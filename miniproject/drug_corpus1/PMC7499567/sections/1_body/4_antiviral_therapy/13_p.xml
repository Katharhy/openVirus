<p>Of the three types of biological aperiodic polymers (nucleic acids, polypeptides and carbohydrates), aperiodic polymers of carbohydrates (glycans and oligosaccharides) have the highest information capacity, due to their structural properties. This ensures high specificity of ligandâ€“receptor interactions of oligosaccharide conjugates. But the structure of glycans in the eukaryotic genome is coded indirectly. Oligosaccharides are synthetized in the cisternae of Golgi apparatus with the support of secondary protein matrices that form functional heterogenic associations (conveyor lines) of glycosyltransferases (Chepur

Obviously, the spatial structure of such matrix protein molecules and thus their affinity to the enzymes of glycan synthesis may quickly and significantly change under the influence of the dynamics in the pH and oxidative-reductive potential in the cisternae of Golgi apparatus.
