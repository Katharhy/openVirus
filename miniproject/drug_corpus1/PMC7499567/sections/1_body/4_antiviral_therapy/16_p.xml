<p>The participation of glycans in viral adhesion and proliferation are extremely important. A wide array of viruses, including coronaviruses (Milewska

Inhibitors of this attachment could therefore prevent and treat infections. The N,N′-bisheteryl derivative of dispyrotripiperasine, pyrimidine dispirotripiperasinium, became the first synthetic small molecule (Schmidtke, Wutzler and Makarov

The inhibition is via mimicking the binding of specific structural parts of heparan sulfate. This investigational class of compounds opens new opportunities for the inhibition of the process of viral transmission, for example, by using them to prevent infection by herpes simplex virus type I.
