<p>Respiratory RNA viruses are anthropozoonotic infectious pathogens that have natural reservoirs and form dynamic genetic pools. Such a genetic pool suggests the interchange or spillover of genetic material between the genomes of familial RNA viruses of humans and animals. This inevitably leads to the appearance of new, highly virulent strains of pathogens and it is impossible to predict the moment of such appearance and antigenic properties of these strains. This means that epidemics of new respiratory RNA viral infections will always begin in the absence of medications for their immune-mediated prevention or treatment. This underlines the necessity of continuing to perform research and development of antivirals and other therapeutic drugs that could be used in the treatment of respiratory RNA viral infections. This review has focused on the past and present efforts at addressing these viruses. Clearly, our future will be very much defined by such viral outbreaks if we are not able to identify broad-spectrum antivirals or vaccines. Looking at the past research may provide some important clues as to how we can identify such therapeutics. The reliance on a single magic bullet for every disease may be unrealistic and we therefore need to consider the combination of diverse antiviral treatments as we currently do for HIV and HBV. Considering molecules that are traditionally not considered ‘antivirals’ may also be critical to open our eyes to accessing additional targets and mechanisms. Host-targeted mechanisms may also be of interest such as those that stimulate the immune system. Clearly, we are seeing many drugs that are lysosomotropic; while long-term use of such molecules may be detrimental, short-term use may prevent viral entry and protect the individual. There is certainly much more research that can be performed to understand how combinations of drugs for these respiratory viruses may work together. While interest in antiviral research and development has apparently languished for decades, the COVID-19 may permanently change that. If we continue to ignore such viruses, the cost will be unimaginable and continue to hold back human progress. We will now see a rebirth in interest and perhaps significant investment in developing antivirals. For years, there have been few major drug companies dominating this field. What we have seen with viruses should also serve to remind us that we also face great pressures such as drug resistance for other classes of drugs like antibiotics. This review should remind us that we need to be ready for the next outbreak and that means having a plentiful supply of drugs that can potentially address any new virus we are faced with. A relatively small investment in this science could pay big dividends for the future in preventing catastrophic pandemics, limiting the global financial depressions that result and providing a degree of security for humanity. We cannot neglect these or other viruses for they provide other insights that could ultimately be useful in healthcare and beyond.</p>
