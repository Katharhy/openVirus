<p>When influenza viruses circulate in their natural reservoirs, they are characterized by high genetic variability that is reflected in the formation of quasi-subtypes (immunologically different antigenic variants) of type A viruses (Barbezange 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). This biological characteristic is called antigenic drift (Taubenberger and Kash 
 <xref rid="bib272" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and it is explained by the fact that RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase of influenza viruses does not have an active corrective site (Steinhauer, de la Torre and Holland 
 <xref rid="bib263" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Cheung 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), which results in a high frequency of point mutations in the process of RNA genome replication (300 times higher than during the replication of bacterial DNA genome) (Drake 
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). Another distinctive characteristic is the high mutational tolerance of glycoproteins of viral envelopes, i.e. the ability of HA and NA to maintain their functional activity in case of significant changes in the primary structure of the polypeptide chain (Thyagarajan and Bloom
