<p>Several genes are usually considered when exploring the phylogenetic relationships among coronaviruses, since trees built from different genomic regions often have inconsistent topologies [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-04546-f004">Figure 4</xref>). One possible cause for these inconsistencies is genetic recombination, which is thought to occur frequently during evolution of coronaviruses (see Molecular epidemiology). Recombination usually involves segments totally or partially spanning the S gene but may be associated with other regions of the genome. For instance, soon after the discovery of human coronavirus HKU1 in 2005, phylogenetic analysis suggested the existence of two putative genotypes, but conflicting results were obtained when using different regions of the genome to infer the phylogenetic relationship between these genotypes [

 <xref rid="B50-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. It was later demonstrated that these discrepancies were due to a recombination between the two genotypes, with recombination breakpoints located within Nsp16 and HE [
