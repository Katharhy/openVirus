<p>Soon after the onset of the 2019â€“2020 COVID-19 pandemic and the availability of the whole genome sequence of the novel coronavirus, phylogenetic analysis revealed that it was closely related to SARS-CoV and it was officially designated as SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B52-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Not surprisingly, it was soon reported that SARS-CoV-2 was phylogenetically related to two bat SARS-like coronaviruses, SL-CoVZC45 and SL-CoVZXC21, previously isolated from 
 <italic>Rhinolophus sinicus</italic> in 2018 [

 <xref rid="B73-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Bat coronavirus RaTG13, isolated from 
 <italic>Rhinolophus affinis</italic> in 2013, was found to be even more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 than the first two [

 <italic>Manis javanica</italic>), a highly smuggled animal illegally sold in China [

 <xref rid="B74-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Although bat coronavirus RaTG13 is phylogenetically closer to SARS-CoV-2 than the pangolin coronaviruses, the RBDs of the latter are more similar to those of SARS-CoV-2, thus suggesting a possible role of pangolins as intermediate hosts in transmission to humans [
