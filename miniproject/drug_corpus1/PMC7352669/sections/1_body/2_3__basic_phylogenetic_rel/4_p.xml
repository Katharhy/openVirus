<p>Several studies addressing the origin of coronavirus species have identified bats as the natural reservoirs of alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses [
 <xref rid="B59-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. This is not surprising, since bat coronaviruses are highly ubiquitous in the most currently accepted taxonomic subgroups [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In fact, five of the seven known human coronaviruses are likely to have originated from bats, namely, NL63, 229E, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The remaining two human coronaviruses, HKU1 and OC43, are thought to have originated from rodents [
 <xref rid="B61-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In the case of SARS-CoV, its possible origin from bats was first suggested in 2005, when two studies independently reported the discovery of SARS-related coronaviruses isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats (
 <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> spp.) [
 <xref rid="B62-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="B63-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], with several more strains discovered in subsequent years (reviewed by Luk et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]). Similar findings have been reported for MERS-CoV, which was found to be closely related to coronaviruses isolated from bamboo bats (
 <italic>Tylonycteris</italic> spp.) and pipistrelle bats (
 <italic>Pipistrellus</italic> spp.), respectively termed 
 <italic>Tylonycteris</italic> bat coronavirus HKU4 (Ty-BatCoV-HKU4) and 
 <italic>Pipistrellus</italic> bat coronavirus HKU5 (Pi-BatCoV-HKU5) [
 <xref rid="B65-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In phylogenetic trees, these two coronaviruses separate well from MERS-related coronaviruses found in other bat species, including those recently isolated from serotine bats (
 <italic>Neoromicia</italic> spp.) in South Africa [
