<p>Another important conclusion drawn from exhaustive phylogenetic analyses is that, although bats appear to act as natural reservoirs of coronaviruses, intermediate animal hosts may also play a critical role in transmission to other susceptible hosts. The presumed intermediate host for SARS-CoV, the masked palm civet from the 
 <italic>Viverridae</italic> family (
 <italic>Paguma larvata</italic>), was identified even before the natural bat carriers, when highly similar SARS-CoV strains were found in the civets from a wet market and in workers supposed to handle them [

 <xref rid="B68-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. A similar scenario has been reported for MERS-CoV and its intermediate host, the dromedary camel (
 <italic>Camelus dromedarius</italic>). After the 2012 MERS outbreak, MERS-CoV strains highly similar in sequence to those from human patients were isolated from camels [

 <xref rid="B70-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In 2013, a novel dromedary camel coronavirus HKU13 was also identified [
 <xref rid="B71-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]; however, phylogenetic analysis positioned it within the 
 <italic>Embecovirus</italic> subgenus, and it is therefore not directly related to MERS-CoV.
