<p>For the taxonomic classification of coronaviruses, the ICTV currently recommends the use of domains 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, NiRAN, RdRp, ZBD and HEL1 of Nsp3, Nsp12 and Nsp13 [
 <xref rid="B52-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. These domains are conserved in all viruses of the order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic> and can therefore be used for deeper phylogenetic analyses [
 <xref rid="B53-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Recent studies exploring the phylogenetic position of SARS-CoV-2 have shown that trees built using some of these conserved domains are consistent with those based on whole genome sequences, at least at the genus and subgenus levels [

 <xref rid="B55-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-04546-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,B). However, in studies exploring shallower phylogenetic relationships, such as those focused on closely related viral strains isolated from different hosts, conserved domains may not have enough variability to ensure robust separation of some taxa. This is evidenced by the relatively low branch support estimates occasionally obtained for some subclades from the same subgenus in trees based on conserved domains, when compared to whole genome trees [
 <xref rid="B4-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-04546-f004">Figure 4</xref>B,D). More variable segments or complete genome sequences may be a better choice in these scenarios, to build more robust phylogenetic trees.
