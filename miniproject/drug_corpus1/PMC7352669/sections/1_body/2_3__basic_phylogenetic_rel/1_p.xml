<p>Phylogenetic analyses help us understand the evolutionary history of viruses and provide a solid basis for their classification. A paramount application of these analyses is to make inferences about the origin of novel viral strains or species. This is particularly relevant in the context of outbreaks, to identify possible animal reservoirs involved in transmission to other susceptible hosts, including humans. To perform these analyses, researchers usually focus on genes or genomic segments conserved through all the species of interest, but with enough sequence divergence to allow their unambiguous separation in a phylogenetic tree. In the case of the coronaviruses, phylogenetic analyses are usually based on whole or partial sequences of the ORF1ab, S and N genes, whereas genes E and M are generally deemed as too short for these analyses [
