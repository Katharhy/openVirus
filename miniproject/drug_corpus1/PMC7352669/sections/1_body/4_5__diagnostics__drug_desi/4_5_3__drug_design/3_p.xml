<p>A high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome has been recently elucidated [
 <xref rid="B178-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. Data from this study revealed an overly complex transcriptome, characterized by a large number of transcripts encoding unknown ORFs produced by fusion, deletion and/or frameshift events. Furthermore, direct RNA sequencing suggested 41 potential RNA modification sites on the viral transcripts, the majority of them containing the AAGAA motif. Functional characterization of these newly discovered ORFs and RNA modification sites may unveil key roles in viral pathogenesis, defining new potential targets for antiviral therapy. In a collaborative effort, several research groups were able to clone, tag and express 26 of the 29 viral proteins found in human cells [

More than 300 high-confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions were further identified using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS). Applying a combination of systematic chemoinformatic drug search and pathway centric analysis to the whole set of interactions, 66 druggable human proteins were identified that are targeted by 69 existing approved drugs and compounds in clinical and/or pre-clinical trials.
