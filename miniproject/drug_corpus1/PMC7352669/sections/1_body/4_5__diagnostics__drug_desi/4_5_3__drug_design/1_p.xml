<p>When SARS-CoV suddenly emerged in late 2002, the initial approach to drug discovery was to test existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs as potential anti-betacoronavirus candidates [

 <xref rid="B173-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]). Not surprisingly, similar strategies have also been explored since the beginning of the 2019â€“2020 COVID-19 pandemic [
 <xref rid="B174-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. Accelerated discovery of new SARS-related betacoronaviruses and characterization of their genomes have allowed the incorporation of genomic information into drug discovery pipelines. Reverse genetic systems have made possible biological assays for characterizing the function of viral proteins, the first important step for identification of potential virus-specific drug targets [

 <xref rid="B133-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. Both genomic and functional knowledge have allowed the development of small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules targeting specific viral proteins. This strategy has been used to design siRNA inhibitors targeting the ORF1b and S genes of SARS-CoV [
