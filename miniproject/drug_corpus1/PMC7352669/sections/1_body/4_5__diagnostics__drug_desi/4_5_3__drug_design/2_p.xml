<p>Genomic knowledge also serves as the basis for other ‘Omics’ such as transcriptomics, proteomics and interactomics, which have also been crucial for accelerating drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2. Based on the high sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and other human betacoronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV, network proximity analysis of drug targets and virus-host interactions in the human interactome has been already used as a tool for accelerating drug repurposing [

In this type of analysis, proteins functionally associated with viral infection are localized in the corresponding subnetwork within the human protein-protein interaction network, and those proteins that serve as drug targets for specific diseases are selected as potential targets for antiviral drugs. These analyses are followed by bioinformatic validation of drug-induced gene signatures and human betacoronavirus-induced transcriptomics in human cell lines to inspect the postulated mechanisms of action in a specific human betacoronavirus.
