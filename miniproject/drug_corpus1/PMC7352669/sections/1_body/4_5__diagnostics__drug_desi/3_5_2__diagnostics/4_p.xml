<p>Prototypes of direct antigen tests have been developed previously for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but have not received regulatory approval, whereas SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests are currently under development [

 <xref rid="B166-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. Most of these antigen-based assays have targeted the N protein, since it is probably the most convenient target for virus detection in patients due to its high abundance. Serological assays that rely on recombinant proteins as antigens have been developed for detection of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, mainly using the N and S proteins as the two major immunogenic proteins of these viruses [

Although serological assays have limited utility for diagnostic purposes due to the variable time span for antibodies to be detectable after initial infection, these assays may be especially useful for unveiling the real epidemiological impact of pandemics such as the 2019â€“2020 COVID-19 pandemic, given the increasing evidence of highly abundant asymptomatic carriers [
