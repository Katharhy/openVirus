<p>Regardless of their efficiency, PCR-based assays have several drawbacks for their massive use during outbreaks and epidemics, including requiring specialized and costly equipment and reagents, as well as having turnaround times ranging from 2 to 4 days due to the time required for sample transportation to centralized testing facilities, preparation and performance of the actual PCR test. In recent years, a rapid molecular test has been developed to detect the N gene of MERS-CoV based on a combination of reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification and a vertical flow visualization strip (RT-LAMP-VF) [

A new assay called DNA Endonuclease-Targeted CRISPR Trans Reporter (DETECTR) has been developed for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which can be performed in less than 40 minutes [
