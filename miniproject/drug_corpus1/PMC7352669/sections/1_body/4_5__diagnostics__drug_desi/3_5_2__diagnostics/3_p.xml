<p>Immunoassays based on antigen-antibody recognition are an alternative for the establishment of point-of-care tests that deliver fast results at a low-cost, and are fundamental for providing diagnostic evidence and for better understanding of the epidemiology of emerging betacoronaviruses, including the burden of asymptomatic infections and exposure. Knowledge of the genomic sequences of infecting coronaviruses has been critical for the development and validation of immunoassays that either use monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to detect viral antigens in clinical samples or cloned viral antigens to detect patient antibodies directed against the virus [
