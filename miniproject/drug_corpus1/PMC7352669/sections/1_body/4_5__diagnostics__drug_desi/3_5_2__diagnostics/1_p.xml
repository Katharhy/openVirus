<p>Methods based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are the most frequently used for detecting highly pathogenic human betacoronaviruses. These methods have several advantages including their high sensitivity and specificity, their feasibility in settings where virus isolation is not possible due to safety concerns and their ability to detect virus presence early after infection, even before the onset of symptoms [

After the 2002–2003 SARS-CoV outbreak, random-amplification deep-sequencing approaches have played a crucial role in discovery and characterization of genomic differences among SARS-related coronaviruses and identification of the emerging MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [

 <xref rid="B150-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. These studies allowed the rapid development of genus- and species-specific real-time PCR assays based on the genomes of these viruses. Available PCR tests for human pathogenic betacoronaviruses employ either a single or multiple primer sets targeting specific regions of the ORF1ab, E and N genes [

 <xref rid="B155-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. Although most of the assays developed using the aforementioned genes show no cross-reactivity with related species, and hence high specificity, assays targeting the N gene displayed higher sensitivity, probably because this transcript is very abundant during replication of betacoronaviruses [

In fact, even if relative abundance of subgenomic mRNAs is believed to be kept well controlled during the replicative cycle, an increasing gradient of expression has been reported from 5′ to 3′, with the N gene exhibiting the highest expression levels in cells infected with MHV [
