<p>Genomic information has been widely used in the development of reverse genetic systems, allowing the construction of synthetic viral infectious particles and the manipulation of the genetic composition of viruses for research purposes [
 <xref rid="B127-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. These systems have proven indispensable for the characterization of human and animal betacoronaviruses, especially when there is limited access to clinical isolates or for research institutions that do not have the appropriate containment facilities [
 <xref rid="B128-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. Reverse genetics was initially difficult to implement for betacoronaviruses due to the relatively large size of their viral RNA genome, which affects transfection efficiency and stability in standard bacterial vectors [
 <xref rid="B127-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. Although several systems can be used to construct synthetic coronavirus genomes (reviewed by Almaz√°n et al. [
 <xref rid="B129-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]), most studies focusing on betacoronaviruses have used a sub-cloning strategy based on in vitro ligation, originally developed for the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [
 <xref rid="B130-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. This system is based on the systematic and precise assembly of complete cDNA genomes from a panel of cDNA cassettes that span the entire viral genome and that are flanked by native or engineered specific restrictions sites, allowing the construction of full-length infectious clones. This assembly strategy was rapidly deployed for the study of human pathogenic betacoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [
