<p>Reverse genetic systems are also useful to understand how the viruses evolve during outbreaks and epidemics. For instance, S protein mutations from zoonotic, early, middle and late epidemic strains of the SARS-CoV outbreak have been introduced into the S protein of the epidemic strain of SARS-CoV (Urbani) to evaluate the effect of those mutations on viral entry into human cells and viral pathogenesis in rodent and primate models [

 <xref rid="B142-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. In addition, reverse genetic systems have proven useful in analyzing the emergence and pathogenic potential of bat SARS-related and MERS-related coronaviruses [

 <xref rid="B146-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Recombinant versions of bat betacoronaviruses can be used to evaluate the efficiency of the S protein-mediated viral entry and replication and to characterize genetic changes required for efficient infection of human cells.
