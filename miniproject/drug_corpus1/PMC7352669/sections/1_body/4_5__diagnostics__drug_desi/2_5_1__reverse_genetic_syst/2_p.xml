<p>The use of reverse genetic systems has allowed targeted genetic manipulation of viral genes and creation of homogeneous viral stocks for running in vitro and in vivo assays. Based on their genomic organization, reporter strains of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been created by replacing the ORFs of accessory proteins with luciferase and fluorescent proteins as reporter genes [
