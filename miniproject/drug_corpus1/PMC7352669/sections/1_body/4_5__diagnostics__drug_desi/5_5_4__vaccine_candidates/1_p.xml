<p>In the aftermath of previous SARS and MERS outbreaks, several laboratories around the globe pursued the development of vaccines using the traditional strategy of inactivating whole viral particles (reviewed by Roper and Rehm [

 <xref rid="B172-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]). Increasing availability of genomic information regarding SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and other related betacoronavirus have allowed the development of other types of vaccine formulations such as live-attenuated vaccines, recombinant vector vaccines and DNA vaccines. Reverse genetic systems have been used to develop and characterize live-attenuated vaccine platforms in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, based on substitutions of key residues of the Nsp16 active site [
