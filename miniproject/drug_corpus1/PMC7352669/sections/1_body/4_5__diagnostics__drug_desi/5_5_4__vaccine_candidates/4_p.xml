<p>Thanks to the availability of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and the previous experience with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, numerous vaccine projects using diverse technologies are currently in progress, with some already entering into clinical trials (reviewed by Amanat and Krammer [
 <xref rid="B215-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>]). Evidence that neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 suggests that SARS-CoV vaccines might cross-protect against SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, the few SARS-CoV vaccines that made it to phase I clinical trials were not further funded due to the control of the disease [
 <xref rid="B215-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>]. Noteworthy is that several of these abandoned projects for SARS-CoV vaccines have been reactivated and rapidly adapted to SARS-CoV-2. The relatively high sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV makes it unlikely that vaccines targeting MERS-CoV can induce strong cross-neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. However, existing platforms for the development of MERS-CoV vaccines were also rapidly adapted for the production of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, as is the case of the RNA-based vaccine developed by Moderna Therapeutics and the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which encodes a segment of the S gene encapsulated in lipid-based nanoparticles (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04283461). The high genomic diversity observed in bat betacoronaviruses suggests that development of a pan-betacoronavirus vaccine will be unlikely; however, available technologies for vaccine production and rapid acquisition of genomic information can pave the way for the development of modular vaccine platforms that are rapidly adjustable to new antigens in potentially emerging epidemics [
