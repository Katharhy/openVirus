<p>Many SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccine formulations evaluated in animal models protected animals from challenge with the virus, but failed to induce protective immunity in aged groups and exacerbated SARS symptoms in younger groups subsequently challenged with the virus [

 <xref rid="B213-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">213</xref>]. These findings stress the importance of developing subunit vaccines, as these will offer targeted immunogenicity with improved safety. For this purpose, bioinformatic tools can be used to predict potential epitopes in proteins encoded in the genomes, based on their sequence similarity to previously described immunogenic motifs or through structural methods such as molecular docking simulations. A recent study used predictive bioinformatic tools to identify potential B- and T-cell epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 in regions of its genome with high sequence similarity to SARS-CoV [
