<p>Early diagnosis and rapid development of drugs and vaccines targeting emerging viruses are essential to limit their spread, but traditional development approaches are time-consuming and often inefficient. Conversely, sequence-based approaches allow rapid understanding of viral protein function and pathogenesis, as well as the identification of virus-specific factors and targets suitable for drug and vaccine design. Here, we briefly review how genomic information has fueled the development of diagnostic systems and the design of new drug and vaccine candidates. We begin with a brief introduction to the application of genomics in the development of reverse genetic systems, which are key to the previously mentioned fields.</p>
