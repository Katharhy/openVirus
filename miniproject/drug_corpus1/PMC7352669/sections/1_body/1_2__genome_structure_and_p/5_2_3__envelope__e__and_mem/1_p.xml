<p>Envelope (E) and membrane (M) are conserved, envelope-associated, integral membrane proteins. Proteins S, E and M are translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the host cell during translation. Unlike the S protein, however, E and M do not appear to have a recognizable N-terminal signal peptide [
 <xref rid="B9-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Upon entry into the ER, the three proteins are integrated into the ER membrane and follow the secretory pathway towards the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). There, E and M engage in several molecular interactions to facilitate assembly and release of new viral particles [
