<p>The E protein has a single TM domain and a relatively short N-terminal CP endodomain, whereas M has three TM domains and a much larger C-terminal CP endodomain. It has been suggested that both CP endodomains play a significant role in the critical functions of these proteins in assembly and release of new viral particles [
