<p>Certain coronaviruses have one or two ORFs overlapping the N protein gene, although these are not always annotated in the corresponding genomes. Betacoronaviruses from the 
 <italic>Embecovirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Merbecovirus</italic> subgenera typically have a single overlapping ORF that has been found to encode a 23-kDa protein in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and bovine coronavirus [
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Experiments performed in MHV-infected cells have demonstrated that this protein is a structural component of the MHV virion and may be involved in the processing or transport of the S protein [
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In the 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> subgenus, there are usually one or two shorter ORFs overlapping the N gene, often termed ORF9b and ORF9c. ORF9b has been shown to encode an accessory protein that is also a virion component [
 <xref rid="B43-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and seems to participate in the suppression of host innate immunity [
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].
