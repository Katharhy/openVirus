<p>Accessory proteins are genus- or species-specific and are usually dispensable for viral replication in vitro but required in vivo [
 <xref rid="B37-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The functions of accessory proteins and their pathophysiological roles are not completely understood. SARS-CoV contains at least eight ORFs encoding accessory proteins, namely, ORFs 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 8a, 8b and 9b. Some of these proteins, particularly 6 and 7b, appear to contribute to virulence [

 <xref rid="B39-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Most of these proteins are involved in cellular processes such as interfering with DNA synthesis, induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis, induction of proinflammatory cytokines and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway [
 <xref rid="B37-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Many of these accessory proteins are also incorporated into mature SARS-CoV virions, filling the role of minor structural proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 genome seems to encode a set of accessory proteins similar to that of SARS-CoV, with noticeable differences in ORFs 3a, 3b and 8b, which have been associated with interferon modulation and activation of the inflammasome [
