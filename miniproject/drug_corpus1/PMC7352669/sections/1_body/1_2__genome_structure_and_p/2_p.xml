<p>As with most viruses, coronavirus genomes are compact and only encode the proteins required for the viral replication cycle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-04546-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Transcription of the protein-coding genes involves the production of subgenomic mRNAs containing a common leader sequence in their 5′ end. This common leader is in turn encoded near the 5′ end of the genome and its fusion to subgenomic mRNAs is mediated by a conserved transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) preceding most genes [
