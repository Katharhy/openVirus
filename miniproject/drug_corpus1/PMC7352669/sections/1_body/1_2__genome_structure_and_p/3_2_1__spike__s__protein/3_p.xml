<p>The S2 subunit is considered to act as a class I viral fusion protein, promoting virus entry to the host cell through membrane fusion [
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This subunit contains a fusion peptide (FP) that is believed to penetrate the host cell membrane, initiating the membrane fusion process [
 <xref rid="B17-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. S2 contains two additional Î±-helical heptad repeat domains, called HR1 and HR2 (IPR027400), which interact with each other to form a coiled coil conformation, facilitating membrane fusion by bringing together the viral envelope and the host cell membrane [
 <xref rid="B18-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The S2 subunit also contains a transmembrane (TM) domain that anchors the S protein to the viral envelope, as well as a short cysteine-rich endodomain, also known as CP (cytoplasmic) domain, oriented towards the interior of the viral particle.
