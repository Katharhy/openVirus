<p>Spike (S) is a glycoprotein that recognizes the host cell receptor and allows the virus to attach to the surface of host cells. Its name refers to the spike-like structures located in the outer surface of the viral envelope, which are trimers of the S protein. After receptor recognition and attachment, the virus enters the host cell through endocytosis or by direct fusion of its envelope with the host cell plasma membrane. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their receptor [
