<p>Due to its binding specificity, the S protein determines tissue tropism and host species range of different coronaviruses. Binding specificity of the S protein is determined by its receptor-binding domain (RBD) (IPR018548), sometimes called C-domain, responsible for recognizing and binding to the host cell receptor. The S protein sequence is commonly divided into two sections, termed S1 and S2, corresponding to the two subunits in which the protein is cleaved by host proteases after receptor recognition, although this cleavage does not occur in all coronaviruses [
 <xref rid="B9-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The RBD is located in the S1 subunit and contains a shorter receptor-binding motif (RBM) that directly interacts with the receptor. Consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have different host cell receptors, their RBDs are structurally similar, but the RBMs differ in sequence [

 <xref rid="B12-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], whereas the MERS-CoV RBM is composed of ~83 amino acids [

 <xref rid="B14-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The S1 subunit also contains an additional N-terminal domain (NTD) (IPR032500) that has been shown to mediate binding to mCEACAM1a in murine coronaviruses [
