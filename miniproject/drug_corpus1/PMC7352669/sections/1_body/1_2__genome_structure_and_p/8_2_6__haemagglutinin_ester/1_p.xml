<p>All known betacoronaviruses from the 
 <italic>Embecovirus</italic> subgenus have an additional haemagglutinin esterase (HE) gene located upstream of that encoding the S protein [
 <xref rid="B45-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This gene encodes a glycoprotein with neuraminate O-acetylesterase activity that mediates reversible attachment to O-acetylated sialic acids by acting as a receptor-binding molecule and a receptor-destroying enzyme [
 <xref rid="B46-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. HE is an integral membrane protein with a single TM domain and a relatively large ectodomain, which contains the esterase core domain (IPR003860) and a lectin subdomain acting as the RBD [
 <xref rid="B47-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This gene is suspected to be acquired from the influenza C virus through heterologous recombination [
 <xref rid="B48-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Due to the absence of this gene in all other betacoronaviruses, this event is likely to have occurred after major subgenera diverged from common ancestors.
