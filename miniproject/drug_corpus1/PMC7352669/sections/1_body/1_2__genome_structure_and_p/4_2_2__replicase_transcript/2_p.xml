<p>At least two Nsps are responsible for the proteolytic activity, namely, Nsp3 (papain-like protease or PL
 <sup>pro</sup>) and Nsp5 (3C-like protease or 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>). The Nsp3 proteins from genus 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> and subgenus 
 <italic>Embecovirus</italic> have two PL
 <sup>pro</sup> functional domains (IPR022733), respectively termed PL1
 <sup>pro</sup> and PL2
 <sup>pro</sup>. All other coronaviruses have only one domain, collinear with PL2
 <sup>pro</sup>. Nsp3 from SARS-related coronaviruses has several functional domains in addition to PL2
 <sup>pro</sup>, including an acidic (Ac) C-terminal domain, an ADP-ribose-1’’-phosphatase (ADRP) domain, a SARS-specific unique domain (SUD) (IPR024375), a nucleic acid-binding (NAB) domain (IPR032592) and a TM segment [
