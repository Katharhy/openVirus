<p>The other Nsps forming the RTC assist RdRp during replication and transcription [
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Nsp7 and Nsp8 are thought to help with the processivity of RdRp and together form the main polymerase holoenzyme [

 <xref rid="B19-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition to the HEL1 helicase core domain (IPR027351), Nsp13 also has an N-terminal cysteine-rich zinc-binding domain (ZBD) (IPR027352) that appears to modulate the helicase activity [
 <xref rid="B26-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Three additional nonstructural proteins, Nsp14, Nsp15 and Nsp16, have functional domains likely to be involved in RNA processing pathways. Nsp14 is a bifunctional protein that has a N7-methyltransferase domain and an ExoN domain with 3′-5′ exonuclease activity. This exonuclease activity provides a proofreading function that is lacking in RdRp and enhances the fidelity of replication [
