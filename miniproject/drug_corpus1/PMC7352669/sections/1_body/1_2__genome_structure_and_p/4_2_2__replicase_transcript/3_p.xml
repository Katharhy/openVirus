<p>Several Nsps (Nsp7 to Nsp16) form the active multimeric replicase/transcriptase complex (RTC). The main component of this complex is Nsp12, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that directly mediates the de novo primer-independent RNA synthesis during replication of the virus, as well as transcription of ORFs to produce the mRNAs for structural and accessory proteins. During replication, RdRp synthesizes a negative-sense genomic RNA by using the positive-sense genome as a template. During transcription, RdRp synthesizes negative-sense subgenomic RNAs that are subsequently transcribed into the corresponding positive-sense mRNAs. These mRNAs are then translated by the host ribosome into the structural and accessory proteins. To accomplish these functions in transcription and replication, Nsp12 has at least two well-conserved functional domains, namely, the RdRp catalytic domain (IPR007094) and a relatively large N-terminal domain (NTD) (IPR009469). This NTD is unique to the 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic> order and contains a nucleotidyltransferase subdomain called NiRAN (nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase) [
