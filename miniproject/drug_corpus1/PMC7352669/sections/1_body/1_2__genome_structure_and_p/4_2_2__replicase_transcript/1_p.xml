<p>Upon host cell entry, the virus is uncoated and the host ribosome then translates the first two overlapping ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, to generate the replicase/transcriptase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. The pp1a polyprotein is synthesized by translation of ORF1a, whereas the longer pp1ab polyprotein is synthesized from both ORFs, due to a ribosomal frameshifting event allowing their continuous translation [

 <xref rid="B19-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] for a comprehensive review). Nsp1 to Nsp11 are encoded by ORF1a and are therefore present in both pp1a and pp1ab, whereas Nsp12 to Nsp16 are encoded by ORF1b and are only present in pp1ab.
