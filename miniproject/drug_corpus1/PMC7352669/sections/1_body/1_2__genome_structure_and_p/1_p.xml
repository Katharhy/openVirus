<p>Betacoronaviruses, like all other members of the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family, have relatively large RNA genomes of around 30 kb in size (
 <xref rid="ijms-21-04546-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The genomes have short untranslated regions (UTR) at both ends, with a 5′ methylated cap and a 3′ polyadenylated tail. Typically, genomes contain 9–12 open reading frames (ORF) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-04546-f001">Figure 1</xref>), six of which are conserved and follow the same order. These conserved ORFs encode the replicase/transcriptase polyproteins and the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) structural proteins. Replicase/transcriptase is organized in two overlapping ORFs, called ORF1a (11–13 kb) and ORF1b (7–8 kb), that occupy nearly two thirds of the genome. These ORFs are translated into two polyproteins that later cleave themselves to form several nonstructural proteins (Nsps), most of them involved in genome replication and transcription [
 <xref rid="B2-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The remaining 3′ portion of the genome encodes the structural proteins and the so-called accessory proteins, whose number and functions vary among different coronaviruses.
