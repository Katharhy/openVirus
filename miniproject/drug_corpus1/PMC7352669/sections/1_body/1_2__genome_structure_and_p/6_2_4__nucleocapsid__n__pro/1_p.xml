<p>The nucleocapsid (N) protein binds to genomic RNAs in a beads-on-a-string conformation. Unlike S, E and M, the N protein stays in the cytosol of the host cell after translation, where it binds genomic RNAs to form new nucleocapsids. These nucleocapsids travel to the ERGIC and are used for the assembly of new viral core particles. The N protein also appears to bind to Nsp3 and M, thus suggesting an important role in guiding viral RNA through replication, transcription and assembly [
