<p>Since the 2002–2003 SARS outbreak, genomic information has become ever-increasingly significant to address outbreaks caused by pathogenic coronaviruses. Before the 2019–2020 COVID-19 pandemic, there were ~1200 complete genomes of betacoronaviruses deposited in the GenBank database. The number of available genomes has increased dramatically during the pandemic, with more than 6000 complete genomes available in Genbank as of June 2019, and almost 50,000 genomic sequences in other public repositories. A variety of information including phylogenetic relationships, mode of transmission, evolutionary rates and the role of mutations in infection and disease severity can be deduced from comparing multiple genomes. In this review, we focus on the genomic features of family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> with special emphasis on the 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genus. We also review how genomic information can be useful to tackle epidemics caused by these viruses, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future ones, potentially caused by emerging strains.
