<p>Coronaviruses (CoV) are important pathogens of vertebrates with the ability to cause respiratory, enteric and systemic diseases in humans and animals. They are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses belonging to subfamily 
 <italic>Orthocoronavirinae</italic> of family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>, order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic>. The subfamily is further divided into four genera, namely, 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Gammacoronavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic>. The majority of clinically relevant coronaviruses belong to the 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genera [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Genus 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> comprises species infecting a diverse group of mammals, including two (229E and NL63) of the seven known species of human coronaviruses. In the case of genus 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) currently divides it into five subgenera, 
 <italic>Embecovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Merbecovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Nobecovirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Hibecovirus</italic>, established based on phylogenetic analysis of conserved protein domains (see Basic phylogenetic relationships). The first four of these subgenera were formerly known as lineages or subgroups A, B, C and D, respectively.
