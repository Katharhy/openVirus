<p>The first reported example of natural recombination in human coronaviruses was that occurring between two different HKU1 genotypes [

 <xref rid="B97-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] and OC43 [
 <xref rid="B98-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. In the case of SARS-related and MERS-related coronaviruses, recombination appears to occur among strains infecting several animal hosts, including bats, intermediary hosts and humans (reviewed by Hu et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] and Su et al. [
 <xref rid="B96-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]). Studies considering several bat SARS-related coronaviruses have suggested the occurrence of recombination in lineages leading to human and/or civet strains of SARS-CoV, with breakpoints often located close or within the S and ORF8 genes [
 <xref rid="B87-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,
 <xref rid="B99-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>,
 <xref rid="B100-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. These findings suggest that recombination between existing strains can result in new strains or species, with possible differences in host and tissue tropism. For instance, bat coronavirus strains Rs3367 (WIV1) and WIV16 have been reported to have high sequence similarity to human/civet SARS-CoV at the S gene, allowing them to use ACE2 as a receptor for cell entry [

 <xref rid="B102-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Recombination analysis suggested that at least one civet SARS-CoV strain (SZ3) may have originated by recombination between WIV16 and another bat SARS-CoV strain (Rf4092) [
