<p>The substitution rate is often expressed in substitutions per nucleotide site per year (s/n/y) and can be estimated from phylogenetic reconstructions when divergence time is known for particular lineages. Although several methods have been traditionally used to estimate substitution rates, including linear regression and maximum likelihood (ML), the most popular method nowadays is the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, such as that implemented in the BEAST package [

 <sup>−3</sup>–10
 <sup>−4</sup> s/n/y [

 <xref rid="B81-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Studies conducted in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have estimated whole genome substitution rates to be between 0.80–2.38 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> and 0.88–1.37 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> s/n/y, respectively [

 <xref rid="B88-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] and SARS-CoV-2 [

 <xref rid="B90-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], suggesting that the S gene and the region between ORF7b and ORF8 may be subjected to positive selective pressure in some lineages. In contrast, more conserved regions of the genome such as ORF1a and ORF1b appear to be under strong negative or purifying selection.
