  <p>Phylogenetic analysis of representative betacoronaviruses. Figure shows four alternative phylogenies for coronaviruses in 
   <xref rid="ijms-21-04546-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, inferred from complete genome sequences (
   <bold>A</bold>), concatenated sequences of ORF1ab domains (
   <bold>B</bold>), whole S protein (
   <bold>C</bold>) and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (
   <bold>D</bold>). Phylogenetic analysis was performed as previously described [
   <xref rid="B4-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
   <xref rid="B52-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], briefly, sequences were aligned with MAFFT [
   <xref rid="B56-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and trees were built with IQ-TREE [
   <xref rid="B57-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], with the maximum likelihood (ML) method and the GTR+G+I model. For protein sequences, amino acid alignments were converted to nucleotides with PAL2NAL [
   <xref rid="B58-ijms-21-04546" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Numbers above or below branches indicate branch support measures expressed as percentage and estimated using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH)-like approximate likelihood ratio test (aLRT) with 1000 replicates. Trees were rooted with human alphacoronaviruses 229E and NL63 (GenBank accession numbers NC_002645 and NC_005831, respectively).
