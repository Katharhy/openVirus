  <p>Replication cycle of a typical coronavirus. Upon recognition of the host cell receptor, the viral particle enters the host cell and is uncoated, releasing its positive-sense genomic RNA. Host ribosomes translate polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which self-cleave to produce the nonstructural proteins (Nsps). Several Nsps assemble into the replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC) that generates the mRNAs for structural and accessory proteins through transcription, as well as positive-sense genomic RNAs through replication. Viral core particles are assembled within smooth vesicles derived from the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). The viral progeny is ultimately released via exocytosis.</p>
