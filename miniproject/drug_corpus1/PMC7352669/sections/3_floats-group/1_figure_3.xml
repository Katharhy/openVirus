 <caption>
  <p>Main functional domains in protein-coding genes. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Location of Nsps along the sequence of ORF1a and ORF1b. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Functional domains of Nsp3, Nsp5, Nsp12, Nsp13, Nsp14, Nsp15 and Nsp16. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Functional domains of structural proteins. All proteins are from SARS-CoV, except for the Nsp3 and HE proteins of murine hepatitis virus (MHV), which are included for comparative purposes. Proteins are drawn to scale, except for E and M, which are drawn three (3×) and two (2×) times larger, respectively. Specific domain name abbreviations are explained in the main text. TM: transmembrane domain, SP: signal peptide, FP: fusion peptide, RBD: receptor-binding domain, CP: cytoplasmic domain, NTD: N-terminal domain, CTD: C-terminal domain.
