<p>Climate change and globalization are driving the destruction of natural habitats which brings humans into much closer contact with wildlife. Another example is the Nipah and Hendra virus, a virus in bats that is also transmitted the humans via intermediate hosts (

The previous findings that horseshoe bats are the natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-like virus and that civets are the amplification host highlight the importance of wildlife and biosecurity in farms and wild animal markets. Wild animals can serve as the reservoirs and for emerging infectious diseases. There is much that we do not know about COVID-19 and the causative agent SARS-CoV-2. However, we are unlikely to progress fast unless we enhance interdisciplinary collaboration and communication (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) and take a genuine One Health approach to this and related viral pathogens. In conclusion, we will make much greater progress if we enhance collaboration and communication between human and animal health researchers, viral disease experts, wildlife ecologists, and even geographers to take a “One Health” approach to this and other emerging viral pathogens. This is not merely a battle, we are entrenched in a long-term conflict that is largely the result of human industrialization and globalization. This is a long-term conflict that cannot be won by human and animal medicine alone.
