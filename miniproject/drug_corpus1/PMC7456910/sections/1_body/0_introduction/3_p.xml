<p>The virus is highly contagious and airborne. It is spread by human-to-human transmission

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Person-to-person transmission is presumed and it is suspected to be carried by asymptomatic carriers (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). It is suspected to cause long-lasting lung damage, characterized by fibrosis. Core biopsies from post-mortem samples have revealed fibroblastic proliferation with extracellular matrix degradation and fibrin forming clusters in airspaces has been reported in (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) there are currently no biomarkers that can accurately predict clinical outcomes but some patients exhibit “dramatically” high levels of D-dimer, a by-product of blood coagulation (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Significantly higher levels of D-dimer and CRP indicate that these two proteins may be measured in combination as biomarkers of disease severity (
