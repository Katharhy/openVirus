<p>FIP is quite a rare and unusual disease in the cat caused by certain strains of the feline coronavirus. Most strains of feline coronavirus are enteric and found in the gastrointestinal tract. These enteric strains do not cause significant disease. However, in ~10% of cats infected with enteric strains of feline coronavirus, one or more mutations in the virus alter its biological behavior, resulting in leucocytes becoming infected and when this occurs, the disease is referred to as the FIP. An intense inflammatory reaction to FIP occurs around vessels in the tissues where these infected cells locate, often in the abdomen. Similar to the severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans resulting in ARDS and over-activation of the immune system, the immune system of the cat can become over-stimulated, resulting in the development of FIP, and once a cat develops clinical FIP, the disease is usually progressive and almost always fatal without treatment, in this case Remdesivir. This is precisely why there is so much interest in the repositioning of this drug for treating SARS-CoV-2. However, Gilead Sciences is now repositioning RDV for the treatment of COVID-19 but without mentioning the significant feline coronavirus research that led to its development. The available data on the breadth and potent antiviral activity of RDV (including both contemporary human and highly divergent zoonotic coronaviruses) can significantly enhance our ability to fight current and future emerging coronaviruses (

EMA's human medicines committee (CHMP) has recommended granting a conditional marketing authorization to Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen
