<p id="p0025">As we all know, viral infections are the main reasons for human death worldwide [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Several infectious viral diseases occurred so far have been reported, which involve viruses such as influenza [
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], Enterovirus 71 (EV71) [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], Dengue Virus (DENV) [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], Ebola Virus [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], as well as the recently emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The main characteristic of viruses is that their genomes are easily mutated, making it difficult to control viral infections and causing pandemics worldwide. Meanwhile, in the absence of vaccines and antiviral therapies, the rapid spread of the virus has been accelerated by increased migration, global travel and urbanization [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, most antiviral drugs today have adverse drug reactions and develop viral resistance to treatments. The threat of drug resistance not only results in huge challenges to the clinical management of viral infections, but also places a heavy burden on the global economy [
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although considerable progress has been made in the development of antiviral drugs since acyclovir, a nucleoside analogue, was invented in 1960, novel drugs that can work through different mechanisms to combat resistance are still desperately in need [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In recent years, with the development of virology, many virus-specific processes or proteins have been identified as targets for chemotherapy [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Viral replication cycle includes viral adsorption, viral cell fusion, reverse transcription, integration, translation and other steps, which can be used as targets for antiviral drugs [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition, specific viral enzymes which involve the synthesis of viral DNA, RNA and glycoproteins are also potential targets [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For example, acyclovir disturbs some key herpes virus enzymes that have an affinity for nucleotide analogues [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Despite the successful understanding of viral proliferation cycle and comprehensive studies for suitable vaccines and treatments against viral infections over the past half of century, still several infections such as HIV afflict a substantial proportion of the world populations in all generations [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. There is no definite vaccine against numerous prevalent viral infections, including most respiratory-tract viruses, HSV-1 and HSV-2 or DEVN [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Moreover, drug resistance to available antiviral agents by different viruses such as the HIV type 1 or HSV-1 has always been a serious impediment to treatment of viral infections, stimulating the search for new efficient molecules [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
