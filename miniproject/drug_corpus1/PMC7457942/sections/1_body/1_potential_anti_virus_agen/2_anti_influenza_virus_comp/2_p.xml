<p id="p0040">Among human influenza viruses, influenza A virus is the most susceptible to mutations causing worldwide pandemics many times, such as 1918 Spanish flu pandemic [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Influenza viruses contain two functional surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. NA has become a major target for drug design against influenza virus as it acts as a significant role in influenza virus replication and has highly protected active site [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Rubrolide S (
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> ), a new rubrolide, was first discovered in the fermentation broth of the marine-derived fungus 
 <italic>Aspergillus terreus</italic> OUCMDZ-1925 that was isolated in viscera of the barracuda (
 <italic>Chelon haematocheilus</italic>) grown in the Yellow River [
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This compound displayed significant inhibitory activity toward H
 <sub>1</sub>N
 <sub>1</sub> virus with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 87.1 μM (ribavirin as positive control, IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 118.8 μM) [
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Chemical study of marine-derived 
 <italic>Streptomyces youssoufiensis</italic> OUC6819 discovered that heterologous expression of the type III polyketide synthase (PKS) gene vioA resulted in production of four novel violapyrones (VLPs), VLPs Q–T (

 <bold>5</bold>, 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) [
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Using ribavirin as a positive control, anti-influenza A [H
 <sub>1</sub>N
 <sub>1</sub> (A/Virginia/ATCC1/2009) and H
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>2</sub> (A/Aichi/2/1968)] virus activity of VLPs were evaluated [
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The results showed that these VLPs exhibited considerable anti-H
 <sub>1</sub>N
 <sub>1</sub> and anti-H
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>2</sub> activities with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 30.6–68.4 μM and 45.3–95.0 μM, respectively (ribavirin as positive control, IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 66.7 and 99.6 μM, respectively) [
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The strain 
 <italic>Cladosporium sphaerospermum</italic> 2005-01-E3, isolated from sediments collected in the Pacific Ocean, resulted in the isolation of a new hybrid polyketide, cladosin C (

 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) [
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Compound

 <sub>1</sub> virus activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 276 μM (ribavirin as positive control, IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 131 μM) [
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Another marine fungus 
 <italic>Penicillium chrysogenum</italic> PJX-17 was derived from a soft coral collected at Terra Nova bay, Antarctica. Chemical investigation of the fungus 
 <italic>P. chrysogenum</italic> PJX-17 afforded two novel sorbicillinoids combining a bicycle [2.2.2] octane with a 2-methoxyphenol moiety, named sorbicatechols A (

 <bold>8</bold>, 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These compounds showed inhibitory activities against H
 <sub>1</sub>N
 <sub>1</sub> virus, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 85 and 113 μM, respectively (ribavirin as a positive control, IC
