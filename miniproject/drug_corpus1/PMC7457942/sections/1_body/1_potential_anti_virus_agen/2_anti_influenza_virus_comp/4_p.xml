 <italic>Truncatella angustata</italic> XSB-01-43 isolated from a finger sponge 
 <italic>Amphimedon</italic> sp. collected from the reef at a depth of 10 m in Yongxing Island, Hainan Province of China, in June 2012, resulted in the isolation of truncateol O (

 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> ) [
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Compound 
 <bold>16</bold> showed anti-H
 <sub>1</sub>N
 <sub>1</sub> activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 30.4 μM, which was stronger than that of oseltamivir (OSV), a positive control with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 46.7 μM [
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The marine sponge-derived 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. CMN-62 was associated with the marine green algae 
 <italic>E. prolifera</italic>, and produced three new phenolic polyketides, wailupemycin J (

 <italic>R</italic>-wailupemycin K (

 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) [
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It was first reported that compounds 
 <bold>17</bold>, 
 <bold>18</bold> and 
 <bold>19</bold> displayed comparable anti-H
 <sub>1</sub>N
 <sub>1</sub> activity with 47.8%, 42.5% and 60.6% inhibitions, respectively at 50 μg/mL, while the positive control, ribavirin, with the inhibition rates of 45.3% at the same concentration [
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Two new meroterpenoids, chrodrimanins K (

 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) and N (

 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), as well as the known 3-hydroxypentacecilide A (
 <bold>22</bold>, 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) were separated from the fermentation broth of 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> sp. SCS-KFD09, which was gathered from a marine worm, 
 <italic>Sipunculus nudus</italic>, from Haikou Bay, China [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Compounds

 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> sp. SCSIO XWS02F40 derived from a marine sponge resulted in the discovery of two new asteltoxins named asteltoxins E (

 <bold>24</bold>, 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) [

 <sub>2</sub> activities with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 6.2 ± 0.08 and 8.9 ± 0.3 μM, respectively. Additionally, compound

 <sub>1</sub> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 3.5 ± 1.3 μM [
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Oseltamivir was used as the positive control with IC

 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A new compound named 6-
