<p id="p0110">The Western Equine Encephalitis Virus (WEEV) belongs to the encephalitic alpha viruses, which can directly infect neurons leading to CNS inflammation and neuronal destruction. It can cause severe diseases in human with high fatality of 70%. Unfortunately, there are currently no licensed vaccines or antivirus drugs for alpha virus infections [
