<p id="p0090">RSV is considered to be the major pediatric respiratory pathogen, triggered by G protein combining host cell receptors [
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Only limited therapeutic compounds for RSV have been reported, such as paclizumab and ribavirin, accounting for the urgency to develop novel anti-RSV drugs [
