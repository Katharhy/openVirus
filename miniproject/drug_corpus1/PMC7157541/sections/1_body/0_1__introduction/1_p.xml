<p>Coronaviruses, named for the crown-like spikes on their surface (Latin: corona = crown), are positive-sense RNA viruses that belong to the Coronvirinae subfamily, in the Coronaviridae family of the Nidovirales order [
 <xref rid="B1-pathogens-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. They have four main subgroups—alpha, beta, gamma, and delta—based on their genomic structure. Alpha- and betacoronaviruses infect only mammals, usually causing respiratory symptoms in humans and gastroenteritis in other animals [
 <xref rid="B2-pathogens-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-pathogens-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Until December of 2019, only six different coronaviruses were known to infect humans. Four of these (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HKU1) usually caused mild common cold-type symptoms in immunocompetent people and the other two have caused pandemics in the past two decades. In 2002–2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused a SARS epidemic that resulted in a 10% mortality. Similarly, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) caused a devastating pandemic in 2012 with a 37% mortality rate.
