<p>Other existing drug candidates include chloroquine and camostat mesylate. Chloroquine is a widely used anti-malarial drug that is known to block virus-cell fusion and has been shown to interfere with the glycosylation of SARS-CoV and ACE-2 cellular receptors, rendering the ACE-2-SARS-CoV interaction less efficient [

 <xref rid="B63-pathogens-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Camostat mesylate targets the TMPRSS2 protease, theoretically preventing viral entry. Researchers in Germany showed that camostat mesylate reduced the amount of SARS-CoV-2 viral replication [
