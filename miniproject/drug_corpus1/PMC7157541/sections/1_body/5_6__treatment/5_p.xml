<p>The recent finding that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the same ACE-2 receptors targeted by the 2002 SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B24-pathogens-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] opens up the possibility of using the previous research on the 2002 SARS epidemic and applying it to COVID-19. The first strategy would be to employ either a small receptor-binding domain (RBD) or a neutralizing antibody targeting the ACE-2 receptor, thus blocking the binding of S protein and preventing virus entry into cells. Initial in vitro results have shown promising results [

 <xref rid="B68-pathogens-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and specific monoclonal antibodies are being contemplated as candidates for treatment [

 <xref rid="B70-pathogens-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The main limitation of using RBDs or antibodies is that the treatment must be given within a specific time window, before the initiation of viral replication [
 <xref rid="B20-pathogens-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, the side effects of ACE-2 blockade, especially since ACE-2 is also present in non-pulmonary tissue, must be understood and minimized before implementation. In addition, finally, the turnover of ACE-2 receptors would influence how often the therapeutic RBD or antibody would have to be administered.
