<p>However, during the course of a potentially fatal pandemic, an accurate estimation of CFR is important. While it is tempting to estimate the CFR by dividing the number of known deaths by the total number of confirmed cases, the resulting number may be off by orders of magnitude, especially since infected individuals at one point in time may die 
 <italic>x</italic> days later. Using the lag period approach and dividing the current number of deaths to the number of cases x days ago may be a more acute estimator of CFR. Nucleuswealth.com applied this method by using the number of deaths at any particular day and dividing by number of cases 4, 8, or 12 days prior. As seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00231-f004">Figure 4</xref>, as time progresses, whether whichever number of days is used for x, the CFR seems to converge at just under 5% for cases within Hubei, and about 0.8% for cases outside of Hubei [

The higher mortality in Wuhan may be overestimated because early in the course of this epidemic, viral testing was limited to only the severe cases. However, the China National Health Commission admits that Wuhan has a relative lack of medical resources, which may have contributed to the higher mortality rate.
