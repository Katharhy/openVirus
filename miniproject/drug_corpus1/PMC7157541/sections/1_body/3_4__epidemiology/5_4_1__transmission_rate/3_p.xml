<p>Once infected droplets have landed on surfaces, their survivability on those surfaces determines if contact transmission is possible. Based on our current understanding from other betacoronaviruses, including SARS and MERS, coronaviruses can survive, and remain infectious, from 2 h up to 9 days on inanimate surfaces such as metal, glass, or plastic, with increased survival in colder and dryer environments [
