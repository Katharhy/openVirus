<p>The reproduction number, or “R naught” (R0), is a mathematical term that defines contagiousness [
 <xref rid="B30-pathogens-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Specifically, it is the number of people that one sick host can infect. If the R0 is less than one the disease will disappear. If the R0 ≥ 1 then the disease will spread between people. Estimates of the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 have ranged from 2.24 to as high as 3.58 [
 <xref rid="B31-pathogens-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] although the World Health Organization estimates it is between 1.4 and 2.5 [
 <xref rid="B32-pathogens-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. For the purposes of comparison, the mean R0 for seasonal influenza is between 1.1 and 2.3 (variable by region and immunization rates), whereas for SARS was between 1 and 2.75. The slightly higher R0 for SARS-CoV-2 may be because it has a longer prodromal period, increasing the period during which the infected host is contagious.
