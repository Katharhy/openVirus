<p>Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets, not to be confused with airborne transmission [
 <xref rid="B33-pathogens-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Droplets are larger and tend to fall to the ground close to the infected host and only infect others if the droplet is intercepted by a susceptible host prior to landing. Droplet transmission is typically limited to short distances, generally less than 2 m. However, the airborne route involves much smaller droplets that can float and move longer distances with air currents. Under certain humidity and temperature environments, airborne droplets can remain in flight for hours. Generally, pathogens that are transmissible via the airborne route have higher R0, because infected particles can remain in the air long after the infected individual has left the premises. This airborne route occurs, for example, in measles (R0 between 12 and 18 [
