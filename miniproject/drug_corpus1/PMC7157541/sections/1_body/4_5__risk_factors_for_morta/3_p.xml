<p>With what we know about the pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV virus, it seems reasonable to assume that those with higher levels of ACE-2 receptors may be at greatest risk. There was some speculation that the expression of ACE-2 receptors may be linked to race, specifically after an early report suggested that Asian males had higher ACE-2-expressing cell ratios than white and African Americans [

However, the sample size contained only eight different individuals (five African Americans, two whites, and one Asian) and extrapolating those findings to a whole race is impractical. Yet, in another study assessing ACE-2 receptor expression in tissues of 224 patients with lung cancer, there were no significant disparities in ACE-2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs. Caucasian), age groups (older or younger than 60 years old), or gender groups (male vs. females) [

ACE-2 gene expression was, however, significantly elevated in smokers suggesting that smoking history should be considered in identifying susceptible populations. Since smoking in China is predominantly a male attribute (54% of men, 2.6% of women) [
