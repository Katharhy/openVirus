<p>The SARS-related coronaviruses are covered by spike proteins that contain a variable receptor-binding domain (RBD). This RBD binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor found in the heart, lungs, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract [
 <xref rid="B18-pathogens-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] thus facilitating viral entry into target cells. Based on genomic sequencing, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be a mutated version of its most closely related virus, RaTG13, sampled from bats (

 <xref rid="B19-pathogens-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It is, therefore, believed that the SARS-CoV-2 also originated from bats and, after mutating, was able to infect other animals. The mutation increased the RBD affinity to ACE-2 in humans, but also other animals such as ferrets and Malayan pangolins (
 <italic>Manis javanica</italic>; a long-snouted, ant-eating mammal sold illegally for use in traditional Chinese medicine), but also decreased the RBD affinity to ACE-2 found in rodents and civets. The pangolin is believed to be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 [
