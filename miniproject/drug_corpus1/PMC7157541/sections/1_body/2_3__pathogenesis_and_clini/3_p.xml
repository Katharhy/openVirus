<p>In the first published review of the clinical presentation of 41 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B9-pathogens-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], 98% of patients had a fever, 76% had a cough, and 55% had shortness of breath on admission. However, those admitted may have had less severe symptoms for 2 to 14 days prior to presentation, during which they were likely contagious. By the time patients developed shortness of breath, they had been sick for an average of eight days. Once admitted to the hospital, all patients developed clinical pneumonia supported by chest CT findings, and 13 of the 41 patients (32%) developed hypoxic respiratory failure necessitating ICU admission. Four patients (10%) required mechanical ventilation, two of which received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation due to refractory hypoxia. In total, six patients died, giving a case fatality rate (CFR) of 15% and triggering panic that quickly spread worldwide. While early media reports suggested that deaths were more likely in patients with comorbid conditions, of the 41 patients described in the Chinese review, only 38% had comorbid conditions and the average age was 49.
