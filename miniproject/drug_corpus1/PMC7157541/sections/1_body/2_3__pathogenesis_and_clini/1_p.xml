<p>Since SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are so similar, the biochemical interactions and the pathogenesis are likely similar. Binding of the SARS-CoV to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors in the type II pneumocytes in the lungs triggers a cascade of inflammation in the lower respiratory tract [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00231-f003">Figure 3</xref>A), the complex is proteolytically processed by type 2 transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 leading to cleavage of ACE-2 and activation of the spike protein (
