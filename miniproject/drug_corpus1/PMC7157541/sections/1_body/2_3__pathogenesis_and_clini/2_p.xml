<p>Viral entry and cell infection trigger the hostâ€™s immune response, and the inflammatory cascade is initiated by antigen-presenting cells (APC). The process starts with the APC performing two functions: (1) presenting the foreign antigen to CD

 <sup>+</sup>-T-killer (Tk) cells that will target any cells containing the foreign antigen. In addition, activated Th1 cells stimulate B-cells to produce antigen-specific antibodies.
