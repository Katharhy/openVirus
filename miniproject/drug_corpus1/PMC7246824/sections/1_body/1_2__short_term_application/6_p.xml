<p>Concerning another coronavirus, Song and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-03176" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] investigated online diffusion of information, spread of fear, and perceived risk of contracting MERS infection during the MERS outbreak in South Korea in May-June of 2015. Buzz conveying negative feelings was found to be more prevalent in online discussion boards, Twitter, and online cafes than news sites and blogs. News buzz, but not rumor buzz, correlated with positive emotions and the mention of taking immunity-boosting food.
