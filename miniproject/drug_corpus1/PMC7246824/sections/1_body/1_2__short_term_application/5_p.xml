<p>Yang and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-03176" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] utilized population migration data to populate a dynamic transmission, compartmental “Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed” (SEIR) model, combined with an AI approach, trained on the SARS data, in order to predict the COVID-19 pandemic curve. Authors demonstrated that a five-day delay in the implementation of the stringent public health measures adopted by the Chinese authorities would have resulted in an epidemic size increased by three times. Loosening/lifting the lock-down intervention would cause a second peak in the Hubei province by mid-March until late April.
