<p>Having a reliable, sensitive and specific diagnostic test is of paramount importance in the prevention and control of infectious disorders. Researchers have succeeded in establishing a molecular kit able to quickly and accurately capture the proper diagnosis and distinguish between COVID-19 and SARS-CoV. Salivary diagnostics seems to hold great promise in effectively detecting the virus. Together with molecular assays and tests, ether multiplex nucleic acid amplification or microarray-based, high-resolution CT of the chest is fundamental for monitoring the disease course and its evolution in terms of severity and response to treatment. Currently ongoing research is also trying to identify early radiological predictors of prognosis, which would be extremely helpful in stratifying patients with COVID-19 and in their clinical management [
