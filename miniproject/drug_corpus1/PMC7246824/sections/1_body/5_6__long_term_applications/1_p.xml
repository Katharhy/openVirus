<p>In recent years, profound societal phenomena, including globalization and rapid urbanization together with population explosion and demographic changes, have deeply modified our lifestyles. Approximately more than half of humanity dwell in urban areas and settlements, with this figure being expected to significantly increase up to two-thirds of the global population by 2050. In the Western countries, whereas, at the beginning of the 20th century, less than half of the population lived in urban areas, this percentage had doubled at the beginning of the new century and it can be anticipated that it will further rise in the coming decades. </p>
