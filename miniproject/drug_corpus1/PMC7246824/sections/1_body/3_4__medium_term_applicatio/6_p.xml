<p>The usage of Ribavirin, a pro-drug of ribavirin triphosphate and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, which is crucial for the biosynthesis of guanosine and nucleic acids synthesis, is neither supported by cellular nor clinical data, with several studies reporting, instead, contrasting findings and clinically relevant toxicities that may result in discontinuation of therapy [
