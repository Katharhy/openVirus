<p>AI and Big Data appear to have enormous potential for the management of COVID-19 and other emergencies, and their role is anticipated to increase in the future. AI and Big Data can be used to track the spread of the virus in real time, and plan and lift public health interventions accordingly, monitor their effectiveness, repurpose old compounds and discover new drugs, as well as identify potential vaccine candidates and enhance the response of communities and territories to the ongoing pandemic. These emerging approaches can be exploited together with classical surveillance: whilst the latter enables data analysis and interpretation, the former uncovers hidden trends and patterns, which can be used to build predictive models. </p>
