<p id="Par37">Whether or not HCW had received IPC training did not seem to influence their level of knowledge and their practices of VHF (view Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). All respondents who received IPC training had good knowledge of VHF and only one HCW without IPC training received a bad knowledge score (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.30). Similarly, both IPC-trained and non-trained HCW had an equal percentage of respondents with good preventive practices (
