<p id="Par19">Bordering Sierra Leone, Liberia and Ivory Coast, Forest Guinea is one of the four geographic regions of Guinea in the southeast of the country. It was at the epicentre of the 2013–2016 Ebola outbreak and is considered one of the few African viral “hotspots” at high risk for VHF outbreaks, not only for EVD but also for MVD, LF and CCHF [

 <italic>Bombali ebolavirus</italic> in bats and Lassa virus in rodents [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]: two KAP studies conducted in Guinea’s capital concluded a low knowledge, negative attitudes and practices of EVD in HCW [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Another study found that the KAP of EVD suspect cases in HCW were insufficient in regions less affected by EVD [
