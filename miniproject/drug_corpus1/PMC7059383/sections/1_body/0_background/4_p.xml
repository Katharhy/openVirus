<p id="Par20">Particularly Guinea’s rural regions have been suffering from a shortage of qualified HCW, especially physicians and nurses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Because of the country’s civil servant system, HCW in rural areas only serve a minimum amount of time before being promoted as civil servants in urban areas, leading to a higher turnover of the health workforce in rural regions. Furthermore, as most HCW receive small salaries, they are often dependent on other sources of income which are mainly unavailable in rural regions. Reforms which hoped to increase workforce retention and professional quality in rural regions after the EVD epidemic have been looked at with scepticism, partly because adequate educational development of HCW in those regions is not ensured [
