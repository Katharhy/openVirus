<p id="Par18">The largest VHF outbreak to date - caused by 
 <italic>Zaire stain ebolavirus</italic> - occurred in West Africa from 2013 to 2016. It mainly affected Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea with a total of more than 28,000 cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Until March 2015, healthcare workers (HCW) accounted for 3.9% of reported cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the current EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), 5% of infected cases have been HCW as per august 2019 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. High rates of occupational infection are not only due to the contagiousness of certain VHF, but also to increased exposure due to non-recognition of suspect cases, limited and incorrect use of personal protective equipment (PPE), shortcomings in general hygiene practices and infrastructural deficiencies in healthcare facilities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Improvements in those areas have been linked to a decrease in occupational infections during VHF outbreaks [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Since HCW are on the frontline of outbreaks, their knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) form a central pillar of outbreak preparedness and infection prevention and control (IPC).
