<p id="Par26">The section on 
 <italic>attitudes</italic> was adapted from Jalloh et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Questions in this section were adjusted to VHF and to the clinical reality of HCW as respondents. Respondents were not scored in the attitudes section and we did not classify certain attitudes as “discriminatory”.
