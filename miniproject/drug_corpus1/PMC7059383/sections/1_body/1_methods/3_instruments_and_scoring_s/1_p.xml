<p id="Par24">The questionnaire was developed based on existing KAP studies of EVD from Nigeria and Guinea (view 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">supplementary material</xref>). Sections on 
 <italic>knowledge</italic> and 
 <italic>practices</italic> were adapted from Oladimedij et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Questions on 
 <italic>knowledge</italic> were adjusted to VHF in general rather than EVD only. The scoring system, which is well-explained elsewhere, was maintained [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In short, if three or more out of five questions on incubation period, infectivity, transmission, symptoms and disposal of infected corpse were answered correctly or with a sufficient number of correct answers, knowledge on VHF was scored as “good”. In addition, a list of nine diseases was read out loud to respondents and they were asked to identify the ones that were VHF. This question was not included in the knowledge score. We also added an open-ended question in which respondents were asked which VHF suspect case definition they applied in their daily clinical practice.
