Abstract</div> <div class="background" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Background</div> <p id="Par1">The 2013â€"2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa began in Guineaâ€™s Forest region, a region now considered to be at high risk for future epidemics of viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHF). Good knowledge, attitudes and practices towards VHF amongst healthcare workers in such regions are a central pillar of infection prevention and control (IPC). To inform future training in IPC, this study assesses the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards VHF amongst healthcare workers in public healthcare facilities in the most populated prefecture in Forest Guinea, and compares results from urban and rural areas.</p> </div> <div class="methods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Methods</div> <p id="Par2">In June and July 2019, we interviewed 102 healthcare workers in the main urban and rural public healthcare facilities in the Nâ€™zÃ©rÃ©korÃ© prefecture in Forest Guinea. We used an interviewer-administered questionnaire adapted from validated KAP surveys.</p> </div> <div class="results" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Results</div> <p id="Par3">The great majority of respondents demonstrated good knowledge and favourable attitudes towards VHF. However, respondents reported some gaps in preventive practices such as VHF suspect case detection. They also reported a shortage of protective medical equipment used in everyday clinical work in both urban and rural healthcare facilities and a lack of training in IPC, especially in rural healthcare facilities. However, whether or not healthcare workers had been trained in IPC did not seem to influence their level of KAP towards VHF.</p> </div> <div class="conclusions" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusions</div> <p id="Par4">Three years after the end of the Ebola epidemic, our findings suggest that public healthcare facilities in the Nâ€™zÃ©rÃ©korÃ© prefecture in Forest Guinea still lack essential protective equipment and some practical training in VHF suspect case detection. To minimize the risk of future VHF epidemics and improve management of outbreaks of infectious diseases in the region, current efforts to strengthen the public healthcare system in Guinea should encompass questions of supply and IPC training.</p> </div> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Background</div> <p id="Par17">Viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHF) are febrile illnesses caused by distinct families of RNA viruses. The main VHF are Ebola virus disease (EVD), Marburg virus disease (MVD), yellow fever (YF), dengue, Lassa fever (LF), Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) and Rift Valley fever (RVF) [<a href="#CR1">1</a>]. Human infection occurs through contact with animal-vectors or other infected humans. Patients may present a wide range of symptoms but VHF usually cause high fever, gastrointestinal symptoms and sometimes bleeding [<a href="#CR2">2</a>]. Clinical outcome depends on the type of viral infection: some VHF only lead to mild illness while others cause life-threatening conditions. Many VHF are highly contagious after an incubation period of up to 21â€‰days, infectiousness of patients usually starting with the onset of symptoms [<a href="#CR3">3</a>]. Thus, VHF outbreaks go hand in hand with a high risk of nosocomial and occupational infection [<a href="#CR4">4</a>].</p> <p id="Par18">The largest VHF outbreak to date - caused by <i>Zaire stain ebolavirus</i> - occurred in West Africa from 2013 to 2016. It mainly affected Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea with a total of more than 28,000 cases [<a href="#CR5">5</a>]. Until March 2015, healthcare workers (HCW) accounted for 3.9% of reported cases [<a href="#CR6">6</a>]. In the current EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), 5% of infected cases have been HCW as per august 2019 [<a href="#CR7">7</a>]. High rates of occupational infection are not only due to the contagiousness of certain VHF, but also to increased exposure due to non-recognition of suspect cases, limited and incorrect use of personal protective equipment (PPE), shortcomings in general hygiene practices and infrastructural deficiencies in healthcare facilities [<a href="#CR4">4</a>]. Improvements in those areas have been linked to a decrease in occupational infections during VHF outbreaks [<a href="#CR6">6</a>, <a href="#CR8">8</a>, <a href="#CR9">9</a>]. Since HCW are on the frontline of outbreaks, their knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) form a central pillar of outbreak preparedness and infection prevention and control (IPC).</p> <p id="Par19">Bordering Sierra Leone, Liberia and Ivory Coast, Forest Guinea is one of the four geographic regions of Guinea in the southeast of the country. It was at the epicentre of the 2013â€"2016 Ebola outbreak and is considered one of the few African viral â€œhotspotsâ€� at high risk for VHF outbreaks, not only for EVD but also for MVD, LF and CCHF [<a href="#CR10">10</a>]. Recently, the region was the site of discovery of <i>Bombali ebolavirus</i> in bats and Lassa virus in rodents [<a href="#CR11">11</a>, <a href="#CR12">12</a>]. To identify misunderstandings, misconceptions and risk practices in HCW relating to EVD, KAP towards EVD amongst HCW have been assessed in parts of Guinea during the EVD outbreak [<a href="#CR13">13</a>â€"<a href="#CR15">15</a>]: two KAP studies conducted in Guineaâ€™s capital concluded a low knowledge, negative attitudes and practices of EVD in HCW [<a href="#CR13">13</a>, <a href="#CR14">14</a>]. Another study found that the KAP of EVD suspect cases in HCW were insufficient in regions less affected by EVD [<a href="#CR15">15</a>].</p> <p id="Par20">Particularly Guineaâ€™s rural regions have been suffering from a shortage of qualified HCW, especially physicians and nurses [<a href="#CR16">16</a>]. Because of the countryâ€™s civil servant system, HCW in rural areas only serve a minimum amount of time before being promoted as civil servants in urban areas, leading to a higher turnover of the health workforce in rural regions. Furthermore, as most HCW receive small salaries, they are often dependent on other sources of income which are mainly unavailable in rural regions. Reforms which hoped to increase workforce retention and professional quality in rural regions after the EVD epidemic have been looked at with scepticism, partly because adequate educational development of HCW in those regions is not ensured [<a href="#CR17">17</a>]. This suggests that HCW practicing in rural regions might be less knowledgeable of VHF and also practice protective measures with a lower frequency.</p> <p id="Par21">Assessments of the KAP in HCW as part of epidemic preparedness are important in regions with elevated outbreak risk in order to identify existing gaps and improve occupational safety and viral surveillance. To our current knowledge, no KAP study towards VHF amongst HCW has been conducted in Guinea, nor has any KAP study compared urban and rural HCW respectively in Guinea. The mentioned KAP studies in Guinea focussed on EVD only as part of the outbreak response and not on VHF in general. Furthermore, Forest Guinea as high risk region has never received particular attention as KAP studies were more concentrated in the capital. Our study fills this gap by assessing KAP towards VHF in HCW in urban and rural areas in the Nâ€™zÃ©rÃ©korÃ© prefecture in Forest Guinea. It informs future training in IPC for HCW in that region and allows to reflect on observed similarities and differences in the knowledge, attitudes and practices towards VHF in HCW practicing either in urban or in rural healthcare facilities.</p> </div> <div class="methods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Setting and study sites</div> <p id="Par22">Our study was conducted in June and July 2019 in Nâ€™zÃ©rÃ©korÃ©, prefecture. Nâ€™zÃ©rÃ©korÃ© is Forest Guineaâ€™s most populated prefecture and is also the name of the prefectureâ€™s capital city where the largest regional referral hospital of Forest Guinea is situated [<a href="#CR18">18</a>]. Apart from the hospital, 19 health centres are distributed in urban and rural areas to ensure a wide coverage of primary care; numerous small health posts are found in the most remote areas and villages [<a href="#CR19">19</a>]. These are mostly unequipped facilities that provide limited services to the population [<a href="#CR20">20</a>]. As study sites we selected the regional hospital and all 19 main health centres of the prefecture - seven in the urban region and twelve in the rural sub-prefectures. Health posts were not included in our study.</p> </div> <div class="respondents" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Respondents</div> <p id="Par23">In total, we interviewed 102 HCW. Respondents comprised physicians, nurses, midwives, technical assistants, laboratory staff, pharmacists, non-medical doctors and medical and nurse students. Respondents were selected based on a convenience sample of HCW present during our visits to healthcare facilities. Health centres were visited once for interviews; interviews at the regional hospital were conducted on several days. At each of the healthcare facilities, the director or acting director gave permission to interview HCW and recommended in which order to interview HCW from different services to leave daily routine as undisturbed as possible. We approached respondents based on those recommendations.</p> </div> <div class="instrumentsandscoringsystem" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Instruments and scoring system</div> <p id="Par24">The questionnaire was developed based on existing KAP studies of EVD from Nigeria and Guinea (view <a href="#MOESM1">supplementary material</a>). Sections on <i>knowledge</i> and <i>practices</i> were adapted from Oladimedij et al. [<a href="#CR21">21</a>]. Questions on <i>knowledge</i> were adjusted to VHF in general rather than EVD only. The scoring system, which is well-explained elsewhere, was maintained [<a href="#CR21">21</a>]. In short, if three or more out of five questions on incubation period, infectivity, transmission, symptoms and disposal of infected corpse were answered correctly or with a sufficient number of correct answers, knowledge on VHF was scored as â€œgoodâ€�. In addition, a list of nine diseases was read out loud to respondents and they were asked to identify the ones that were VHF. This question was not included in the knowledge score. We also added an open-ended question in which respondents were asked which VHF suspect case definition they applied in their daily clinical practice.</p> <p id="Par25">Questions on <i>practices</i> were adjusted to better fit the Guinean post-Ebola context. Furthermore, the original binary structure of possible answers was changed to a five-point Likert scale to reflect frequency of practices. Three sections - each consisting of nine questions - measured the frequency of practices in general precautions, VHF suspect case identification and VHF suspect case management. The answer â€œneverâ€� received one point, â€œrarelyâ€� two points, â€œsometimesâ€� three points, â€œoftenâ€� four points and â€œalwaysâ€� five points. An additional possibility â€œnot applicableâ€� was added if HCW felt the demanded practice did not match their clinical responsibility. For questions involving <i>practices</i> with clinical materials, a possible answer was added for â€œmaterial unavailableâ€�. Our scoring system for <i>practices</i> deviated from the original version. The mean for each section was calculated and a minimum of four was considered as indicating good practice. Respondents had to reach a good practice score in each section to reach overall good practices. The items where the answers â€œnot applicableâ€� or â€œmaterial unavailableâ€� were given were excluded from the calculation of the practice score.</p> <p id="Par26">The section on <i>attitudes</i> was adapted from Jalloh et al. [<a href="#CR22">22</a>]. Questions in this section were adjusted to VHF and to the clinical reality of HCW as respondents. Respondents were not scored in the attitudes section and we did not classify certain attitudes as â€œdiscriminatoryâ€�.</p> <p id="Par27">The language of the questionnaire was French. The original versions in English underwent a forward and back translation by native speakers acquainted with the necessary terminology. In contrast to the reference works of the source questionnaires, our questionnaire was fully interviewer-administered. This was due to the simple reason that overall literacy in French is estimated to be as low as 27% in the Nâ€™zÃ©rÃ©korÃ© prefecture, leaving even some university graduates with difficulties to read French [<a href="#CR23">23</a>]. Two healthcare professionals from the Nâ€™zÃ©rÃ©korÃ© prefecture and three graduate students in medicine and pharmacology from Nâ€™zÃ©rÃ©korÃ© public university were trained in the research protocol and acted as interviewers.</p> </div> <div class="statisticalanalysis" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

The two most frequently reported professional positions amongst respondents were technical assistant (30.4%) or state registered nurse (22.5%) and the majority (75.5%) had been working in the healthcare facility for more than 1 year. Of those working for more than 1 year, 29.9% had not yet received any training in IPC (view TableÂ <a href="#Tab1">1</a>).

Discussion</div> <p id="Par38">This is the first KAP study on VHF in Forest Guinea. The study shows that HCW practicing in both urban and rural areas possess a very good knowledge of VHF and would accept vaccines once approved and available. Our data suggests that knowledge on VHF is not a consequence of IPC trainings. Rather, we believe that it is a general consequence of the heightened awareness for VHF that the recent EVD outbreak has created in the country. During our study, HCW consistently emphasized how the EVD epidemic had sharpened their knowledge and practice towards EVD because it had dominated their daily lives in healthcare facilities for so long.</p> <p id="Par39">We found some deficiencies in practices amongst many of our respondents in both urban and rural healthcare facilities. Especially the fact that HCW did not consistently rule out VHF in patients when they presented a certain range of symptoms â€" e.g. through the clinical exploration of more likely causes for the symptoms or through recommended laboratory tests for VHF â€" is an important finding. It points to a reluctance of HCW to signal VHF suspect cases even though they may fit suspect case definition criteria. This may seriously jeopardize routine VHF screening in clinical practice.</p> <p id="Par40">Furthermore, the large majority of HCW reported to be using a VHF suspect case definition based on the presence of haemorrhagic signs in patients. While this reflects WHO recommendations for integrated disease surveillance in African countries, such case definitions risk to miss VHF index cases since visible haemorrhage is only an infrequent and late clinical sign of infection, at least in EVD [<a href="#CR24">24</a>].</p> <p id="Par41">As previous Ebola-related KAP surveys amongst HCW in Guinea during the EVD epidemic, we identified IPC training needs with regards to reported IPC training status and the described deficiencies in practices. The EVD epidemic has generated widespread awareness of the disease and left many HCW in the country with IPC training who had been without before [<a href="#CR25">25</a>â€"<a href="#CR27">27</a>]. Despite the increased post-Ebola efforts to improve IPC performance and VHF awareness in healthcare facilities, our study hints at a gap in IPC training in the Nâ€™zÃ©rÃ©korÃ© region, especially in rural areas. Similar findings have been reported in other West African countries [<a href="#CR21">21</a>, <a href="#CR28">28</a>]. Surprisingly, this gap does not seem to translate into a lack of knowledge or deficient practices towards VHF. A recent study on IPC in the DRC suggested that a higher quantity of HCW with IPC training does not increase IPC performance of healthcare facilities [<a href="#CR29">29</a>]. We found that rural areas where significantly less HCW had received IPC training than in the urban areas reported higher scores on certain topics regarding <i>practices</i>. Even though our data cannot explain this finding, informal conversations with HCW have indicated that HCW in rural areas feel strongly responsible for preventing any future outbreaks in rural regions since such events would stigmatize â€œtheirâ€� region as sanitary problem area once more. This underscores that quantity itself may not suffice when aiming to improve IPC performance through trainings. Nevertheless, future index cases of VHF outbreaks are likely to appear in Forest Guinea and we believe that the above reported deficiencies in practices regarding VHF suspect case detection in both urban and rural areas have to be tackled, possibly through improving the quality of IPC trainings.</p> <p id="Par42">Last, several respondents in our study reported the absence of important basic protective materials, such as gloves, masks and gogglesâ€" a fact already well documented during the 2013â€"2016 EVD outbreak [<a href="#CR30">30</a>]. PPE seemed to be less available in urban than in rural healthcare facilities. According to some HCW, this was due to a temporary distribution problem since specialized treatment centres for infectious diseases have opened in 2018 in urban areas. These centres stockpiled specialized gear such as PPE for urban healthcare facilities in preparation for future outbreaks.</p> <p id="Par43">Our study has two main limitations. First, our results are based on a non-probabilistic sampling strategy. Therefore, our comparison between urban and rural healthcare facilities has to be interpreted with caution. Financial and temporal restrictions as well as an unknown target population size prevented us from employing a probabilistic sampling strategy. Our stratification into urban and rural subgroups was thus not based on prior knowledge of population sizes. At the time of our study, 432 HCW were employed in the Nâ€™zÃ©rÃ©korÃ© prefecture according to the local health authorities but rural and urban proportions were unknown. The official numbers, however, rarely reflect the reality in healthcare facilities: a recent study on Guinean health workforce has noted absenteeism rates between 39 and 41% [<a href="#CR17">17</a>]. The same study found that (graduate) students and other volunteersâ€" not represented in official numbers - possibly make up for the absence of civil servants. Since this part of the health workforce executes similar tasks as officially registered HCW - such as triage, diagnostics and therapy - they are exposed to the same occupational risks. Assessing their knowledge attitudes and practices towards VHF was considered of equal relevance for this study which is reflected in the composition of our study population.</p> <p id="Par44">Second, the reported deficiencies in protective practices are possibly bigger than our study shows. As the questionnaire was interviewer-administered and not accompanied by a verification process, over-reporting of practices due to social desirability may have occurred. For instance, a recent study in the Nâ€™zÃ©rÃ©korÃ© regional hospital showed that the great majority of VHF suspect cases are usually not recognized by HCW [<a href="#CR31">31</a>] even though 71.1% of HCW in our study reported good suspect case identification practices.</p> <p id="Par45">Despite these limitations, our study provides insight into existing shortcomings in practices amongst HCW in a remote region of Guinea where access to rural areas is often difficult for researchers.</p> </div> <div class="conclusion" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusion</div> <p id="Par46">Good knowledge, attitudes and practices towards VHF amongst healthcare workers form a central pillar of infection control and prevention in regions at risk for VHF outbreaks. Our study â€" conducted in urban and rural public healthcare facilities in the former epicentre of the 2013â€"2016 EVD outbreak in Guineaâ€" showed that HCW possess a good knowledge of VHF but maintain some deficiencies in practices regarding the management of VHF. Whether or not HCW were trained in IPC did not influence their KAP. Thus, while the study highlighted deficiencies in some crucial preventive practices such as VHF suspect case detection, the need for more training in IPC is not self-evident. Rather, future IPC trainings in Forest Guinea should ensure that a certain quality in IPC is met and maintained by healthcare facilities, especially regarding future VHF signal case detection and outbreak prevention. This study further hinted to a shortage in the provision of general protective materials and PPE. Future efforts should thus also only aim to improve the availability protective gear in healthcare facilities.</p> </div> <div class="supplementary-material" title="supplementary-material"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
