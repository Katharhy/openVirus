<p>Incidentally, in the context of the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), it has been demonstrated that higher expression levels of the HIV binding sites CCR5 and CD4 protect from, rather than increase, HIV virulence. Michel et al. reported that HIV employs its early gene Nef product for avoiding superinfection during the viral‐entry step by downregulating CCR5. This Nef‐mediated downregulation enhances the endocytosis rate of both CCR5 and CD4, which in turn facilitates efficient replication and spread of HIV, thereby promoting AIDS pathogenesis (Michel, Allespach, Venzke, Fackfmicheller, &amp; Keppler, 
 <xref rid="ddr21656-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). It remains to be studied if a comparable mechanism for avoiding superinfection has evolved in coronaviruses; in which case, the suggestion of applying AT1R blockers as SARS therapeutics, even that they upregulate the expression of the ACE2 virus binding site, will not seem paradoxical.
