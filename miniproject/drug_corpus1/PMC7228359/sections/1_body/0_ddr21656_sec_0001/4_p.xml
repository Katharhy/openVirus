<p>The AT1R antagonists losartan and olmesartan, commonly applied for reducing blood pressure in hypertensive patients, were shown to increase cardiac ACE2 expression about three‐fold following chronic treatment (28 days) after myocardial infarction induced by coronary artery ligation of rats (Ishiyama et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21656-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Losartan was also shown to upregulate renal ACE2 expression in chronically treated rats (Klimas et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21656-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). In agreement with these observations, higher urinary ACE2 levels were observed in hypertensive patients treated with the AT1R antagonist olmesartan (Furuhashi et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21656-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that chronic AT1R blockade results in ACE2 upregulation in both rats and humans.
