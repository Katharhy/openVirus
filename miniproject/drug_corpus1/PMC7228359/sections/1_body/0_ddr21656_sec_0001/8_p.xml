<p>The tentative suggestion to apply AT1R antagonists such as losartan and telmisartan as SARS‐CoV‐2 therapeutics for treating patients prior to the development of acute respiratory syndrome remains unproven until tried. At time of writing this brief commentary, the end of the COVID‐19 epidemic is not in sight and drastic actions are required (and being done) for containing its spread and death toll. Hence, the most rapid approach for assessing its feasibility is to analyze clinical patient records and apply datamining technologies to determine whether patients who were prescribed with AT1R antagonists prior to their diagnosis (for treating their hypertension, diabetic kidney disease, or other indications) had better disease outcome. Moreover, the percentage of people chronically medicated with AT1R blockers in the general population should be compared with the percentage among hospital admissions of SARS‐CoV‐2 infected patients presenting serious symptoms. If the latter percentage would be found to be significantly smaller, this would support the notion that AT1R antagonists confer protection from severe symptoms among SARS‐CoV‐2 infected individuals. Knowledge gained from such datamining of clinical records seems crucial for reducing the mortality and morbidity of SARS‐CoV‐2. At the same time, efforts must be made for developing a SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine.</p>
