  <p>Characterization of exosomes (
   <bold>a-b</bold>) The size and morphology of freeze-dried exosomes were similar to non-freeze-dried exosomes. Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) showed bell-shaped particle size distribution, peaking at mode 117 nm ±5 nm and 129 nm ±8 nm for freeze-dried exosomes and non-freeze-dried exosomes respectively. There was no aggregation of exosomes observed as indicated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) (Scale bar-100 nm, Magnification-15000X); (
   <bold>c</bold>) Western Blot image showing that freeze-drying method did not alter the exosomal membrane integrity and its protein content as evident by the expression of exosomal specific surface protein CD 63 and cytoplasmic protein Alix; (
