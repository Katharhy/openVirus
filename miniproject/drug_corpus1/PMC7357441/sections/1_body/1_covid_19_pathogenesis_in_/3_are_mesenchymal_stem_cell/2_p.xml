<p id="Par7">Such findings using MSCs should not be surprising as they have been well known for their high regenerative and immunomodulatory properties. MSCs can secrete IL-10, hepatocyte growth factor, keratinocytes growth factor, and VEGF to alleviate ARDS, regenerate and repair lung damage and resist fibrosis [

MSCs have the potential to inhibit the abnormal activation of T lymphocytes and macrophages, and induce their differentiation into regulatory T cells (Treg) subsets and anti-inflammatory macrophages. These functional aspects of MSCs, make them an ideal candidate amongst other available cellular therapies for the treatment of COVID-19 [

MSCs regenerative and repair mechanisms usually lie in their potential to replace the damaged cells, release anti-inflammatory cytokines, promote angiogenesis, etc. MSCs are the most common andwidely investigated cell type used amongst the other available cell-based therapies in various diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Various preclinical studies have already investigated the mechanistic approach of the MSCs to treat respiratory diseases. Based on these studies, the first AETHER trial, published in 2016, evaluated the safety of a single infusion of bone marrow-derived MSCs in nine patients with mild to moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. No severe adverse events were reported in the next 60Â weeks after the infusion of the MSCs. Such studies have formed the base for using MSCs in treating patients with respiratory disorders and have shown to be effective [
