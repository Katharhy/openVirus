<p id="Par8">Despite these clinical reports satisfying the safety and efficacy of using MSCs for respiratory diseases, there are certain challenges and controversies which cannot be neglected at this point considering the COVID-19 situation. Some of these include, high cost of maintenance, long term homing potential, transient survival after transplantation, disturbed differential capacities thus contributing to further adversity of the disease condition, difficult to store and reuse after revival, etc. [

Rapid progress in the understanding mechanisms underlying MSCs based cellular therapy has shown profound and significant influence of host inflammatory environment effect on transplanted cells fate. These MSCs are phagocytosed by resident macrophages, and exosomes derived from them can replicate their therapeutic effect. This has paved the way to the paracrine hypothesis which is emerging as one of the most advanced and beneficial therapies over MSCs themselves [

The existing literature strongly evidences that the transplanted MSCs when encounter the harsh environment at the target site, they undergo autophagy and apoptosis to release growth factors and cytokine rich exosomes which in turn results in alleviating the disease pathophysiology [
