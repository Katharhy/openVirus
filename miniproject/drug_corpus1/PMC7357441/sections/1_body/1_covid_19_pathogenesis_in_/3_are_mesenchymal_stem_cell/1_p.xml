It was observed that after a single dose of MSCs intervention, there was a significant improvement in the functional conditions of these patients without any adverse effects. Within 2 days of MSCs transplantation, there was a drastic improvement in the pulmonary function of these patients. Thus, the transplantation of MSCs was found to be effective. Similarly, other clinical trials have been registered for evaluating the efficacy and safety of MSCs isolated from a range of allogenic sources like Bone Marrow, adipose tissue, Wharton’s jelly, and placenta for COVD-19. More than 20 clinical trials are registered tilldate [
