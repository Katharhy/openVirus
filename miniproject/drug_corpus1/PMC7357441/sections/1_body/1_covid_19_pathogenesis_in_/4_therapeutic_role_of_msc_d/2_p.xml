<p id="Par10">Further, the present pandemic renewed the interest of many researchers towards the applicability of exosomes as an effective and safe therapeutics for combating COVID-19 associated diseases. Recently, bone marrow-derived exosomal based product, EXOFlo was tested in a non-randomized open-label cohort study for the treatment of severe COVID-19. Twenty-four patients were treated with these exosomes and no adverse events were observed within 72 h of treatment. It was observed that exosomes treatment resulted in significant improvement in these patients by restoring oxygen storage capacity, downregulating cytokine storm, and enhancing immunity. However, this study is first of its kind evaluating MSCs derived exosomes therapeutic potential for COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Similar studies are warranted to investigate the regenerative and reparative potential of exosomes to further validate the vast pre-clinical observations in non-COVID-19 model systems sharing the same pathologies as that of COVID-19. Based on these studies, the putative role of MSCs derived exosomes in lung pathogenesis can be described as follows:

    <bold>Protection and proliferation of lung epithelial cells</bold>: The bronchial and lung epithelial cells represent a primary target during lung infection. During infection, a complex cascade of inflammatory signaling results in the activation of innate and adaptive immune systems against the invading pathogen by these lung epithelial cells [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Epithelial cell injury and damage may influence disease risk and thus their protection and proliferation during infection are vital. Different groups have evidence of the potential protective role of these exosomes in various pre-clinical studies. In one study, it was demonstrated that miR-21-5p delivery by the MSC-exosomes protected lung epithelial cells against oxidative stress-induced cell death [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In another study, by Bari et al., MSC- exosomes were shown to express Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) on its surface. AAT is a potent inhibitor of neutrophil-derived proteolytic enzymes and has a key role in protecting lung epithelial cells by anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in the lungs [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Kim et al. have also reported that the administration of MSC- exosomes in the animal model of emphysema, increased the proliferation of lung epithelial cells. These exosomes contain growth factor FGF2, which hasthe regenerative capacity and is important in lung development [

    <bold>Reversal of Lung inflammation</bold>: Cytokines play an important role in immunopathology during viral infection, where the rapid innate immune response is needed as the first line of defense against infection. Deregulated and excessive immune response may be responsible for immune damage to the human body [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. There is evidence from severely ill patients with CoVs that suggest that proinflammatory response plays a major role in the pathogenesis. In the earlier stages of nCoV infection, respiratory epithelial cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages shows a delayed release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. However, in the later stages, these cells secrete low levels of antiviral factors (interferons-IFNs) and high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin -IL-1β, and IL-6) and chemokines (CCl-2, CCL-3, and CCL5). This delayed but elevated levels of pro-inflammatory factors results in cytokine storm which may induce organ damage and therefore, is one of the major concerns contributing to the severity of the disease [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. These patients are administered immunosuppressive medications, which is inevitably associated with increased risk of infection [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. MSCs and their derivative exosomes have long been known for their immune-modulatory potential and thus have been evaluated in various pre-clinical and clinical settings. A noteworthy, similar condition is observed in Graft versus host disease (GvHD) associated pulmonary disease [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In a preliminary clinical study, MSC- exosomes were shown to alleviate the symptoms of grade IV GvHD patients [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Although there is limited data available for exosomes potent immunomodulatory role in the clinical setup. This preliminary study gains confidence in the potential role of exosomes in dealing with the cytokine storm induced lung damage.

    <bold>Polarization of lung macrophages:</bold> As previously mentioned, during viral infection, cytokine storm is generated due to the impaired immune response leading to further lung damage. This is largely mediated by pro-inflammatory macrophages in the lungs [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The regulation of these pro-inflammatory macrophages (producing inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α) to anti-inflammatory macrophages (producing immunosuppressive cytokines like IL-10 and TGF-β) by exosomes may aid in the further reversal of the disease pathophysiology. Some of the pre-clinical studies evaluating the effect of MSC derived exosomes on lung macrophages in various lung injury models have provided insights into the exosome derived approach as a new strategy for treating nCOV associated pathogenicity. These studies have demonstrated that the presence of several miRNAs like miR-145 and proteins in exosomespromote lung tissue repair and regeneration [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Additionally, MSC- exosomes may also modulate phenotype and function of lung-infiltrating dendritic cells (DCs) by inducing the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines like IL-10 and TGF- β and thus preventing the lungs from the detrimental macrophage and DC-driven systemic immune response [

The group later demonstrated the ability of these exosomes in restoring alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) in an ex-vivo lung perfusion model using human donor lungs that were not suitable for transplantation. This ability of MSC-exosomes was in part by a CD-44 dependent mechanism of exosomes for internalization into the damaged host cells [
