<p id="Par9">Exosomes are small nanovesicles of size 30 nm −150 nm secreted by all cell types and known for their role in cell-to-cell communication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. These exosomes carry various biologically active molecules like miRNA and proteins. The type of content of these exosomes depends on the parent cell from which they are secreted. These exosomes have cell adhesion molecules present on their surface which help them in binding with the target cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Since the discovery of exosomes as a mode of the paracrine effect of the MSCs, various studies have investigated their role in deciphering the regenerative and mechanistic aspects in treating various diseases. The use of MSC-derived exosomes as cell-free therapeutics offers several advantages compared to their cellular counterparts such as high stability, low immunogenicity, easy storage, and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. These exosomes have bilipid membrane composition, potential for off the shelf availability, and biocompatibility that make these exosomes an ideal candidate as a drug delivery vehicle [

Thus, these interesting features about exosomes have gained enough interest in evaluating their potential role as a therapeutic and pharmacological intervention in dealing with the present COVID-19 pandemic. Probably, Exosomes therapy can prevent the cytokines stormelicitedby the immune system as the mechanistic approach shown in (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; Panel B) and promote endogenous repair by reparative properties of the exosomes. Emerging evidence support the possibility of using MSCs derived exosomes as a new form of therapy for treating different diseases. The initial reports suggesting exosomes as potential therapeutics were in 2009 when identified for their cardio protective role [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Later detailed investigations into these MSCs derived exosomes revealed their similar or superior functional capacity like MSCs themselves. A first report in 2012 by Lee et al. demonstrated the cytoprotective effect of exosomes from MSCs in hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension mice model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. This led to multiple studies investigating exosomes cargo and mechanistic role in various lung diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and Acute Respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [
