<p id="Par16">Exosomes therapeutic efficacy and safety for the delivery of cellular biological components to the target cell has now drawn considerable interest for their potential as drug delivery vehicles. These are emerging as ideal biological nano-carriers for clinical applications owing to their capability of escaping immune recognition and premature degradation, slightly negative zeta potential for longer period of circulation in the body and small size for deeper penetration into the tissues [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Many more studies have been reported, investigating the potential of this biological modality for drug packing and targeted delivery to the sites where cells or synthetic vesicles cannot reach, like a blood-brain barrier. Although, most of the reported studies have evaluated different mechanistic approaches for loading drugs with high efficiency into these vesicles. Two major approaches for loading the therapeutic cargo into the exosome mimetics includes active and passive encapsulation. The passive cargo loading methods are relatively simple and uses the drug loading through diffusion method along the concentration gradient, which further depends on the hydrophobicity of the drug molecule. Different drugs or nano-formulations like curcumin, paclitaxel, etc. have been loaded using this methodology [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. In contrast, active cargo loading involves methods involving temporary disruption of the exosome-membrane such as sonication, freeze-thaw cycles, electroporation, etc. Various chemotherapeutic drugs, siRNAs, etc. have been loaded into exosomes isolated from various cell sources using this approach [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Further modifications in the exosome surface molecules have resulted in enhanced targeted delivery in the damaged tissues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. However, there are limited studies available with respect to MSCs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Also, combining the therapeutic properties of MSC-exosomes and loading drugs will aid in enhanced regenerative potential (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; Panel A). MSCs are known to produce a large number of exosomes, suggesting that these cells may be efficient for exosome production in a clinically applicable scale as compare to other cell sources [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. As reported in the studies, specifically designed bioreactors can also be utilized for exosome production scale-up [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Nevertheless, the idea of using MSC derived exosomes is promising and encouraging as next-generation therapy for combating COVID-19. The regenerative immunomodulatory cargo of these exosomes along with that of anti-viral drugs makes them a novel intervention of treatment and prevention of the disease.
