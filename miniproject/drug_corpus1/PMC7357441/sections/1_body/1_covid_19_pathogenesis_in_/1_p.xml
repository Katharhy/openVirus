<p id="Par4">Novel Coronaviruses (nCoVs) are large, enveloped viruses, belonging to the family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> in the 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic> order [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It contains non-segmented positive-sense single-stranded RNA, size ranging from 26 to 32Â kb in length. Its structural protein consists of a spike(S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) protein, which plays a major role in virus entry and replication in the host cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Various findings have identified COVID-19 to be closely related to two bats derived SARS coronavirus (88% similar), while it was only 70% and 50% related to SARS and MERS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The structural analysis and pathological insights suggest that the virus enters the lungs and binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors which are abundantly expressed on the surface of lungs and intestinal epithelial cells. ACE2 receptors are also expressed by myocardial cells, cholangiocytes, proximal tubular cells of the kidney, etc. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The virus uses the host machinery to replicate itself and infect other cells possessing these receptors. Primarily, these viruses severely affect the lungs causing massive alveolar damage due to imbalanced and excessive immune response which may cause pneumonia and thus, leading to progressive respiratory failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Some of the major histological changes of the nCOV infected lungs are interstitial inflammation, alveolar damage, intra-alveolar edema, granular tissue formation, fibrin and collagen deposition, bronchiolitis and leukocyte infiltration. These histological changes in the infected patients show clinical manifestations such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath and thus need immediate hospitalization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. There are still limited data available on nCOV pathogenesis and associated cellular changes, however, understanding the associated changes in the lung is important for diagnosis and management of COVID-19.
