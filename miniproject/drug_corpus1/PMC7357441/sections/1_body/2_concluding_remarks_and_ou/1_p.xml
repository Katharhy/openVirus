<p id="Par18">The vast advantages of using exosomes over MSCs have shifted the focus on these nano-platforms. The MSCs derived exosomes can be a novel intervention for treating the current COVID-19 pandemic situation due to their regenerative, immunomodulatory, and anti-microbial properties. With upcoming reports and clinical studies using these proposed novel therapeutic interventions, exosomes can be established as cell-free therapeutics and drug delivery modality worldwide. This is the need of the hour and must be looked into as a potential nano-intervention for treating critically ill patients. This review intended to encourage various clinicians/ scientists worldwide working in this area to understand and explore this emerging area of research. Displaying such a diverse range of advantageous properties including their spectral curability, and their capability to be used as a drug carrier, make exosomes an ideal candidate for clinical applications, and as an off the shelf therapeutics.</p>
