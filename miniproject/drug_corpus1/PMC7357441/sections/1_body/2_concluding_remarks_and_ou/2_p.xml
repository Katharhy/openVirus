<p id="Par19">Even after considering every advancement of utilizing exosomes as a therapeutic aid and a drug delivery vehicle, ultimately the question that still stands is if we are overlooking the efficacy of MSCs derived exosomes in resolving the question of finding a cure to combat COVID-19, or is there no convincing data available in terms of pre-clinical/clinical results to consider the application of these exosomes as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in the current situation? Are we still missing out on the relevant information available with the scientists/ clinicians? There are many such doubts which are hindering the involvement of MSC derived exosomes as a mainstream therapeutic player which may inspire future research in this field. MSCs have been shown to possess the ability to fight against the pathogenesis of COVID-19, yet it is debatable if exosomes derived by them replicate their abilities. Another matter of concern is that despite the similar characterization of MSCs isolated from various tissue sources, there are subtle differences in their response to various disease conditions, so it is unclear whether tissue specificity of MSCs also results in differential modulation in the therapeutic efficacy of the exosomes shed by them. Another application of MSC derived exosomes has been presented in drug delivery, which has made these nano-vesicles an attractive clinical tool. Extensive research is required to modulate their implementation from being mediators of bio-interactions to being drug delivery vehicles. Future, preliminary clinical studies are warranted in this area, as they will also resolve issues inferred by cell-based therapy and put forward an ‘all-in-one’ autonomously therapeutic drug delivery modality.</p>
