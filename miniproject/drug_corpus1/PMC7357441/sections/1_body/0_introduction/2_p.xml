 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As per the reports, the virus has an incubation period of ~5 days (range 2–14 days) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The probability of dying, if infected by the virus, differs depending on the age group. Individuals with a previous case history of hypertension, diabetes, respiratory system disease, and cardiovascular disease, are at a higher risk of infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The vaccine is the most attractive approach to combat SARS viruses and treat infected patients. Scientists and physicians are relentlessly working together worldwide to investigate and decode the exact source of infection, structure, modes of transmission, and immunopathogenic characteristics as well as the most effective treatment strategy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Thus, given the current scenario, where we lack an effective and approved vaccine, and the available potential drugs are still under trials, it is important to look for all possible treatment strategies to cure the infected populations.
