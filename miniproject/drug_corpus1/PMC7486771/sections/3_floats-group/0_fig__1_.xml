 <caption>
  <p>Similar age pattern of COVID-19 mortality by region. (
   <italic>A</italic>) Unnormalized age-specific mortality, calculated as the ratio of deaths by age to population by age. The levels should not be interpreted as reflecting real differences in mortality because of unaccounted variation in time scale, stage of the epidemic, and the extent of spread within the region. (
   <italic>B</italic>) Normalized rates, dividing each regionâ€™s rates by the sum of these rates, allow comparison of the age pattern. The average is calculated across all regions. Exponential increase at a rate of 0.11 is plotted to intersect the average in the age group 70 to 79 y. 
   <italic>A</italic> and 
   <italic>B</italic>, 
   <italic>Lower</italic> show the same data as 
   <italic>A</italic> and 
   <italic>B</italic>, 
   <italic>Upper</italic> but in logarithmic scale. (For sources, see main text
