<p>It is very difficult to evaluate the cost of measures taken to mitigate the epidemic. The various public transfer programs that have been enacted are redistributions rather than net social costs, although they will entail further redistributions as government debt is serviced in the future. The net societal economic cost of the public measures taken to mitigate the epidemic is the loss of gross domestic product (GDP) due to these measures. Estimating the net cost is an active area of work (

Not all of this decline can be attributed to societal choices to slow the spread of the virus, because the economy would also suffer—perhaps even more—if the virus were uncontrolled. But even if we assign all of the drop in GDP to measures taken to save lives, the economic costs of the actions society has taken appear to be appropriate for the scale of the crisis.
