<p>The loss of future life seems very small when compared to all of the years remaining. One way to put the years of remaining life lost from an epidemic into perspective is to consider them relative to the person years lost from mortality in a “normal” nonepidemic year. This calculation accounts for the number and age of deaths from the epidemic and weights them by the loss of remaining person years, comparing the result to the person years lost in a comparable nonepidemic year.</p>
