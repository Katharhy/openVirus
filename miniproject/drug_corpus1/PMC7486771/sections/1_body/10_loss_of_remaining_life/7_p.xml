<p>Using this metric, we estimated the average age of death and computed the comparative loss of life from COVID-19 relative to the Spanish flu, the HIV epidemic, and the recent opioid epidemic according to three different measurements. For COVID-19 we show scenarios for 1 million and 250,000 deaths. In

 <italic>Middle</italic>, which takes population size into account, Spanish flu emerges as having produced the largest increase in per capita mortality rates. Taking the age of those who die into account and their remaining life expectancy,
