 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows such calculations for different epidemiological forecasts for the United States in terms of temporary aging, assuming a 3-mo window of epidemic mortality and

 </inline-formula>. We provide a range from as low as 125,000—the midrange of the CDC (2020) summarized projections to June 27—to a high of 2 million, a bit less than the estimate of an uncontrolled epidemic (
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The estimates in 
 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> tell us that a scenario of 1 million COVID-19 deaths over the course of 3 mo exposes a 30-y old to the risks of a 38.5-y old in normal times and exposes an 80-y old to the risks of an 88.5-y old in normal times. The same numbers of years of temporary aging, however, pose different absolute increases in risk. For the 30-y old, the absolute increase in mortality would be small, but for the 80-y old it would be large. Considering mortality risk in this manner allows, we believe, accurate communication of risk and understanding of the limited risk to the young and the much greater risk to the elderly. However, this approach has its limits, applying neither to children nor, probably, to the oldest old.
