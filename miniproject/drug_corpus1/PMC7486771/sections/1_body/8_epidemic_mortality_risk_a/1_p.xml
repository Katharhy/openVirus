<p content-type="flushleft">We can translate the elevated risk of mortality during an epidemic into a measure of “temporary aging.” This measure expresses the increased risk of an individual during the months of the epidemic in terms of the age of someone with equivalent mortality during normal, nonepidemic times. If 
 <inline-formula>
  <math id="i5">
   <mi>R</mi>
  </math>
 </inline-formula> is the ratio of mortality during the epidemic to normal mortality and 
 <inline-formula>
  <math id="i6">
   <mi>β</mi>
  </math>
 </inline-formula> is the exponential rate of increase of all-cause mortality with age, then the years of implied temporary aging will be 
 <inline-formula>
  <math id="i7">
   <mi>log</mi>

    </mrow>
    <mo>)</mo>
   </mrow>
   <mo>/</mo>
   <mi>β</mi>
  </math>
 </inline-formula>. For example, if there were 1 million COVID-19 deaths within a 3-mo period when only 750,000 deaths would normally occur, and if 
 <inline-formula>
  <math id="i8">
   <mi>β</mi>
   <mo>=</mo>
   <mn>0.10</mn>
  </math>
 </inline-formula>, then the years of temporary aging would be 
 <inline-formula>
  <math id="i9">
   <mi>log</mi>
   <mrow>
    <mo>(</mo>
    <mrow>
     <mn>1.75</mn>

   <mo>/</mo>
   <mn>0.1</mn>
   <mo>=</mo>
   <mn>8.5</mn>

 </inline-formula>. This same effect applies across the range of ages when mortality is increasing at this rate, approximately from ages 30 to 85 y.
