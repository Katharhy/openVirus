<p>A further contribution of this paper is to show that the age pattern of deaths, when appropriately adjusted, is quite similar across a wide range of countries and stages of the epidemic. Indeed, the increase in mortality by age from COVID-19 strongly resembles the age pattern of all-cause mortality. Whereas all-cause mortality tends to follow Gompertzâ€™s law, increasing exponentially at a constant rate of about 10%/y of age, COVID-19 mortality increases at about 11%/y of age. There is some variation across populations, but this too seems to echo background mortality. The age profile of COVID-19 mortality may change over time, as treatment becomes more (or less) available. However, the age gradient we see to date suggests that the risk factors for COVID-19 are similar to those for all causes of death.</p>
