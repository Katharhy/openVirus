<p>The epidemic is much more dangerous for the elderly than for the young. The most commonly reported age-specific measure is the “case fatality rate” (CFR), which is the ratio of COVID-19 deaths to diagnosed cases by age. There are challenges in the classification and reporting of COVID-19 deaths, in particular whether the coverage is restricted to hospitals or also includes deaths occurring at home or in nursing homes. But the bigger problem in relying on the CFR is the measurement of the denominator, the number of cases. Cases can be defined within hospital systems or within a testing regime, but neither approach is a reliable indicator of the actual number of infected individuals at the population level.</p>
