<p>For each country, we calculate (unnormalized) age-specific death rates (ASDR) using reported COVID-19 deaths by age and the population by age, typically for the nation as a whole (

 </xref>). Since the epidemic may be concentrated in one part of the country, and since some countries may be at earlier stages with fewer reported deaths, these ASDR may be extremely low in some countries and much higher in others, which does not necessarily signal a more or less severe epidemic and should not be so interpreted. Instead, we believe that the most reliable information is the shape or pattern by age of death rates, abstracting from the level. To make the age pattern comparable across populations, we normalize each countryâ€™s rates by dividing by the sum of the rates, so that the normalized rates sum to 1.0. We can see that the age patterns are quite similar across the eight countries (
