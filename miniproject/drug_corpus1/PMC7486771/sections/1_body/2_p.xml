<p>Our intention here is not to provide new forecasts of COVID-19 mortality. Instead, we combine existing projections with observations to date about the age pattern of mortality, producing an estimated age profile of COVID-19 mortality. This age profile, which can be scaled up or down, enables estimation of the epidemicâ€™s impact on period life expectancy and loss of person years of life at a population scale, as well as comparison with past epidemics.</p>
