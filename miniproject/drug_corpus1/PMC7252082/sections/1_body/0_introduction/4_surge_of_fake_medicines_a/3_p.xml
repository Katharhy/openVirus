<p id="p0045">Another equally pressing and parallel emergency is medication information overload and misinformation surrounding COVID-19. The WHO has described that the outbreak of and response to COVID-19 “has been accompanied by a massive ‘infodemic’ – an over-abundance of information.” An ‘infodemic’ refer to the perils of excessive volume of information in relation to COVID-19 (including false prevention measures or cures) that pose concerns for the public to distinguish fact from fiction, and for government agencies to conduct evidence-based policy-making. As COVID-19 turns into a full-fledged global public health crisis, several unsubstantiated claims regarding cures and transmission and/or exposure have taken hold on the internet and social media. Such misinformation and conjecture are of great concern as they represent a serious challenge in tackling the pandemic. Moreover, medication misinformation in the absence of scientific validation can potentially spread unnecessary fear and panic, undermining the public's willingness to follow legitimate public health advices and to take proven precautionary measures.
