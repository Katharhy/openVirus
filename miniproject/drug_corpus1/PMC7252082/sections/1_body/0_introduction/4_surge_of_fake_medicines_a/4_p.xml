<p id="p0050">The current rush to search for the magic drug without adequate safety guarantees has already become a source of medication-related misinformation, causing public confusion and panic. A classic example is the recent media announcements that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are the “game changers” and potential cure for COVID-19, prompting inappropriate stockpiling and use by the public. Inappropriate stockpiling of hydroxychloroquine has also resulted in substantial shortages affecting arthritis or lupus patients— conditions for which it has been proven effective.
