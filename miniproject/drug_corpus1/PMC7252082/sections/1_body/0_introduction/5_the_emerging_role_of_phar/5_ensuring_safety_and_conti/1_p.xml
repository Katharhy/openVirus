<p id="p0075">Pharmacists provide an essential public service in the supply of medicines and pharmaceutical care and continuing these services without interruption is even more important during the pandemic. In addition to continuing these essential services, pharmacists are empowered with extended capabilities to reduce the burden on general practitioners and support social distancing and self-isolation measures employed by the authorities. National, state and territory governments have put in place continued dispensing arrangements providing authority to pharmacists for the ongoing supply of medicines without a prescription until 30 June 2020.

 </xref> This has increased responsibility of pharmacists to monitor and follow up patients, at times in liaison with their medical practitioner. In order to promote social distancing and self-isolation especially in vulnerable patients, home delivery services for Medicare subsidised medicines are implemented by the Department of Health. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the PSA in liaison with health authorities have provided guidance to pharmacies on how to set up these services. This programme has leveraged a previously existing payment process for pharmacy services. In addition, there is ongoing work in liaison with pharmacists, general practitioners, and state and territory authorities to enable therapeutic substitution by pharmacists in the event of a shortage. This will allow community pharmacists to substitute dose strength or form without prior approval from the prescriber, if a prescribed medicine is not available at the time of dispensing. These measures highlight the important role pharmacists can play in enabling and maintaining access to medicines for people in need throughout the COVID-19 outbreak.
