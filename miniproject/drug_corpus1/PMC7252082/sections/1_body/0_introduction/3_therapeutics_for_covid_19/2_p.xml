<p id="p0025">The drugs under investigation aim to do either of two things: kill the virus or limit the severity of the disease to increase chances of survival. Their antiviral activities are produced by targeting one or more of the proteins that are essential for SARS-CoV-2 to bind and cause infection. To have a greater understanding of these potential drugs, it is imperative to understand how the virus works and its mechanism of transmission. SARS-CoV-2 is a ribonucleic acid 
 <italic>β</italic>-coronavirus and, like SARS and MERS, encodes non-structural proteins (such as 3-chemotrypsin-like protease, helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), structural proteins like spike glycoprotein and other accessary proteins.

 </xref> Another human protein, TMPRSS2, cleaves the spike protein, allowing the virus to fuse with the cell and start to replicate inside it.

 </xref> These proteins are among targets for promising drug candidates currently under investigation for COVID-19 treatment. Importantly, most of these proteins, including the drug binding pockets of this virus, have strong similarity with those observed in SARS and MERS, highlighting the potential use of previously developed small‐molecule therapeutics for COVID-19.
