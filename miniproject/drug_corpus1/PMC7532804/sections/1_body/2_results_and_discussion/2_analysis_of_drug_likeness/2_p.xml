<p id="p0065">The inhibition properties of probe molecule choline have been studied through SWISS ADME software to determine physicochemical descriptors and to predict ADME (Adsorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion) parameters: pharmacokinetic properties, drug like nature and medicinal chemistry friendliness 
 <xref rid="b0320" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. From the data mentioned in 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> we can see that choline was satisfying the most prescribed virtual screening properties like Ro5 as it has molecular weight less than 500 g/mol, TPSA values less than 40 Å
 <sup>2</sup>. H-bond donors ≤5, H-bond acceptor 10, synthetic accessibility count between less than 5 so that they can be synthesized easily. It also follows Veber rule that means it satisfies all the bioavailability conditions. Its pharmacokinetics validate its neuroprotective role for the brain development. All medicinal chemistry parameters suggest that choline has no liver cytotoxicity effect in terms or drug induced liver injury for humans, null mutagenicity reveals that choline can cause no abnormal genetic mutations leading to cancer. It has no cardio toxicity also. According to ADMET (
