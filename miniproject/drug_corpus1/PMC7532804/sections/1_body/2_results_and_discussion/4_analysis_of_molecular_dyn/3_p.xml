<p id="p0085">To quantify the strength of interaction between protein and ligand, nonbonded electrostatic interaction plays a vital part. For nonbonded interaction, we are interested mainly on short range electrostatic part. The whole MD simulation is performed under the varying time scale from 10,000 ps to 100 ps. First, we have studied the stability of each structures (host and complex). We have optimized the probe systems by energy minimization process to get the minimum potential energy for both. For energetically stable structures, we obtained steady convergence of potential energy with negative energy minimum and maximum force value (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b). For 6LU7 the computed average energy was −1.27 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> ± 56.7 (kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup>) for E
 <sub>pot</sub>, while for choline: 6LU7 it was −8.2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> ± 38.77 (kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup>). We have observed same order of results (energy, enthalpy, temperature, pressure density, volume, rmsd) both for 6LU7 and choline: 6LU7 complex in both CHARM36 and GROMOS43A2 force fields which justifies the applicability of any one of the force field (SD2a,b). For rest the simulation we have used GROMOS43A2. Further to check the stability of the structures under NVT and NPT equilibrated ensembles, we have tried to compute T, D, P, V of the probe systems within a varying time trajectory 100–10,000 ps. Simulated progression data showed that temperature of each system (receptor, complex) reached to a stable value (298 K) very quickly (within 100 ps) and maintained the stability throughout the whole simulation process for both applied force fields CHARM36 and GROMOS43A2 (cf. 
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> a). This also proved the applicability of both force fields for MD simulation. Same type of stability has been observed for density, pressure, volume throughout the varying time scale (Inset of 
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>a). After running the whole simulation process we have computed several thermodynamics parameters of choline: 6LU7 complex in comparison to bare 6LU7 to understand the possible conformational arrangements during complexation throughout the whole time trajectory. The parameters are RMSD, RMSF, nonbonded interaction energy, hydrogen bonds, R
 <sub>g</sub>, etc. (

 <xref rid="b0335" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. RMSD is used to check the stability of host protein due to ligand binding with respect to the reference backbone structures of protein. 
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>b has shown the RMSD values of carbon backbone for choline: 6LU7 complex with respect to 6LU7 for the time scale trajectory up to 1 ns in 3D view (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>b). For better understanding a 2D diagram is also provided in the inset of 
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>b for larger time trajectory 1–10 ns. It is observed that RMSD for complex showed a variation between 0.14 and 0.26 (±0.01) nm compared to 6LU7 variation 0.12–0.18 (±0.01) nm which indicate the possibility of structure fluctuation during choline binding. The larger fluctuation in complex structure mainly arises between 7.5 ns and 10 ns time scale. Still the closeness between the average RMSD values of complex (0.18 nm) with host 6LU7 (0.16 nm) validated the stable docked choline: 6LU7 formation. Flatness in the 3D contour plot suggest that CL
 <sup>pro</sup> has shown no significant change in presence of choline during time resolved simulation. The contour plot also revealed steady phase of RMSD after 1 ns of the time trajectory. Similarly for RMSF, residue fluctuations of 6LU7 in complex were found to be very small with respect to the 6LU7 in terms of C
 <sub>α</sub> carbon. Closeness and less fluctuations in RMSF values suggest that choline: 6LU7 docked complex structure has not affected the host protein structure which remained mostly unaltered during simulation (SD3). To check it further we have analyzed the radial distribution function g(r) of choline and water around protein backbone which gives an average picture of the distribution of water or choline around the protein. The g(r) values of water and choline are presented in SD4. Figure SD4 suggests that water has a sharp increment at ~0.44 nm of the protein backbone. Beside this water shows a steady increment throughout the radial distribution. Whereas in presence of choline a sudden increment of peak height is observed. This sudden increment is definitely due to the repulsion between water and choline molecules. The change may be due to the fact that choline tries to preserve the compactness of the protein structure by repealing the water molecules towards protein backbone. The fact justifies the lower interaction possibility of choline with protein backbone.
