<p id="p0090">To justify the above fact, we have computed Kirkwood G factor (SD 5) of water or choline around the protein backbone. Variation of Kirkwood G factor validate the net decrease in protein- choline interaction compared to protein-water interaction. Increment of G factor in protein-water clearly indicates increase of water density around protein. Similarly decrement of G factor in choline-protein indicates the influence of choline on the dynamics of water as water density around protein increases and so choline gets excluded from the protein backbone.</p>
