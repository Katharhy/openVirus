<p id="p0095">The radius of gyration (R

 <xref rid="b0340" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Variation of R
 <sub>g</sub> values over the whole-time trajectory showed that the host 6LU7 and choline: 6LU7 complex showed a quite stable and compressed structures without lacking any major expansion/contraction throughout the simulation period. Both complex and base protein structures have reported

 <xref rid="b0345" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. Favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine are also expected to show similar compactness due to their similar type of binding affinity towards 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> protease as per Ref. 
 <xref rid="b0350" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. The value of Remdisivir exactly matches with the average

 </italic> value obtained for choline. This justifies the candidature of choline as a proposed CoV2 inhibitor. Similarly, SASA measures the area of receptor exposure to the solvents during the simulation process. In present study for 6LU7, SASA value was obtained between 19 and 26 nm
 <sup>2</sup> with a mean value of 22 nm
 <sup>2</sup> whereas for choline: 6LU7 complex, it was observed between 16 and 20 nm
 <sup>2</sup> with a mean value of 19 nm
 <sup>2</sup> (SD7). The closeness of the observed SASA values of both bare 6LU7 and it complex justified that ligand binding does not affect the folding of the receptor protein very much.
