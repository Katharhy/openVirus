<p id="p0100">Though weaker than ionic and covalent interaction, intermolecular hydrogen bonded interaction is a predominant contributor for complex formation. 3.5 Å cut-off condition has been used to find number of hydrogen bonds. In the present study we have observed a variation of number of hydrogen bonding between 0 and 6 throughout the whole-time trajectory with an average value of ±2.6 (SD8). Obtained numbers perfectly matches with the molecular docking results and further validate the stability of choline: 6LU7 complexation. Short-range nonbonded interaction energy used to quantify the strength of the interaction between components of a complex. For the present case we have presented the variation of short-range Coulombic interaction energy and short-range Lennard-Jones interaction energy versus time (0–10,000 ps) for choline: 6LU7 complex and presented in 3D

 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Energy values showed a stable nature up to 7000 ps of time scale data. Computed data revealed the less effect of binding affinity due to Coulombic interaction energy (−50.776 ± 20.12 kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup>) compared to Lennard-Jones interaction energy (−95.26 ± 22.10 kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup>). Time resolved variation of energy values are also found to match perfectly with the RMSDs of the complex for full time scale region.
