<p id="p0105">To establish the stronger ligand binding affinities towards receptor we have applied the MM/PBSA method which deals with net free binding energy (ΔG) change as a sum of comprehensive set of energies of individual components. Molecular docking only suggests the binding energy of the complex while ΔG indicates the nonbonding interaction energies of the binding region for the complex formation. The average MM/PBSA free binding energy (ΔG
 <sub>bind</sub>) of choline in complex was obtained as −33.497 kJ/mol which is good enough due to its well binding affinity towards SARS-CoV2 protease. The Van der Waal energy (E
 <sub>vdw</sub>) component (−34.656 kJ/mol) also showed very good binding affinity of choline towards 6LU7 whereas electrostatic energy (E
 <sub>electrostatic</sub>) did not show any significant role (−7.380 kJ/mol) in the complexation process. The variation of all energies needed for ΔG (energy in vacuum, polar and nonpolar solvation energies) is described in

 <sub>bind</sub> in the whole-time trajectory. All the MD simulation results reported in this work and summarized above validate that choline can make an impressively stable complex with SARS-Cov2 protein after binding to the active sites of this 3CL
