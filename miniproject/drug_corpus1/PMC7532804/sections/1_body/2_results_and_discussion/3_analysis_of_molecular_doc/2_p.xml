<p id="p0070">For receptor protein: 6LU7 and potential inhibitor: choline, docking result showed best 9 suitable pose structures for the choline: 6LU7 complex with their RMSD/ub (upper bound) and RMSD/lb (lower bound) variations. For pose 1 we obtained highest negative value of binding energy (−3.7 kcal/mol), lowest value of complex driending energy (104.198), and lowest value of inhibition constant (k
 <sub>i</sub> = 1.92 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> M) at room temperature (298 K) as the best fit structure of ligand: receptor complex (

 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> ). We have repeated the docking simulation several times and got the variation in binding affinity for the best pose structure in between −3.7 kcal/mol to −3.4 kcal/mol. Usually, the dreiding energy values for individual protein and ligand are found to be different, but when they form complex the dreiding energy of the complex is found to be smaller than that of the individual protein and ligand. The complex structure having minimum dreiding energy corresponds to the most favourable structure

 <sub>i</sub> value is far lower than the toxicity dose range of choline (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) which validate the strong candidature of choline as a proposed drug for CoV2 infection. Maximum value of dipole moment (5.374 debye) for pose 1 also validate the possibility of better complexation between choline and 6LU7 which arises due to the existence of strong electrostatic interaction (attractive type) between 6LU7 residue GLU166 and positively charged nitrogen (N1) of choline. Again, the weak hydrogen bonded interactions have significant role in defining the stability of protein: ligand complex as larger the number of nonbonded interactions the more is the possibility of binding affinity in ligand: protein complexation and so the possibility of formation of complex structure 
 <xref rid="b0330" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. Maximum number of weak interactions (both conventional hydrogen bonds and carbon hydrogen bonds) were observed for pose 1 of docked structure between 6LU7 (Residues: GLY143, LEU141, HIS163, PHE140, ASN142) and choline (atoms: O1, H15, C4, C2, C3) (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a, b, 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In supporting document1 (SD1) we have presented the data for the two more suitable nearest docked poses which justifies the choice of pose 1 as best pose structure. So molecular docking results indicate that choline can be easily inhibited inside the favourable pocket of 6LU7 protein and can form a stable choline: 6LU7 complex by strong electrostatic bonding and weak hydrogen bonding between them. Existence of strong interaction between choline and 6LU7 have been established by MD simulation results in next section.
