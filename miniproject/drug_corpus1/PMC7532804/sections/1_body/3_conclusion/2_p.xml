<p id="p0110">CoV2 infection is anticipated to affect fetal development in a manner similar to other respiratory viruses which are known to be responsible for the maternal inflammatory response on the fetus and placenta. Earlier studies have established that if would be mother gets infected by a respiratory coronaviruses during early pregnancy, higher prenatal choline level in her body can safeguard the developing brain of the fetus from the adverse effects of CoV2 infection. There are many natural recourses of choline (e.g., vegetables, egg, milk, whole grains, herbal plants). Our ADME analysis (physiochemical, pharmacokinetics, drug likeness, medicinal chemistry) have found a strong inhibitory possibility of choline for SARS-CoV2 protease 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. Molecular docking results with strong binding binding affinity, lowest inhibition constant and existence of hydrogen bonded interaction have established the possibility of existence of choline: 6LU7 complex structure. Various thermodynamic parameters (E
 <sub>pot</sub>, T, V, D, R
 <sub>g</sub>, SASA energy, interaction energies, Î”G
 <sub>bind</sub>) obtained by Molecular dynamics simulation have validated the complexation between choline and CoV2 protein (6LU7). Summarizing all simulated output and interpreting their analysis have helped us to establish choline as a strong candidate to be used as a potential inhibitor for SARS-CoV2. We believe that our present in silico study would provide a lead for the prenatal drug development for the treatment of COVID-19. Still to efficiently target CoV2 infections, production of high quality concentrated choline extract and in vivo, in vitro experimental validation of the present work and clinical studies are defensible.
