<p id="p0045">Molecular docking which performs energy minimization and binding energy calculations, is one of the most applied simulation mechanisms used to predict the potential drug-target interactions. It can identify the best orientation/pose of ligand towards host protein. Docking algorithms with the help of some scoring functions are used to identify the suitable ligand conformation at energy minimized state 
 <xref rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Molecular docking can predict whether the ligand/drug is docked with the receptor protein/DNA or not and show the results in the form of rankings of docked compounds which are dependent on lower binding energy. The algorithm of AutoDock Vina with some best fitted configuration parameters (binding modes- 9, exhaustiveness – 8, energy difference- 3 kcal/mol, Gridbox center with coordinate x, y, and z of residue position of the target protein) is used to do the docking-based studies on the suggested inhibitor onto the protease of CoV-2

 <xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> and ready to be used for docking. After simulation, the pose showing maximum nonbonded interactions, dipole moment with minimum binding affinity (kcal/mol), drieding energy, inhibition constant was chosen as the best ligand: protein complex structure. Another criteria of choosing best ligand: protein pose is identifying the types and number of bonding between them. The metabolite which makes maximum number of H-bonds, electrostatic bonds with the receptor protein mostly show better capability to form ligand: protein complex.
