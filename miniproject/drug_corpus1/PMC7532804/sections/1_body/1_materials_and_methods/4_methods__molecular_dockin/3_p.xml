<p id="p0050">MD simulation results helped us to investigate the structural dynamics of protein: ligand interactions. LINUX based platform ‘‘GROMACS 5.1 Package’’ 
 <xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref> with CHARMM36 all atom 
 <xref rid="b0285" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref> and GROMOS43A2 force fields 
 <xref rid="b0290" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref> are used for determination of various thermodynamic parameters like potential energy (E
 <sub>pot</sub>), temperature (T), density progression (D), radius of gyration (R
 <sub>g</sub>), root mean square deviation (RMSD) for backbone, root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) for protein C
 <sub>α</sub> backbone, solvent accessible surface area (SASA), hydrogen bonds, interaction energies of the proposed ligand: protein complex. CHARMM36 is all atom type which is additive in nature including parameters for proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates and drug-like biomolecules. Here the atomic partial charges are derived from quantum chemical calculations of the interactions between model compounds and water. Whereas GROMOS43A2 is a united atom force field without explicit aliphatic (non-polar) hydrogens applied mainly for biomolecular system. Here the smallest interacting unit is group of atoms of the system. Choline was optimized by Gaussian 9.0 by Density Functional Theory (DFT) with the basis set 6.31G (d,p)

 <xref rid="b0300" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. TIP3P water model and steepest descent algorithm has been used for energy minimization of the system in two steps each with varying time (1–10 ns) for 500,000 iteration steps with a cut-off up to 1000 kJmol
 <sup>−1</sup> for reducing the steric clashes. For the present work we have decided to stick upto 10 ns simulation since we have observed that within 10 ps of the time scale trajectory, both 6LU7 and choline: 6LU7 have reached to it stability. In first step, a boundary condition of constant number of particles (N), volume (V), and temperature (T) has been applied and in second step, it was constant NPT (particle numbers, pressure, temperature) under the pressure of 1 atmosphere and temperature 298 K. For the nonbonded interactions, short range Lennard-Jones and Coulomb interaction have been used. After final step of each simulation, obtained trajectories and results were analyzed using the graphical tool Origin pro. Detailed major information of MD simulation, docking, virtual screening study with constituents, time required, salvation box length etc are same as our previous work
