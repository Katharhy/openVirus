<p id="p0040">Corona virus encodes large number of structural and nonstructural polyproteins. Among them some polyproteins become cleaved and transformed themselves into some mature nonstructural protein by protease 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> which is a key to SARS-CoV enzyme 
 <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> is responsible for controlling functions replication and transcription processes by its spike (S) glycoprotein 
 <xref rid="b0250" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. S enters the host cell and from the viral surface it forms homo trimers. After entering it interacts strongly with the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor and replicates itself through some cyclic processes 
 <xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Targeting 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> protease may constitute a valid approach for anti COVID drug designing. 3D structure of one of the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> like protease protein is reported by X-Ray crystallographic data (PDBID: 6LU7) 
 <xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a). We have checked the inhibiting and binding possibilities of this natural 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> like protease protein substrate in order to find the effectiveness of choline against COVID-19 in the present work. The structure of 6LU7 was downloaded from the “Protein Data Bank” (

 <xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. The inbuilt ligands were removed from 6LU7 using Discovery studio 2020 (Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA) 
 <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> and the output structure was subsequently cleaned and saved in PDB format.
