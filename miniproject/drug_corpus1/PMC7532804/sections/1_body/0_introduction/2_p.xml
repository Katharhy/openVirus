<p id="p0025">A pandemic situation which has risen from the COVID-19 disease caused by a member of the coronavirus family of viruses, namely SARS-CoV2 is now been faced by the whole world. As coronaviruses are well known from last few decades, it’s already understood that these viruses have specific enveloped RNA which can be the reason for various respiratory illnesses like common cold to fatal pneumonia of varying severity 
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. It was first found in domestic poultry in 1930s, and it was later recognized as cause of respiratory, liver, gastrointestinal, and neurologic diseases in animals 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Seven categories of coronaviruses are known, out of which four can only cause mild illness with symptom of common cold to the healthy human being. Severe lower respiratory tract infections and pneumonia for infants, immune-compromised patients and older people 
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> can be caused by these viruses in very rare cases. The rest three categories: SARS-CoV (identified in 2003) 
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, MERS-CoV (identified in 2012) 
 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and SARS-CoV2 (identified in 2019) 
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> can cause severe respiratory infections which can sometimes become fatal to the humans. Devastating and deadly outbreaks of SARS-CoV2 have already been observed in December 2019 in Wuhan, China 
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The virus has been observed to spread worldwide within a few weeks of its appearance and to reveal its global presence by showing symptoms of respiratory illness (both acute and severe) caused by it 
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. It was soon realized that in addition to usual respiratory problems, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death can also be caused by this virus. It’s observed fact that the risk of death and\or serious symptoms due to COVID-19 increases in older people and in patients with other serious medical issues including obesity, diabetes, and heart, lung, kidney or liver disease 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The outcome of the above mentioned severity can progress to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, multi organ failure, and death 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. CoV2s are zoonotic pathogens in nature which usually appear in animals first. Due to the similarities of 79% and 96% for complete genome sequence recognition rates of SARS-CoV and bat SARS-CoV (SARSr-COV-RaTG13) it’s suggested that bats may be the hosts of CoV viruses 
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Similarly, for CoV2 there may exist original, intermediate and final hosts and so the disease may transfer from infected animal to human. For SARS-CoV2, person-to-person transmission is the easier way to spread the disease which can happen easily through infected secretions mainly via respiratory droplets, surface contaminated and possibly by aerosol transmission. Research outputs obtained till now have led to the conclusion that this virus can easily be transmited by symptomatic, asymptomatic and presymptomatic patients 
 <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. As per latest reports, COVID-19 patients are mainly treated by providing supportive treatment only 
 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Around 200 FDA approved drugs and vaccines through clinical trials have been registered. Some investigational antiviral drugs like: Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Hydrochloroquine, Chloroquine, etc. have been in use for patients with severe symptoms 
 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However, toxicities associated with these drugs have already created some major fatal health issues 
 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Alternatively, some Immunomodulatory therapy by including convalescent plasma also are in use but as per today, specific drugs and vaccines to fight against COVID-19 are yet to be discovered or are still under development. As a part of this development, some particular nutrient food supplements and herbal medicines which specifically have some antiviral, immunomodulatory activities against different viruses like influenza, HIV, other coronaviruses can be considered with the aim of promoting the use of dietary therapy, hard immunity and herbal medicine as an alternative of COVID-19 therapies 
 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. A set of research works have already suggested that nutrient food supplements and herbs possess a potential antiviral ability, hard immunity against SARS-CoV2 
 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.
