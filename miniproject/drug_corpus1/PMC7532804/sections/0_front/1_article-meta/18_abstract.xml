 <p>Prenatal COVID infection is one of the worst affected and least attended aspects of the COVID-19 disease. Like other coronaviruses, CoV2 infection is anticipated to affect fetal development by maternal inflammatory response on the fetus and placenta. Studies showed that higher prenatal choline level in motherâ€™s body can safeguard the developing brain of the fetus from the adverse effects of CoV2 infection. Choline is commonly used as food supplement. By virtual screening, molecular docking and molecular dynamics techniques, we have established a strong inhibitory possibility of choline for SARS 3CL
  <sup>pro</sup> protease which may provide a lead for prenatal COVID-19 treatment.
