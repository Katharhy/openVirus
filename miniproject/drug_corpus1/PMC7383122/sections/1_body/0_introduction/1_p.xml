<p id="Par2">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has evolved into a global health crisis. The full spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans is not fully understood yet, but is being heavily studied. Patients with previously established comorbidities such as heart failure (HF) are at a particularly high risk of morbidity and mortality from this viral infection. In this review, we explore the risks associated with COVID-19 infection in HF patients and address unique aspects related to HF management in the acute and chronic settings when complicating the infection itself.
