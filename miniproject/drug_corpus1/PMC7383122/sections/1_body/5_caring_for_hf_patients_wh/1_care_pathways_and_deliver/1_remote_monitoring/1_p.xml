<p id="Par19">The Heart Failure Society of America released a statement addressing how the care for HF patients has changed in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Outpatient clinic visits are reduced in order to minimize patients’ exposure and transmission of the disease. This is paralleled by establishing virtual visits through video calls to ensure that the wide spectrum of HF patients and even mechanical circulatory support and heart transplant are still followed up properly and safely. This type of patients’ follow-up represents a win-win situation for both physicians and patients in the setting of a pandemic, and seems to be associated with better compliance with follow-up appointments. Gorodeski et al. evaluated no-show rates of HF patients in the HF clinic 7 days post-hospitalization and compared personal with virtual visits rates of 51% versus 34.6%, respectively. No significant differences in hospital readmission, emergency room visits, or death were observed between the two groups [

Although full physical examination cannot be conducted through virtual visits, it is feasible to inspect for clinical signs of volume overload such as lower extremity edema, or even jugular venous distention, which have been previously reported to correlate with invasive monitoring [

When these are accompanied with home monitoring and charting of daily weights and vitals including heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation can all aid in assessing symptoms as well as guide any potential medication adjustments and up-titration. More assessments could be done, including exercise intolerance and NYHA functional classification.
