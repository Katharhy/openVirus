<p id="Par30">Early case reports of COVID-19 infections in LVAD patients highlighted refractory hypoxemia leading to tracheostomy, and right ventricular failure leading to multi-organ dysfunction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. An important management issue in these cases was the limited implementation of prone ventilation, a technique known to be beneficial in managing ARDS with a refractory hypoxemia, due to fears that the outflow graft and/or the driveline may be compressed in such position, or that it would impair venous return, thus worsening RV hemodynamics resulting in progressive HF.
