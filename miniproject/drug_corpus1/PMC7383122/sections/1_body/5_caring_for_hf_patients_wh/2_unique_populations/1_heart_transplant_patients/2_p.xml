<p id="Par25">When infected by the virus, immunosuppression may influence the typical clinical presentation of COVID-19 patients who are also heart transplant recipients, resulting in unusual symptoms such as gastrointestinal manifestations [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. The clinical picture in reported cases from China was accompanied by mild to severe symptoms at presentation, typical imaging findings, and identical laboratory findings with the exception of higher C-reactive protein (CRP) and lower lymphocyte counts compared with non-heart transplant patients. Reported cases from a European transplantation center showed that solid organ recipients with COVID-19 had a more severe clinical course and high complications rates when compared with the general populations [

A recent case series of 28 heart transplant recipients and a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 from New York reported an alarmingly high casa fatality rate of 25%. However, it is important to note here that the median age of these patients was 64 years (interquartile range (IQR), 53.5–70.5 years) and more than half of them already had cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). The approach to treatment followed in these patients included reducing immunosuppression in most of these patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. This also brings up the question as to the best strategy of treatment for this unique population.
