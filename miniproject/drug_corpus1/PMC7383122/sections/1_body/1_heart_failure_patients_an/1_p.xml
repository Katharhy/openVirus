<p id="Par3">In addition to older age, chronic comorbidities increase the risk of severe COVID-19 infection as well as its fatality. The overall global mortality rate of around 6.9% in COVID-19 is already significantly higher than that reported for the seasonal flu [

Based on earlier analyses, cardiovascular disease (CVD) was statistically more prevalent in patients who die from the infection; a recent study from China that included 416 patients showed that 19% had signs of previous cardiac damage (defined as blood levels of cardiac biomarkers, namely high-sensitivity troponin I (hs-TNI) above the 99th-percentile upper reference limit of normal) and these patients were significantly more likely to experience mortality (51.2% vs 4.5%;

A more recent large global observational study that included 169 hospitals from three continents and close to 9000 patients found coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure (mortality of 15.3%, vs. 5.6% among those without heart failure; CI, 1.62 to 3.79) as independent predictors of in-hospital death [
