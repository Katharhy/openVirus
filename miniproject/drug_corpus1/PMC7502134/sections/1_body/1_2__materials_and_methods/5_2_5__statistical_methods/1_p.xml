<p>The number of waves required to reach equilibrium, the homophily of the main variables, and their crude and adjusted estimates were calculated with RDSATÂ® (version 7.1.46). A number of waves of less than six and a homophily around zero for key parameters, such as HCV or HIV serostatus, were used to assess the RDS validity. All seeds were included in the analysis.</p>
