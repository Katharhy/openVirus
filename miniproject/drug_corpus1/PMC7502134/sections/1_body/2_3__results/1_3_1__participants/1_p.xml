<p>Among the 5075 coupons issued, 1490 coupons were returned (29.4%). Each seed recruited between zero and three participants, and there were 16 waves of recruitment. We encountered some challenges during participant recruitment. These included a few attempts of duplicated participation detected by the fingerprint device, enhanced police enforcement limiting possibilities for PWID to meet in public areas/hotspots and distribute coupons, and finally a typhoon which interrupted the study process for two days. In all, 1380 participants were enrolled and analyzed. The participant flowchart is presented in
