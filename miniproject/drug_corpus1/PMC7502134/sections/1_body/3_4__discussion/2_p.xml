<p>PWID in profile 1 were all at-risk drinkers. Although it was not demonstrated by our data, possibly due to underreporting, alcohol use is known to be associated with disinhibited behaviors and risk-taking practices [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Alcohol use should be systematically assessed among PWID, and brief intervention should be offered to all at-risk drinkers [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. PWID in profile 4 were mainly characterized by methamphetamine use (96%) which is also associated with sex- or drug-related risk practices. Nevertheless, in our study, very few PWID were injecting methamphetamines; it was almost exclusively smoked. Indeed, risks could then rather be related to inappropriate practices when injecting heroin during methamphetamine rush, unsafe sex, and also HCV transmission when sharing pipes with lip burns. These PWID were more often female, injecting more frequently, and more often polydrug users. Most women who inject drugs are sex workers, and CBO members reported that polydrug use with clients was a common practice among sex workers. These findings are consistent with a study conducted in Tijuana, Mexico, where stimulant smoking was associated with polydrug use and transactional sex [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In contrast with our study, highlighting that unsafe sex was not frequent in this profile, it was associated with high-risk sexual behavior in the Mexican setting. Interventions should probably target information on methamphetamine use, prevention of psychiatric disorders related to methamphetamine use, and prevention of transition to methamphetamine injection. The other two profiles (profiles 3 and 5) exhibit lower risk profiles. It should be noticed that among PWID in profile 5, very few reported sexual intercourse with casual partners, but they had the highest rate of unprotected sex with their primary partner. Screening and awareness for the primary partner should be proposed.
