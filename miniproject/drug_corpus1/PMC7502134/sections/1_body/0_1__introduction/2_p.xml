<p>Mental health disorders among PWID are often associated with the severity of substance use disorder and higher risk practices [

However, promising mental health community-based interventions have been described elsewhere, including group interpersonal psychotherapy, counseling sessions at home, and community reentry programs [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As in many countries, these PWID interventions are copied from those elaborated in other settings and delivered according to a “one-fits-all” approach. This may not address the wide diversity of PWID [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] as well as the different settings, particularly in middle-income countries where access to specialized care (addiction treatment, psychiatric care, and harm reduction settings) is limited. HCV control mainly based on harm reduction towards safer injection practices stands as a good example, but this concern also applies to all other interventions implemented for PWID. Since these interventions are mainly led by peers within small groups of PWID, an approach tailored to the specific risks may make a difference [
