 <p id="Par1">Coronaviruses (CoVs) are highly diverse single-stranded RNA viruses owing to their susceptibility to numerous genomic mutations and recombination. Such viruses involve human and animal pathogens including the etiologic agents of acute respiratory tract illnesses: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the highly morbific SARS-CoV-2. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an emerging disease with a quick rise in infected cases and deaths, was recently identified causing a worldwide pandemic. COVID-19 disease outcomes were found to increase in elderly and patients with a compromised immune system. Evidences indicated that the main culprit behind COVID-19 deaths is the cytokine storm, which is illustrated by an uncontrolled over-production of soluble markers of inflammation. The regulation process of coronavirus pathogenesis through molecular mechanism comprise virus-host interactions linked to viral entry, replication and transcription, escape, and immune system control. Recognizing coronavirus infections and COVID-19 through epigenetics lens will lead to potential alteration in gene expression thus limiting coronavirus infections. Focusing on epigenetic therapies reaching clinical trials, clinically approved epigenetic-targeted agents, and combination therapy of antivirals and epigenetic drugs is currently considered an effective and valuable approach for viral replication and inflammatory overdrive control.</p>
