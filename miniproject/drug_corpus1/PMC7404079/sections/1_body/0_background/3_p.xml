<p id="Par92">As outbreaks can ensue rapidly worldwide, it is quite necessary to emphasize on novel therapeutic approaches. Although investment in biomedical and pharmaceutical research has increased significantly, the annual number of new treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has remained relatively limited [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Generally, the available treatment strategies for emerging coronavirus’ strains, that led to significant pandemics, are inadequate to effectively advance patient’s outcome [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Yet, HCoVs potentially influence the host’s epigenome, and this will aid in discovering new targets for therapeutic interventions to gain more insights for the development of antiviral therapeutics and vaccines [
