<p id="Par97">Understanding fundamental elements of epigenetic regulation is progressively contributing to concepts of viral epigenetic therapeutics. Epigenetic therapies are among the most active areas of research and this is because of their potential specific targeting mechanisms compared to the conventional therapies. Manipulating gene regulatory networks using epidrugs could be associated with a risk generating from the systemic effect of such therapies. Yet, knowing that HCoVs including SARS-CoV-2 may infect more than one cell type it is advantageous to rely on systemically acting agents. Besides, some proposed epigenetic treatments can be site-directed and consequently minimize unwanted systemic risk. Furthermore, it is imperative to spotlight the SARS-CoV-2 direct RNA sequence data including RNA modifications, the viral transcriptome and epitranscriptome as it could anticipate novel-targeted strategies for the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection [

Antiviral therapies targeting the pathogen itself act by inhibiting enzymes responsible for viral genome replication, the viral assembly process, and preventing viral entry by blocking the virus-host receptor binding. Remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, galidesivir, and its salt form (BCX-4430) targeting RdRp; ritonavir and darunavir targeting viral proteases (3CLpro or PLpro) in addition to camostat mesylate which is a serine protease inhibitor directly acting on SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the FDA approved lopinavir/ritonavir as a target of the coronavirus protease enzyme and arbidol (umifenovir) targeting ACE2 and S protein showed efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 as well as chloroquine which possesses an antiviral and an anti-inflammatory effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the primary stages of SARS-CoV epidemic, an empirical treatment of broad spectrum antiviral agents and immunosuppressive doses of steroids were used along with the supportive treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Despite the available treatment options, studies documenting the therapies’ efficacy are lacking especially for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Nevertheless, extending the choices of treatment by generating epigenetic therapies would provide a real improvement to healthcare community struggling to cope during an outbreak of emerging viral infections (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Histone deacetylases (HDACs) resemble a main epigenetic target for the treatment of viral infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Hence, HDACs class III such as SIRT1 and resveratrol have been previously described as antiviral effectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Resveratrol was found to modulate SIRTs’ activity (SIRT 1,2,3,5) especially as a SIRT1 activator, 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), protein kinase C, NF-kB, p53, activator protein 1 (AP-1), early growth regulator 1 (EGR-1), sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1), and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)1 thus targeting the regulation of viral infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Significant downregulation of apoptosis induced by MERS-CoV, prolonged cellular survival post-MERS-CoV infection, potential decrease in viral NP protein expression, and decreased viral replication were detected after resveratrol administration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Besides HDACs class III, the inhibition of the class II HDAC2 is achieved by the approved drug valproic acid (VPA) and the pre-clinical candidate apicidin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. VPA displayed minimal control of SARS-CoV-2 growth regardless of drug concentration along with high cytotoxicity levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In addition to VPA and apicidin, HDAC inhibitors include the broad spectrum trichostatin A (TSA) which reduced the pro-inflammatory mediator’s production, MS-275, and depsipeptide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Other potent HDACi such as vorinostat or suberanilohydroxamic acid (SAHA), belinostat, romidepsin, and panobinostat were already used for the treatment of several cancers such as T cell lymphoma and relapse of multiple myeloma [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Knowing that viruses depend on host’s epigenetic machinery, some epigenetic drugs used in cancer therapies were shown to give a potential broad spectrum antiviral action against novel emerging viruses. The histone methyltransferases-enhancer of zeste homolog 2/1 (HMT EZH2/1) inhibitors have the ability to attain cellular antiviral state and reduce viral yields instead of inducing activation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. A pan-HKMT antagonist, 3-deazaneplanocin-A (DZNep), prove to be therapeutically superior to BIX-01294 which antagonizes HKMT G9a [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Chaetocin is a fungal mycotoxin which inhibits HMT Suv39H1, promotes permanent cell cycle arrest, and RNA transcript blockage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Chaetocin is contraindicated with SAHA and JQ-1 as it causes cytotoxicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. On the contrary, a possible synergism was revealed combining BIX-01294 with vorinostat and DZNep with vorinostat [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. BRD4, a chief gene expression regulator, is involved in recognizing and modifying histone acetylation. Inhibition of BRD4 exhibits an effective antiviral effect against a wide range of RNA and DNA viruses by boosting a potential innate immune response, blocking viral attachment, inducting DNA damage response (DDR), decreasing viral replication, and arresting cell-cycle with no apoptotic signs. Bromodomain and extraterminal protein inhibitors are subdivided into clinical (ABBV-744, CPI-0610, RVX-208) and preclinical (dBET6, JQ-1, MZ1) candidates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. By hindering the communication of BRD4 and transmembrane E protein, JQ-1, and dBET6 effectively inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 genome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. JQ-1 exhibited a potential viral inhibition at low doses; dBET6 expressed lower cytotoxicity levels than JQ-1. Knowing that the bromodomain and extraterminal protein inhibitors possess varying cytotoxicity further drug assessments must be performed prior patient use [
