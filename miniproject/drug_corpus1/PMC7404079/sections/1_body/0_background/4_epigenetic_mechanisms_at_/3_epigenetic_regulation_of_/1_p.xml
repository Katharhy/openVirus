<p id="Par95">Coronaviruses employ a multisubunit machinery for replication and transcription. The RdRp, also known as Nsp12, catalyzes the synthesis of viral RNA and thus plays a central role in the replication and transcription cycle of SARS-CoV-2, possibly with the assistance of Nsp7 and Nsp8 as cofactors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Nsp7 interacts with the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (7SK snRNP) complex comprising La-related protein (LARP7), methyl-phosphate capping enzyme (MEPCE), and hexamethylene bisacetamide inducible protein (HEXIM1). This complex sequesters positive transcription elongation factor (P-TEFb) which is critical for the replication of several viruses including herpesviruses, human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), human adenovirus (HAdV), influenza A virus and Dengue virus (DENV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The interaction between Nsp7 and P-TEFb will result in the release of the active form of P-TEFb known to bind bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4); similar interaction has been reported previously for HIV Tat and P-TEFb. Interestingly, bromodomain and extra-terminal motif (BET) inhibitors such as JQ1, I-BET, I-BET151, OTX015, UMB-136, MMQO, CPI-203, RVX-208, PFI-1, BI-2536, and BI-6727 induce P-TEFb release and have been reported to be latency reversal agents in HIV infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]; Nsp14 interacts with SIRT5 acting as a weak deacetylase but with desuccinylase and demalonylase activities regulating several metabolic pathways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Recently, SIRT5 inhibitors have been developed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Nsp13 helicase/triphosphatase participate in the release of newly synthesized RNA strand and thus the production of infectious viral particles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Since p300 expression is under HDACs’ control [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], helicases such as Nsp13 might be under the control of p300 and thereby HDAC inhibitors might interfere with coronavirus replication. The Nsp3-Nsp4-Nsp6 complex is also involved in viral replication. Remarkably, Nsp4 interacts with HDAC2, and this could emphasize the role of epigenetic therapies in blocking HDAC2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Nsp10 is essential for the RNA cap methyl transferase of Nsp16. During RNA capping, Nsp16 methyl transferase activity coud be blocked by methyltransferase inhibitors such as sinefungin, dAPPMA 2′-O MTase inhibitors, aurintricaboxylic acid and inhibitor 7 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Finally, Nsp15 is a uridine-specific RNA endonuclease which has been shown to cleave a highly conserved RNA structure in the 3′ non-translated region of the SARS virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Most recurrent transcription regulating sequence (TRS) related to MERS-CoV is TRS2. Generally, MERS-CoV transcribes 11 subgenomic mRNAs, including various ORFs translating polypeptide chains and fusion proteins. Unlike MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV includes TRS3 that exists also in SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV possesses several accessory proteins (AP), which are translated directly from mRNAs. SARS-CoV-2 grants comparative differences in transcription and subgenomic mRNAs translation compared to other beta-coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 initiates transcription in 20 TRS sites, transcribing much more forms of subgenomic mRNAs than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV; this could correlate to the severity and high infectivity of COVID-19 on host patients. SARS-CoV-2 produces around nine forms of fusion proteins, with higher concentrations of Nsp12, Nsp3, Nsp5, and AP12 [
