Early studies have shown that this receptor acts as a protective mechanism to block the early stages of COVID-19 [

ACE2 is significantly expressed in the lower respiratory tract such as type II alveolar cells (AT2) of the lungs, upper esophagus, and stratified epithelial cells, as well as in kidney proximal tubule cells, bladder urothelial cells, absorptive enterocytes, cardiomyocytes, and cholangiocytes. Such cellular outspreading elucidates the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection that is not only limited to respiratory disorders but also to kidney, liver, heart, and gastrointestinal tract illnesses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Sirtuins, a family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ dependent deacetylases, play an important role in cellular homeostasis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Silent information regulator T1 (SIRT1), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) class III, is a key regulator of ACE2 levels via binding to its promoter [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In fact, resveratrol a well-known activator of SIRT1 increases the ACE2/angiotensin 1-7 (Ang1-7)/Mas receptor (MasR) axis parallel to the downregulation of the Angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) expression belonging to the prorenin receptor (PRR)/ACE/angiotensin II (Ang II)/AT1R axis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Although it was not shown so far that SIRT1 increases SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell due to increased ACE2 expression, COVID-19 patients with high levels of ACE2 have a better prognosis probably due to decreased hyperinflammation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Similarly, SIRT1 could impact viral entry of SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 which also use ACE2 for viral entry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Foremost host cellular receptors significantly utilized by other HCoVs for entry and viral replication are aminopeptidase N (APN) by HCoV-229E, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) by MERS-CoV and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid by HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Any mutations in human APN cell surface receptor will directly inhibit virus-receptor interaction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Promoter hypermethylation downregulates APN gene expression and azacitidine (5-azaC) induces APN protein expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In melanoma cells, the combination of HDAC inhibitor CHR-3996 and APN inhibitor tosedostat activated synergistically NF-kB [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Glucocorticoids directly upregulate the DPP4 gene expression in macrophages due to the presence of two GC-binding motifs in the DPP4 gene promoter [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Therefore, the cell surface expression of HCoV entry receptors can be modulated by epigenetic drugs which could be used to discover new therapeutic approaches to curtail HCoV infections.
