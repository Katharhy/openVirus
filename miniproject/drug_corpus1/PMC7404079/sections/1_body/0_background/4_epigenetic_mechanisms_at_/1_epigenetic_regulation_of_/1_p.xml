<p id="Par93">The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is composed of a single-stranded positive RNA of 29 kb; it is considered the largest of all RNA virus genomes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. So far, 14 open reading frames (ORF) have been described in the SARS-CoV-2 genome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes for viral proteins involved in viral replication named non-structural proteins (Nsp) including the replicase complex coded by ORF1ab, and structural viral proteins involved in viral assembly including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (NP) protein [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The S protein, a class I fusion glycoprotein, forms homotrimers bulging in the viral surface facilitating the viral envelope binding to host cells by attraction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This transmembrane protein is cleaved by the host cell furin-like protease into 2 subunits labeled S1 which binds to the receptor on the host cell surface and S2 is responsible for fusion activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Hence, disparities in the S protein would directly impact the viral biological characteristics including pathogenicity and antigenicity. Spike protein has been considered as the ultimate target for COVID-19 immunotherapies, and this is based on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV preceding evidence. Recently, studies have found that SARS-CoV S protein induced polyclonal antibody responses and counteracted SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry into host cells, thus favoring the use of this ideal molecular target for vaccination and immunotherapies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Even though SARS-CoV-2 crisis is noteworthy, referring to HCoVsâ€™ data is eminently required since HCoV and SARS-CoV-2 share genomic and biological properties.
