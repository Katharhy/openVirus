<p id="Par100">Epigenetic interventions must be urgently directed against cytokine storm to avoid or reduce ARDS and rising mortality (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Targeted anti-cytokine methodologies have proven efficacious in handling cytokine storm syndrome [

IFN-αβ and IFN-γ inhibitors mitigate HCoV-induced inflammation; the timing of IFN antagonism therapy must be taken into consideration as it defines the disease outcome. An early IFN response was protective in SARS-CoV-infected mice unlike a delayed IFN signaling. During delayed severe stages of SARS-CoV, IFN-αβ receptor antagonists prevent inflammatory responses; IFNγ neutralization limited IFN-α production [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. DNA methylation is directed via DNA methylase DNMT3a/b by binding of H3K9 histone methyltransferase G9a to the TNFα promoter which will then render TNFα promoter in a transcriptionally repressive state, resulting in reduced TNFα protein levels. Histone acetylation (H3K9ac, H3K36ac, and H4K5ac) triggers the suppression of IL-8 and TNFα levels which were majorly produced in response to CoV. By means of broad spectrum HDACi, TSA, the production of these proinflammatory mediators was curbed [
