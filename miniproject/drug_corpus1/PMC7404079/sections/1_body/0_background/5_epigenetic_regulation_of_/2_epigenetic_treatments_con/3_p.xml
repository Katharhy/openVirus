<p id="Par102">Baricitinib, a JAK inhibitor as well as an AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) inhibitor, was approved for inhibiting IFN-α production in hyperinflammatory cases caused by SARS-CoV-2 [

Epigenetic drugs targeting proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines act as a beneficial forecaster of long-term outcome for CoVs infections. The aim is to dampen the major proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β) and chemokines (IL-8, MCP-1, CCL5) response while enhancing the role of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β). Altering DNA methylation and histone acetylation states in the IL-6 promoter will impact IL-6 expression [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Histone acetyltransferase inhibitors (HATi) such as anacardic acid, MG149, and C646 suppress IL-6 levels [
