<p id="Par104">Providing more research to generate infection control therapeutic interventions is a major challenge. The three coronavirus global outbreaks emphasized the exigent need for curtailing CoVs infections despite the presence of many therapeutic options including epigenetic therapy, antivirals, and repurposing drugs. Cationic amphiphilic drugs, analogs of previously developed drugs, antibody therapy, structure-based drug design, and combination therapies are considered as researchersâ€™ key for further novel antiviral drug development [
