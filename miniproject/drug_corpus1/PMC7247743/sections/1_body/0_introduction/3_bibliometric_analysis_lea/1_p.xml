<p id="Par4">An exhaustive bibliometric analysis of drug repurposing over the decades conducted by this team recently has described the many drugs that have been tested for other indications (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>). Not surprisingly, chloroquine has also been identified by several groups (in China, South Korea and the USA, (

This could be due to a number of reasons such as the metabolism and disposition of these drugs and the therapeutic window. We have now used the same text mining approach to focus solely on drugs that have been used in the treatment of coronaviruses (Supplementary Material, Table S

Quaternary ammonium compounds are widely recommended to kill viruses and there are over 350 products on EPA’s List N: Disinfectants for use against SARS-CoV-2 (
