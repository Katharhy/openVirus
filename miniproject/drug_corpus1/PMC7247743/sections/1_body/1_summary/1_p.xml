<p id="Par7">We propose that in particular, cetylpyridinium chloride is a simple molecule that is cheap, safe, clinically approved, widely accessible in hospitals and the consumer sector and which could enter clinical trials immediately. If reported to have activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> against SARS-CoV-2 subsequent delivery in the form of a mouthwash or nasal spray containing this compound may be an effective way both to combat the virus at its point of entry and reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Similarly, this compound could be added to shampoo and body cleansers so that one could effectively bathe in low concentrations of this compound to destroy shed coronavirus. Cetylpyridinium chloride and many other quaternary ammonium compounds have already demonstrated their antiviral activity against a wide array of related coronaviruses as disinfectants and antiseptics, therefore they represent especially low hanging fruit for testing in humans. Due to their reported mechanisms they may also have much broader activity against viruses which could be useful toÂ address future enveloped viruses. Certainly, additional studies may be warranted to assess potential drug-drug or drug-transporter interactions. This work may also point to other related compounds that could be utilized, or at least enable the generation of new antiviral compounds that leverage the quaternary ammonium substructural fragment as a potential warhead. As simple as it sounds, it is entirely possible that we should be looking in our bathroom cupboards, for potential remedies against COVID-19.
