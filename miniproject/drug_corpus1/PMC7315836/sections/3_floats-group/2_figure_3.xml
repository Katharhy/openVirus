  <p>Entry model of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell. Binding of the S1 domain within the spike (S) protein to the cellular ACE2 receptor triggers conformational changes in the S2 domain that results in internalization and subsequent membrane fusion ((A) endosomal/clathrin-dependent pathway). The endosomal pathway is facilitated by a low pH and the pH-dependent cysteine protease cathepsin L. Alternatively, SARS-CoV-2 can enter the cell via the nonendosomal/clathrin-independent pathway (B). During this route, ACE2 recognition by the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (comparable to route A) is followed by additional activation/cleavage of the S protein into S1 and S2 domains by cell membrane-associated serine proteases such as TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS11D.
