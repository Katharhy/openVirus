  <p>SARS-CoV-2-RBD and ACE2 interface. ACE2 (in blue) is contacting via its proteolytic domain (PD) with helix α1 the extended loop region (in purple) of SARS-CoV-2 RBD, mainly via polar interactions. In addition, helix α2 and the loop 3–4 connecting β3 and β4 are also contributing to the interface. SARS-CoV-2 S protein monomer was obtained from PDB 6VSB and RBD-ACE2 complex from PDB 6VW1. Boxes 1, 2, and 3 highlight polar clusters 1, 2, and 3, respectively.</p>
