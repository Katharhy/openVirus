<p>Despite the availability of many compounds with inhibitory effects on ACE2, the corresponding ADMET data in a preclinical model is not available. Regardless, direct inhibition of ACE2 is probably not a viable therapeutic modality, however. This is due to its important normal physiological roles, in addition to its lung injury protective role in acute respiratory distress syndrome from a variety of causes, including SARS-CoV infection.

 </sup> As such, directly inhibiting ACE2 as an antiviral strategy appears to be physiologically unsound, and virally targetted blockers of its interaction with the SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 S protein hold greater promise.
