<p>Milewska et al. synthesized several polymer-based compounds showing prominent anticoronaviral activity. Among them, a cationically modified chitosan derivative, 
 <italic>N</italic>-(2-hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethylammonium chitosan chloride (
 <bold>HTCC</bold>, 
 <bold>10</bold>), and hydrophobically modified HTCC (
 <bold>HM-HTCC</bold>, 
 <bold>11</bold>) were found that could inhibit HCoV-NL63 replication. For both tested polymers, their IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were relatively low in LLC-MK2 cells, amounting to ∼50 nM for 
 <bold>10</bold> and ∼230 nM for 
 <bold>11</bold>. CC
 <sub>50</sub> values were ∼0.8 and ∼1 μM for 
 <bold>10</bold> and 
 <bold>11</bold>, respectively.

 </sup> Recent research showed that 
 <bold>10</bold> and 
 <bold>11</bold> blocked the interaction of HCoV-NL63 with its ACE2 receptor and thus interfered with the process of viral entry.
