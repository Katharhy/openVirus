<p>Turner et al. identified that the SARS-CoV receptor, ACE2, undergoes proteolytic shedding, releasing an enzymatically active ectodomain during viral entry.

 </sup> Further research identified that a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM17) is responsible for shedding regulation of ACE2. Inhibiting ADAM activity with the ADAM-specific inhibitor 
 <bold>GW280264X</bold> (
 <bold>6</bold>) reduced shedding of ACE2 at 1 nM against SARS-CoV.

 </sup> Another enzyme involved in ACE2 shedding is TACE (TNF-Î± converting enzyme, a member of the ADAM family). Two TACE inhibitors, 
 <bold>TAPI-0</bold> (
 <bold>7</bold>) and 
 <bold>TAPI-2</bold> (
 <bold>8</bold>), reduced ACE2 shedding against SARS-CoV, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 100 and 200 nM, respectively.
