<p>Constrained peptides are receiving more attention in the drug development field, combining the best attributes of antibodies and small molecules. Linear peptides are often highly flexible and unstructured in solution, only forming structures upon target binding. This can sometimes reduce the affinity of such peptides for their target by an entropic penalty mechanism. However, stabilization methods such as cyclization or hydrocarbon stapling can increase the physicochemical characteristics and drug-like properties while negating the entropic penalty of binding and having a positive impact on affinity.
