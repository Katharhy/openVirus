<p>Using a constrained peptide library displayed on filamentous phages, Ladner et al. identified several peptides inhibiting ACE2 function with the most potent being DX600 (

  <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">2</xref>
 </xref>). DX600, an N-terminal acetylated and C terminal amidated peptide, was a potent ACE2 peptide inhibitor with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 10 nM and a

 <sub>i</sub> value of 2.8 nM. DX600 did not inhibit ACE activity and thus is specific to ACE2. In addition, DX600 was chemically stable and not hydrolyzable by ACE2.
