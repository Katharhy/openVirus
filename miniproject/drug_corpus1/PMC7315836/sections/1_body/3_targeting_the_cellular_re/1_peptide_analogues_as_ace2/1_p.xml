<p>Human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a highly glycosylated type I integral membrane protein and has been identified as a fundamental regulator of the reninâ€“angiotensin system (RAS) in humans and is an important target in regulation of blood pressure homeostasis. ACE2 is a human homologue of ACE.

 </sup> It contains a single zinc-binding catalytic domain, which is 42% similar to the human ACE active region.

 </sup> ACE2 can catalyze the cleavage of angiotensin I into angiotensin 1-9, and angiotensin II into the vasodilator angiotensin 1-7 and its organ- and cell-specific expression also suggests a role in the regulation of cardiovascular and renal function and fertility.

 </sup> ACE2 is a functional receptor to the SARS-CoV during viral entry, and recent research demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 also utilizes ACE2 for infection.

 </sup> However, ACE2 cannot be inhibited by ACE inhibitors, so there is an urgent need to develop specific ACE2 inhibitors that would prevent infection by both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
