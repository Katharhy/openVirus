<p>One of the first efforts to target the ACE2 receptors was documented by Liu et al. Using a novel epitope assembling assay, Liu et al. identified linear B-cell immuno-cross-reactive epitopes of SARS-CoV S protein by synthesizing 22 longer peptides. Five of these peptides showed serologically highly cross-reactivity in all tested SARS patients sera. Among them, peptide S
 <sub>471-503</sub> could significantly block the binding of RBD to ACE2. S
 <sub>471-503</sub>, derived from the S1 fragment (

 </xref>) could target ACE2, and showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV infection in vitro, with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 41.6 Î¼M, providing an important basis to explore the antiviral potential of S
 <sub>471-503</sub> against SARS-CoV-2.
