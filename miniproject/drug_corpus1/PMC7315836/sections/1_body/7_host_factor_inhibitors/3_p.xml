<p>On the basis of an HTS assay using cytopathic-effect (CPE), Shin et al. identified 
 <bold>saracatinib</bold> (
 <bold>30</bold>), a potent inhibitor of the Src-family of tyrosine kinases (SFKs), that can block the early process of the MERS-CoV life cycle, possibly through inhibition of the SFK signaling pathways. 
 <bold>30</bold> exhibited prominent antiviral activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.9 μM and a CC
 <sub>50</sub> value of &gt;50 μM, resulting in an SI value of approximately &gt;17. Moreover, 
 <bold>30</bold> showed a broad-antiviral activity against hCoV-229E and hCoV-OC43, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.4 and 5.1 μM, respectively.
