<p>Out of an HTS, 
 <bold>VE607</bold> (
 <bold>33</bold>) was identified using a phenotype-based screen from a 50 240 structurally diverse small-molecule compound library. Pseudotype virus entry assay suggested VE607 can specifically inhibit SARS-CoV virus entry into cells with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 3 μM and inhibited SARS-CoV plaque formation with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.6 μM.

 </sup> A similar HTS approach was employed by Zhang et al. for screening a compound library consisting of 727 structurally diverse small molecules. eighty-four compounds were identified with significant anticoronavirus potential. Further studies revealed that 51 compounds inhibited virus entry, while 19 others interfered with viral replication.

 </sup> Natural products should, however, be considered with caution due to their unknown mechanism of action and possible toxic side effects.
