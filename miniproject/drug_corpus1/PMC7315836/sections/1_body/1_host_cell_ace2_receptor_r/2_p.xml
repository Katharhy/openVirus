<p>Recently the cryo-EM and crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2’s RBD in complex with ACE2 were solved and provide important structural guidance for inhibitor design (

 </sup> The interface can be divided into three contact sides, mainly polar in nature, and is similar to the SARS-CoV-ACE2 complex.

 </sup> In this structure, an extended loop of the RBD contacts an arch-like helix α1 of the proteolytic domain (PD) of ACE2 via an N- (cluster 1), central (cluster 2), and C-terminal (cluster 3) portion (

  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref> purple box). Additionally, helix α2 and loop 3–4 (connecting β3 and β4) of ACE2 provide limited contacts. At the N terminus of α1 (cluster 1), Gln498, Thr500, and Asn501 of the RBD interact via hydrogen bonds with Tyr41, Gln42, Lys353, and Arg357 from ACE2. The middle portion (cluster 2) of the RBD loop contacts via Tyr453, the ACE2 PD at residue His34. At the C terminus of α1 (cluster 3), Gln474 of RBD contacts Gln24 of ACE2, and Phe486 of RBD interacts with Met82 of ACE2 through van der Waals interactions (
