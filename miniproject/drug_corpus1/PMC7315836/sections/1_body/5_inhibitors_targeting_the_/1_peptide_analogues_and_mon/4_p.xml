 </xref>), targeting the HCoV-229E S protein HR1 and HR2 domains, could competitively inhibit the viral autologous 6-HB formation and inhibit HCoV-229E S protein-mediated virus-cell membrane fusion with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 5.7 and 0.3 μM, respectively. Moreover, neither 229E-HR1P nor 229E-HR2P had significant cytotoxicity to Huh-7 and A549 cells at concentrations up to 1000 μM. In addition, 229E-HR2P potentially inhibited pseudotyped and live HCoV-229E infection with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.5 and 1.7 μM, respectively.
