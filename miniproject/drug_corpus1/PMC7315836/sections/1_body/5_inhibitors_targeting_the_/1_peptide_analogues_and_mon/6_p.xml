<p>Tsunetsugu-Yokota et al. found that antibody SKOT20 can inhibit SARS-CoV with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 5 Î¼g/mL in Vero E6 cells SARS-CoV. Mutational studies indicate that SKOT20 restrict conformational changes within the S2 domain, essential for viral entry.

 </sup> Taken together, the here presented peptide and mAb candidates targeting the S2 domain derived from previous SARS-CoV studies could potentially help develop effective vaccines to combat SARS-CoV-2.
