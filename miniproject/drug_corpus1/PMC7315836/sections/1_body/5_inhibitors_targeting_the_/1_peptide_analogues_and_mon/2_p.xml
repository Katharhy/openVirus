<p>The development of a drug with broad-spectrum HCoV inhibitory activity is increasingly becoming an attractive approach. Xia et al. found that the EK1 peptide showed pan-CoV fusion inhibitory activity against multiple HCoVs (

 </sup> Further investigation revealed that EK1 directly reacts with the HR1 region and can competitively inhibit viral 6-HB formation. The pseudovirus assay suggested that the antiviral activity of EK1 against HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E infection with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.81, 6.02, and 3.35 μM, respectively. In vitro cytotoxicity assay determined that EK1 is not cytotoxic at concentrations up to 1 mM. Mice that received 5 mg/kg of EK1 were nearly completely protected from infection by HCoV-OC43 and 200 μg of EK1 against MERS-CoV infection. Recently, this team found that EK1 could also potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2 with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.38 μM in pseudovirus assay and an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.19 μM in fusion inhibitory assay.

 </sup> To improve the inhibitory activity of EK1 against SARS-CoV-2, they conjugate the cholesterol molecule to the EK1 peptide and found that a new peptide, EK1C4, exhibited highly potent inhibitory activity inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, The CC
 <sub>50</sub> of EK1C4 was 5 μM, and the selectivity index was &gt;136. In the OC43-infected mouse model, mice that received 0.5 mg/kg of EK1C4 were nearly completely protected from infection by HCoV-OC43. These data suggested that EK1C4 could be used for inhibition and treatment of infection by currently circulating SARS-CoV-2.
