 <bold>ADS-J1</bold> (
 <bold>15</bold>), a potential viral entry inhibitor, was reported by Ngai et al. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 
 <bold>15</bold> was 3.89 μM. Molecular docking analysis suggests that 
 <bold>15</bold> can bind into a deep pocket of the SARS-CoV S protein HR region and block the SARS-CoV entry into host cells.

 </sup> Recently, Zhao et al. demonstrated that 
 <bold>15</bold> could also inhibit MERS-CoV infection in a pseudovirus-based inhibition assay, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.6 μM, a CC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 26.9 μM, and providing a selectivity index of almost 45.
