<p>Two small molecules, 
 <bold>CID 16725315</bold> (
 <bold>18</bold>) and 
 <bold>CID 23631927</bold> (
 <bold>19</bold>), were reported by Diamond et al. as viral entry inhibitors of the SARS-CoV. In a cathepsin L inhibition assay, 
 <bold>19</bold> could block cathepsin L with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 6.9 nM, while 
 <bold>18</bold> showed slightly weaker potency with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 56 nM. Interestingly, besides inhibiting SARS-CoV, compound 
 <bold>19</bold> (EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 273 nM) showed some inhibition activity for Ebola virus infection (EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 193 nM) of human embryonic kidney 293T cells. Importantly, 
 <bold>19</bold> did not show any sign of toxicity to human aortic endothelial cells at 100 μM. This data offers a new promising point for the treatment of SARS and Ebola virus infections.

 </sup> Recently, in a cell-based assay screen of ∼14 000 compounds, 
 <bold>SSAA09E1</bold> (
 <bold>20</bold>) was identified that could specifically bind to the cathepsin L proteinase and interference SARS-S protein during viral entry, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 5.33 μM. In a pseudotype-based assay in 293T cells, the EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 
 <bold>20</bold> was around 6.4 μM, and no cytotoxicity was detected below 100 μM.
