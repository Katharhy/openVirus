 <bold>17</bold>, 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="other">4</xref>
 </xref>) by Bates et al., and in an antiviral activity assay, 
 <bold>17</bold> specifically inhibited cathepsin L-mediated substrate cleavage and blocked SARS-CoV viral entry, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.5 nM and EC
 <sub>50</sub> value in the range of 100 nM. However, despite its potent inhibitory activity, no cytotoxicity data for 
 <bold>17</bold> is currently available.
