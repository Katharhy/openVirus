<p>Using SARS-CoV entry assays, Zhou et al. screened 2100 cysteine protease inhibitors with confirmed activity to inhibit human cathepsins. Among them, 
 <bold>K11777</bold> (
 <bold>21</bold>) demonstrated the most robust activity. Results demonstrated that 
 <bold>21</bold> blocked SARS-CoV pseudovirus entry at an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.68 nM while no toxicity was observed, CC
 <sub>50</sub> value &gt;10 Î¼M. Interestingly, for other coronaviruses, 
 <bold>21</bold> showed broad-spectrum antiviral activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.48, 6.78, and 46.12 nM against HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and MERS-CoV, respectively.
