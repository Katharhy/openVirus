<p>Elevated levels of furin expression were able to facilitate MERS-CoV pseudovirion infection, and viral entry could be reduced by furin siRNA silencing.

 <bold>Decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone</bold> (
 <bold>23</bold>, dec-RVKR-CMK), a furin inhibitor, was shown to block MERS-CoV S protein-mediated entry as well as virus infection, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 75 Î¼M in HEK-293T cells. Furthermore, when cathepsin inhibitor camostat was used in combination with 
 <bold>23</bold>, a significant inhibition in infectivity was characterized compared to camostat alone.

 </sup> Recently, Bestle et al., showed that the potent peptidomimetic inhibitor 
 <bold>MI-1851</bold> (
 <bold>24</bold>) could prevent proteolytic processing of the S protein from SARS-CoV-2 by endogenous furin in HEK293 cells. However, no antiviral data is available for 
 <bold>24</bold> yet.

 </sup> The peculiar furin-like cleavage site (S1/S2-site in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure

 </xref>) in SARS-CoV-2 that is absent in the SARS-CoV and other SARS-like CoVs indicates that furin inhibitors could play a significant role in blocking the viral entry process.
