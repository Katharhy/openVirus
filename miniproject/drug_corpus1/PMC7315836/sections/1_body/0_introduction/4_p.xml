<p>The glycoprotein or S protein is responsible for receptor recognition and viral entry into host cells. The spike protein can be divided into two domains; S1 is responsible for angiotensin-converting enzyme II(ACE2) recognition, the recently identified host cell receptor, and S2 mediates membrane fusion (

 </sup> Structural alignment of SARS-CoV-2 S protein with SARS-CoV S protein shows that both S proteins are similarly with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 3.8 Å over 959 Cα atoms, while the S2 domain, responsible for membrane fusion, display the most substantial similarities with an RMSD of 2.0 Å (
