 </sup> Host proteases such as the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and TMPRSS11D can cleave the S protein at the S1/S2 cleavage site (

 </sup> A recent study also confirms that TMPRSS2 expressing VeroE6 cells are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting the importance of TMPRSS2 in the replication cycle.
