<p>As mentioned previously, Zhang et al. determined the full-length genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and revealed that the virus was very similar (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses.

 </sup> Simultaneously, Shi et al. found that SARS-CoV-2 shares 96% sequence identity at a whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus, and importantly, they confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as SARS-CoV.

 </sup> Recently, the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 bound to the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 was solved, providing an important structural foundation for intervention strategies.

 </sup> Conservation analysis also revealed that the RdRp and the 3CLpro are highly conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.

 </sup> Therefore, it is widely accepted that SARS-CoV-2 would behave similarly to SARS-CoV with regards to viral entry and replication.
