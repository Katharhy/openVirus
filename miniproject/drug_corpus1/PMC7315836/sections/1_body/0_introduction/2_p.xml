<p>Until last year, six strains of coronaviruses have been identified that are pathogenic to humans. Among them are CoV-NL63, CoV-OC43, CoV-HKU1, and CoV-229E that could cause mild respiratory tract diseases.

 </sup> However, two of the β-CoVs, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have caused severe epidemics in the past.

 </sup> In April 2003, SARS-CoV was responsible for 8098 infections, with a fatality rate of ∼10% by the end of September 2003.

 </sup> MERS-CoV emerged from its zoonotic reservoir in 2012 and infected 2494 people with a fatality rate of ∼34% by the end of 2019.

 </sup> Both outbreaks having such high fatality rates, highlight the need for surveillance of coronavirus emergence. While efforts for the development of antivirals against SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV are still in process, a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged from an epicenter located in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

 </sup> SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and has quickly spread in and beyond China. As of May 28, 2020, there have been more than 5 596 550 diagnosed cases around the world, with 353 373 confirmed deaths (
