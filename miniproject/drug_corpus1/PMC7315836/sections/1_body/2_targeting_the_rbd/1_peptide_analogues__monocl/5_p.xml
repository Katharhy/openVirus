<p>Brouwer et al. used cross-sectional blood samples from three PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals to screen for binders to a soluble prefusion-stabilized S protein of SARS-CoV-2 using an ELISA-based approach. All three blood samples did bind to the prefusion-stabilized S protein and prompted subsequent sorting of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific B cells for mAb isolation. Nineteen Nabs could be identified that target a diverse range of antigenic sites on the S protein and showed remarkable picomolar inhibiting activities with the two most potent IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.010 and 0.007 Î¼g/mL (COVA1-18 and COVA2-15, respectively) against live SARS-CoV-2 virus.
