<p>Membrane fusion is a crucial step in the MERS/SARS infection cycle in both described pathways (see section 1). Within the endosomal/clathrin-dependent route, internalized viral particles need to fuse with the endosomal membrane to escape the endosomal/lysosomal environment. This is achieved via a conformational change of the S protein (S2 domain) within the acidic milieu followed by membrane fusion activation by the host protease cathepsin L. Membrane fusion is also essential during the nonendosomal/clathrin-independent route to fuse with cellular membranes facilitated by host protease cleavage of the S protein by cell membrane-associated proteases such as TMPRSS2.

 </sup> In conclusion, the S2 domain of the SARS-CoV S protein and host proteases such as cathepsin L and TMPRSS2 are very attractive therapeutic targets.

 </sup> Therefore, we highlight in the following section a few examples of peptide analogues, mAbs, and small molecules that target the S2 domain or inhibit directly host proteases that are crucial for the S protein processing and fusion event.
