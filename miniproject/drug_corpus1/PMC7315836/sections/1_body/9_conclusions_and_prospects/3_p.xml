<p>In addition to small-molecule inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and vaccine development, convalescent sera from SARS-CoV-2 survivors (convalescent-phase sera) is an additional option for COVID-19 treatment. Passive immunization was well established for viral infection prophylaxis.

 </sup> By meta-analysis of studies about the 1918 influenza, H1N1 influenza epidemic demonstrated that early treatment of convalescent blood products decreased the risk ratio caused by pneumonia from 37% to 16%.

 </sup> Nevertheless, the appropriate titer of the convalescent-phase sera antibody remains to be determined, which was required for therapeutic efficacy to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Research carried out with MERS-CoV suggested that sera from patients recovering from infections did not contain sufficient antibody titers for therapeutic use.
