  <p>Effects of time-of-addition of RS on IFV replication. RS at a concentration of 50 µg/mL (closed bar) or 500 µg/mL (open bar) was added to the culture medium 3 h prior to virus infection (
   <bold>a</bold>), during infection for 1 h (
   <bold>b</bold>), during infection for 1 h, and throughout the subsequent incubation (
   <bold>c</bold>), immediately after infection (
   <bold>d</bold>), at 1 h post-infection (p.i.) (
   <bold>e</bold>), at 3 h p.i. (
   <bold>f</bold>), or at 6 h p.i. (
   <bold>g</bold>). Each value is expressed as the mean ± SD from independent duplicate assays.
