<p>Mice (16–21 per treatment) were intranasally infected with 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU of virus in 50 μL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) on day 0. RS or oseltamivir was given by oral administration at a dose of 5 mg/day or 0.2 mg/day, respectively, twice a day from 7 days before virus inoculation to 7 days after virus inoculation, starting from 30 min after virus infection. In the immunocompromised groups of mice, 5-FU was injected subcutaneously every other day at a dose of 0.5 mg/treatment starting from 7 days before virus inoculation to 13 days after virus inoculation, whereas the immunocompetent mice were not injected with 5-FU. Blood and lung samples and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) were collected from each group at 3, 7, or 14 days after virus inoculation. Blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and the sera were stored at −20 °C. Lung samples were sonicated for 10 s after the addition of 1 μL PBS per mg of lung tissue and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min to collect the supernatants, which were then stored at −80 °C. BALF samples were prepared by four washes with 0.8 mL ice-cold PBS via a tracheal cannula and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min to collect the supernatants, which were then stored at −80 °C. Virus titers in the lung and BALF samples were determined by plaque assay on MDCK cell monolayers.
