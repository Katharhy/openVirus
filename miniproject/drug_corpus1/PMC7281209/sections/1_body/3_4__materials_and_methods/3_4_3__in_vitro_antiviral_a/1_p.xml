<p>For cell growth inhibition studies, cells were cultured for 72 h in the presence of increasing concentrations of RS. Viable cell yields were determined by the trypan blue exclusion test. The inhibition data were plotted as dose–response curves, from which the 50% cell growth inhibitory concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) was obtained. In the antiviral assays, the plaque yield reduction assay was employed except for human coronavirus, adenovirus, and HIV. Cell monolayers in 48-well plates were infected with the virus at a dose of 0.1 plaque-forming units (PFU) per cell at room temperature. After 1 h of viral infection, the monolayers were incubated at 37 °C. Samples were added during infection and throughout the incubation period or immediately after virus infection. Virus yields were determined by plaque assay after 1 day of incubation for HSV-1, HSV-2, measles virus, mumps virus, poliovirus, coxsackie virus, and IFV, and after 5 days of incubation for HCMV. For anti-human coronavirus and anti-adenovirus assays, cells were infected with the virus at 0.01 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> (50% tissue culture infectious dose) per cell and incubated in the medium for 3 days. The TCID
 <sub>50</sub> values (titers) of the viruses were determined based on cytopathic effects through the Reed–Muench method [
 <xref rid="B38-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. For anti-HIV assays, the virus was collected from the supernatants of Molt-4/HTLV-IIIB cell cultures and its TCID
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated in MT-4 cells. Mt-4 cells were infected with HIV at 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> at room temperature for 1 h and incubated at 37 °C for 5 days to count viable cells. Antiviral activity was expressed as the 50% effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>), which was the sample concentration that reduced plaque numbers by 50% in treated cultures compared with no-drug controls. Antiviral activities were estimated by selectivity indices (SIs) calculated from CC
 <sub>50</sub> and EC
 <sub>50</sub> values (SI = CC
 <sub>50</sub>/EC
 <sub>50</sub>).
