<p>BALB/c mice were fasted for 3 h and then orally administered with FITC-RS or FITC at a dose of 2 mg/mouse or 1 mg/mouse, respectively. Mice were killed at 10, 30, or 60 min after oral administration. The Peyer’s patches were dissected from the mouse small intestines, fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and were frozen in Tissue-Tek optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek Japan Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Cryosections (7 μm) were cut and stained with rhodamine-labeled 
 <italic>Ulex Europaeus</italic> Agglutinin I (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA) for the detection of M cells. Then, the sections were counterstained with 0.5 μg/mL DAPI (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) and mounted with Aqua-Poly/Mount (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA, USA). The stained sections were analyzed by fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS IX73, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).
