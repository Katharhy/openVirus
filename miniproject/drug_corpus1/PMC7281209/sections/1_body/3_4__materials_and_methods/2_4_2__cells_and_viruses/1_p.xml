<p>Vero, MDCK, and HeLa cells obtained from Denka Seiken Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) were grown in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). MRC-5 cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were grown in Dulbeccoâ€™s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS. MT-4 and Molt-4/HTLV-IIIB cells obtained from Tokyo Medical and Dental University were grown in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. HSV-1 (HF strain), HSV-2 (UW 268 strain), measles virus (Toyoshima strain), mumps virus (EY strain), poliovirus type 3 (Sabin strain), and coxsackievirus type B-1 (Conn-5 strain) were kindly donated by the Toyama Institute of Health and were grown on Vero cells. Influenza A virus (A/NWS/33, H1N1 subtype) (IFV) obtained from Denka Seiken Co., Ltd. was grown on MDCK cells. Human cytomegalovirus (Towne strain) (HCMV) obtained from Kanazawa University and human coronavirus (229E strain) obtained from the ATCC were grown on MRC-5 cells. Adenovirus (type 2) from Toyama Institute of Health and human rhinovirus type 14 (1059 strain) from Maruishi-Pharm Co. (Osaka, Japan) were propagated on HeLa cells. HIV obtained from Denka Seiken Co., Ltd. was prepared from the culture supernatant of persistently infected Molt-4/HTLV-IIIB cells.</p>
