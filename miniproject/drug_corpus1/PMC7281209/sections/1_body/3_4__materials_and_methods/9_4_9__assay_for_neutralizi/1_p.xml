<p>Neutralizing anti-IFV antibody titers were determined through the 50% plaque reduction assay. Serum samples at 5- to 78, 125-fold dilutions (0.1 mL) were mixed with approximately 200 PFU of virus (0.1 mL) and incubated at 37 Â°C for 1 h. Each mixture was added onto MDCK cell monolayers in 35-mm dishes to measure residual virus infectivity by plaque assay. The neutralizing antibody titer was defined as the highest dilution of the serum that reduced the plaque numbers by 50% compared with the control (without serum).</p>
