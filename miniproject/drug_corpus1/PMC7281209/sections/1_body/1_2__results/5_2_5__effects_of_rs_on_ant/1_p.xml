<p>To evaluate the effects of RS on antibody responses, 5-FU (-) and 5-FU (+) mice were infected with IFV, and sera were collected 3, 7, and 14 days after infection. The effects of RS on the immune response were evaluated in IFV-infected mice at 3, 7, and 14 days after infection. RS induced higher titers of neutralizing antibodies in the sera at 7 and 14 days after infection in both 5-FU (-) and FU (+) mice (

On the other hand, oseltamivir significantly suppressed antibody production at 3 and 7 days after infection in FU (-) mice and at 7 and 14 days after infection in FU (+) mice. These results indicate that RS stimulated the production of virus-specific antibodies.
