<p>To clarify the mechanism of RS on reducing virus yield and enhancing antibody production, the localization of RS in the gastrointestinal tract was determined using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled RS and used for subsequent analysis. FITC-RS was not clearly observed in the sections of Peyer’s patches from the mice at 5 and 60 min after oral administration (data not shown). After 30 min of administration, the fluorescence of FITC-RS was clearly observed in almost all M cells in the Peyer’s patches, which are the immune sensors of the intestine (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-18-00254-f006">Figure 6</xref>). These data show that RS passed through M cells and entered the Peyer’s patches within 30 min after oral administration. When FITC was orally administered, the substance itself was not detected in M cells after 30 min (data not shown).
