<p>To evaluate the effects of RS on viral proliferation, virus yield in the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) were determined on both 5-FU (-) and 5-FU (+) mice 3 and 7 days after infection. Among 16â€“21 mice, 5 mice were used to determine the viral yields on each time point. RS significantly reduced IFV production in the lungs to 50% (
