<p>The SI values of RS when added during viral infection (
 <xref rid="marinedrugs-18-00254-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>A) were higher than the values obtained when RS was added immediately after infection (
 <xref rid="marinedrugs-18-00254-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>B) for all the enveloped viruses except for HIV. These results suggest that RS has antiviral effects against these enveloped viruses and that RS interferes with the early steps of viral replication, including viral attachment to and penetration into the host cells. In order to characterize the antiviral activity of the RS, its effects on IFV replication were subsequently evaluated.
