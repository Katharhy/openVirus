<p>These results of time-of-addition experiments suggested that the antiviral targets might be early events including virus adsorption to the host cell surface and/or virus penetration into host cells. Therefore, to evaluate the effects of RS on the early steps of viral replication, we determined whether it could inhibit IFV adsorption and penetration (
