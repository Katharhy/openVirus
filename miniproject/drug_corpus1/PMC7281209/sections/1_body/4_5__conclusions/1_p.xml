<p>Here, we report that RS alleviates infection by interfering with virus adsorption/internalization in vitro and by enhancing the antibody response against infection 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, not at the stage of virus growth inside the infected cells. Therefore, the mode of action of RS may be different from that of currently approved drugs such as oseltamivir. Further, it seems that a resistant virus against RS hardly appears, even after long-term use. Future studies are needed to further characterize the effects of RS on different types of enveloped viruses to support its role as a potential antiviral candidate.
