<p>To analyze the effects of RS on IFV infection in vivo, we performed IFV infection experiments in mice. Our results showed that the oral administration of RS led to an early improvement of influenza symptoms based on the reduction of influenza virus titers in normal mice and the suppression of body weight loss in FU-treated mice. In another animal experiment, the intramuscular injection of RS derived from 
 <italic>M. latissimum</italic> exerted a therapeutic effect on enterovirus replication [
