<p>Studies have shown that whereas influenza virus shedding in nasopharyngeal secretions can be controlled within a few days in immunocompetent patients, longer durations of viral shedding have been observed after the onset of symptoms in immunocompromised patients [

 <xref rid="B30-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Thus, immunocompromised patients have higher risks of acquiring severe influenza virus infection, which also appears to be more difficult to prevent and treat [
