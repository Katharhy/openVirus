<p>Heparin is a sulfated polysaccharide that is known to bind a glycoprotein, gp120, which is located on the HIV envelope [

 <xref rid="B26-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Fucoidan also binds gp120 and has anti-HIV activity [

 <xref rid="B18-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The ionic interaction between the sulfated polysaccharide molecule and the viral glycoprotein is believed to be the main mechanism for viral inhibition; the RS derived from 
 <italic>M. nitidum</italic> in this study may also bind viruses through a similar mechanism. We speculate that the molecular target of RS on the influenza virus is hemagglutinin (HA), which is a glycoprotein that is found on the viral envelope and contributes to host cell binding. Analysis of the interaction between RS and HA will have to be performed in future studies to verify this hypothesis.
