<p>Since RS is a high molecular weight substance, it is unlikely to be transported to the respiratory mucosa, where influenza virus proliferates in vivo. Oseltamivir suppresses virus proliferation in the body, but it also suppresses virus-specific antibodies, whereas RS suppresses virus growth and promotes the production of virus-specific antibodies. Based on these results, we speculated that orally administered RS has stimulatory effects on the intestinal immune response. Considering that RS is a macromolecule, we focused on the M cells in Peyer’s patches that can incorporate large molecules, including bacteria [

Since the Peyer’s patch, a lymph node organ associated with the small intestine, is important for inducing antigen-specific intestinal immune response, RS will have to be transported into the Peyer’s patch through the M cells. The polysaccharide β-glucan is known to be transported by M cells into Peyer’s patches [

In this study, as part of elucidating the mode of action of RS in vivo, we investigated the localization of FITC-labeled RS in the mouse intestine. Our results revealed that orally administered RS passed through M cells about 30 min after administration and was incorporated into the Peyer’s patch (
