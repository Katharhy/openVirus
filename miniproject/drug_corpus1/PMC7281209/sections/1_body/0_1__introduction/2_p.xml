<p>Antivirals and vaccines are the primary tools for controlling viral diseases. Neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir and zanamivir are often used for the treatment of influenza virus infections. However, drug-resistant influenza strains have been reported [

 <xref rid="B3-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although vaccines are indispensable to the prevention of influenza, the current vaccine design has several limitations: vaccine production using embryonated chicken eggs takes over 6 months, and manufacturing vaccines against avian influenza viruses such as the H5N1 subtype is often difficult because of its high pathogenicity in chickens. To overcome the disadvantages related to neuraminidase inhibitors and vaccine production, other types of drugs that exhibit both anti-influenza virus activities and different mechanisms of action such as stimulating the immune system or inhibiting viral adsorption are needed.
