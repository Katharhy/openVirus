<p>In this study, we first aimed to show the antiviral activities of RS against a broad range of viruses (enveloped and non-enveloped) in vitro. Next, we focused on the characterization of the antiviral effects of RS against IFV infection in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we show histological evidence that RS molecules could bind to M cells in the intestinal epithelium of mice. Our findings suggest that RS is a potential candidate for development into an anti-influenza therapeutic agent.</p>
