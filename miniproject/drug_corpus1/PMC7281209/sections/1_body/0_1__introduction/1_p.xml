<p>Influenza viruses are disease-causing agents belonging to the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family. There are three types of influenza viruses: A, B, and C. Influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal flu epidemics almost every year around the world. Influenza A viruses (IFVs) infect a broad range of hosts, including humans, pigs, dogs, horses, and birds, and they are known to evolve into highly pathogenic strains. The emergence of novel IFVs have been known to cause pandemics in recent history, such as the influenza pandemic of 2009, and the potential emergence of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus strain into a pandemic remains a global health concern [

In addition to influenza viruses, coronaviruses, such as the causative agents of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the new SARS-CoV-2 have also recently emerged as threats to global health, thereby necessitating new control strategies against emerging viral infections.
