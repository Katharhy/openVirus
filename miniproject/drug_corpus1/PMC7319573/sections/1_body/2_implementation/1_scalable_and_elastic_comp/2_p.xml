<p>Scalable Pathogon Pipeline Platform (SP
 <sup>3</sup>) is an open source web-based platform that we developed to host container-centric bioinformatic pipelines (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). We deploy NanoSPC to the SP
 <sup>3</sup> platform to allow the pipeline to be run at high-performance computing (HPC) clusters and major commercial cloud platforms, such as Google Cloud, Amazon Elastic Computing Cloud (Amazon EC2), Microsoft Azure and OpenStack Cloud. SP
 <sup>3</sup> has a cloud operation layer that provides interface to cloud platforms. A cloud agnostic scaler and scheduler allocate compute nodes based on CPU and memory requirement of the submitted jobs, and deallocate computational resources after the completion of the jobs. All SP
 <sup>3</sup> software are deployed to a head node equipped with Ubuntu 18.04 and Nextflow. Compute nodes are only being built and used when tasks are sent to the head node. SP
 <sup>3</sup> platform manages pipelines via a series of Web APIs, providing a range of functionalities, such as fetching data from European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and other data sources, and excuating data analysis.
