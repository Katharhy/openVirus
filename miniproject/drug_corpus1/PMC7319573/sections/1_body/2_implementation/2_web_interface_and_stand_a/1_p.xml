<p>We build a web interface for users to interact with cloud platforms via SP
 <sup>3</sup> and perform data analysis (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). An authorised user can login to the SP
 <sup>3</sup> system to upload their Nanopore sequencing data and execute the pipeline. Users can monitor the progress of the submitted job in real-time. The interface displays detailed logs, running commands, output files being generated, processing time, CPU usage, and memory usage for each individual process in the pipeline. Upon job completion, a complete run report displays the analysis results for each dataset. Users can choose to download the result files in bulk or only files that are of interest through running a command provided in the interface. The interface is served by the Nginx web server, configured to authenticate against web APIs, allowing user access control via web LDAP authentication. The web interface is written in python.
