<p>We illustrate the usage of NanoSPC with an exemplar Nanopore metagenomic sequencing dataset. The dataset contains Nanopore metagenomic sequencing reads generated from a clinical respiratory sample. The sample has been tested positive for human metapneumovirus (hmpv) in the clinical diagnostic laboratory as described in (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Web interfaces for submitting the jobs to cloud-based analysis and real-time monitoring of the progress are shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> andÂ 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">B</xref>. Analysis of the data shows that Nanopore sequencing generated 428 914 reads with mean length of 615 bp (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Taxonomic classification of the sequencing reads are displayed using the Krona plots (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). In this case, bacterial and viral reads accounted for 88% and 5% of the total sequencing reads. Among the viral reads, 67% and 33% are identified as hmpv and human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hpiv-3) reads, exemplifying simultaneous identification of multiple potentially pathogenic species from individual metagenomic sequencing dataset. Mapping to reference sequences showed that 14 821 hmpv reads cover the complete genome at mean coverage of 886, and 7323 hpiv-3 reads cover the complete genome at mean coverage of 370 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). The medaka mode is employed for calling variants, the total execution time is 13 mins (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>).
