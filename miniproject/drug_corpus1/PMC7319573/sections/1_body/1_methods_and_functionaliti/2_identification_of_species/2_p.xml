<p>NanoSPC first applies Centrifuge v1.0.3 (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) to classify sequencing reads to a taxonomic identifier in the centrifuge reference database (p_compressed+h+v) that comprises 20 174 complete bacterial, archaeal, viral, and human genomes corresponding to 11 539 taxonomic IDs. One primary assignment with a score &gt;150 is reported for individual reads. Based on the centrifuge report, the pipeline selects a draft reference genome for each viral species, and maps sequencing reads to the draft reference using Minimap2 (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In order to optimize the reference sequence for viral species, a preliminary consensus sequence for each viral species is generated using a simple majority voting method that selects the most abundant base at each genomic position. The preliminary consensus sequences are then BLASTed against a customized viral reference database to determine more optimal reference sequences. Finally, we map the reads to these references using Minimap2 for a second time. The customized viral reference database comprises of &gt;86 000 complete genomes of viral pathogens downloaded from NIAID Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) in March 2020. We aim to update this viral reference database every four months or when significant novel pathogen species are discovered.
