<p>To distinguish species present in the data and artifacts, the pipeline implements the following filtering of the mapping results: (I) retain mapped reads with a mapping quality &gt;50; (II) retain reads that have &gt;80% of the bases mapped to the reference sequence (i.e. if the length of a read is 1000 bp, &gt;800 bp are required to be mapped). Viral species with ≥2 mapped reads or one mapped read longer than 400 bp are reported.</p>
