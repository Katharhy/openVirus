<p>The continuous improved data yield from each ONT flow cell permits users to make more efficient use and reduce cost by multiplexing several samples in a single sequencing run. Our previous work has shown that barcode contamination reads could account for &lt;1% of the total reads from a multiplexed sequencing run (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), highlighting the need for careful barcode demultiplexing and the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity that applies to the demultiplexing methods. NanoSPC enables three demultiplexing modes, namely default-porechop, strict-porechop, and qcat. The default-porechop mode requires a barcode sequence to be present at either end of each read using porechop (

The strict-porechop mode requires the same barcode sequence to be present at both ends of each read, minimizing the number of misclassified reads. The qcat mode employs the demultiplexer offered by ONT and works similar to the default-porechop mode, due to the fact that porechop has been deprecated.
