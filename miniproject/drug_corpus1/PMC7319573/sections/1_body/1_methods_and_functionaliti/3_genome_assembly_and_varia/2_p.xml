<p>NanoSPC enables three variant calling modes, namely nanopolish, medaka and clair. With the nanopolish mode, NanoSPC takes both sequencing reads of the fastq format and raw signal data of the fast5 format as inputs, and applies Nanopolish (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) to detect single nucleotide variants. The pipeline considers candidate variants from the aligned reads when the variant frequency is &gt;10% and the mapping depth is &gt;10. To distinguish true variants and artifacts, NanoSPC keeps variants that the number of signal reads used to call the variant are &gt;10 and the fraction of signal reads that support the variant are &gt;75%. Finally, reads are mapped against the consensus sequence and only positions that are supported by &gt;70% of mapped reads are kept.
