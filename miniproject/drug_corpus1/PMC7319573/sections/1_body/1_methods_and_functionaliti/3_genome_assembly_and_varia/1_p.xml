<p>Whole genome sequencing can provide high-resolution investigation of transmission and characterization of the spatiotemporal spread of outbreaks. While low accuracy on the sequencing read level (âˆ¼90%) is a major limitation of nanopore sequencing, genome assembly can generate high-accuracy consensus sequence with adequate sequencing depth. The full genome consensus sequences generated by NanoSPC have been used to delineate nosocomial transmission of influenza A virus and human metapneumovirus, contributing to improvement of infection prevention and control practices (
