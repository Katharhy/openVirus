<p>While the nanopolish mode can generate consensus sequence with high accuracy, it is computationally intensive and time consuming, due to the large size of fast5 signal data. Therefore, signal based variant calling methods present a challenge to data storage, transfer, and analysis. Fortunately, with the Medaka and clair mode, NanoSPC applies Medaka (ONT) and clair (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) to detect single nucleotide variants. The advantages of these two modes is that they only take fastq format sequencing reads, and can be competitive with the nanopolish mode and being much faster.
