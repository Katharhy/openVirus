<p>NanoSPC takes Nanopore sequencing reads of the fastq format and, optionally, raw signal data of the fast5 format as input (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We have tested the pipeline with fastq reads produced by the R9.4 and R9.4.1 version flow cells, native and rapid barcoding kits. The acceptable multi-read fast5 format should contain data pertaining to multiple reads in each fast5 file. While NanoSPC is designed to analyze Nanopore sequencing data, some of its modules could be used to analyze sequencing data from other platforms, such as PacBio or Illumina. The pipeline investigates the quality of the sequencing reads using NanoPlot (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). A comprehensive statistical summary is produced to report the overall data quality, including number of reads, total nucleotide bases, mean and median read length, and quality scores. In addition, a variety of informative graphs are generated to display multiple aspects of the data, such as cumulative yield plot showing efficiency of the flow cell against time, heat map of the physical layout of the flow cell comparing the efficiency of each channel, and violin plots showing base call quality against time.
