<p>If influenza viruses are identified from the sequencing data, the pipeline determines the type of influenza virus (A or B) and the HA and NA subtype of influenza A virus based on the reference sequences. The pipeline analyzes assembled consensus sequences of Neuraminidase and Matrix 2 genes to identify mutations that confer resistance to antiviral agents, including oseltamivir, zanamivir, and amantadine. Drug resistance mutations are listed in
