<p>We have applied NanoSPC to identify and assemble genomes of a range of pathogen species, including influenza viruses and human metapneumovirus, from Nanopore metagenomic sequencing data of clinical samples (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The generated sequences have been used to investigate drug resistance and genetic diversity of influenza viruses from a UK hospital during the 2018/19 influenza season. The sequences also provided high resolution characterization of nosocomial transmission of influenza A virus and human metapneumovirus, contributing to improvement of infection prevention and control practices (
