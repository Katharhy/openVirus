<p>We report NanoSPC, a scalable, portable, and cloud compatibilable pipeline for analyzing metagenomic sequencing data generated using ONT. NanoSPC differs from other pipelines, such as NanoPipe (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), by analyzing metagenomic sequencing data and identifying a range of organisms without a priori knowledge of species contained in the data. The implementation of cloud computing enables NanoSPC to increase the ease and efficiency of analysis of high throughput Nanopore metagenomic data. The analysis results can potentially be used in multiple clinical and public health applications.
