<p>Our future step is to include prediction of antiviral drug resistance for viral species, such as influenza A virus, and phylogenetic analysis in the pipeline. Other features including discovery of novel pathogen species, particularly viruses, are also under investigation. ONT is undergoing constant improvement in sequencing chemistry and library preparation methods. ONT has released a new sequencing chemistry (R10 version flow cell) that provides improved accuracy. Our pipeline should be able to process R10 data but validating tests have not been conducted due to data availability. We are committed to continuously update our pipeline with the development of bioinformatics tools to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the data analysis.</p>
