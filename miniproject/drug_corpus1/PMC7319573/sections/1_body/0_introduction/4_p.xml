<p>Here, we introduce NanoSPC, a scalable, portable and cloud compatible pipeline for analyzing Nanopore sequencing data. NanoSPC can identify potentially pathogenic viruses and bacteria simultaneously to provide comprehensive characterization of individual samples. The pipeline can also detect single nucleotide variants and assemble high quality complete consensus genome sequences, which permits inference of transmission with high resolution. We implement NanoSPC using Nextflow pipeline manager within Docker images to allow reproducibility and portability of the analysis. We deploy NanoSPC to our scalable pathogen pipeline platform, enabling elastic computing for high throughput data via HPC cluster as well as multiple commercial cloud platforms.</p>
