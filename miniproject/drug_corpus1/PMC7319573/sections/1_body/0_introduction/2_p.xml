<p>Metagenomic sequencing has the capacity to detect all potential pathogens from individual clinical samples, and provide genomic information for comprehensive characterization of the pathogens, microbiome analyses, and investigation of epidemiology and transmission (

Metagenomic sequencing with ONT has the potential to become a point-of-care test for infectious diseases in clinical and public health settings, providing rapid diagnosis of infection, guide individual patient management and treatment strategies, and informing infection prevention and control practices (
