<p>Nanopore sequencing data is characterized by high error rates (approximately 10% with state of art chemistry and basecalling algorithms) compared to next generation sequencing (approximately 0.1%) (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). A variety of bioinformatic tools have been developed to overcome such high error rates and improve data quality for each step associated with the analysis, including basecalling, reads mapping, variants calling, and genome assembly (
