  <p>A hypothesis of the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and cell pyroptosis. The COVID-19 may be linked to cell pyroptosis, especially in lymphocytes through the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Morphological changes in lymphocytes and macrophages, nucleic acid and protein levels in classical and non-classical cells, detection of NLRP3 and GSDMD, and the role of inflammatory cytokines IL-1Î² and IL-18 requires further research.</p>
