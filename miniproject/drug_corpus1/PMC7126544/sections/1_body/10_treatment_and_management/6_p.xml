<p id="p0430">Due to lack of valid evidence and possible adverse effects, routine use of corticosteroid should be avoided unless for specific reasons. Baillie JK et al. [
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] suggested that corticosteroid should not be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury or shock, because of the lack of evidence that patients with COVID-19 will benefit from corticosteroid. In the first 41 patients, only 22% (9/41) patients were given corticosteroid, with six of these in the ICU [

 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], 45% (62/138) patients received corticosteroid treatment. In Guan's study, 18.6% (204/1099) of patients were given systemic corticosteroids [
