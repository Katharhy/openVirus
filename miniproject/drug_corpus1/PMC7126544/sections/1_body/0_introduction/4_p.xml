<p id="p0060">Coronaviruses were first identified in the 1960s. It is not known for how long they have existed. Most of the time they are associated with mild disease, but every few years a highly virulent strain appears. The pathogenesis of these deadly epidemics is unclear. An examination of the structure of the viruses and the mechanism of infection may help elucidate and provide information for the development of effective treatment and possibly vaccines. Our purpose of this review is to provide a brief summary of the epidemiology and history of SARS, as well as the lessons learned. The other aim is to review the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical characteristics, diagnosis and management of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to better understand this deadly coronavirus and suggest prevention, treatment and management strategies.</p>
