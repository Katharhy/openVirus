<p id="p0095">To date, there is no anti-viral therapeutics that specifically targets human coronaviruses, so treatment is only supportive. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic>, interferons (IFNs) are only partially effective against coronaviruses [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic>, the effectiveness of IFNs combined with ribavirin requires further evaluation [
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A variety of other agents, including antiviral peptides and corticosteroids have been shown to be effective 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and/or in animal models [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, clinical evidence does not support the use of corticosteroid treatment for SARS-CoV-2 lung injury [
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Vaccines that have been developed are either not effective, or in some cases have been reported to be involved in the selection of novel pathogenic CoVs via recombination of circulating strains [

 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Vaccine development can be a challenge. It is noteworthy that almost 20 years after SARS, there is still no vaccine for coronavirus.
