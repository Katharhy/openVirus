<p id="p0075">There are three primary ways to transmit the virus, including close person-to-person contact, aerosol transmission, and transmission by touch [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>]. The virus is thought to be transmitted to other people by respiratory droplets during coughing or sneezing. Droplet spread can occur when an infected person sneezes or coughs, whereupon virus containing droplets are propelled up to 3 feet through the air and are deposited on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, or eyes of persons who are nearby. A recent report suggests that transmission through the ocular surface is also possible [
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The other avenues for the spread of the virus are shaking hands with an infected person, touching an infected object/surface, frequent touching of the nose or mouth or coming into contact with a patient's excreta. Another avenue is through “hidden transmission” [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], in which asymptomatic infected individuals or carriers unknowingly transmit the virus to unsuspecting contacts.
