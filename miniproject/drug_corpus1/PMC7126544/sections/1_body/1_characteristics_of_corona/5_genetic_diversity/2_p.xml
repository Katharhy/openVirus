 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For SARS-CoV, the mutation rate in the SARS-CoV genome was estimated to be 0.80–2.38 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> nucleotide substitutions per site per year, and the nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates were estimated to be 1.16–3.30 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> and 1.67–4.67 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> per site per year, respectively, which are similar to that of other RNA viruses [
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The various CoVs of animal origin undergo evolution and genetic recombination either within the host species or upon jumping from one species to another. Such changes thus have the potential to lead to variants that have high pathogenic potential when transmitted to humans [
