<p id="p0065">CoVs are enveloped with a non-segmented, positive-sense, single-strand RNA, with size ranging from 26,000 to 37,000 bases. This is the largest known genome among RNA viruses [
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The genomic structure of CoVs is as follows: 5′-leader-UTR-replicase-S (Spike)–E (Envelope)-M (Membrane)-N (Nucleocapsid)-3′UTRpoly (A) tail. There are accessory genes interspersed within the structural genes at the 3′ end of genome [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], some of which have been shown to play an important roles in viral pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The S protein is responsible for receptor-binding and subsequent viral entry into host cells, the M and E proteins play important roles in viral assembly, and the N protein is necessary for RNA synthesis [
