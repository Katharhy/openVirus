<p id="p0310">The SARS-CoV-2 needs to be distinguished from other known viral pneumonias including influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, as well as 
 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic>, chlamydia pneumonia, and bacterial pneumonias. For patients with underlying diseases, attention should be paid to the detection of invasive fungal infections. The differential diagnosis also includes non-infectious diseases such as vasculitis, dermatomyositis, and organizing pneumonia. It should be noted that often patients with viral pneumonia may test positive to multiple viruses, and the potential lethality of a combined SARS-CoV-2/influenza virus infection should not be ignored.
