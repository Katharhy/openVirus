<p id="p0500">The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic of 2020 in China is an international crisis, affecting human lives, the global economy, societal views and lifestyle. During times of crisis, misinformation, blame and conspiracy theories abound. It is probably prudent to not entirely trust the media, whether local, regional or international, as each most likely has their own agenda. On the other hand, it is the responsibility of doctors and scientists to evaluate the events to ascertain whether or not more effective management of the crisis could have been attained. This comes with its own set of challenges, as hindsight is always 20/20.</p>
