<p id="p0470">Research institutions and pharmaceutical companies worldwide are stepping up research and development for a coronavirus vaccine. Virus strains have been isolated from patientsâ€™ samples and provide the basis for research and development of a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. Although vaccines have been developed for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, these are not commercially available [

Since the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, basic research on coronaviruses and advances in vaccine preparation technology can significantly shorten the development time of new coronavirus vaccines. However, the difficulties and challenges of developing an effective vaccine have been discussed earlier, and the key to a successful vaccine program is to vaccinate people before an outbreak occurs, not begin to develop the vaccine during the outbreak. Development of animal models that faithfully mimic SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is critical not only in providing a more refined understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms involved but also to serve as a screening model for potential chemotherapeutic agents and vaccines.
