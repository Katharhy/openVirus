<p id="p0480">The strict control of cross-infection in medical institutions is also key to preventing the further spread of the epidemic. In addition, actively mobilizing the population to participate in epidemic prevention and control is critical, and this can be achieved by accurate information dissemination and ongoing updates. Real-time updating the information of the epidemic situation can help to alleviate panic and reduce societal anxiety. A strong public health surveillance system to guide the response to the outbreak is important in the face of a lack of effective therapeutics or vaccines. Big data and artificial intelligence systems are tools that can be used to fully integrate the information, conduct comprehensive research and analyze public health risks. Last but not least, use of the Internet and the media to conduct health education for the people, publicize the correct knowledge of prevention, and offer online consultation to guide patients to seek medical treatment correctly are additional strategies that can be implemented to achieve viral containment.</p>
