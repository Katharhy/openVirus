 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> . Since both SARS and SARS-CoV-2 appear to have an exotic animal origin, the purchase, trafficking, and sale of wild animals should be banned, and illegal activities should be prosecuted. Early recognition of the problem, early identification of infected patients and early mobilization of healthcare resources are critical in limiting morbidity and mortality. When an outbreak occurs, it is very important to rapidly identify and characterize the pathogen, in order to be able to develop diagnostic assays. In the early stage of the disease epidemic, summarizing the clinical characteristics and treatment efficacy, formulating the diagnosis procedures, defining suspected cases and locations, determining transmission patterns, isolating contagious patients and formulating the appropriate quarantine strategy are all necessary and need to be implemented promptly.
