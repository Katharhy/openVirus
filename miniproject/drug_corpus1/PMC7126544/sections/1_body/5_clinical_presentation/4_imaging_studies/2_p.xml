<p id="p0295">In Huang's study [
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], all 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest computed tomography (CT) and 40 (98%) had bilateral involvement. The ICU patients on admission had bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation. The non-ICU patients had bilateral ground-glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation. Subsequent chest CT images showed bilateral ground-glass opacity, whereas the consolidation was resolved. In Chen's study [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], imaging showed that 74 patients had bilateral pneumonia, 14 patients had multiple mottled and ground-glass opacities, and 1 patient had a pneumothorax. In Wang's study [
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], imaging showed that 138 patients had bilateral patchy shadows or ground-glass opacity. In Guan's study, 840 of 1099 patients received chest CT on admission which showed that 76.4% had pneumonia, but 23.9% of severe cases had no radiologic abnormality on initial presentation. Ground-glass opacity (50.0%) and bilateral patchy shadow (46.0%) were the most common findings [
