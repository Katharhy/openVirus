 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the blood counts of patients on admission showed leucopenia and lymphopenia. Prothrombin time and D-dimer levels on admission were higher in ICU patients. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, G-SCF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, and TNFα. In Chen's study [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], all patients were tested for nine respiratory pathogens and nucleic acids of influenza viruses A and B, as well as bacteria and fungi. No other respiratory viruses were detected, but 4 cases of fungal and 1 case of bacterial infection were found. The absolute number of leukocytes was decreased in 9 patients and increased in 24 patients. The absolute neutrophil count was increased in 38 patients and the absolute lymphocyte count was decreased in 35 patients. Forty-three patients had varying degrees of liver dysfunction, seven patients had varying degrees of renal dysfunction, and most patients had abnormal myocardial zymograms. Seventy-three patients were tested for C-reactive protein which was increased in 63 patients. In Guan's study, 82.1%, 36.2%, and 33.7% of the patients had lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, respectively. Compared with non-severe cases, severe cases had more prominent laboratory abnormalities [
