A few patients have symptoms such as nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, and diarrhea. Some patients only have a low fever, mild fatigue, and no pneumonia. In severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties occurring more than one week after infection. Critical patients may progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and even death. It is worth noting that during the course of severe and critical patients, there can be moderate to low-grade fever or even no obvious fever.
