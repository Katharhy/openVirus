 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Their study reported the clinical features of the first 41 patients admitted to the designated hospital in Wuhan who were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 by January 2, 2020. Twenty-seven (66%) of the 41 patients had been exposed to the Huanan seafood market. Common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (98%), cough (76%), and myalgia or fatigue (44%). Less common symptoms were sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, and diarrhea. Dyspnea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients and 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. The median time from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 7.0 days, to shortness of breath was 8.0 days, and to ARDS was 9.0 days. Almost a third of patients developed ARDS requiring intensive care, 5 patients had acute cardiac injury, and 4 patients required assisted ventilation. Eventually 28 patients were discharged, 13 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 6 patients died.
