<p id="p0315">Several rapid and sensitive detection tests have been developed for the prevention and control of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. At present, seven products including the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection kit (fluorescent PCR method) and the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid sequencing system have been approved on an emergency basis by the National Medical Products Administration. Biological product companies have expanded production of detection kits for the new coronavirus. The use of detection kits can accelerate accurate diagnosis of patients, help to determine quarantine and isolation requirements, assist in determining the treatment of patients and save limited medical resources. However, the rapidity of spread of the disease has led to an insufficient supply of detection kits.</p>
