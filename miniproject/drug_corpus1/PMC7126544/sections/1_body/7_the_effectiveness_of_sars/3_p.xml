<p id="p0320">It is worth noting that there have been confirmed patients whose viral nucleic acid tests are negative multiple times in the early stages, and there have also been confirmed cases whose throat swabs were negative for the viral nucleic acid test but positive in alveolar lavage fluid. Correlation of Chest CT and RT-PCR testing of 1014 cases showed that CT had a 88% had a positive CT scan but only 59% had positive RT-PCR. [

Sampling techniques, extraction and detection of viral nucleic acids, and diagnostic reagents may affect the test results. More attention should be paid to the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic reagents, and diagnostic decisions should rely on comprehensive judgment based on the clinical manifestations, laboratory results and imaging examinations of patients. According to the latest guideline of the NHC [
