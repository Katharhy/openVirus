<p id="p0210">Li et al. [
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] showed that human-to-human transmission among close contacts has been occurring since the middle of December 2019. Further dissemination has continued rapidly over the ensuing months. The authors estimated that the reproduction number (R
 <sub>0</sub>) for SARS-CoV-2 is 2.2, meaning that every infected person can infect a mean of 2.2 people. In another study, the reproduction number of the SARS-CoV-2 was 2.68 with an epidemic doubling time of 6.4 days [
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. It is worth noting that a nucleic acid fragment of the SARS-CoV-2 was detected by Guangzhou Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on a doorknob touched by a confirmed patient [
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. China Daily reported that scientists have discovered that stool samples from patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 have also tested positive for the virus [
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], and that the virus was also detected in the loose stool of the first patient in the US infected with the virus [
 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], meaning the virus has the potential to be spread through contaminated fecal material.
