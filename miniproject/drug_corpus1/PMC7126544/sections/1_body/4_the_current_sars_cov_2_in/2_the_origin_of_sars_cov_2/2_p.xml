<p id="p0200">A cluster of cases of viral pneumonia of unknown etiology, now known as SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province and were reported to health authorities on the December 29, 2019 [

 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). Researchers found that the SARS-CoV-2 showed a higher sequence homology to Bat-CoV-RaTG13 that was previously detected in 
 <italic>Rhinolophus affinis</italic> from Yunnan Province than Bat-SL-CoVZC21 and Bat-SL-CoVZC45, which suggested that the Chinese chrysanthemum bat is the origin of SARS-CoV-2. More recently, the pangolin was believed to be the likely intermediate host due to the fact that there appeared to be approximately 99% sequence homology between SARS-Co V-2 and the consensus sequence derived from &gt;1000 metagenomic samples from the pangolin species [
