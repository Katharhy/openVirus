<p id="p0380">The combination of SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2 of host cells is similar to the combination of SARS-CoV and ACE2, indicating that they have the same mechanism to entry into host cells [
 <xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. The S protein of metastable prefusion conformation undergoes a series of structural rearrangements to combine with the viral membrane of host cells [
 <xref rid="bib111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. This process consists of the S1 subunit binding to the host cell receptor, triggering of the prefusion trimer's instability, and shedding of the S1 subunit, resulting in a highly stable post-fusion conformation of the S2 subunit [
 <xref rid="bib121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. During the binding of the subunit S1 to its cognate receptor, it is important to note that the S1 subunit exists in 2 different states, a “down” conformation and an “up” conformation state, which corresponds to a receptor-inaccessible state and an unstable receptor-accessible state, respectively [

 <xref rid="bib124" ref-type="bibr">[124]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib125" ref-type="bibr">[125]</xref>]. Unfortunately, there are significant conformational differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 such that the commercially available monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV do not react with SARS-CoV-2 [
