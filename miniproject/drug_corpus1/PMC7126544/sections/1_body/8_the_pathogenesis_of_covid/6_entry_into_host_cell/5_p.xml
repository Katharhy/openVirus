Though the respiratory systems is a primary target of SARS-CoV-2, bioinformatic analysis of single-cell transcriptomes datasets of lung, esophagus, gastric, ileum and colon reveal that the digestive system is also a potential route of entry for COVID-19, as ACE2 was not only highly expressed in lung AT2 cells, esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells but also in absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon [
