<p id="p0375">Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) are known host receptors for the Î²-CoVs SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively [
 <xref rid="bib116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. In similar fashion to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also uses ACE2 to gain entry into host cells. Hoffmann et al. found that the cellular protease MPRSS2 blocks entry by cleaving the spike protein and may constitute a treatment option [
 <xref rid="bib118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Zhou et al. also confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 is able to use all but mouse ACE2 as an entry receptor for ACE2-expressing cells, but not cells without ACE2, indicating that the cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 could be ACE2, and not other coronavirus receptors such as aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 [

 <xref rid="bib119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. However, Wrapp et al. found that SARS-CoV-2 S binding to ACE2 has approximately 10- to 20- fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV S, which can provide one explanation why SARS-CoV-2 has more human-to human spread compared to SARS-CoV [
