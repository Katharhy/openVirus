<p id="p0335">The term “cell pyroptosis” was first proposed in 2001 [
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. In recent decades, there has been increasing evidence suggesting that “pyroptosis” is a novel inflammatory form of programmed cell death. In 2019, Chen et al. found that SARS-CoV Viroporin 3a triggered the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the secretion of IL-1β in bone marrow-derived macrophages, suggesting SARS-CoV induced cell pyroptosis [

 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As the rise of IL-1β is a downstream indicator of cell pyroptosis, this may suggest that cell pyroptotic activity is likely to be activated and involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, as both classical and non-classical pyroptosis signaling can induce the release of IL-1β, it is unclear which pathway is involved in COVID-19. Based on existing data, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to cause cell pyroptosis, especially in lymphocytes, through the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. The pathways involved in the activation of the signaling between NLRP3m IL-1β, IL-18 and GSDMD are illustrated in
