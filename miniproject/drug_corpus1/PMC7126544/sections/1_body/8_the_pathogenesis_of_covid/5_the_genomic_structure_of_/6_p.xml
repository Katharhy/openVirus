<p id="p0360">Spike glycoprotein consists of S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit contains a signal peptide, an N-terminal domain (NTD) and RBD, while the S2 subunit includes the conserved fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2), transmembrane domain (TM), and cytoplasmic domain (CP) [

The S2 subunit is therefore targeted when screening broad spectrum antiviral peptides, which is an important piece of information that can be used to develop preventive and treatment measures. Most recently, the 3D structure of S protein was elucidated using Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM), and the RBD structure of the S protein is closer to the central location of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV [
