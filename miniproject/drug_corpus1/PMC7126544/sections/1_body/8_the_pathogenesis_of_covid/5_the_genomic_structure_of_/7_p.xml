 <xref rid="bib106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. The N protein contains two domains, both of which can bind virus RNA genomes via different mechanisms. It has been reported that the N protein can bind nsp3 protein to help tether the genome to replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC) and package the encapsulated genome into virions [
