<p id="p0355">The identities of 5′- and 3′-UTR sequences are more than 83.6% consistent between SARS-CoV-2 and other β-CoVs, such as SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bib102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. The replicase polyproteins ppla and pp1ab encoded by the largest genes orf1ab are proteolytic and have been reported to function in the replication of CoVs by regulatory elements located within the non-structural proteins [
 <xref rid="bib102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Four structural proteins (S, E, M and N) contribute to virion assembly and infection of CoVs. The spike protein located on the surface of viral particles is made up of homotrimers of S proteins and is the key for the viral attachment to host receptors [
