 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) to visualize and modify receptor and inhibitor structures. MEGA X utilized for multiple sequences and phylogenic analyses. AutoDock 4.2 (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, San Diego, USA) was used for the preliminary docking program in this study. The inhibitor PDBQT file format was prepared, and the grid box size was determined using AutoDock Tools version 1.5.4 (ADT; Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, San Diego, USA).
