<p>Molecular docking perceived 
 <italic>in silico</italic> structure-based strategy is broadly utilized in drug design and discovery approaches. Molecular docking empowers to identify novel compounds of therapeutic interest for the emerging pandemic infectious outbreaks by predicting the inhibitor-receptor interactions. Even though it initially evolved for assisting to understand the mechanism of molecular binding recognition among small compounds and receptor molecules, in recent years, uses and applications of molecular docking have profoundly changed to help in the rapid development of drug discovery (Khandare et al.,
