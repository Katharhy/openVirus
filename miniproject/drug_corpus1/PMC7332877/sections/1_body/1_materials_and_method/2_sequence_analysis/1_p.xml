In humans, coronaviruses were first identified in the mid of 1960s (Killerby et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) around the globe and primary sub-groupings of coronaviruses are known as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. Commonly infective human coronaviruses are 229E (alpha), NL63 (alpha), OC43 (beta), and HKU1 (beta). In last two decades SARS-CoV (2002) and MERS-CoV (2013) have evolved and now in 2019–
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged as a pandemic outbreak (Chen,
