<p>The novel human respiratory coronavirus initially called as 2019 â€“ Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCOV) and now called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emphasized the insurgency for therapeutic alternatives to alleviate and stop a novel evolving epidemic of infectious zoonotic diseases. Till now no therapeutic vaccine and drugs against 2019-nCoV are available. Previous epidemics of high-morbidity human coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV (2003) and MERS-CoV in 2012, motivated the characterization of compounds that could be potentially active against the currently emerging pandemic 2019-nCoV. The most promising compound, Remdesivir currently in clinical trials for treating the EBOV infections, also inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in tissue cultures, and displayed efficacy in non-human animal models. Besides, a combination of the HIV-1 protease inhibitors is shown to be effective in patients infected with SARS-CoV. This 
 <italic>in silico</italic> study also suggested that anti-viral protease inhibitor Remdesivir has the best docking score and binding activity when compared to selected inhibitors and existing peptides with 2019-nCoV of M
 <sup>pro</sup>. These inhibitors were tightly bound to the domains I and II cleft of very crucial key residues of Cys145 and His164 of 2019-nCoV, which could inhibit the replication and proliferation in the host, The 
 <italic>in silico</italic> assessment of a single dose with a combination of multiple protease inhibitors against the 2019-nCoV of M
 <sup>pro</sup> is the limitation of this study. This study will pave the path for the identification of potential personalized medicine by novel drug designing for different genomic mutations of 2019-nCoV.
