<p>Many ongoing clinical studies also suggests that Remdesivir is much better at inhibiting the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Remdesivir has shown wide therapeutic index and demonstrated anti-viral activity against RNA viruses and also are selective for viral polymerases along with low susceptibility to cause any human toxicity (Agostini et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Sheahan et al., 2020). Drug’s delayed chain-termination act is conceived as one of the most crucial mechanisms of action especially in treatment against MERS-CoV and EBOV (Siegel et al., 2017; Jordan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Tchesnokov et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In coronaviruses, Remdesivir also exhibited high genetic hurdle resistance and also permits one-time daily dosage because of its extended intracellular half-life (Agostini et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Sheahan et al., 2020). This 
 <italic>in silico</italic> study also suggests that Remdesivir has a good docking score with strong binding affinity and stable confirmations with the crucial residues Cys145, and His164 of M
 <sup>pro</sup>, which inhibits the replication and proliferation of 2019-nCoV. According to WHO, the recommended administration of Remdesivir for Ebola virus (EBOV) in single or multiple-dose phase intravenous between 3
 <bold> </bold>mg and 225
 <bold> </bold>mg. The risk for central nervous system, respiratory, or cardiovascular effects was considered low at projected therapeutic exposures and is well tolerated without any evidence of kidney or liver toxicity. Moreover, the consistent antiviral activity of Remdesivir for filoviruses (Ebola Zaire, Sudan, Bundibugyo, and Marburg) was observed. Similar antiviral activity was observed also against pathogenic coronaviruses (MERS and SARS CoV) and paramyxoviruses (Nipah and Hendra) discerning for viral polymerases. Thus, the present 
 <italic>in silico</italic> and ongoing clinical studies are also suggesting that the Remdesivir is a potent inhibitor against 2019-nCoV.
