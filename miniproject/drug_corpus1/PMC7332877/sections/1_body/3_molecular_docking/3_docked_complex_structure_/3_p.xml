<p>Moreover, similar trends were observed when calculating the rGyr of docked and native complexes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figure 7A</xref>). The rGyr represents the average distance between each atom complexes and the center of mass of the structures and was a useful value to provide a structural measure of the degree of compaction of the studied complexes with MD simulations. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6C</xref> depicts the evolution of the rGyr of each complex over the full MD simulations trajectories. The comparison of rGyr average trends towards native and docked depicts 23.66
 <bold> </bold>Å and 22.77
 <bold> </bold>Å, respectively displayed stable over time, suggesting that both complexes have reached a more compact structure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6C</xref>). Whereas, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6D and 6E</xref> shows the average SASA of both docked and native has 152.29 Å
 <sup>2</sup> and 161.99 Å
 <sup>2</sup> respectively were observed in 100
 <bold> </bold>ns simulations.
