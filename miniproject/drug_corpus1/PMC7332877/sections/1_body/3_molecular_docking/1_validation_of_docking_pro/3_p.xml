<p>Second, as we have found that 2019-nCoV (PDB ID: 6LU7) M
 <sup>pro</sup> have 100% sequence identity with BAT SARS-CoV (PDB ID: 2A5K), to validate the same using co-crystal structures, 2A5K with (5
 <bold> </bold>s,8s,14r)-ethyl 11-(3-amino-3-oxopropyl)-8-benzyl-14-hydroxy-5-isobutyl-3,6,9,12-tetraoxo-1-phenyl-2-oxa-4,7,10,11-tetraazapentadecan-15-oate (AZA) peptide (Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), with docked M
 <sup>pro</sup> with N3 peptide complex was taken and superimposed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4A</xref>). The resulted docked complex was superimposed with the native co-crystal structure, 2A5K with AZA peptide, the superimposition has 1.029Å RMSD, which precisely coincided with each other (
