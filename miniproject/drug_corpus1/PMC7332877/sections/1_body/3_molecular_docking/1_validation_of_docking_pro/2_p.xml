<p>At first, the docking was performed with the co-crystal structure of 2019-nCoV i.e. M
 <sup>pro</sup> with N3 peptide and the docked complex was superimposed with the native co-crystal structure, M
 <sup>pro</sup> with N3 peptide complex, the superimposition has 0.923Å RMSD, which precisely coincided with each other (
