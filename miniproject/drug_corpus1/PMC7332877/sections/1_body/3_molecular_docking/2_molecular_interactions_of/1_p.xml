<p>The docking complex of each M
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors with 2019-nCoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> was analysed by the Schrodinger maestro 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>-1 visualization tool. The selected anti-viral protease inhibitors led to the better docking score and binding interactions than N3 peptide within the cleft of domain I and domain II (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2B</xref>). The results revealed that the protease inhibitors were having better molecular docking scores with a strong binding affinity with the M
 <sup>pro</sup> of 2019-nCoV. The present study results also represented here are starting with better binding score to least binding score: Remdesivir &gt; Baloxavir marboxil &gt; Nafamostat &gt; Nitazoxanide &gt; Penciclovir &gt; Zanamivir &gt; Ribavirin &gt; Oseltamivir &gt; Chloroquine &gt; Favipiravir (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Thus, the evidence from the molecular docking score and binding affinity suggested that these inhibitors are eminently interacting with 2019-nCoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> and might be considered for therapeutic interventions of 2019-nCoV (
