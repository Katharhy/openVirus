<p>The 2019-nCoV is an enveloped positive-sense single-strand RNA virus, infecting primarily respiratory system. It also infects the gastrointestinal epithelial cells, macrophages, and other cell types, thereby triggering the systemic changes and damage to many vital organs for instance lung, heart, liver, kidney and adrenal gland. Anti-2019-nCoV therapeutics could target several major viral pathogeneses, such as virus-cell interactions, virus entry, intracellular viral replication, and virus assembly and exit (Lu,

 <sup>pro</sup> proteins share ∼99% identity in amino acid sequences and ∼100% binding site (
