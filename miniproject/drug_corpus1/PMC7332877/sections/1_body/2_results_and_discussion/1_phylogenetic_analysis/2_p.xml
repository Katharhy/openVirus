<p>The alignment shows that amongst the seven M
 <sup>pro</sup> protein sequences identical with BAT SARS-CoV, four sequences are from different Human Coronaviruses isolates, one from MERS CoV and one from BAT SARS CoV isolate. Notably, the 2019-nCoV of M
 <sup>pro</sup> is identical (100%) with BAT SARS-CoV and distantly related (âˆ¼34%) to Human Coronavirus, 229E (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1A</xref>). Results suggest that M
 <sup>pro</sup> of 2019-nCoV was evolved from BAT SARS-CoV.
