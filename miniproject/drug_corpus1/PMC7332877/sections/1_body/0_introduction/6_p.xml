<p>Various provinces of China and India have initiated trials using Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, known anti-malarial agent, as a heme polymerase inhibitor (Rathi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). It functions as a virus blocking agent via augmenting the endosomal, which is required for cell fusion and also by interfering with the glycosylation process of the cellular receptors of SARS-CoV (Vincent et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Multiple types of studies (double blind, Phase 3, randomized, open-label and Phase 4, open-label, non-randomized) are at the initiation stage of recruiting study subjects. (
