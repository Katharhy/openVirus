<p>Other antiviral drugs viz., Oseltamivir, and Zanamivir, which are neuraminidase inhibitors, are also under clinical trials. Efficacy of Oseltamivir (individually and in combination with other drugs) has been under interventional (Phase 3, clinical) trial to treat the 2019-nCoV Pneumonia in China and Thailand (

Clinical trials for the various antiviral drugs are ongoing to find an effective treatment for 2019-nCoV. However, since the time-period estimated for the completion of the trials is too long, bioinformatics technology used to assess the efficacy of each drug individually at a molecular level and in complex with multiple probabilities. Hence, in view of the complex mechanisms associated with various drugs, there is a need to identify the drug which targets viral replication especially on the M
 <sup>pro</sup> enzyme of 2019-nCoV. The most suitable drug/s predicted using bioinformatics tools and techniques may be used for further trials and may be prescribed for 2019-nCoV patients. Therefore, the current aim of the study is to dock the antiviral drugs (1) Remdesivir (2) Chloroquine (3) Favipiravir (4) Baloxavir Marboxil (5) Ribavirin (6) Penciclovir (7) Nafamostat (8) Nitazoxanide (9) Oseltamivir and (10) Zanamivir with M
 <sup>pro</sup> to understand their effectiveness against 2019-nCoV. The findings of the present study with detailed molecular level empathetic of M
 <sup>pro</sup> with potentiality-identified inhibitors might help in rational drug design to combat COVID-19.
