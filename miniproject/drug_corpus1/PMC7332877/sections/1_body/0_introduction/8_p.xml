<p>Wang et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) have evaluated seven antiviral drugs against a clinical isolate of 2019-nCoV 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Among the seven tested drugs, high concentrations of three drugs, i.e. Ribavirin, Penciclovir, and Favipiravir, shown to lower the viral infection. Nafamostat, a potent inhibitor of MERS-CoV, was inhibitive against the 2019-nCoV infection since it prevents membrane fusion. Nitazoxanide, an anti-protozoal agent having potential antiviral property against a wide range of coronaviruses also inhibited the 2019-nCoV at a low-micromolar concentration. Further, Remdesivir and Chloroquine were also found to be potently blocking virus infection at low-micromolar concentration.
