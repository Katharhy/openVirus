<p>The first line of treatment is targeted to treat the symptoms of the disease. Most of the symptoms of individuals affected with 2019-nCOV were similar to influenza, and both viruses cause respiratory issues. Influenza is a communicable disease caused by the influenza virus. This RNA virus contains seven genera: 
 <italic>Influenzavirus A, Influenzavirus B, Influenzavirus C, Influenzavirus D, Isavirus, Thogotovirus,</italic> and 
 <italic>Quaranjavirus.</italic> Among these, 
 <italic>Influenzavirus A, Influenzavirus B, Influenzavirus C</italic> can infect humans. The 
 <italic>Influenzavirus A</italic> virus is the most virulent human pathogens and can cause flu pandemics (Kumar et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In humans, some of the serotypes which are known to cause pandemic deaths are H1N1 (known to cause Spanish flu and Swine flu), H1N2 (endemic in humans and pigs), H2N2 (Asian flu), H3N2 (Hong Kong flu), H5N1 (bird flu), H7N7 (unusual zoonotic potential), and H7N2 (low pathogenicity avian influenza virus) (Hay et al.,
