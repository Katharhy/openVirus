<p>The study on viral composition revealed that the Hemagglutinin-Esterase (HE) glycoprotein gene is found in the beta coronaviruses, and this HE gene of coronaviruses have sequence homology with influenza HE glycoprotein and may reflect early recombination between the two viruses (Luytjes et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>). Additionally, coronavirus spike (S) protiens can get attached to the human cell (especially lungs) surfaces via angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) receptors. Primarily, S1/S2 site in the coronavirus S protein is subjected to proteolytic cleavage by host proteases (trypsin and furin). Later, cleavage of S2’ site occurs which releases fusion peptide and triggers the activation of membrane fusion mechanism (Boopathi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Hence, it can be assumed that the mode of action of the drugs used in the treatment of influenza can work successfully in the same line to treat 2019-nCOV. Therefore, the clinical trials conducted revealed that most of the drugs inhibit the critical components of the 2019-nCoV life cycle. The lifecycle includes viral entry into the host cell, viral replication, and viral RNA synthesis (Boopathi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The previous research exertions to develop the anti-viral drugs against the Coronaviridae family receptors via, ACE2, RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the main protease (M

 <sup>pro</sup> as an attractive drug target among coronaviruses family which is essential and have a Signiant role in processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA (Anand et al.,

 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). However, the M
 <sup>pro</sup> protein sequence of 2019-nCoV is similar to the sequences of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV proteins, which are mainly involved in the replication cycle (Harrison, 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Therefore, obstruction in the replication cycle may prove a suitable solution for the drug quest.
