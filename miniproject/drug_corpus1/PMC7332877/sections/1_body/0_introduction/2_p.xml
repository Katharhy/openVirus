<p>The contagious virus 2019-nCOV can spread primarily through the viral droplets of saliva and discharges from the nose of the infected person while coughing or sneezing and also touching contaminated surfaces (Pant et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The typical viral infection symptoms of 2019-nCoV are dry cough, running nose, fever, shortness of breath in majority of cases. Some cases reported severe conditions such as pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, kidney failure with fatal consequences (Elfiky, 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). However, as of now, there is no vaccine against this virus, which is the cause of the utmost trepidation globally. Nevertheless, the scientific fraternity all over the world has commenced with assiduous research work to understand the nature of virus, which may subsequently lead to the discovery of medicine and vaccine. However, several researchers have recognized that to investigate the routes of viral spread among humans, the site of activation must be identified. This led to identify the sites of various viruses including influenza family virus which enable uninterrupted spread of virus (Hasan et al.,
