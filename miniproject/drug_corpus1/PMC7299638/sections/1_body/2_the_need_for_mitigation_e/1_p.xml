<p id="Par26">Healthcare systems have been implemented to ensure citizens’ right of receiving appropriate and prompt care, as declared by the bill of right of many European Countries. In pandemics, unanticipated stresses challenge healthcare systems efficiency and performance, given the acute extraordinary shifts in patients’ needs and allocation of resources.
