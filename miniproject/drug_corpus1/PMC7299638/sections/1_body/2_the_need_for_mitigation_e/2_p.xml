<p id="Par27">The first and obvious measure is quarantining of infected individuals, which is nonetheless limited by the challenge of identifying and isolating asymptomatic individuals and the high false negative rate of microbiological screening tests [

Next, use of protective equipment, especially by health-care providers, is a mainstay of mitigation strategy but might be limited by shortage of material or misuse due to lack of operative skills. In the context of uncontrollable spreading of communicable diseases, social limitations and home confinement are extreme measures, even though made more bearable by the availability of social digital technologies. To make social distancing more feasible, a number of issues should be addressed and, in the context of care delivering, reducing unnecessary direct patientsâ€™ interaction with health-care providers is a priority requiring maximum efforts to adapt to and may be prolonged to the post-pandemic period, according to transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There is particular concern for aging individuals, where coexisting comorbidities and consequent polypharmacy carry the risk of adverse events in terms of loss of control of chronic diseases, lack of therapeutic adherence, drug-related adverse events and need for urgent care, which would put both the patient and health care providers at risk of infection. In addition, uncontrolled chronic airway diseases could contribute to SARS-CoV-2 dissemination through coughing or sneezing, especially during periods of increased pollen exposure. Delivering targeted educational programs and action plans to enact in case of disease exacerbation is essential. Patients should be routinely checked about their technical skills (e.g. inhaler use) and treatment adherence and remotely monitored for initial signs of physical or psychological decompensation, possibly by using mobile health technology [
