<p id="Par29">In general, acute access to allergic emergency or life-threatening acute events is mandatory even during pandemics. As to outpatients, scheduled in-person visits for severe and poorly controlled allergic diseases should be regularly provided, by instructing patients to enter the clinic in a precise time-range and respect social distancing. To reduce the risk of in-hospital spread of the infection, COVID-19 and COVID-19 free-zones can be created by predisposing check-points at COVID-19 free-zone entrance to detect patients with fever (&gt; 37.5 °C), screen for symptoms of active infection and/or contact with COVID-19 positive individuals. Conversely, accesses for mild-to-moderate disease in well-controlled patients can be transitioned to a digital medicine service (DMS), including phone, video and email consults [

When patients experience worsening symptoms requiring timely evaluation, digital tele-triaging should be arranged in order to segregate patients suitable for remote monitoring and therapeutic adjustment (for example, by providing them with an up-to-date action plan) from those requiring in-person visits and access to health-care facilities. Psychological and physical barriers to treatment adherence and comorbidities causing loss of control might be safely addressed and resolved by teleconsultations. Moreover, digital teletriaging of patients experiencing worsening respiratory symptoms can provide an invaluable aid at suspecting COVID-19 and activating general practitioners to monitor and/or investigate suspected patients [

Patients waiting for diagnostic work-up or experiencing troublesome lack of comfort with therapeutic recommendations can access to digital platforms in order to contact their caring specialist. Objective questionnaires administered on-line may help deal with patients who poorly perceive their symptoms. We specify that some of these clinical interventions and ascertainments may be provided by health providers collaborating with allergists in multidisciplinary teams, such as specialized nurses, dietitians, ENT physicians and psychologists.
