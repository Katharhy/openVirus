<p id="Par34">First line anti-allergy agents, such as anti-histamines and low-dose steroids, are not likely to affect immunocompetence and should not be discontinued during the pandemic (for disease specific recommendations, see “
 <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">Disease-specific management</xref>” section), provided systemic corticosteroid posology remains under the immunosuppressive threshold [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and that all strategies to reduce systemic corticosteroid use should be applied independently from the pandemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Notably, regular steroid-based regimens, including inhaled and oral corticosteroids, should not be stopped, since abrupt interruption would bring along an increased risk of adrenal insufficiency in case of acute stressing events, as COVID-19 is [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Conversely, a pulsed dose of steroids could result in a protective effect in such a circumstance [
