<p id="Par28">Since allergic diseases are highly heterogeneous in severity and risk of exacerbation, both at inter- and intra-patient levels, in the event of acute outpatients’ service rationing aimed at mitigating virus spread, patients’ access to allergy services has to be rationalized [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A gradual escalation in acute service reduction would be preferable but might not be applicable in case of tumultuous spread of the virus. Similarly, “phase 2” re-opening policies should be based on gradualism and prudence. To this aim, a risk-stratified approach can be applied by considering patients’ clinical needs and in accordance to local and institutional policies. Therefore, acute service reduction can be arranged through combinations of measures that could change form nation to nation according to local epidemiology and socio-political trends. In such a highly dynamic setting, it is difficult to forecast how long the pandemic will last and whether subsequent “waves” of COVID-19 will require additional lockdowns before herd immunity is reached or a vaccine becomes available. Thus integrated planning is essential to keep allergy clinics and allergists operative in the long-term.
