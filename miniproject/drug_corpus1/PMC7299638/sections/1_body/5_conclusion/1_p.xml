<p id="Par45">We are now in the middle of the storm and we do not know how long it will last or whether additional consequences are on the horizon. In these times of suspense, we have the responsibility of balancing individual patientsâ€™ needs with public health issues.

We therefore advocate for a risk-stratified approach aimed at conjugating COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 health care needs of allergic patients. We have to reshape our practice and optimize those innovative tools that help us reduce the risk of viral spreading while delivering up-to-date personalized care. A new era of integrated precision-digital medicine is knocking at the door.</p>
