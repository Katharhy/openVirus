<p id="Par25">Some allergic diseases, like allergic rhinitis, CRSwNP and asthma, can simulate symptoms of COVID-19: cough and dyspnoea are shared with asthma, while runny nose and headache are frequent symptoms in allergic rhinitis and CRSwNP. In addition, this pandemic started in the spring season when the majority of patients with seasonal allergies suffers from partially similar symptoms. Anxiety is associated to both chronic airways diseases and COVID-19 pandemic, acting as a confounding factor that should be carefully factored in when interpreting subjective symptoms. From a different perspective, it has been reported that COVID-19 patients might present with skin signs and symptoms of urticaria and eczema resembling those acute urticaria or drug reactions, thus posing a diagnostic challenge to dermatologists and allergists [

A combined MASK-air-COVID app will be launched and will differentiate rhinitis/asthma symptoms from those of COVID-19 (personal communication form Prof. Bousquet).
