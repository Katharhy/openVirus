<p id="Par24">The susceptibility to and severity of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection positively correlate with age and comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The spectrum of clinical presentations is variable, from asymptomatic and mild clinical symptoms to acute respiratory-distress syndrome (ARDS) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Adults with mild COVID-19 most commonly manifest fever, cough, conjunctivitis, fatigue and anosmia, which in some patients can be accompanied by runny nose and headache. In the more severe clinical presentations, the patient feels worsening dyspnoea and general exhaustion. Additional symptoms such as diarrhea are less common. When the virus affects the lung, it can cause interstitial pneumonia [
