<p id="Par44">Expert recommendations and consensus on these topics during COVID-19 epidemics are missing at the time of this manuscript being written. As a general principle, we maintain that ongoing treatment for these conditions should not to be discontinued in order to keep disease under control as far as these treatments are not likely to increase the risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection or complicate COVID-19 course in case of infection. A possible exception might be represented by patients on immunosuppressive regimens (e.g. cyclosporine for chronic spontaneous urticaria), in whom shift to a biological agent with a more favorable safety profile might be considered on a case-by-case basis (e.g. close contact with infected individuals, active infection) [

For new evaluations, diagnostic procedures should be postponed during the epidemics peak and reconsidered on a second time, unless urgently needed (e.g. severe reactions to Hymenoptera venom). We highlight that urticaria can be a presenting sign of COVID-19 and allergy to drugs used to treat COVID-19 can present with rashes that may involve the allergistâ€™s evaluation [
