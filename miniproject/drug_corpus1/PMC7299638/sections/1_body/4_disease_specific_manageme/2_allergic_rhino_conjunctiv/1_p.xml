<p id="Par40">Allergic rhino-conjunctivitis-specific recommendations from allergic rhinitis and its impact on asthma (ARIA) and European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) are reported in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Allergic rhinitis visits should not be prioritized and can be safely postponed unless exceptional circumstances supervene. Intranasal steroids do not induce immunosuppression and are not to discontinue [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. As stated above, optimal disease control is mandatory as sneezing in asymptomatically infected patients can contribute to viral spread; mobile applications can contribute in improving optimal self-management of rhinitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For AIT-specific recommendations, see Table
