It is unknown whether increased risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection or disease severity is associated with atopic dermatitis due to impaired cutaneous barrier. Patients on immunosuppressive therapy for severe atopic dermatitis should be strictly monitored or transitioned to safer anti-IL4/IL13 immune-modulatory agents, as advocated by the European Task Force on atopic dermatitis [

Food allergy and allergic gastrointestinal diseases are prevalent comorbidities in atopic dermatitis, especially in children; careful evaluation is needed and food challenge should be performed to prevent unnecessary food avoidance interfering with growth and micronutrients balance [

Asthmatic patients with food allergies may need to be provided with epinephrine auto injectors (see the following section on anaphylaxis management) and should avoid introducing new foods in their diets during the pandemic as long as the risk of contagion is high [
