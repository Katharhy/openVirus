<p id="Par39">Asthma-specific recommendations from Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) are reported in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Data are controversial regarding the interaction between asthma and COVID-19 as European and Chinese data suggest a lower risk for asthmatic patients to contract the infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] while U.S. data suggest the opposite [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Probably this association is modulated by the severity of asthma, age class, and levels of indoor and outdoor, allergen and pollution exposures. With knowledge evolving, GINA and the British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend not stopping the regular treatment regimen, including inhaled and oral corticosteroids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], since abrupt interruption would bring along an increased risk of acute/severe exacerbations or adrenal insufficiency [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Every patient should be provided with a detailed and convenient action plan to deal with potential loss of control [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and invited to regularly use mobile health technology apps to self-monitor symptoms of their asthma [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Aerosol generating procedures are discouraged unless essential and lung function testing should be postponed whenever possible [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].
