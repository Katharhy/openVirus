<p id="Par43">A modified anaphylaxis management algorithm during COVID-19 pandemic has been proposed by Casale et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Patients are invited to carry two epinephrine injectors and to activate emergency services only when a second administration of epinephrine fails to control symptoms. It might be prudent to proactively discuss the modified management of anaphylaxis, if feasible, e.g., via telemedicine. Home delivery service of self-injectable adrenaline should be implemented, provided the patient has been instructed on the underlying disease, triggers avoidance measures and proper use.
