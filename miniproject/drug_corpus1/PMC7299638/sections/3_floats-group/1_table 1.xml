The possibility of expanding injection intervals in the continuation phase should be checked and may be beneficial</td>

    <td align="left">Both subcutaneous and sublingual immunotherapy can be continued in the current COVID-19 pandemics, in any asymptomatic patient without suspicion for SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals, in any patient with negative test result (RT-PCR) or in any patient after an adequate quarantine or with detection of serum IgG to SARS-CoV-2 without virus-specific IgM</td>
