<p id="par0065">Of the 26 Covid-19 patients included in the study, 20 were alive and 6 died. Laboratory values and clinical parameters of patients living and dying at the time of admission were compared (
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> ). A statistically significant difference was found between age and lymphocyte values of living and dying patients. The patients who died were determined to have older age (74,6 vs 61,85, p = 0,018) and more severe lymphopenia (0,47 vs 1,18, p = 0,001).
