<p id="par0030">CP treatment was applied to 26 Covid-19 patients in intensive care unit who had quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) positive Sars-Cov-2 infection. Plasma was collected at least 14 days after complete recovery from patients who had mild or moderate infection with Sars-Cov-2 infection. 500–600 cc plasma was collected from the donors with a therapeutic apheresis device for 60−90 min considering age and comorbidity. Donors were selected from those who could be blood donors between the ages of 18−60. All tests (Eliza, etc.) before donation to the donors were done before the procedure. Antibody titer was checked before donating to the donors. Plasma was collected from donors with antibody positivity. Before starting the procedure, PCR was confirmed to be negative for Covid-19 in both the swab and serum of the donor. Informed consent was obtained from both the donor and the patients. After the CPs were collected, they were prepared and frozen in 200 cc packages with a sterile combining set. The collected CPs were applied to severe Covid-19 patients. Laboratory values of patients just before CP and after 1 week were compared. This study was approved by the local ethical committee of Inonu University, Medical Faculty on 26 May 2020 under the number 2020/77.</p>
