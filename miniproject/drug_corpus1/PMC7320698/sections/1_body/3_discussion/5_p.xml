<p id="par0085">Duan et al. added 200 mL of CP containing high neutralizing antibody titers (&gt; 1: 640) to the treatment of 10 critical patients with Covid-19 (age range 34–78) after an average of 16.5 days of admission to the hospital. CP treatment increased the neutralizing antibody titer, oxygen saturation and lymphocyte count in patients; however, it has been observed that it reduces CRP, SARS-CoV-2 viral load and lung lesions in radiological imaging.
