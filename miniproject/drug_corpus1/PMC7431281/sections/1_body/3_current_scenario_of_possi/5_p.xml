<p id="Par11">The chloroquine drug appears to interfere with terminal glycosylation of ACE2 and exerts direct antiviral effects by inhibiting pH-dependent steps of the replication in several viruses including coronaviruses showing a strong impact on SARS-CoV infection [

Moreover, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are known to modulate the immune response in some infectious diseases via inhibition of autophagy, controlling Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, and diminishing the cytokine storm by suppressing the production of TNF-α and IL-6 [

A preliminary clinical trial of chloroquine repurposing against SARS-CoV-2 infection has shown some positive results, which led to the start of several clinical trial studies across the world [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Recently, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA, stopped the clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine as a potential therapy for COVID-19 because some studies show controversial results of this drug against SARS-CoV-2 [

Through the fog of alleged misconduct, hope, hype, and politicization that surrounds hydroxychloroquine, the malaria drug touted as a COVID-19 treatment, a scientific picture is now emerging. Recent systematic studies demonstrated no significant benefit of hydroxychloroquine drug in COVID-19 treatment [
