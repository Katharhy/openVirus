<p id="Par5">The coronaviruses belong to a large subfamily, 
 <italic>Orthocoronavirinae</italic>, of the Coronaviridae family within the Nidovirales order and are classified into 4 genera: Alpha (α), Beta (β), Gamma (γ), and Delta (δ) coronavirus. They are single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) genomes with the size ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases, with a crown-like appearance due to the presence of spike glycoproteins on the envelope. They are known to infect both humans and animals. SARS-CoVs, MERS-CoVs, and SARS-CoV-2 are classified as β-coronavirus family members [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. There are structural similarities between the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV; however, they target the host cells through different receptors, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DDP4) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) respectively [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The coronavirus particle, virion, consists of a nucleocapsid, containing single-stranded genomic RNA and phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is covered inside the phospholipid bilayers having two different types of spike proteins (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), the spike glycoprotein trimmer (S) that is present in almost all the CoVs and the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) that is found in few CoVs. The membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins are located among the S proteins in the virus envelope [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus containing 29,891 nucleotides, encoding for 9860 amino acids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Although its origin is not entirely understood, the genomic analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 probably evolved from a strain found in bats [
