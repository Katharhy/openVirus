<p id="Par6">Recently, bioinformatic analysis of a virus genome from a patient with COVID-19 shows that the genome of SARS-CoV-2 shows 89% nucleotide identity with batSARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet, and human SARS coronaviruses. Further, additional genomic studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 shared 79% nucleotide identity to SARS-CoV and 51.8% identity to MERS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the comparative analysis of the genomic organization of various coronaviruses in different species. All these studies indicated a high genetic homology among SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as that for SARS-CoV to enter the target cell, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract. ACE2 enzyme is involved in the regulation of blood pressure and is expressed by cells of the heart, lungs, kidneys, and intestines. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 through spike proteins. However, the external subdomain of the spikeâ€™s receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. So, the drugs targeting SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV might not be fit for the prevention of COVID-19.
