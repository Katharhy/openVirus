<p id="Par23">The National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA, has sponsored a biotechnology company, CytoAgents, to fast-track the production of GP1681. This would be effective in controlling the cytokine storm resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 infection. These are small molecules known to show a host-directed methodology to spot the fundamental reason of cytokine storm, altering the host’s natural immune system. This molecule would be effective against other viral diseases like influenza. It is currently under phase I and II of the human trial. There are enough case studies that have reported an exaggerated and abnormal production of IL-6 that led to “cytokine storm” and which finally ended up in heart failure due to stimulation of the coagulation process. Also, tissue necrosis and infiltration of monocytes and macrophages are commonly observed in both COVID-19 patients showing severe symptoms and postmortem pathological analysis. The authors propose that there is a good possibility that anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) therapy may manage COVID-19-induced cytokine storm (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, macrophage activation syndrome, and sepsis) [

Tocilizumab is a human monoclonal anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, extracted from patients with cytokine release syndrome. This is in phase 4 for SARS-CoV-2 trial. Tocilizumab can be associated with soluble IL-6R and mIL-6R, and inhibit signal transduction. However, it is a very costly treatment and its safety risks need to be tested in clinical trials [
