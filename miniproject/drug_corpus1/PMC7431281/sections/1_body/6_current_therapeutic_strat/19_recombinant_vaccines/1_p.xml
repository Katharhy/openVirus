<p id="Par36">Specific spike protein-producing gene segments are inserted into vectors (adenovirus) for vaccine delivery. Adenoviruses are good vectors for vaccine development because they can infect a wide range of hosts; cause effective expression of transgene; can be cultured in laboratories at low cost; do not allow lysogeny of viral genes into host genes; and can trigger an immune response by infecting dendritic cells and target both systemic and mucosal immune response. Johnson and Johnson, a US-based company, is working on this project (26% of current vaccine research focuses on this approach).</p>
