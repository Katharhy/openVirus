<p id="Par21">It is a recombinant adenovirus vaccine developed by the University of Oxford. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 has been genetically engineered using weakened common cold adenovirus (ChAdOx1) infective only to chimpanzees. Genes coding for spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 virus have been inserted into these viruses as these spike proteins are vital to bind on to ACE2 receptors on human cells. Its peculiar feature is that MenACWY has been used as an active control instead of saline solution. It gave very encouraging positive results on monkeys, generating antibodies within 28 days of its administration. It also drastically reduced respiratory distress in the patients and also prevented viral replication. Its human trials are in the process, and the university has already signed an agreement for its global manufacture and sale with Astra Zeneca. It is under trial on humans and is estimated that the initial study would include more than 1100 healthy subjects between 18 and 55 years of age. Exclusion criteria include pregnant, breastfeeding mothers and COVID-19 patients.</p>
