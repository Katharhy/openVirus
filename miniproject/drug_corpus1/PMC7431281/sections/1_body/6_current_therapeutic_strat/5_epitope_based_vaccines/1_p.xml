<p id="Par22">The coronavirus has spike proteins on its shell which are essential to latch on to the host cellular receptors. Viruses have been smart enough to evade the hostâ€™s defense system by hiding their receptor binding motif (RBM). Thus, one of the strategies could be to design a vaccine targeting the RBM of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Tel Aviv University (TAU) of Israel is working on the same plan in association with Neovii, a pharmaceutical company. They aim to come up with a COVID-19 epitope vaccine based on in silico or computational prediction. It will be a cost-effective solution with great therapeutic efficacy.</p>
