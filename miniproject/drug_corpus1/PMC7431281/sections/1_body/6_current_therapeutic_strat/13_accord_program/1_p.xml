<p id="Par30">Official records depict that the UK was worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; thus, the UK government has constituted an Accelerating COVID-19 Research &amp; Development (ACCORD) Program to step up large-scale research and development strategies to fight COVID-19. The first drug has been fast-tracked is bemcentinib. This drug is a selective inhibitor of the AXL kinase protein and was originally developed to prevent cancer cell metastasis. It has been proposed to use this drug against SARS-CoV-2 since this virus uses AXL kinase protein for its entry into the host cell. Thus, by inhibiting this protein, the virus can be prevented from infecting cells. This drug is a panacea and has also proven effective against the Ebola and Zika viruses. Another important characteristic of this drug is that it is safe in case of adults as its target is a protein that is least essential in adulthood. This drug can prevent the virus from both entering the host cell in the first stage and controlling the progression of disease in patients already suffering from COVID-19. Thus, it is a broad-spectrum drug. Apart from this drug, the program includes tyrosine kinase inhibitor interleukin 33 and Calquence drug. Under this program, approximately $8billion funding would be provided to several international agencies, research organizations, and industries by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).</p>
