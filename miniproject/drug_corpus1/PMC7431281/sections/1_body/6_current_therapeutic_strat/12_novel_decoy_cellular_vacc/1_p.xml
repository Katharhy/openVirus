<p id="Par29">Transgenic antigen-expressing cells: In this innovative strategy, nonreplicating, irradiated cells (I-cells) would be deployed as presenting carriers of antigens of SARS-Cov-2 so that these can be recognized by the host immune cells. These are irradiated to prevent in vivo replication and will act as a vaccine to protect against COVID-19 disease. It is thus a transgenic antigen-expressing cell.</p>
