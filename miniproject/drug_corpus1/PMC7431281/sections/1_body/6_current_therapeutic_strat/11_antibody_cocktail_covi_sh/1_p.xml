<p id="Par28">Some researchers at Mount Sinai Health System have come up with the idea of developing a triple-antibody prophylactic and therapy. This antibody cocktail specifically would safeguard frontline workers and doctors who are frequently exposed to this virus They aim at screening approximately 1500 COVID-19 recovered patients for identifying and isolating at least 3 vital antibodies against spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 virus from their blood plasma. Then, monoclonal antibodies would be synthesized in collaboration with Sorrento Therapeutics. This would specifically provide immunity to the high-risk population for at least 2Â months. This therapy may also provide resistance to future virus mutations and is currently filing an Investigational New Drug (IND) application.</p>
