<p id="Par33">Such viruses are more effective than dead viruses as are live and draw out a strong immune response. But these vaccines provide only short-term immunity and their booster doses are required. Such weakened viruses are actual viruses with some mutations that make them more attracted to other animals than humans. Such viruses are created by culturing them in tissues of some other animal. Thus, a mutant form of the virus is chosen that would prefer other non-human animal hosts and would hardly infect humans. Vaccines made from such weakened viruses when injected into humans may provide immunity against viruses and at the same time avoid exaggerated infection. Thus, such vaccines usually show mild side effects post-treatment. Some of the examples are rotavirus, measles, mumps, rubella (MMR combined vaccine), smallpox, etc. Thus, both live and attenuated vaccines train our body to fight against infection as they are more natural. Some of the limitations of such vaccines include refrigeration to keep them alive; costly instrumentation to protect them from any new virulent mutation (or reversion) during transportation to distant places; reliability deficit in the effectiveness of the vaccine and safety after administration.</p>
