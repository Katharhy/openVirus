<p id="Par38">Worldwide, millions of people are infected, and thousands of deaths are occurring due to the pandemic situation of COVID-19. Unfortunately, no therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2. The identification of effective strategies against SARS-CoV-2 is a major challenge. Currently, we are fighting a twenty-first century disease with twentieth century weapons. The clinical trials of repurposing the existing antiviral agents against this potentially fatal disease are going on across the world. Recently, several possibilities including targeting viral binding receptors (ACE2) and spike proteins, stimulating an immune response, monoclonal antibodies, peptides, small-molecule drugs, etc. are being explored against emerging SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the whole world is facing a challenge in dealing with a new coronavirus infection that has just emerged in humans and we are not having the existing vaccine or a drug against this potentially fatal disease. We hope that through these accelerated and determined plans, very soon, an effective vaccine that targets SARS-CoV-2 will be developed to settle this global COVID-19 issue. In closing, we express our concern about fading away from these big programs and funds offered to sort this public health crisis (generally offered around such pandemic). We would be witnessing many new and far deadly viral pandemics in the ensuing time, and thus, we really need to be prepared to tackle this unseen danger. Thus, we need to continue this research with the same enthusiasm and zeal to discover reliable and affordable therapeutic strategies to curb such pandemics.</p>
