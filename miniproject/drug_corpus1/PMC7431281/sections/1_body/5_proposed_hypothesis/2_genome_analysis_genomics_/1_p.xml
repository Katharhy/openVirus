<p id="Par16">A comprehensive genome analysis of the virus as well as the host population to predict genetic determinants is the need of the hour. Such a large-scale collaborative task of genome sequencing may unmask hidden mysteries like severity and susceptibility of COVID-19. Many such initiatives using high-throughput sequencing technologies are in the pipeline (namely Genomics England, UK Biobank). Since we know that genome is unique to an individual and it is the sole dower of phenotypic or functional expression of a trait, so it is imperative to first analyze the defect at the molecular level. This would open a gamut of doors for therapeutic and preventive strategies and may help answer all the puzzles concerning COVID-19. Once we know the gene, we may easily correlate any defect in its protein expression and biochemical pathway concerning the disease. This gene structure would also give an insight into new and ameliorating drugs and therapies.</p>
