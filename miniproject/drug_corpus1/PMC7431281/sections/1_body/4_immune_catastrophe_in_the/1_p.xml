<p id="Par14">The immune response is a strong defense against invasive pathogens. Recent studies demonstrated an acute inflammation in the severely affected COVID-19 patients, leading to cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress, and then multiple organ failure. Nutritional interventions including vitamin C and D and antioxidants are also used to boost the immune response against this disease. After the recent demonstration of the crystal structure of spikes in SARS-CoV-2 [

The S protein in the spike of SARS-CoV-2 is the major target for vaccine development, and several companies are now in the advancing stage of an effective therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2. Figure
