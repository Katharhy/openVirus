  <p>(A) Structure of SARS-CoV-2 particle, virion, and (B) genomic organization of SARS-CoV-2 (adapted from Chan et al. 2020). A SARS-CoV-2 particle is approximately 70–90 nm in size, 30 kb, an ssRNA virus, similar in structure to the SARS-CoV virion, and belongs to the family Coronaviridae. It has a crown shape with spikes on the membrane that are used to embed in the host membrane-derived lipid bilayer. (B) There are 6–11 open reading frames (ORFs) with 5′ and 3′ flanking untranslated regions (UTRs). The nsps constitutes dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), main protease (nsp5), helicase (nsp13), and papain-like protease (nsp3)</p>
