    "BACKGROUND:Because alcohol use disorders (AUDs) in patients living with HIV/AIDS are associated with a reduction in therapeutic outcomes and increases the risk of morbidity/mortality, finding an appropriate pharmacotherapy treatment for this disorder is necessary. OBJECTIVES:This systematic review contains studies that examine the effects of pharmacological intervention (oral naltrexone (NTX) or injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX)) on the persons living with HIV and AUDs. METHODS:A systematic literature search using three electronic databases including Pubmed Medline, Scopus and the Cochrane Library and Google Scholar was conducted and includes articles published from 1995 to 2019. Records were collected by searching relevant keywords and those that meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria are included. RESULTS:Overall, in this systematic review, the results of 7 relevant studies including pilot and randomized controlled/clinical trials were summarized and reviewed. Among selected records 2 of these assessed the efficacy of NTX and 5 tested the XR-NTX effectiveness in treating AUDs among persons living with HIV (PLH). In summary, with some expectations, NTX and XR-NTX administration in persons living with HIV and AUDs led to reduced alcohol use, improved viral suppression, unchanged ART adherence and has no significant adverse events. CONCLUSION:The findings of this systematic review suggest the beneficial effects and safety of the NTX and XR-NTX for treating AUDs in PLH. Further studies are needed in the future to focus on the treatment of AUDs in people living with HIV."
