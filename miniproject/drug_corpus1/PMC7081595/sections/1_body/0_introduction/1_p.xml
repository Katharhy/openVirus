<p id="Par11">Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are a costly, common and disabling health condition that is considered as one of the most serious public health problems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Alcohol use is highly prevalent among positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Alcohol use in people living with HIV/AIDS seems to be 2–4 times more prevalent than the general population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and it has also been estimated that about 40–50% of these patients had a history of heavy alcohol use [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. There are several harmful linkages between alcohol use and HIV. Heavy alcohol use has the ability for interfering with immune system functions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], increasing in the incidence of serious bacterial infections (especially tuberculosis) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], liver damage and hepatotoxicity in the case of associated infection such as hepatitis C [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and make changes in the metabolism of antiretroviral drugs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Moreover, heavy alcohol use is linked to the harmful behavior i.e. illicit drug use, smoking, and enhanced unsafe sexual activities. Besides, it has been reported that alcohol use is associated with an increase in the risk of chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease and cancer in people living with HIV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Alcohol use among people living with HIV affects negatively on their adherence and engagement to the HIV treatment, treatment outcomes and mortality risk [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. There are various pharmacological/behavioral treatments for treating AUDs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Pharmacotherapy is recommended for AUD treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and FDA-approved medications for these disorders include acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Besides above-mentioned drugs, strong evidence found regarding the use of topiramate for AUD treatment in a meta-analysis study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].
