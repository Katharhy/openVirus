<p id="Par12">Opioid antagonist, naltrexone (NTX) sold under the brand names Revia and Vivitrol among others, is an important pharmacological medication. Oral and injectable forms of naltrexone are commercially available [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. It is used for managing of AUDs and it is effective to reduce alcohol use and craving [

The main goal of this research is to provide a systematic review of the current evidence regarding the application of naltrexone for the pharmacotherapy of AUDs in people living with HIV. The impact of oral naltrexone (NTX) and injectable extended-release form (XR-NTX) on the alcohol use and HIV related outcomes are discussed.
