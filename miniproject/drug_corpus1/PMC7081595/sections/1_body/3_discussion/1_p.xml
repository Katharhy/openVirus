<p id="Par24">HIV and AUDs are two of the prevalent epidemics and if they combined together leading to poor health outcomes and increased mortality/morbidity. Based on health treating complication related to alcohol use in PLH, it is crucial to explore efficacious pharmacological and behavioral interventions to treat AUDs. In this regard, this systematic review covering information from the literature contribute to the pharmacotherapy treating of AUDs in PLH. These studies are focused on whether AUD treatment can affect the important clinical and laboratory parameters affecting the evaluation and progression of AIDS. These studies use naltrexone (oral or injectable forms) to treat heavy alcohol use among PLH. Very few studies have been conducted to examine the outcomes of AUDs pharmacological treatments in PLH. Studies included in this work have examined the effects of NTX or XR-NTX on AUD treatment and reported different outcomes such as treatment retention (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2), drinking status (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5), antiretroviral therapy adherence (n = 2), and biological HIV markers (n = 5). Although these studies reported a change in alcohol intake during naltrexone use, the measurement criteria and timing are very different. So it is hard to summarize and compare their results. For example, studies have used different criteria for measuring and reporting drinking-related outcomes. These studies reported the mean alcohol drinking per week, the number of abstinent days per month, the past 30-day mean drinking days, time to first heavy drinking day, average drinks per drinking day, mean percent of heavy drinking day and mean change in alcohol craving in different intervals during the period of assessment. One study found an 83% of XR-NTX groups remained on treatment during 16 weeks follow-up and in another study, a significant difference in remaining on treatment between XR-NTX and placebo groups did not find. Due to NTX administration, a reduced average daily alcohol drinking, mean weekly alcohol consumption and an increase in the number of the abstinent days was found by two studies. After treating with XR-NTX, fewer past 30-day mean and heavy drinking day was reported by 2 studies. In comparison to placebo, for both NTX and XR-NTX groups no statistically-significant differences for the proportion with ≥95% ART adherence were reported. Undetectable HIV viral load or viral suppression did not increase significantly after NTX consumption. A statistically-significant VS improvement in the XR-NTX than the placebo group was reported by three studies. The amount of mean CD4 count improved slightly from baseline after NTX administration and there was also the lower CD4 count for XR-NTX group compared to placebo. Three studies did not find any statistically-significant adverse events for NTX and XR-NTX. Despite the importance of managing alcohol use disorders in PLH, only a limited number of studies have focused on this issue. The variety of responses considered for evaluating drug treatment outcomes, the low number of study participants, and the selection of the study population from specific groups such as prisons or newly released individuals are among problems associated with the limited studies conducted in this area.
