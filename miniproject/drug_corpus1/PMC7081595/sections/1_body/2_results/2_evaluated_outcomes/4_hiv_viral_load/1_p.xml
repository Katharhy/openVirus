<p id="Par20">In the case of women who received 50 mg daily NTX in the study by Cook et al. 2017, undetectable HIV viral load increased from baseline after 2, 4 and 7 months in both the NTX and placebo groups but these increase was not significant (“The pooled effect size for HIV viral load was OR=2.32, 95%CI: 0.56 to 9.71”) [

For the placebo group involved in the Springer et al., 2018 study, there were no statistically-significant improve at each level of viral suppression from baseline to 6-month treatment. For the placebo group, the value of viral suppression (VS) at all three-level (&lt; 50, &lt; 200, and &lt; 400 copies/mL), didn’t improve from baseline of 42, 64 and 66.7% to 30.3% (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.292), 42.4% (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.070) and 42.4% (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.030) after 6 month treatment, respectively. VS for the XR-NTX group at two levels (&lt; 50, and &lt; 200 copies/mL) increased from baseline of 31, 48 to 56.7% (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) and 64.2% (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.024) after 6 month, respectively. From baseline to 6 months, the value of VS &lt; 400 copies/mL was maintained (63.6 to 53.7%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.260). Also at 6 months, XR-NTX receiving participants were more likely to have viral suppression for both &lt; 200 copies/mL and &lt; 50 copies/mL levels than placebo while there was no significant difference for viral suppression &lt; 400 copies/mL between two groups. Based on Korthuis et al., 2017 HIV viral suppression (HIV RNA pcr &lt; 200 copies/mL) changed from 92 to 82% for patients assigned to XR-NTX and no change was detected for TAU at 16 weeks [
