<p id="Par18">Cook et al., 2017 conducted a study from 2010 to 2012 on the 17 women who have HIV with AUDs. They received naltrexone (daily 50 mg orally) or placebo randomly to reduce drinking [

 <italic>n</italic> = 10) and placebo (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7) groups. In both groups, during participants follow-up, the drinking reductions were observed in terms of decreased mean alcohol consumption per week (39.2 vs. 12.8 drinks/week at month 4 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and 9.4 drinks/week at month 7, (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05)) and increase in the number of abstinent days. Although these changes were significant for each group alone, there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups. Hu et al., 2013 investigated the effectiveness of using NTX in reducing heavy alcohol use on 19 women infected with HIV from 2010 to 2012 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. They were randomized 2:1 and received 50 mg NTX orally or placebo for 7-months. Among NTX group an average daily alcohol drinking significantly reduced from 7.13 at baseline to 0.46 standard drinking units at the end of 7 month treatment. Edelman et al., 2019 examined the effects of XR-NTX on the 51 participants with HIV/AUDs from 2011 to 2015. Participants divided into 2 (XR-NTX or placebo) groups and followed throughout the 24-week treatment. The XR-NTX group received 380 mg in 4 mL intramuscularly at four-week intervals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Edelman et al., 2019 observed that compared to the placebo group, the XR-NTX assigned group had fewer past 30-day heavy and abstinent drinking days (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.03). Moreover, for the XR-NTX group phosphatidylethanol (PEth, an alcohol biomarker) values decreased over time (p = 0.03) [

 <italic>n</italic> = 12) versus treatment as usual (TAU, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 11) and followed during 8 months [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The past 30-day mean drinking days to intoxication decreased from 13 to 6 and 18 to 7 for XR-NTX and TAU groups, respectively. In another study reported by Springer et al. 2017, 100 HIV positive released prisoners with AUD were randomized 2:1 to XR-NTX or placebo groups to receive injections of XR-NTX or placebo for 6-month. Overall, there was no statistically significant difference for the time to first heavy drinking day, average drinks per drinking day, mean percent of heavy drinking day and mean change in alcohol craving. Compared to the placebo group, younger in age participants (age 20–29 years) in the XR-NTX group had a more time to first heavy drinking day.
