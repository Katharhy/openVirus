<p id="Par16">As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, two of these studies have used oral naltrexone (NTX) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and the 5 other used extended-release injectable form (XR-NTX) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The difference between reported outcomes and a small number of studies has made it difficult to present results in a meta-analysis. However, to illustrate the effect of the drug in each study, the total effect size of each study for repeated measurements at different time intervals was calculated and reported using a fixed effect model [
