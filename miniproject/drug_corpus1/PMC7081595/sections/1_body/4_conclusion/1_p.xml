<p id="Par25">This review study was designed to evaluate the effect of naltrexone on the outcomes of drinking and AIDS treatment in patients with these two conditions simultaneously. Results showed that administration of injectable/oral naltrexone in people living with HIV/AUDs reduces alcohol consumption and improves viral suppression without significant side effects. Thus naltrexone can be used to treat alcohol-related disorders in this group of patients. However, due to the small number of studies conducted in this field and the problems associated with alcohol consumption in AIDS patients, it seems that more prospective prolonged controlled trial studies are needed to address the impact of NTX and XR-NTX in people living with HIV/AUDs.</p>
