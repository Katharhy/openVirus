<p id="p0290">The in vitro viricidal effect against SARS-CoV-2 has been described for ethanol, alcohol-based hand sanitizers and povidone-iodine only so far. In vitro inhibition of other coronaviruses was reported for LF, HCQ, ethanol and AQCs. No treatment was tested against SARS-CoV-2 in randomized controlled clinical trials. The lack of effective and safe drugs against SARS-CoV-2 implies primarily that the relevant literature on this topic does not exist.</p>
