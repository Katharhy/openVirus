<p id="p0160">LF in its free form is degraded within the stomach by the action of hydrochloric acid and hydrolytic enzymes. Newer formulations of LF including encapsulation and liposomalization have been explored. Another interesting observation is that zinc saturated lactoferrin can apparently exert a more potent antiviral effect. This is of particular relevance in COVID-19 as zinc supplementation has been proposed as a possible therapeutic intervention for the disease (

An oral supplement combining a liposomal bovine lactoferrin (LLF) syrup (32 mg of LF/10 ml plus 12 mg of ascorbic acid) and a Zinc solution 10 mg/10 ml 2–3 times a day and 4–6 times/day was administered for 10 days to 75 symptomatic COVID-19 patients tested positive for IgM/IgG rapid test and self-isolated at home. A control group was treated only with LLF. All patients, who were followed up for one month, resolved their symptoms within 4-5- days since treatment inception and a half dose of LLF on 256 household contacts was effective to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection (
