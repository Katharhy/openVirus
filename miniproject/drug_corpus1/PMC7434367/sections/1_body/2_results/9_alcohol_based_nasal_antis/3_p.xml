<p id="p0245">Two studies tested the effectiveness of alcohol-based antiseptics in reducing nasal bacterial carriage in health care professionals at an urban hospital center (
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Steed et al., 2014</xref>) or among colonized patients (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Kanwar et al., 2019</xref>), providing conflicting results though. A commercially available, non-prescription product, Nozin Nasal Sanitizer antiseptic was used as test agent in both latter studies. The safety-tested formulation was composed of ethanol active combined with a mixture of natural oil emollients and the preservative benzalkonium chloride. Sterile phosphate-buffered saline with 0.017% peppermint oil as a masking agent was used as placebo treatment control. Whilst 3 nasal applications of the latter alcohol based antiseptic over 8 hours significantly reduced the nasal carriage of
