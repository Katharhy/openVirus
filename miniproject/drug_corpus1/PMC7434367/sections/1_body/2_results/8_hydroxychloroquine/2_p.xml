<p id="p0230">Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a less toxic derivative of chloroquine (CQ), at micromolar concentration proved anti-viral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), and its mechanism of action entails the increase of pH of intracellular organelles, such as endosomes/lysosomes, essential for membrane fusion (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Ashfaq et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, CQ could inhibit SARS-CoV-1 entry through changing the glycosylation of ACE2 receptor and the spike protein (
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Savarino et al., 2006</xref>). Along with the derivative HCQ, CQ has even entered multiple clinical trials. The evidence on the efficacy of HCQ to clear the nasopharynx from SARS-CoV-2 is relatively low, being founded only on one small open-label non-randomized clinical trial, which did not confirm clinical improvement of COVID-19 patients though (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Gautret et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, HCQ is featured by risk of side effects in terms of QTc prolongation and haemolysis associated with deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (

 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Giudicessi et al., 2020</xref>). The efficacy of HCQ, also in combination with azithromycin, has been questioned too, since it was not found to be associated with a significantly reduced mortality among 1428 randomly sampled COVID-9 patients admitted to 25 hospitals of the New York City Metropolitan region (
