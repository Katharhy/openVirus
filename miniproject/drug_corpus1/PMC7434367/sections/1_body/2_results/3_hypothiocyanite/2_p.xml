<p id="p0080">The lactoperoxidase (LPO) is a heme peroxidase present in several exocrine secretions, including the interface of human airways epithelium, which produces different anti-infectious agents in presence of hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>), principally from halide (the iodide anion I
 <sup>−</sup>) and pseudo-halide (thiocyanate, also known as anion SCN
 <sup>−</sup>) substrates (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bafort et al., 2014</xref>). Both SCN
 <sup>−</sup> and I
 <sup>−</sup> act as one-electron donors, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> works as a relatively specific electron acceptor, whereas LPO is the catalyzing enzyme. By undergoing two oxidations, the native LPO donates two electrons to H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, which is reduced to water. At that point, LPO is reduced back to its native state. Whether the required biochemical/environmental conditions are satisfied, LPO produces the active antimicrobial molecules OSCN
 <sup>−</sup> (hypothiocyanite) or OI
 <sup>−</sup> (hypoiodite) in presence of SCN
 <sup>−</sup> or I
 <sup>−</sup> respectively (
