Whilst in the initial stage of the epidemic a symptom-based screening strategy was useful with the aim to treat and isolate infected cases, COVID-19 outbreaks in care homes and hospitals suggest that the current IPC measures are inadequate and have failed in several countries (

Furthermore, the above IPC measures are not sustainable in the long run, as they would severely ruin the economies of countries heavily affected by COVID-19. The clear need to relax/avoid the lock down measures enforced in many countries prompts for a revised approach to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic individuals, until a pharmacological intervention (ideally a vaccine or a chemoprophylaxis) will hopefully become available (

As explained above, the problem with COVID-19 is the transmission from asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic individuals, a phenomenon particularly critical in care homes and hospitals, where more than half residents testing positive might not develop symptoms (
