Therefore, there are two issues with COVID-19: the high transmissibility of the virus and a variable clinical pattern of the disease, which can range from pre-symptomatic/asymptomatic condition to life threatening pneumonia featured by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and hypercoagulable state (
