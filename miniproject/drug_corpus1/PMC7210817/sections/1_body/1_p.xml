<p>However, as epidemics of viral diseases occur at a gap of years, these infections are not at the priority among the research community and that is the reason why there is as yet no effective vaccine or treatment for most emerging or re-emerging viral diseases. Existing situation demands that more research is needed to identify precisely the modes of transmission and medical countermeasures, the predisposing factors and its effective management, especially the preventive aspect. As many of such viral infections are either fatal or leave behind complications that can cause either permanent disability or affect quality of life of the patients or have large-scale impact on mortality or morbidity, this field has also to be explored exhaustively.</p>
