<p>Since the ACE2 receptor is also widely distributed in organs, such as heart, kidney, endothelium, and retina, this could explain the multi-organ dysfunction observed in COVID-19 affected patients. Therapeutic studies based on the rational use of anti-inflammatory drugs that directly inhibit the synthesis processes of inflammatory cytokines, e.g., inflammasome Nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (NOD) NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) [

Early control of CSS by immunomodulators and cytokine antagonists at an early stage, as well as reduction of lung inflammatory cell infiltration, is the key to improving treatment success rates and reducing mortality rates in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, rational therapy should always include a careful evaluation of the cytokineâ€™s profile of selected cohorts of symptomatic COVID-19 patients, especially those with severe pneumonia and in intensive care units (ICU).
