<p>Accumulating evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 causes an inflammatory response in the lower airway, leading to lung injury (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-01228-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Collectively, the virions first invade the respiratory mucosa and then trigger a powerful immune response in the lungs with the production of a cytokine storm (Cytokine Storm Syndrome; CSS) that hyperactivates a type-1 cellular T-helper response similar to that described in SARS and MERS [

 <xref rid="B66-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. CSS is an uncontrolled and often fatal systemic inflammatory response, resulting from the release of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, IL-18, IL-33, TNF-α, TGFβ, and chemokines, including CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL10. Cytokines/chemokines all contribute to the occurrence of ARDS and may lead to the most critical condition of COVID-19 patients, including death [
