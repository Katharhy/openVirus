<p>While the main target of CoVs is lung epithelial cells, SARS-CoV-2 also infects macrophages and dendritic cells, which overstimulated and promote hyperinflammation [

IL-17 is able to strengthen the inflammation response and to activate neutrophils cells that can migrate to the lung and are heavily involved in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Blocking IL-17 could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for COVID-19 [
