<p>4. So far, serological assays for the detection of human IgM and IgG currently have limitations in sensitivity/specificity and are not able to provide epidemiological evidence since most of the Italian general population (over 90%) results uninfected by SARS-CoV-2 (unpublished data). Moreover, no completely reliable immunological assays have yet been developed for the detection of serum antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. They probably will be important to define epidemiological questions, including attack rate in the population, and to identify immune individuals. However, it remains to be investigated in detail the immune response elicited by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, it is not known how long the humoral response lasts in the infected subjects.</p>
