  <p>RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Inhibitors (RdRp).</p>
  <p>Among RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Inhibitors (RdRp), there is Remdesivir (RDV), an adenosine analog previously used as anti-Ebola virus drug recently approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to employ in emergency for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalized with severe disease [
   <xref rid="B96-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. The mechanism of action of RDV makes it potentially useful in the treatment of COVID-19. At least 23 studies of RDV are currently listed on various trial registers, intending to study 23,500 patients, but fewer than a quarter are double-blind, and some are uncontrolled observational studies [
   <xref rid="B97-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Although measurement of efficacy will require ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled trials of RDV therapy, recently, in a cohort of patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19 who were treated with compassionate-use RDV, clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53 patients (68%) [
   <xref rid="B97-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. More recently, our research team proposed to administer RDV by aerosol to combat SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract in patients with severe clinical conditions and in ICUs in order to avoid possible side effects of systemic intravenous RDV administration [
   <xref rid="B98-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Other recent potential effective antivirals include Favipiravir (Avigan), in the same class of the RDV, whose antiviral activity is exhibited through selectively targeting RdRp, are attractive targets for antiviral therapies, which interrupt the nucleotide incorporation process during viral RNA replication [
   <xref rid="B90-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Favipiravir is a guanine analog approved for treatment against influenza virus infection in Japan and also can effectively inhibit replication of Ebola, yellow fever, chikungunya, norovirus, and enterovirus and could potentially exhibit effects against SARS-CoV-2 [
   <xref rid="B99-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Neuraminidase and protease inhibitors have not proven to be particularly effective against SARS-CoV-2, although additional studies are necessary.

  <p>Inhibitors of TMPRSS2 serine protease.</p>
  <p>The serine protease TMPRSS2 required for SARS- CoV-2 entry into host cells, highly conserved among the MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 viruses, has been identified as a promising target for treatment of COVID-19 [
   <xref rid="B59-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The TMPRSS2 cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors camostat mesylate, nafamostat, and bromhexine may treat COVID-19 [

  <p>Anti-inflammatory molecules potentially efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.</p>
  <p>For severe COVID-19 illness, many experimental studies are underway to test the validity of anti-inflammatory molecules used successfully for other diseases that may have a potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect [
   <xref rid="B100-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. In this context, the use of corticosteroids (dexamethasone) as well as the immunomodulators sarilumab, tocilizumab, meplazumab, bevacizumab, baricitinib, avipatadil, may ameliorate the cytokine storm that contributes to mortality [
   <xref rid="B101-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Tocilizumab has been widely used in rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. It is an IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) blocker that can effectively block the IL-6 signal transduction pathway and thus is likely to become an effective drug for patients with severe COVID-19 and to reduce the mortality [
   <xref rid="B102-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. To block IL-17 pathway by biological drugs that are already available and used to treat different pathologies could also be a novel, additional strategy to treat patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 [
   <xref rid="B71-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. COVID-19 was initially underestimated especially in Lombardy and other regions of Northern Italy, in which hospitals have become amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. If these patients were treated early with anti-inflammatory drugs and anticoagulants, they could have avoided being hospitalized, where many of them died.

  <p>Antagonists of Proteinases.</p>
  <p>The growing recognition of endothelitis and thrombosis in COVID-19 patients provides a strong incentive to determine the potential utility of antagonists of PAR1 (Proteinase-activated receptor 1) inhibitors to improve the outcome of such patients. PAR1 is widely expressed in cell types relevant to COVID-19 pathobiology, which include pneumocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and platelets. Activation of PAR1 by the serine protease thrombin is a critical element in platelet aggregation and coagulation. In particular, serine protease inhibitor Nafamostat, a serine protease inhibitor that works as an anticoagulant, has demonstrated satisfactory results in inhibiting the action of MERS-CoV and has been shown to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection, preventing membrane fusion [

   <italic>Hyperimmune plasma</italic>.
  </p>
  <p>The use of hyperimmune plasma obtained from convalescent patients recovered from the disease has shown to be a very promising and specific approach for the treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection [
   <xref rid="B104-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. This could represent a promising specific approach in the treatment of COVID-19 also on the basis of experience gained in other countries on a limited number of patients [
   <xref rid="B105-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Convalescent plasma therapy also appears to be characterized by a high level of safety, as documented on all occasions in which it has been used in recent years, including COVID-19 itself. However, no randomized controlled trials or controlled non-randomized studies evaluating benefits and harms of convalescent plasma have been completed [
   <xref rid="B106-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. The European Commission in its recent Guide to Member States has pointed out that hyperimmune plasma would be a low-risk therapy immediately usable in selected categories of patients and a bridge alternative to be used while waiting for the production of a vaccine or the availability of drugs of proven efficacy [
   <xref rid="B107-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. So far, there is general consensus on the importance of combating uncontrolled inflammation, and the resulting ARDS or CSS, caused by this infection.
