<p>SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 through the S-glycoprotein comprising two subunits, S1 and S2 [
 <xref rid="B11-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which are involved in virus-host and cell tropism (S1) and fusion of the virus-cell membrane (S2), respectively. Other than the S protein responsible for facilitating entry of virus into the target cell, the coronavirus genome encodes three structural proteins: nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and the envelope (E) polypeptides [
 <xref rid="B35-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 recognizes human ACE2 receptor more efficiently than SARS-CoV-1; this may increase the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to be transmitted from person to person, warranting a more efficient spread among subjects [
