<p>Recent studies have demonstrated the virus entry mechanism, also clarifying the contribution of such mechanism to the evasiveness of the virus against immune response, cell infectivity, and spreadability of the virus [
 <xref rid="B63-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Basically, differently from other CoV, SARS-CoV-2 entry is dependent on preactivation by proprotein convertase furin, thus reducing its need for target cell proteases. Such a mechanism allows SARS-CoV-2 to maintain efficient cell entry while evading immune surveillance, thus potentially contributing to the wide spread of the virus.
