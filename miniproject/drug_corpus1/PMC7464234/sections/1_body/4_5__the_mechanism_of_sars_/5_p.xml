<p>ACE2 receptor is also highly expressed on the luminal surface of intestinal epithelial cells, which may explain some initial disease manifestations, such as vomiting and diarrhea [

Whether COVID-19 may have started with the consumption of bat food from the Wuhan market, the presumed location of the outbreak, is yet to be determined [
