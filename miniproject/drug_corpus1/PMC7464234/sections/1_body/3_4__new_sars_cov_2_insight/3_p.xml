<p>In Europe, the first few cases have been reported in France and Germany and then in Italy and Spain. In France, the COVID-19 epidemic is believed to have started between the end of December 2019 and late January 2020 [

Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction suggested that these two tourists were probably infected before their arrival in Italy, since the viral strains sequences intermixed with Chinese isolates of the epidemic dating back probably to 19 January, 2020 before their arrival in Italy. Furthermore, the Chinese touristâ€™s viral strains isolated in Italy clustered with other European strains from France and Germany, intermixing with other Chinese sequences, thus suggesting that strains introduced in Europe to date came from China [
