<p>Recently, evidence of vertical transmission has been reported [

Although pregnant women are constitutively less at risk of COVID infections, as well as SARS and MERS, probably due to genetic and host factors, in most women who have had signs of mild to moderate COVID-19 pneumonia, no loss of pregnancy and premature birth occurred [

However, the neonatal diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 should not be limited to molecular testing, when there is also the possibility of cultivating the virus in vitro. In fact, a recent Italian author highlighted the importance of viral culture to be used in parallel with molecular techniques to detect the presence of cytopathogenic viral agents, as demonstrated in an Italian 7-week-old lactating infant who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 only with the cell culture method, without any clinical suspicion and/or risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection [

SARS-CoV-2 can survive in the environment from a few hours to a few days, depending on surfaces and environmental conditions, and touching affected surfaces, such as mobile phone and paper money or where the virus is presumed to survive for up to 2 days [
