<p>On the basis of recent phylogenetic data, it is not unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 passed directly from bats to humans without the intermediate host. Moreover, it cannot be excluded that for SARS-CoV-2 the spillover effect may have involved a mechanism similar to those found in SARS or MERS, although an intermediate host was not found. However, there may be other animals including snakes, turtles [

 <xref rid="B40-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Pangolins, long-snouted, ant-eating mammals, were suggested as the possible intermediate hosts because coronavirus genomes from pangolins had approximately 85.5â€“92.4% similarity to SARS-CoV-2, representing two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which (GD/P1L and GDP2S) was extremely closely related to 2019-nCoV [
 <xref rid="B36-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, even if the pangolin may not be the intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2, the possibility of viral recombination of SARS-CoV-2 in pangolin cannot be excluded [
