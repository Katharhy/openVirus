<p>Initially in Italy, NPS/OPS were carried out on symptomatic subjects only. When the infection spread to other Italian regions including Veneto, it became evident that this policy was not enough and swabs were, therefore, also performed on asymptomatic subjects or those with few or mild symptoms. Veneto was the region that first pursued early SARS-CoV-2 detection by searching for the virus even in asymptomatic subjects and imposing self-isolation or quarantine. This proved to be the winning strategy to stem the spread of the wave of infections, in order to prevent the regional health system from being overwhelmed. </p>
