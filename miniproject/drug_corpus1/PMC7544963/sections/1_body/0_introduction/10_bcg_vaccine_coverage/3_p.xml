<p>During 1940–1980, many nations started the program of BCG vaccination; however, a few nations, such as, Romania and Uzbekistan, had started vaccination much earlier in 1928 and 1937, respectively, while few African countries, for example, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, began to provide BCG vaccination as late as in 1991 and 1990, respectively. To date, nine countries have stopped the program of universal BCG vaccination. Spain and Denmark were among the first countries to stop in 1981–1986, while Austria and Germany halted the vaccination in 1990 and 1998, respectively. The remaining nations, including the Isle of Man, Slovenia, the United Kingdom, Finland, and France, stopped their respective BCG vaccination programs somewhere between 2005 and 2007. While some of these nations have stopped vaccination programs universally, many of them continue to provide BCG vaccination to high-risk groups or individuals, including those involved in occupations with high-risk of exposure to TB and children born in an environment with high burden of TB.
