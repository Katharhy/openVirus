 </sup> However, during the last 18Â years, two human pathogenic CoVs, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have caused epidemics that originated in China (2002) and Saudi Arabia (2012), respectively, and spread over to several countries with high morbidity and mortality.

 </sup> Thus, in the recorded history of humans, the existing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is the third human CoV outbreak. SARS-CoV-2 has higher genetic relatedness with SARS-CoV (nearly 80%) than with MERS-CoV (nearly 50%).
