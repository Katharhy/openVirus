<p>The signifying advantage of BCG vaccination, an early life immunization with unique formulations, is an unanticipated reduction (∼50%) in all-cause mortality, especially in low-birth weight males, greatly exceeding that attributable to TB prevention. This mortality benefit has been related to prevention of sepsis and respiratory infections, suggesting that BCG vaccine induces “heterologous” cross-protection against unrelated pathogens. The nonavailability of a suitable vaccine or therapeutic option to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic is forcing researchers and public health experts to be assertive on the use of BCG vaccine to control the COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 especially the adult and old-age population. It is unclear whether the vaccine given to old-age population will make adequate or similar immunological response as delivered to the young age population. The ongoing clinical trials of BCG in health care workers are anticipated to provide an insight on the usage of TB vaccine in old-age population against COVID-19.</p>
