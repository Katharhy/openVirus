<p>The data and statistics available from limited investigations have revealed a correlation between the use of BCG vaccination and protection from COVID-19. However, further studies are required to judge the prophylactic and/or therapeutic significance of BCG vaccine against COVID-19 and to strengthen the evidence of the molecular mechanisms proving this hypothesis. Considering the global need to restrain the COVID-19 emergence and transmission, scholars at Murdoch Childrenâ€™s Research Institute in Australia (MCRI) are underway to explore the use of BCG vaccine-generated cross-protection in countering COVID-19.</p>
