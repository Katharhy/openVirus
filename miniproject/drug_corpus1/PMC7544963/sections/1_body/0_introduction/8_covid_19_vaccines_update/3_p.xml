<p>The Johnson and Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceutical research teams, in collaboration with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, part of Harvard Medical School, have selected its lead vaccine candidate Ad26-COV2-S, recombinant for prevention of coronavirus infection. They have started the Phase-I/II a first-in-human clinical trial of its investigational SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, Ad26.COV2-S, recombinant. The NVX-CoV2373 is a prefusion protein CoV vaccine candidate made using Novavaxâ€™s proprietary nanoparticle technology, Matrix-M, which is an adjuvant to enhance immune responses and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies. In preclinical trials, NVX-CoV2373 showed efficient binding with receptors of the SARS-CoV-2. Sanofi-GSK using a combination of innovative technologies developed an adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to prevent COVID-19 disease. The companies may start phase-I clinical trials in the second half of 2020 and, aim to complete the development of the vaccine by the second half of 2021. Vaxart develop an oral H1 influenza vaccine targeting the SARS-CoV-2. The phase-II clinical study showed that oral H1 flu tablet vaccine protects against influenza infection after just one dose. Based on these results, it is considered to protect against mucosal respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2.</p>
