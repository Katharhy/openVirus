 </sup> analyzed data on BCG vaccination from 81 countries, including Canada, Italy, and the United States. The results of the study revealed that there is higher COVID-19 infectivity (11.2% versus 8.53%), case positivity (1043.9 versus 172.4), and deaths (48.9 versus 4.3) per million population in countries that have not adopted BCG vaccination as compared to those that use BCG vaccines. As stated previously, the higher protection against COVID-19 morbidity and mortality observed in countries that provide BCG vaccination during childhood might be due to provoking of both nonspecific and cross-protective immune responses.

 </sup> The trained immunity conferred by BCG vaccination include the enhanced expression of certain resistance factors like IL-Î² which might have a major role in reducing the level of viremia in infected hosts as shown in case of yellow fever virus administration.
