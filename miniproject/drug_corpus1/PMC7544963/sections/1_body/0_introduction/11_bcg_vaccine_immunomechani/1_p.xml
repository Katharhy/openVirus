<p>The live attenuated BCG-TB vaccine proficiently induces nonspecific cross-protection against pathogens, which may be different from the cause of target disease.

 </sup> BCG vaccination in children reduces mortality and elicits an improved innate immune response against different microorganisms in addition to 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, such as 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. This nonspecific immune protection is provided by the innate immune cells, including monocytes and natural killer cells, and this development does not depend on T or memory B cells. The monocytes are epigenetically reprogrammed at the site of immunization such that there is histone modification in the promoter region of genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines and hence, there is a long-term change in their ability to respond to novel stimuli. These monocytes exhibit enhanced production of cytokines like IL1β, IFNγ and TNFα in response to infection with several different pathogens.

 </sup> The phenomenon of producing a memory-like response in innate immune cells is known as “trained immunity.”
