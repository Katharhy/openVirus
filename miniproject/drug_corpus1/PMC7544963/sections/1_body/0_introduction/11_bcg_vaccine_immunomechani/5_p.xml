<p>The immediate defense against an infection is provided by the innate immune system and is vital for effective initiation of adaptive immunity.

 </sup> In contrast, adaptive immunity is mediated by T cells, B cells, and memory cells and it provides antigen-specific responses. T and B cells recognize a variety of antigens through unique T-cell receptors (TCRs) and B-cell receptors (BCRs), respectively. The activation of T and B cells lead to the development of killer cytotoxic T cells (cellular immunity)

 </sup> and production of antibodies by differentiated plasma B cells (humoral immunity).

 </sup> The immune response is initiated by the interaction between the innate immune cells and adaptive immune system.
