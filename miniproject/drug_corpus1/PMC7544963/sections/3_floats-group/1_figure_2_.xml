 <attrib>Activation of phagocytes and a new cytokine environment leads to differentiation of naïve CD4 + T cells into TH1 and/or TH2 cells, which direct the immune response toward cellular or humoral immunity, respectively. The therapeutic effect of BCG depends on proper induction of TH1 immune response. IL-10 inhibits TH1 immune response, whereas IFN-γ inhibits TH2 immune response. Blocking IL-10 or inducing IFN-γ can lead to TH1-dominated immunity, which is essential for BCG-mediated heterologous immunity.</attrib>
