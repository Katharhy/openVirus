<p>Patients suffering of a pulmonary virus infection, including COVID-19, are often administered prophylactic antibiotics, including azithromycin, moxifloxacin, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, or cefepime, to reduce the risk of secondary infections; often in addition to another antibiotic that is deployed once the infection is identified (

As the numbers of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains continue to grow, there is increased the risk of superinfection in severely ill patients, especially in intensive care units (ICUs). During the COVID-19 pandemic, many clinical case studies of COVID-19 patients have been reported, but mainly these focus on the viral infection itself. There are few reports detailing secondary bacterial infections and even less describing AMR. Until a vaccine is deployed globally, bacterial secondary infections will continue to be important in COVID-19 clinical care. New antibiotics or alternative treatments targeted against secondary bacterial infections need to be developed for COVID-19 and subsequent pandemics.
