<p>The use of sub-lethal concentrations (concentration of antibiotics lower than minimal inhibitory concentrations) of antibiotics can enhance phage productivity mediating phage induced bacterial decline (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Tagliaferri et al., 2019</xref>), known as phage-antibiotic synergy. One factor proposed responsible for phage-antibiotic synergy is bacterial elongation or filamentation induced by sub-lethal concentrations of antibiotics (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). While different antibiotics exhibit different inhibitory mechanisms, they often result in the blocking of bacterial cell division causing elongation of the bacterial cell, as a large bacterial surface area is available for phage attachment, bacterial cells are vulnerable toward phage infection, increasing the efficacy of phage lytic activity (

 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). Antibiotic-induced morphological changes in the host bacterium can permit faster phage assembly due to altered or abundant precursors required for phage maturation, which ultimately can result in an acceleration of cell lysis (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Nouraldin et al., 2016</xref>). Beta-lactam antibiotics and quinolones can stimulate virulent phage production, together with the changes induced in bacterial membrane proteins by antibiotics and may enhance the lytic activity of phages and increase phage burst size observed in phage-antibiotic studies (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Jo et al., 2016a</xref>). A further advantage of using sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics is avoidance of side effects from administration of otherwise necessary higher doses of the antibiotic (
