<p>Another solution to overcome such limitations is to conduct combination therapy. The combined use of phages and antibiotics is expected to provide stronger suppression of bacterial growth and is expected to help reduce bacterial resistance against phages and antibiotics (different targets are used by the two agents). Recent 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have shown improved efficacy in controlling the growth of bacterial pathogens such as 
 <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> using combinations of phages and antibiotics (

 <italic>vice versa</italic>. Phage-antibiotic therapy can prevent the emergence of double resistant bacterial mutants, as a bacterium is unlikely to acquire phage and antibiotic resistance simultaneously. For the success of combination therapies, it is essential to carefully choose the dosage as well as the point of administration of each antibacterial agent. Administration of antibiotics prior to the phage resulted in the decreased evolution of phage resistance due to antibiotic stress (
