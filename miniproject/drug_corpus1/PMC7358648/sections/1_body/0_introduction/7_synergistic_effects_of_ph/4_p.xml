<p>Infections caused by biofilm-forming bacteria, especially nosocomial infections, are difficult to treat using antibiotics (

Combined phage and antibiotic therapy with a sequential approach of administering the antibiotic after phage treatment of the biofilm has shown success; initial treatment of the biofilm with phages caused biofilm disintegration, while later administration of the antibiotic prevented biofilm regrowth as well as the emergence of phage-resistant mutants. Phages can enable antibiotics to penetrate biofilm layers by degrading the biofilm matrix; phages penetrate into deeper layers of the biofilm, replicating in the lower layers and facilitating the destruction of the biofilm (
