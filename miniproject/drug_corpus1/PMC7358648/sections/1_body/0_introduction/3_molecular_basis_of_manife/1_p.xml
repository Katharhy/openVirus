<p>There are several hypotheses why secondary infections quickly establish in patients with a pulmonary viral infection, including immunological host changes, mechanical damage and diffusion, and removal of mucus within the lungs. Much of how secondary infections manifest themselves and what role the immune response to a virus influences the defense against a prokaryotic pathogen, is poorly understood. The prevalence of secondary bacterial infections during a primary virus disease is due to the altered immune response to one pathogen (here: the virus) that often changes the response of the system to the other infectious agent (here: the bacterium), resulting in increased morbidity (

These immune alterations termed “trained immunity,” “innate imprinting,” or “immune paralysis,” change the inflammatory response of immune cells (

This change in the microbiome has been suggested to possibly modulate immune cell priming against secondary bacterial challenge (
