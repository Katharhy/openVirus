<p>Phage proteins can be extracted and also engineered for deployment as an alternative to whole phage therapeutic applications. Endolysins are phage-encoded enzymes produced at the end of the bacteriophage lytic lifecycle that facilitate release of phage progeny into the environment, degrading the peptidoglycan layer of the host bacterial cell wall (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Imanishi et al., 2019</xref>). The ability of endolysins to digest the bacterial cell wall when applied exogenously offers the opportunity for their deployment as potential antibacterial agents, to target and kill pathogenic bacteria, potentially without harming the normal microflora due to specificity of enzyme activity (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Haddad Kashani et al., 2017</xref>). The chances of bacteria developing resistance toward endolysins are low since endolysins target cell wall molecules essential for bacterial viability (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">≈Åusiak-Szelachowska et al., 2020</xref>). Phage-derived endolysins are promising candidates for treating secondary bacterial infections or multi-drug resistant infections (

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). There are five main classes of endolysins based on their enzymatic specificity (

 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Schmelcher et al., 2012</xref>). Several applications for endolysins have been reported, including use in biocontrol agents against bacterial pathogens in food and agricultural industries (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Matamp and Bhat, 2019</xref>) and as strong antibacterial agents for human pathogens in animal models (

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">de Wit et al., 2019</xref>). Most naturally occurring endolysins have limited effect on Gram-negative bacteria as the outer membrane (OM) protects the peptidoglycan layer from being attacked by the enzyme. However, efficient endolysin-mediated inactivation of Gram-negative pathogens can be achieved by either chemical/physical permeabilization of the OM (such as pressure or chelation of divalent ions), or by creating endolysin-peptide-fusions that have the ability to permeabilize the OM (
