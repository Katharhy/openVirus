<p>The past two decades have seen the emergence of four severe viral outbreaks including the 2002 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus (CoV) epidemic, the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, 2012 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak, and most recently the COVID-19 pandemic. Emergence of novel lethal CoV strains in human populations are becoming more frequent and are of increasing global concern; SARS-CoV-2, a novel CoV that caused a first major outbreak in China in 2019 has now infected almost 8 million people globally and resulted in 434,000 deaths (as of June 15, 2020), a far greater disease burden than SARS and MERS (

However, even with many potential repurposed and new anti-viral drug candidates able to inhibit replication or attachment of the virus, a major consequence of disease progression in patients at later stages of infection, are secondary bacterial infections. At least one in seven COVID-19 patients was found to be additionally infected with a secondary bacterial infection with 50% of the fatalities during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic caused by untreated or untreatable secondary bacterial infections, in most cases in the lung (

While antibiotics do not have impact on the virus itself, almost all seriously ill patients are treated with antibiotics to attempt to prevent the occurrence of secondary bacterial infections. Any surge in antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic will have a detrimental effect on antibiotic resistance rates for nosocomial bacterial pathogens, fueling global growth of antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens (
