<p>A major advantage of phages is that they exhibit bacterial host specificity (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Seguin et al., 2006</xref>) and selectively target pathogenic bacteria without adverse effects on the normal microflora (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Brüssow, 2005</xref>). Phages may be genus- or species-specific, and even strain-specific, infecting and killing their target bacterium. As most secondary bacterial infections are caused by one bacterial genus, species or strain, phage therapy offers a promising treatment option. Clinical studies using phages have demonstrated success at eliminating resistant bacterial strains (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2013</xref>). Intact phage particles do not adversely interact with human cells and are not able to cause infections in humans (

The self-replicating nature of phages enables them to function as “active and self-replicating” drugs once administered to the patient so dosage is less important to reach therapeutic levels; however—in practice—a large quantity of phages are being deployed (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Barr, 2019</xref>). Phages show low toxicity; being mainly composed of protein and DNA and eventually undergo degradation inside a patient’s body. Degradation of phage particles does not result in the production of toxic molecules, unlike antibiotics that could apply strain on the liver and might result in organ failure. Since most secondary bacterial infections occur in immunocompromised or immunodeficient patients, it is necessary to study the efficacy of phage therapy under such conditions. Previous studies on cancer patients and renal allograft patients showed that phage therapy can be effective in treating secondary bacterial infections and co-infections (

 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Miȩdzybrodzki et al., 2012</xref>). Phages often do not cause an immune response, in contrast to human-pathogenic viruses (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Manohar et al., 2019a</xref>). The levels to which administered phages can induce immune responses have been well studied and no adverse side effects have been observed (

 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Voelker, 2019</xref>). While there is a lack of evidence showing the efficacy of phage therapy during viral infections, bacteriophages have been shown to be effective prophylactic agents (
