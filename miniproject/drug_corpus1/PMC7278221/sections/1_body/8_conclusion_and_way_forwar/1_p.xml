<p id="Par42">After several months’ lockdown, China is now reopening, facing the risk of second wave of COVD-19. In Italy, despite lots of patients had already been infected, second wave of diseases is also challenging should they reopen the cities, as there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered are protected from a second infection. While waiting for an effective vaccine for COVID-19 and for a clear specific treatment, current management is highly depended on supportive therapy. The best way to reduce the mortality is therefore related first of all to risk reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This might be achieved by combining six main actions: social distance, masks, hygiene recommendations, contact tracing, extensive use of early diagnosis tools, and confirmed and suspected cases quarantine. We learnt from countries like South Korea and Singapore that such approaches can be feasible, even in absence of very strict lockdown. Secondly, strengthen health systems capacity in order to be fully equipped in terms of medical staff and optimal equipment’s to prevent medical resource be overwhelmed. The implementation of these measures is pivotal to prevent re-infections and reactivation of the pandemic; therefore, the future working society and economy must adapt to these measures.</p>
