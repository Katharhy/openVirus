<p id="Par23">However, the sensitivity of serological assays is influenced by both the time of sample collection as well as human immune response status. In the study by Guo et al., as high as 22.0% (18/82) of the PCR confirmed cases were found to be negative by an IgM antibody tests. Most of the COVID-19 patients were able to generate antibody within 10 days after symptoms onset. Suspected patients who tested IgM/IgG negative in their early phase of disease could have repeated IgM/IgG tests

 </sup>, if nucleic acid tests are not available. In addition, the serological assays can also provide historic information about viral exposure, which are important for epidemiology studies. Interestingly, early presence of IgA might be protective and a surrogate marker of good outcome, detecting of which may help identifying patients warrant medical attention
