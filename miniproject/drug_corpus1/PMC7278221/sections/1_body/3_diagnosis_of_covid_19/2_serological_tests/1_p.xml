<p id="Par22">Serological assays detect both SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies IgM, IgA, and IgG, which are produced both at the early and later phases of the disease, respectively. Unlike PCR tests, antibody tests could be less accurate and require longer time to be established as routine tests. However, serological tests are portable, user-friendly, and can produce results in 10–30 min at least at the qualitative level. Moreover, they request very limited sample volume: one drop of blood from a pinprick is sufficient to detect the antibodies. Therefore, they can be established as decentralized point-of-care (POC) tests. In a cohort comprised of 82 confirmed and 58 probable (qPCR test is negative despite other indications of COVID-19 including symptoms and epidemiology) COVID-19 cases, the positive detection rate is extremely high (98.6%) when PCR is performed in conjunction with IgM ELISA for every patient as compared to qPCR analysis alone (51.9%)

 </sup>. Therefore, the serological tests could be used together with nuclei acid detection to increase the sensitivity of tests. In China, some of these kits have received fast-track approval from the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). In the USA, only one serological test has been approved by the date of submission. These tests are of good accuracy with sensitivity range from 87.3% to 97.2% and specificity range from 95.6% to 100%. The detailed serological tests has been reviewed elsewhere
