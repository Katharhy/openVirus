<p id="Par21">Despite the high accuracy of the PCR tests, these nucleic acid tests highly depend on the procedures of sample collecting, in addition to high labor and time costing. The test protocol is generally expensive and complex, and therefore difficult to be broadly applied in resource limited locations. Transferring samples to a central laboratory not only decrease the accuracy of the tests either by sample decay due to incorrect storage or contamination but also further delay the test results. A false-positive test could result in an unnecessary quarantine and therapy while a false-negative diagnosis may allow infected patients to spread the virus. Therefore, other methods are also needed to serve as a supplement. Most importantly, as the virus spreading many healthcare personnel have caused wanton community transmission before correct testing allowed isolation and tracking. Therefore, tests that are able to be scaled up quickly are urgently needed.</p>
