Since azithromycin is known to reversibly binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit of the 70S ribosome to inhibit the translocation step of protein synthesis, whether it has antiviral effect is not known. It is also not known whether azithromycin synergize with HCQ to provide better antiviral activity. A recent prospective study failed to find antiviral activity or clinical benefit of this combination for the treatment of our hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 (ref.
