<p id="Par29">Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) is a mix of protease inhibitors commonly used for the therapy of HIV-1 infection, often known as highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). The combination of LPV/r with additional ribavirin was reported to be able to reduce the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality in SARS patients

 </sup>. LPV/r was therefore repurposed to treat COVID-19, as SARS-CoV-2 was genetically close to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. However, in a retrospective study with 134 patients (more than 95% patients were mild cases), we recently find that administration of LPV/r along with interferon alpha inhaling was not associated with faster virological clearance or clinical improvement
