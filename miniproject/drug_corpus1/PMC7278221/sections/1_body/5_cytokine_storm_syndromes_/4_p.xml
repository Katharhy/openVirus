<p id="Par38">CQ and HCQ might also be able to modulate the over activated immune response. They alter the pH and disrupt autophagy and lysosomal activity, destabilize membrane, and disrupt signaling pathways and transcriptional activity, subsequently inhibiting antigen presentation, immune activation, MHC class II expression, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines, and deregulation of co-stimulatory molecules

 </sup>. However, whether its suppression on the immune response may lead to delay of SARS-CoV-2 clearance is still unclear. In some viral diseases including HIV infection, HCQ administration was associated with increased viral replication
