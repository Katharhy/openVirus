<p id="Par39">Other therapeutic drugs that under investigation include the IL-1 inhibitor, IL-6 inhibitor, and JAK-STAT signal pathway inhibitors. Treatment with IL-1 blockade, in a phase 3 randomized controlled trial in sepsis patients with macrophage activation syndrome, resulted in a drastic improvement in the 28-day survival rate

 </sup>. IL-6 inhibitor, which was used as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and CRS associated with CAR-T cell therapies for cancer, has now repurposed to treating COVID-19 in severe and critical patients as recommended by a Chinese government guideline

 </sup>. Interestingly, preliminary results from the two available IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab and sarilumab) with different study population showed contrasting results, indicating that choose appropriate population is essential for anti-IL-6 treatment

 </sup>. Recently, a pilot study suggest that JAK inhibitor is active, well tolerated in patients with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis indicating these drug maybe apply to COVID-19 treatment
