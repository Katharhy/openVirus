 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> compares the major characteristics of COVID-19 in China versus Italy. Patients in Italy were more older compared to patients in China, with more numbers of comorbidities. The number and severity of these co-morbidity has been a major factor influencing the outcome; this was particularly evident where the virus diffused into old pension homes. Indeed, while the mortality was 3.1% in Italy, with the exception of the Milan area (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) where it was 6.8%, within the residences for old people it peaked to 24% (

In this case, out of 3859 death, only 133 were confirmed by swabs, while 1310 had all symptoms but they were not tested. Disease severity was strongly age dependent, primarily due to the presence of comorbidities. Therefore, the proportions of severe and critical patients in Italy were higher than that in China, partially leading to a higher mortality.
