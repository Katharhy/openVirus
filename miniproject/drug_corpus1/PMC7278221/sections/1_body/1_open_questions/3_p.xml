 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> show the current set of data of the pandemic, with a special attention to China and Italy. With the great efforts mostly based on strict containment measures, China has successfully emerged out of the first wave of the epidemic at the beginning of April 2020, when the social order slowly returned to the norms. Although different precautionary measures have been taken at national level in the EU to limit and to monitor the entrance of potential COVID-19 cases from China, the first symptomatic cases have been reported before the end of February in a number of EU countries including Italy, Spain, Germany, and, just weeks later, UK. In this context, Italy is one of the first and hardest hit country in Europe, with over 219,000 cases and 30,500 deaths reported.
