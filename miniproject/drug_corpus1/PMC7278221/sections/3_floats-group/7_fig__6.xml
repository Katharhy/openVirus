  <title>Daily incidence of new infections and future scenarios.</title>
  <p>The Leopoldina Statement reported the daily incidence of new covid-19 infections in Germany (
   <bold>a</bold> blue dots and line) followed by a statistical modeling of new infections, with full implementation of all proposed measure of containment (hygiene recommendations, physical distancing, nose and mouth protection, testing, digital data tracking, selected targeted quarantine) with a very gradual relaxation of restrictive measures imposed to public life (
   <bold>a</bold>, green line 1). Conversely, the scenario proposes a fast reactivation of the infections (
   <bold>a</bold>, reddish line 2) if the proposed measures fail to be implemented. The read frequency of cases in South Korea (
   <bold>b</bold>), despite full implementation, shows that sporatic new infections cannot be fully avoided despite serious prevention, resulting in a low grade of endemic cases
