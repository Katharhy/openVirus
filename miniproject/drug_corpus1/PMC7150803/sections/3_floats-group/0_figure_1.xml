  <p>Reverse genetic system for the recovery of a recombinant canine distemper virus (CDV) wild-type strain. The five recombinant plasmids used for the recovery of a recombinant CDV strain, including one T7-promoter driven full-length cDNA expressing plasmid containing the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) gene inserted between the fusion (F) and hemagglutinin (H) genes, four cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-governed supporting plasmids expressing the nucleocapsid (N), phospo (P), and large (L) proteins respectively, and the T7 polymerase plasmid (
   <bold>a</bold>), which could be replaced by baby hamster kidney cells stably expressing T7 RNA polymerase (BSR-T7) or the modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA-T7) virus (
   <bold>b</bold>). The recovery process for the generation of the recombinant CDV is as follows: All plasmids are used for the simultaneous cotransfection of 293 cells (
   <bold>a</bold>), or BSR-T7 cells or MVA-T7 infected cells (
   <bold>b</bold>), followed by identification of the expression of EGFP in infected foci, and the overlay of B95a or Vero-SLAM (Vero cells expressing the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule [SLAM] receptor) cells for subsequent viral propagation.
