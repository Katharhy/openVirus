  <p>Possible mechanisms of the lysis of tumor cells upon infection with an oncolytic virus. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Binding to receptors initiates the internalization of the virus, which then release the viral nucleic acid, starting viral proliferation and release, leading to the apoptosis of tumor cells. (
   <bold>b</bold>) A pathogen-associated molecular pattern stimulates the production of antiviral cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]), which leads to the activation of immune cells, mediating cytotoxicity and phagocytosis. Meanwhile, major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I-mediated presentation of viral proteins activates CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells, triggering lysis of the oncolytic virally-infected tumor cells. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Secretion of IFN-γ and IL-12 might initiate the complex interplay between IFN-γ, IL-12, natural killer (NK)-cells, and IFN-γ-inducible protein (IP-10), leading to the eventual limitation of tumor angiogenesis. Moreover, externalization of vasostatin is also involved in the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. The arrows indicate the various steps and the components of an oncolytic virus during exerting the lysis of tumor cells, with the bar indicating their participation inhabiting the tumor angiogenesis.
