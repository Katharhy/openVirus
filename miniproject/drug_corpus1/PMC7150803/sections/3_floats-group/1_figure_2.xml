  <p>Schematic of the entry cells and tissues, dissemination, and shedding process of CDV in infected dogs. (
   <bold>a</bold>) CDV infects macrophages or dendritic cells of the respiratory epithelium by binding with SLAM; (
   <bold>b</bold>) immune cells of the lymph nodes are infected and then the CDV disseminates to the spleen, thymus, etc.; (
   <bold>c</bold>) CDV further infects epithelial tissues by binding to the receptor nectin-4 of epithelial cells of the basolateral surface; (
   <bold>d</bold>) CDV is released from the apical surface of epithelial cells.
