<p>Due to the availability of an RGS for manipulating CDV genomes and generating respective recombinant viruses, a number of recombinant viruses based on attenuated CDV strains has been generated that present antigens of foreign pathogens during CDV replication. These recombinant vaccines have an excellent safety record in animal models and elicit humoral as well as cellular immune responses in vaccinated animals, which are responsible for long-lasting protection (
