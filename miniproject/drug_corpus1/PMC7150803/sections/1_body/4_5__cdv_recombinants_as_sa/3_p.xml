<p>In general, as a nonsegmented negative-strand RNA virus, the lack of a significant nuclear phase in CDV is a favorable aspect with respect to vector development because it insulates these infectious agents from extensive interference of genetic and cellular processes. Thus, the fact that the CDV genome does not recombine is also of relevance for viral-vector development. In addition, most of CDV vaccine strains showed a good safety record in the context of canines, and diseases arising from Rockborn strain infection such as post-vaccination encephalitis have been stopped by vaccinations [

Importantly, a virus-based vector must not only be satisfactorily attenuated but must also maintain sufficient replication efficiency in cultured cells for enabling its production in amounts that allow it to be immunogenic in the host. In comparison with other RNA virus vectors, CDV as a replication-competent vector appears to be clearly superior, as it can deliver foreign antigens in vivo with high efficacy for enabling the systemic spread and preferential infection of professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphoid and epithelial tissues; these vectors also show significant expression efficiency for foreign antigens as candidate multivalent vaccines [
