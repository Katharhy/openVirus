<p>There are several possible mechanisms through which an oncolytic virus could mediate oncolysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00339-f003">Figure 3</xref>). One of the mechanisms of viral oncolysis is known to be the direct destruction and lysis of tumor cells due to the overwhelming viral replication and release of virions from infected tumor cells, which destruct the tumor vasculature and subsequently trigger cellular defense mechanisms, causing the apoptosis and necrosis of tumor cells [

Another most likely mechanism is considered to be the induction of cytotoxic immune responses and phagocytosis: the activation of natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells triggers lysis of the virus-infected tumor cells, while neutrophils and macrophages exert increased phagocytic activities on tumor cells following viral entry [

In addition, initiation of the complex interplay between IFN-γ, IL-12, NK cells, and the angiotoxic IFN-γ-inducible protein (IP-10) might eventually lead to the depression of tumor angiogenesis and the induction of tumor regression, respectively. As known, IL-12 can mediate the production of IFN-γ by NK cells, and stimulate the accumulation of IP-10. Accordingly, IP-10-stimulated infiltrating NK-cells have been shown to exert a high killing effect on endothelial cells, leading to reduced tumor growth [
