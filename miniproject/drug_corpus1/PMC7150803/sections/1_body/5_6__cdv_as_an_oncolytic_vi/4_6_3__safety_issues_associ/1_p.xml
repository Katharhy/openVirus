<p>Safety is of paramount importance. CDV has a non-segmented genome rendering it stable, with a low risk of mutation, thus it is highly unlikely to revert to the pathogenic phenotype. As an effective oncolytic virus for canine cancer cells in vitro, live attenuated CDV strains also maintain the ability to enter the immune and epithelial cells in vivo via the SLAM and nectin-4 receptors. Thus, safety issues with respect to possible virus dissemination and therapeutic effects in animals and humans should be addressed. CDV is thought to be the result of a spillover transmission into dogs from MeV during human epidemics in the New World [

The recent notorious host-range expansion of CDV, particularly in non-human primates, and identification of single amino acid changes in the H protein of wild-type strains that allow them to use human SLAM and nectin-4 receptors, highlight the potential of CDV to enter into vacated ecological niches [

Although to our knowledge, no report has demonstrated CDV to be a zoonotic pathogen enabling transmission into humans from infected animals, safety issues regarding the use of CDV as an oncolytic virus in humans should also be considered due to the fact that the current MeV vaccine cannot completely protect against CDV infection in monkeys [
 <xref rid="B114-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Moreover, the use of CDV as an oncolytic virus may also raise new biosafety and risk management issues. The risk assessment for trials involving CDV must take into account and mitigate the potential risk of transmission of the infectious agent to wildlife, companion animals, and persons in contact with the treated patients. If necessary, the risk of disease or adverse effects associated with the viral therapeutic could be countered using antiviral agents effective against the CDV strains being considered for cancer treatment.
