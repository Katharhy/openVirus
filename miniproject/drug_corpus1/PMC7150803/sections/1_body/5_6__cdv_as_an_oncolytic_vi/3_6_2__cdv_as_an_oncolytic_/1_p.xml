<p>In the veterinary field, several viruses have been reported as oncolytic agents, including adenovirus, reovirus, vaccinia virus, and CDV. One advantage of CDV as an oncolytic virus is the relatively small size of CDV in comparison with DNA viruses. Only a few proteins of the virus are expressed in addition to those expressed from the artificial inserts, thus minimizing superfluous immune responses in vivo. Second, as members of the morbilliviruses, CDV shares many similarities with MeV, and represents an interesting candidate for its employment in oncolytic therapy, as naturally attenuated vaccine strains have been shown to be able to infect and induce apoptosis in many kinds of cancer cells (

Infection of canine lymphoid cell lines, including GLGL-90 chronic large granular lymphocytic T-cell leukemia cells, and 17–71 acute B-cell lymphoma cells, expressing SLAM on the surface of their cell membranes with the CDV Onderstepoort strain, has been shown to result in enhanced rates of apoptosis of tumor cells [

Similarly, enhanced rates of apoptosis have also been described in a human cervical tumor derived cell line (HeLa cells), after infection with the CDV Lederle strain. Apoptosis of the infected tumor cells was triggered by the intrinsic pathway, as demonstrated by an increase in the amount of the cleaved active form of the caspase-3 protein [

Persistent infection of DH82 cells with Onderstepoort was shown to lead to increased mRNA transcripts of immune response-activating signal transduction genes, as well as activated M1, and alternatively activated M2 macrophages, whereas it decreased the generation of blood vessels in a xenotransplant mouse model in vivo, investigating the antiangiogenic effect of a CDV infection of tumor cells [

Moreover, Onderstepoort-infected DH82 cells were reported to exhibit downregulation of the expression of the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and TIMP-2, whereas a higher number of mRNA transcripts was observed for the reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK) [
 <xref rid="B111-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. These results suggest that a CDV infection of canine histiocytic sarcoma cells could restore the expression of RECK and might positively influence tumor behavior and reduce its malignant potential [

Furthermore, CDV-L strains have also been demonstrated to restrict tumor growth without apparent pathology in a xenograft mouse model and exert antitumor effects in canine mammary tubular adenocarcinoma cells, where they induced apoptosis through the caspase-8 and caspase-3 pathways by activated NF-kB signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Recently, it was reported that infection of human adenocarcinoma, breast tumor, and mammary tumor, as well as canine adenofibrosarcoma with the Snyder Hill and Lederle CDV strains led to the death of tumor cells or late apoptosis associated with the expression of TNF-α induced protein 8 (TNFAIP8), strongly suggesting that both human and canine mammary tumor cells could be potential candidates for CDV-induced cancer therapy [
