<p>Cancer could be defined as the formation of a malignant tumor due to genetic mutations in normal cells leading to their indefinite growth and abnormal proliferation in the body and causing damage to the normal functions of the body. Many cancers remain incurable to modern therapy despite recent antitumor pharmacological regimens in both humans and animals. Roughly 1 to 2% of canines over the age of 10 die from cancer [

In humans and the veterinary field, the utilization of morbillivirus, adenovirus, vaccinia virus, coxsackie virus, and reovirus is being extensively investigated and these viruses have entered clinical trials for the treatment of a wide range of advanced cancers [

These viruses are named oncolytic viruses, as they ideally infect, replicate, and induce the lysis of cancer cells, whereas they do not harm noncancerous cell types. Upon cell lysis, viral progeny are released resulting in the infection of neighboring cancer cells allowing for the easy spread and escalation of the therapy. Oncolytic viruses could be targeted to cancer cells at several levels, including receptor-dependent viral entry, and viral replication [

 <xref rid="B90-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Recently, increasing studies on oncolytic viruses for cancer treatment have often been focused on engineering the virus to increase viral specificity and enhance the oncolytic effect to cancer cells. In 2015, a new drug for oncolytic virotherapy, talimogene laherparepvec (IMLYGIC), a herpes simplex virus, that has been genetically engineered to express granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to treat advanced melanoma was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and was licensed for marketing by the European Commission.
