<p>In addition to the identification of key residues in the H and F proteins sustaining the SLAM or nectin-4 receptor dependent cell entry and fusion in vitro [

 <xref rid="B50-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], several CDV RGS studies were recently performed on the establishment of genetic mutations or gene knockout strains to study the mechanisms of virulence in vivo. These studies investigated the determinants of CDV virulence, including not only the envelope (H, F, and M) and replication proteins (N, P, and L), but also the accessory C and V proteins that counteract host defenses [

 <xref rid="B52-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. To understand how CDV might invade the host and cause immunosuppression, CDV variants, which were SLAM-blind or incapable of expressing either one or both of the nonstructural V and C proteins (C- or V-knockout, or both), were generated based on RGS approaches and used to infect ferrets, respectively. Results confirmed that the V protein was able to sustain the swift lymphocyte-based invasion of mucosal tissues and lymphatic organs, as well as the inhibition of the induction of interferon (IFN)-α/β in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and that of other important cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), IFN-γ, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and IL-4 that control the activation of cellular and humoral immune processes, whereas the C protein was shown to be dispensable for the invasion of the lymphatic organs and appeared to sustain subsequent infection phases [

Detailed molecular analysis of the neuropathogenic CDV A75/17 strain demonstrated that the V protein specifically ablates the nuclear import of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 without affecting their activated phosphorylation states [

A further study demonstrated that the V protein could block type I and II IFN responses through inhibition of the nuclear translocation of STAT2 and mda5 signaling, but not STAT1, which was observed to be critical for lethal disease in ferrets [
