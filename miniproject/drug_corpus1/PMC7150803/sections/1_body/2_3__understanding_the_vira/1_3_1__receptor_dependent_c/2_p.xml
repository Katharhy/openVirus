<p>The CDV RGS has also been used to identify the key residues in the H protein interacting with cellular receptors and evaluate their contribution to the viral entry. Recently, the P493S/Y539A double mutations in the H protein were introduced in an unable to recognize nectin-4 (nectin-4-blind) recombinant CDV strain, which was recovered and used to infect ferrets. Although the infected ferrets showed no clinical signs or viral shedding, there was a rapid and efficient spreading of immune cells observed, producing the same levels of leukopenia and inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation activities as in the case of wild-type strain infected animals. This finding highlights the fact that the SLAM-expressing immune cells appear to be necessary for CDV entry, dissemination, and initial infection, as well as immunosuppression, whereas infection of nectin-4 mediated epithelial cells seems to be required for viral shedding and clinical disease, as well as viral transmission [

Additionally, a very recent in vivo study in ferrets infected with SLAM- or nectin-4-blind CDV strains caused by mutations in key residues of the H protein confirmed that sequential use of the SLAM and nectin-4 receptors is essential for the transmission of CDV to na√Øve hosts [

A further study on three simultaneously administered recombinant wild-type CDVs expressing green (Venus), red (dTom), or blue (TagBFP) fluorescent proteins to ferrets, allowing assessment of viral entry, intra-host dissemination, and inter-host transmission, showed that CDV could efficiently enter the host if delivered to the nose or lung, as well as lead to infection of the host through conjunctival administration [
