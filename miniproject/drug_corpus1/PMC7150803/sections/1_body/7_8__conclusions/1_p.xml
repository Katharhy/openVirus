<p>This review summarized the important roles that CDV RGS approaches have played in (1) the construction of recombinant CDV-based vaccines; (2) understanding the mechanisms of the cellular tropism and pathogenesis of CDV from a molecular perspective, comprising not only the interactions of the viral proteins with host cellular receptors but also the influence of host factors on viral virulence; and (3) the potential ability of CDV, particularly vaccine strains, to be used as an oncolytic virus against cancers in humans and animals by targeting tumor markers as viral receptors. However, the action of CDV as an oncolytic virus in human and canine cancers has been primarily evaluated in tumor cells in in vitro systems only. Detailed in vivo studies are highly required for a better understanding of the mechanisms of interactions between the virus and tumor cells, as well as of the impact on the microenvironment and antitumor immune reactions.</p>
