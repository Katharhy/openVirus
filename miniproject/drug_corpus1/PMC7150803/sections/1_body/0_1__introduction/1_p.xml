<p>Canine distemper virus (CDV) is an enveloped negative-RNA virus, which, along with measles virus (MeV), Rinderpest virus (RPV), peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV), phocine distemper virus (PDV), Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV), and recently discovered feline morbillivirus (FeMV), belongs to the 
 <italic>Morbilivirus</italic> genus within the 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Noted, CDV is the etiological agent of canine distemper (CD) that has been known since the mid-1700s and might have originated from the infection of dogs by MeV during human epidemics in the New World [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Both viral agents are known to be highly contagious, spread via the respiratory route, and cause a similar pathogenesis characterized by fever, skin rash, and conjunctivitis with profound immune suppression, but also elicit lifelong immunity in surviving hosts [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, MeV has a narrow natural host range restricted to humans and certain non-human primates, whereas CDV can infect most of the terrestrial and aquatic carnivorous species, even non-human primates. Over the past decades, CDV has caused several fatal outbreaks in wild carnivores and non-human primates, including the deaths of almost all African wild dogs (

 <italic>Phoca caspica</italic>), around 35% of Serengeti lions (
 <italic>Panthera leo</italic>), and 30% of rhesus monkeys (
 <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) [
