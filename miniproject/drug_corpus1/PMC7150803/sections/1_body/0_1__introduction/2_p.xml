<p>Currently, attenuated CDV strains are routinely used worldwide as live vaccines against CDV infection in dogs, minks, and other carnivores. However, these vaccines have often been reported as insufficiently attenuated for ferrets and other wildlife species and can cause symptomatic and sometimes fatal infections after administration, resulting in an increased interest for a safe and efficient CDV vaccine for highly susceptible species [

In addition, CDV can induce apoptosis in many cancer cell lines, including canine neoplastic lymphocytes, canine adenofibrosarcoma cells, human breast cancer cells, and human cervical cancer cells. Moreover, persistent infection by CDV has been shown to exhibit anti-angiogenic properties in a canine histiocytic cell line [
