<p>This review highlights the potential use of the CDV genome as a viral vector for the development of novel vaccines and oncolytic virotherapy against cancers. Specifically, the development of a CDV reverse genetics system (RGS) and identification of the viral cellular receptors over the past decades, contributed to the understanding of viral pathogenesis and the generation of recombinant CDV-based vaccines, as well as the exploitation of the oncolytic potential of the virus against cancers by targeting tumor markers as viral receptors.</p>
