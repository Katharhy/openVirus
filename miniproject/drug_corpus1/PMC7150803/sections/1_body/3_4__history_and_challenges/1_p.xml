<p>Both live-attenuated and inactivated CDV vaccines have been used to reduce the number of CD outbreaks in ferret, mink, and dog populations [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. However, compared with live-attenuated vaccines, inactivated vaccines have been reported to provide insufficient protection due to a weaker inflammatory response to antigens [
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Until recently, two live-attenuated vaccine strains against CDV, both introduced in the early 1960s, were available. The first live-attenuated vaccine strain, the Onderstepoort, was developed from a natural isolate from an infected fox, which was passaged in ferrets and then adapted to chicken embryos, and later replaced with chicken cell cultures [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The other was generated by adaptation of the Rockborn strain to canine kidney cell cultures [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The canine-adapted cell culture vaccine is known to offer protection to almost 100% of vaccinated dogs, but on rare occasions can cause post-vaccination encephalitis [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although these two vaccines significantly reduced the number of CDV infections in domestic dog populations, they were insufficiently attenuated for use in wildlife species. For example, the Rockborn strain vaccine generated in canine cells was reported to cause disease in grey foxes (
 <italic>Urocyon cinereoargenteus</italic>) and ferrets (
 <italic>Mustela nigripes</italic>) [

 <xref rid="B60-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], while the Onderstepoort strain vaccine might be fatal for both the European mink (
 <italic>Mustela lutreola</italic>) and ferrets [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Problems associated with live-attenuated vaccines, especially their unsuitability for many endangered species, have served as the incentive for the development of recombinant vaccines, which can be safely used across species, particularly for wildlife. Respectively, the recently generated recombinant CDV vaccine, incorporating the envelope proteins of CDV in a strain of canarypox virus, was shown to be safe to all susceptible species tested to date [
 <xref rid="B61-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,
 <xref rid="B62-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. However, it is replication incompetent and as such induces a milder immunological response than live-attenuated vaccines, thus requiring regular reimmunization [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Recently, CDV DNA vaccines encoding viral nucleocapsid and envelope proteins have also shown promise by inducing a strong protective humoral and cell-mediated immune response and protecting dogs and minks against wild-type CDV challenges [
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,
 <xref rid="B67-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Although effective and relatively inexpensive to produce, problems associated with the vaccination regime and efficient delivery routes must be resolved to make DNA vaccines an effective alternative to live-attenuated vaccines for wildlife.
