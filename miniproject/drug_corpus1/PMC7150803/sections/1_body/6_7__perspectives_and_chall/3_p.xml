<p>Recently, “immunovirotherapy” strategies to enhance the oncolytic efficacy of MeV have been developed with the introduction of immunomodulatory transgenes (GM-CSF, IFN-β, IL-12 and IL-15, etc.) and antibodies against immune checkpoint inhibitors (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4, CTLA-4 and programmed cell death-1, PD-1) that stimulate the native anti-tumor immune response. These strategies were used for MeV-susceptible cancer mouse models and showed significantly-senhanced tumor regression or prolonged overall survival, which were correlated with an influx of host neutrophils and tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T cells [

Tumor cells have been demonstrated to exploit this mechanism of T cell ablation to evade the immune system. Thus, the antibodies blocking CTLA-4 and PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 show promising anti-tumor effects in a wide range of tumor types by priming T cells against tumor antigens [

 <xref rid="B125-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Taken together, the potential synergistic clinical improvements brought about by employing a combination of immunovirotherapy and clinical treatments, including chemo- and radiotherapy will be vital for future directions in the use of CDV as an oncolytic agent.
