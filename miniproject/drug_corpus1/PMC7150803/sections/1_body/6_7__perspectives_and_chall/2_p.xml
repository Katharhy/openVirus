<p>Today, several limitations remain in the development of an ideal oncolytic virus, including (1) selective targeting of oncolytic viruses to tumor tissue, (2) relatively poor viral spread throughout solid tumor tissues, (3) inefficient viral replication in immunocompetent hosts, and (4) disadvantageous ratio between the anti-viral and anti-tumoral immunity. As far as CDV is concerned, virotherapeutic studies have been primarily performed using CDV vaccine strains rather than wild-type strains, due to the exceptional genetic stability and safety record in canine populations [

 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Nevertheless, most dogs are vaccinated against CDV, and thus the high prevalence of virus-neutralizing antibodies could be one major obstacle restricting the use of CDV as oncolytic viruses and therapeutics for canine cancer patients. Use of genetically engineered viruses through RGS approaches, such as the use of chimeric viruses combining the envelope glycoproteins from MeV or removing key neutralizing epitopes on the surface of viral H or F might help avoid instances of preexisting immunity and overcome such antiviral host immune responses. In addition, intratumoral or mucosal viral application or administration of higher doses of the virus could also be a solution for cases of preexisting immunity problems [

 <xref rid="B117-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Accordingly, the VSV/CDV hybrid virus could also be enhanced to spread the cytopathic effect in cancer cells compared with CDV alone.
