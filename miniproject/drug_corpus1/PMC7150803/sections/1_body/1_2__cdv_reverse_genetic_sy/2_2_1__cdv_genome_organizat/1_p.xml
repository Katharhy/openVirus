<p>The CDV genome is 15,690 nucleotides in length and consists of a short 3′ leader region and 6 genes encoding the nucleocapsid (N), phospho (P), matrix (M), fusion (F), hemagglutinin (H), and large (L) proteins, which are separated by intergenic regions of 3 nucleotides and followed by a short 5′ trailer region. The V and C nonstructural proteins are encoded within the P gene. The V protein is expressed by cotranscriptional RNA editing, and C is expressed from an overlapping reading frame [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The N, P, and L proteins together with the viral RNA constitute the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, which either directs the sequential synthesis of capped and polyadenylated mRNAs from 6 transcription units or the replication of full-length encapsidated antigenomes. The H glycoprotein mediates the binding of the virus to the cell membrane, and the F glycoprotein executes the fusion of the 2 membranes, enabling the entry of the viral RNP into the cytoplasm and the initiation of an infectious cycle [

 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. As CDV is a member of the morbilliviruses, it is known that its genomic or antigenomic RNA, as for all 
 <italic>Mononegavirales</italic>, cannot function as mRNA. Thus, to generate the viral RNP, the minimal infectious unit of negative-strand RNA viruses, simultaneous expression of viral protein components forming the polymerase complex, and full-length viral antigenomic RNA (cRNA) from cDNA are required [
