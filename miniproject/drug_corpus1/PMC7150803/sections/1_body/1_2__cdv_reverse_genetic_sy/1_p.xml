<p>The development of the RGS of RNA viruses can be used to produce modified viruses that have specific properties with potential applications in vaccine development, gene therapy, and basic science. Concomitantly, foreign genes were inserted to (1) allow localization of viral replication in vivo through the expression of marker genes, (2) develop candidate multivalent vaccines against vector viruses and other pathogens, and (3) create candidate oncolytic viruses. The vector use of RNA viruses was experimentally encouraged by the pronounced and unexpected genetic stability of the recombinants, and by the high load of insertable genetic material [
