<p>In standard RNA virus RGSs, an exact 3′-end of the antigenome is generated by autocatalytic cleavage from a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (HDV-Rbz) sequence positioned directly downstream of the antigenome. Accordingly, the first established CDV RGS was the Vero cell-adapted Onderstepoort vaccine strain, which was recovered from Vero cells overlaying vaccinia-T7 virus-infected HeLa or 293 cells after cotransfection with a plasmid encoding the full-length cDNA (driven by an optimal T7-promoter comprising three extra guanine (G) nucleotides at the 3′-end), and supporting plasmids encoding the N, P, and L proteins [

 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The rescued virus revealed no major differences with the parental virus in the growth kinetics or in the shape and size of syncytia in Vero cells. Although the use of the optimal T7 promoter enhances the processivity and transcript levels of the T7 RNA polymerase [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], in the context of paramyxovirus RGS, the optimal T7 promoter has mixed effects on CDV rescue because these extra three G nucleotides not only interfere with appropriate recognition of the genomic terminus by the RdRp complex, but also interfere with the “rule of six”, a property shared by all members of the 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family. The T7 RNA polymerase in this RGS was delivered by MVA-T7, a derivative of the modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus, which can drive high-level expression of T7 RNA polymerase in the cytoplasm. However, the use of a vaccine virus has several disadvantages, primarily high poxvirus-mediated cytotoxicity, challenges associated with separating vaccinia virus from the rescued viruses, and increasing restrictions on the use of vaccinia virus, especially for vaccine development. To avoid these possible problems, cells lines stably expressing T7 RNA polymerase has been developed as alternatives to the use of helper T7-vaccinia virus. The most commonly used of which are BSR-T7 cells, a baby hamster kidney (BHK)-derived cell line stably expressing T7 RNA polymerase [

 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. As T7 cell lines have significantly lower T7 expression than that of vaccinia virus-mediated systems [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and as T7 expression has been shown to be a major determinant of virus rescue efficiency, this resulted in the low virus recovery efficiency of these RGSs. To overcome the low rescue efficiency that results from the use of an optimal T7 promoter and the low T7 expression levels in BSR-T7 cells, Beaty et al. developed a single-step transfection protocol [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. By incorporating a self-cleaving hammerhead ribozyme (Hh-Rbz) sequence immediately before the 5′-end of the recombinant viral antigenome combined with the use of a codon-optimized T7 polymerase, the authors significantly improved T7 expression, thereby enabling a substantial increase in paramyxovirus rescue efficiency for representative viruses belonging to all five major 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> genera [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Instead of a T7-promoter-based RGS, alternatively, RNA polymerase II (Poll II)-controlled expression of antigenome and supporting expression plasmids were also used to improve the rescue efficacies of MeV and CDV from their cDNAs [

 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]; the lower precision of the start and stop of Poll II transcription may allow completion of the virus from genomes not in line with the “rule of six” [
