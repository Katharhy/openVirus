<p>Recently, several generated RGSs have been reported for the rescue of CDV wild-type strains from marmoset lymphoblastoid cells (B95a) or Vero cells expressing the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) receptor (Vero-SLAM) that allows for propagation of wild-type CDVs and maintenance of their virulence in vivo (

Results have confirmed that CDV could be used as a vector for the expression of an enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) in the form of an extra transcription unit without loss of its virulence, although the expression level of the foreign protein, as well as the replication efficiency and the virulence of the recombinant viruses depend on the site of the insertion of the EGFP gene [

 <xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00339" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Thus, RGS approaches for CDV have greatly increased the understanding of the pathogenesis of wild-type strains and the attenuating mechanisms of vaccines, as well as subsequently facilitated the generation of recombinant CDV-based vaccines.
