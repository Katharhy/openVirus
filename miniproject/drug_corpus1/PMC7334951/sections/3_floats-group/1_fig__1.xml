  <p>COVID-19 and IFN-I treatment.</p>
  <p>In the majority of patients (left panels) early phase infection results in a physiological IFN-I activation that favors the development of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies and virus-specific T cells in addition to the paracrine direct antiviral effect. This immune activation leads to a resolution of the infection without any need of treatment. Instead, approximately 15â€“20 % of infected patients (middle panels), because of reduced early IFN-I activation show a dysfunctional immune response with higher viral spread. This situation is then followed by an excessive granulocyte and macrophage infiltration, secreting high amounts of inflammatory cytokines that lead to severe forms of COVID-19. This group of patients would strongly benefit of an IFN-I treatment at the early phase of infection (right panels) as it would re-establish a functional immune response that would then lead to resolution of the infection. At bottom, diagrams summarizing the variation over time of infection levels and immune response for each scenario. This figure was created using
