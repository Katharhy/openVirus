 <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the disappointing results obtained with IFN-I were ascribed to the late timing of administration of the cytokine [
 <xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], thus suggesting the need for an early therapeutic intervention to fully exploit the properties of these cytokines. Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, IFN-α and -β administration at early time points was included in several clinical studies reported by WHO [
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], with the common intent to achieve a general antiviral effect. In fact, IFN-I was often administered together with other compounds (Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Remdesivir, Chloroquine), even though no evidence-based or mechanism-driven rationale clearly supported these combinations. We believe that the early administration of IFN-β, by counteracting SARS-CoV-2 immune evasion mechanisms and linking innate and adaptive immune response, will result not only in an effective limitation of virus replication, but will also prompt the elicitation of humoral and cellular immune response. The beneficial effect of early IFN-β supplementation might be potentially higher in patients likely experiencing an age-related impairment of IFN-I response (
