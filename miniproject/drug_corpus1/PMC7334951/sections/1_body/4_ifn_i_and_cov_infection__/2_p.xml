<p id="par0080">The past experience on IFN-I in cancer and chronic viral infection was mainly based on repeated intravenous (i.v.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of high doses (10–20 millions) of IFN-α, often resulting in relevant side effects and refractoriness phenomena that hampered clinical success [

The peculiar scenario offered by SARS-CoV-2, characterized by the possible rapid progression towards severe COVID-19 pneumonia, represents a new challenge, and requires a rethinking of the timing and modality of administration of these cytokines. The therapeutic interventions for SARS-CoV-2 need to be tailored to virus pathogenesis and subsequent disease: in early phases, they should counteract virus replication and spreading to favor the development of an effective antiviral immune response; at later time points, treatments should, in principle, reduce the deleterious effects of virus-induced cytokine storm on lung tissues [
