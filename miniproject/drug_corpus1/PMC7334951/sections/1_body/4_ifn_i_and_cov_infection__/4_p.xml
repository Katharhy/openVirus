<p id="par0090">Besides being less effective if given when viral replication is reaching its peak, attention should be paid to the possible adverse effects of IFN-I administration when SARS-CoV-2 cytokine release syndrome is already ongoing. It is clear that cytokine accumulation observed in the plasma of severe COVID-19 patients is not the result of systemic immune activation, but it is rather caused by virus-mediated stimulation of alveolar macrophages and lung epithelial cells [

For this reason, we believe that the most appropriate therapeutic window for a safe and effective use of IFN-α or β administration is limited to the first 10 days since the SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. In light of the evidence available so far, the use of IFN-I for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients should be discouraged.
