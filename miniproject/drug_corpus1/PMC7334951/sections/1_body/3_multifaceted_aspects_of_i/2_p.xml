<p id="par0070">The IFN response represents the major ﬁrst line of defense against viruses. Under steady state conditions, IFN-I are produced at low levels. However, upon RNA viral recognition through the endosomal (i.e. Toll-like receptors) or cytosolic (RIG-I-like receptors) pattern recognition receptors, the activation of downstream signaling pathways leads to the induction of IFN-I as well as IFN-λ, which, in turn, stimulates the transcription of a variety of ISG, ultimately leading to a broad-spectrum antimicrobial response [
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The antiviral activity of IFN-I is, however, intimately linked to its impressive capacity to regulate activation and function of various immune cell populations. Among these activities, the activation of antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DC) and natural killer (NK) cells, and the localization, expansion or differentiation of virus-specific T lymphocytes and of antibody-producing B lymphocytes represent key aspects of the antiviral defence. In the early phases of infection, IFN-I contribute to limit viral spread by activating NK cells [
 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and enhancing their cytotoxic activity against infected cells [
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Concurrently, IFN-I variously inhibit or promote the differentiation of precursors into DC (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). DC exposed to IFN-I show a peculiar ability to cross-present viral antigens to naïve CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells [
 <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], promote Th1 cell differentiation, T cell memory turnover [
 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and favor the recruitment of NK, T and B cells at the site of infection [
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Notably, the interplay IFN-I/DC is crucial for the generation of protective antibodies against reference and viral antigens [
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>]. In fact, the stimulation of IFN signaling by exogenous IFN-I or by IFN inducers, such as poly(I:C), strongly enhance the primary antibody response (especially IgG2a) to reference antigens [
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] or to a standard influenza vaccine [
 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] in mice. Interestingly, even in the absence of a direct antiviral effect, the continuous production of IFN-α by a recombinant γ-herpesvirus elicits a significant antiviral immune response attenuating the severity of the infection and protecting against subsequent viral challenge [
 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This evidence supports the concept that IFN-I, rapidly produced in response to viral infection, stimulate the generation of a protective humoral immunity. Based on these premises, IFN-I were used in pilot studies as a vaccine adjuvant in infective diseases [
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. IFN-α local injection in close proximity of the HBV vaccine showed evidence of clinical efficacy in the absence of any toxicity [
