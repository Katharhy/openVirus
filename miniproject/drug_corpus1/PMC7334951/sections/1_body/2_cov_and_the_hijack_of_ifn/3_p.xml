<p id="par0065">Other studies suggest that rather than a complete absence, the IFN response may be delayed. Compelling evidence indicated that human bronchial epithelial cells are capable of promoting active, but delayed IFN-related antiviral responses to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection [

 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These results are in line with data on mouse model of SARS-CoV infection, where a robust viral replication associated with delayed IFN-I signaling was reported to orchestrate the inflammatory responses, leading to accumulation of pathogenic monocytes-macrophages promoting lung immunopathology, vascular leakage and suboptimal T cell response with decreased survival [

Notably, while early exogenous administration of IFN-β completely protected mice from lethal MERS-CoV infection by inhibiting virus replication and inflammatory cytokine production, delayed IFN-β therapy caused instead a striking increase in IFN-I, ISG, and inflammatory cytokine levels, resulting in fatal disease [

In conclusion, in comparison to other respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 infection drives a lower antiviral transcriptional response that is marked by low IFN-I and IFN-III levels and elevated chemokine expression, which could explain the proinflammatory disease state associated with COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Overall, these observations outline the critical role of IFN-I in both protective and pathogenic events during CoV infections, thus strengthening the need of fine tuning the IFN-I signaling with respect to the kinetics of CoV replication for an optimal protective response.
