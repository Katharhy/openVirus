<p id="par0050">Differently from the 2002 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has a lower virulence with a large number of asymptomatic infections and mild upper respiratory tract illness [
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This is a determinant factor for its increased transmissibility, considering that asymptomatic or presymptomatic carriers might contribute to viral transmission, especially in high-risk populations [
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Even though upper respiratory infections are often spontaneously resolved, some of these eventually progress in more severe viral pneumonia. Severe COVID-19 patients are characterized by a strong immune activation (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]) resulting in lung infiltration by proinflammatory macrophages and granulocytes [
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure and subsequent fatality (

 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Ageing is indeed characterized by the gradual development of a chronic subclinical systemic inï¬‚ammation and by acquired immune impairment, particularly in the male population [
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In particular, recent studies have shown that ageing affects B lymphocyte-driven acquired immunity [
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], attenuates the upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules for T cell priming and reduces IFN-I production by alveolar phagocytes in response to viral infection [
