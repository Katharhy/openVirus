<p id="par0045">The antiviral activity of IFN-I has been extensively exploited for the treatment of viral chronic infections [
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Nevertheless, as highlighted by the long clinical records of IFN-I use, the complex nature of the IFN-I system and the dysregulated IFN-I response in SARS-CoV-2 infection point to the need of a fine-tuning of route, timing and dose of administration to balance clinical efficacy and side effects. In this Perspective article, we briefly review the role of IFN-I signaling in COVID-19 pathogenesis and discuss some critical issues that need to be taken into account for optimally exploiting IFN-I in todayâ€™s fight against COVID-19 pandemic.
