<p id="par0105">In some cases, and in most of the Chinese studies, IFN-α and IFN-β administration by either inhalation or intranasal instillation is proposed, assuming that a mucosal delivery of IFN-I, besides being targeted at the infection site, could be more compliant and less toxic than the parental administration, especially for prophylaxis in subjects at high risk of infection or in early phases of household management of infected patients. However, the mechanisms of action of intranasal IFN-I are still poorly identified. Further studies are needed to characterize the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of mucosal IFN-I preparation, thus defining the risks of central nervous system toxicity [especially when IFN-β is used [

By contrast, much more is known on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of IFN-α and IFN-β administered by both s.c. and i.v routes, their mechanisms of action and toxicity limitations. A continuous systemic treatment, somehow inspired by the conventional use of these cytokines in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection and cancer, has been suggested in some of the emerging COVID-19 clinical studies. However, taking into account some critical aspects related to toxicity and refractoriness recently underlined [
