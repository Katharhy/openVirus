<p id="par0115">While some of the above-mentioned issues will be clarified once the results of more preclinical and early phase clinical studies are available, we believe that the knowledge of IFN-I biology and the past experience of the clinical use of these cytokines should be carefully considered in the design of new clinical studies against COVID-19. In the light of the current information on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, we speculate that IFN-I system integrity may be, at least in part, responsible for the spontaneous resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the majority of infected patients (estimated around 80 %). We assume that in the remaining 20 % of people a defective IFN-I system may favor SARS-CoV-2 spread, eventually causing the development of severe forms of COVID-19 and dismal prognosis. We believe that this fraction of the population, in which age, sex, comorbidities and genetic predisposition, may represent determinants of IFN impairment and important cofactors in disease outcome [
