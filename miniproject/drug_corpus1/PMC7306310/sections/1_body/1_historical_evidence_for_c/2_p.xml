<p>Several decades later, in the context of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus infection, convalescent plasma treatment was able to significantly reduce respiratory tract viral load, serum cytokine response (interleukin-6, interleukin-19, tumor necrosis factor-alpha), and mortality in a comparative study recruiting 99 patients. In that study, the decrease in mortality was rather impressive, as the odds of death decreased by 80%.

 </sup> A subsequent systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized 32 studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus infection and severe influenza and highlighted the consistent evidence for a reduction in mortality, especially in case of early administration of convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin after symptom onset. The meta-analysis confirmed the sizable reduction in the odds of mortality, pointing to a decrease by 75% in the odds of death.
