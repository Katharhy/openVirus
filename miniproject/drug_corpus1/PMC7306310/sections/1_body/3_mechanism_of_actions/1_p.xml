<p>Convalescent plasma may offer various beneficial actions in COVID-19 disease (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). First and foremost, the apparent mechanism pertains to the fact that antibodies from convalescent plasma can suppress viremia.

 </sup> Similar to the strategies implemented in the SARS epidemic, theoretically the administration of convalescent plasma at the early stage of the disease would be more effective.

 </sup> Viremia peak is noted in the first week of infection in the majority of viral illnesses and a primary immune response of the host is usually developed by days 10 to 14 of infection

 </sup> Moreover, the presence of non-neutralizing antibodies binding to the pathogens may also be helpful.

 </sup> In any case, the administered antibody modifies inflammatory response and this can be optimally achieved during the early response, even at the asymptomatic stage.

 </sup> It has also been suggested that apart from the direct anti-viral properties, plasma components can provide other beneficial actions, such as restoring coagulation factors.
