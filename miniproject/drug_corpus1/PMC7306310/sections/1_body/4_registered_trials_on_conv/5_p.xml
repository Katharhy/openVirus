<p>The examination of studies registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>   ) revealed a different pattern. In the registry, 10 studies on convalescent plasma were identified; among them, the majority (6 trials) were randomized comparative (vs conventional treatment with/without ordinary plasma), three were non-randomized comparative, and only was a single-arm trial. If all studies are complete, a total of 680 patients will have been evaluated. All studies are focusing primarily on severe or critical cases; among the exclusion criteria, pregnancy, lactation, immunoglobulin allergy/allergy to plasma, immunoglobulin A deficiency, and other contraindications for plasma transfusion (such as heart failure) have been often stated. Interestingly, some studies (ChiCTR2000029757, ChiCTR2000030010, ChiCTR2000030702, ChiCTR2000030929) provide shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation as an exclusion criterion. No details have been provided regarding the selection of donors. Regarding immunoglobulin therapy for COVID-19, the identified study in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR20000308410) seemed to correspond to the previously presented study in clinicaltrials.gov by the same principal investigator (NCT04264858).
