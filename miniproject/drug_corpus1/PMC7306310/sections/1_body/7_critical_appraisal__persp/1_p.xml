 </sup> These individuals may offer a valuable pool of a life-saving treatment for future patients during the pandemic. Asymptomatic, antibody positive carriers may also prove helpful as donors of the disease. For instance, there is anecdotal evidence that in Northern Italy among 60 volunteer blood donors in the town of Castiglione dâ€™ Adda, Lombardy, 67% were antibody positive although asymptomatic; nevertheless, their specific antibody titers were not declared in detail.

 </sup> If proven in larger cohorts, these results may be promising in terms of identifying a large number of eligible convalescent plasma donors. Thorough research into the evaluation of humoral response and neutralizing antibodies
