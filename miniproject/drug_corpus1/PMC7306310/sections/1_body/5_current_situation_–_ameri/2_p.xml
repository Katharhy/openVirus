<p>According to the FDA, eligible donors could be recovered COVID-19 patients who had been proven positive either by a diagnostic test such as nasopharyngeal swab at the time of illness, or antibody-positive patients on whom a diagnostic test had not been performed during their illness. The level of neutralizing antibody titers should be greater than 1:160, whereas a titer of 1:80 could be deemed acceptable if alternative matching units are not available. Symptoms should have resolved completely at least 28 days prior to donation; alternatively, a symptom-free interval of at least 14 days prior to donation and negative results in one or more nasopharyngeal swabs or in blood-based molecular diagnostic tests are necessitated. Male donors are eligible; special attention is paid to female donors who should be negative for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies in case of previous pregnancy. General donor eligibility requirements along with the additional criteria for plasmapheresis should be also met, including infection status control. The FDA has also provided guidance on blood establishment standards, labeling, and recordkeeping.
