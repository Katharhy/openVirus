<p>The study by Ye et al

 </sup> in Wuhan (China) encompassed 6 patients and examined the transfusion of convalescent plasma in a spectrum of clinical scenarios, including persistent SARS-CoV-2 detection, consolidation or extensive lesions in chest CT, comorbidity with Sj√∂gren syndrome and post-discharge positivity to SARS-CoV-2; improvement and promising results were noted in all cases. Similarly, Zhang et al

 </sup> reported improvement in a patient from Nanjing (China) receiving convalescent plasma. Ahn et al
 <sup>

 </sup> provided the first report on 2 cases from Korea, where the administration of convalescent plasma was linked to beneficial effects, namely successful weaning from mechanical ventilator in one patient and hospital discharge in the other patient. On the other hand, the study by Zeng et al,

 </sup> from Zhengzhou (China), published in late April, 2020, highlighted the limitations of the new treatment; administration of convalescent plasma in critical, end-stage respiratory failure, at a late stage during the course of the disease (median: 21.5 days after first detection) was associated with suppression of viral shedding but ultimately death in 5 out of 6 examined cases.
