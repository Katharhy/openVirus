 </sup> encompassing 10 COVID-19 patients in China, administering convalescent plasma with neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640. Among them, those who received the transfusion relatively early during the disease (days 10 and 11 from initiation of symptoms) showed a rapid increase in lymphocyte counts, decrease in serum CRP levels, and a notable remission of lung lesions in CT. The neutralizing antibody titers of 5 patients increased rapidly up to 1:640, whereas 4 patients remained at the same high level (1:640) after transfusion. Overall, the results were excellent, as no deaths were noted, 3 patients were discharged, and the remaining 7 were ready for discharge; this is in contrast to a historical control group presented by the study authors, where a death rate of 30% was noted. No serious adverse effects were documented following transfusion of convalescent plasma; only a minor effect was reported by a patient, namely an evanescent facial red spot.
