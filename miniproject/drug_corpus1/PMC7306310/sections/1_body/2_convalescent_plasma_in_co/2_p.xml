 </sup> adopted a richer regimen of convalescent plasma transfusions in their series of four COVID-19 patients in Guangdong (China), with total volumes administered ranging between 200 and 2400â€ŠmL. All patients in severe condition received convalescent plasma after day 12 of hospitalization. Very positive outcomes were reported, as three of 4 patients were discharged from the hospital, whereas the remaining one was finally PCR negative for the virus and was transferred to an unfenced intensive care unit. Two cases produced anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG approximately 14 days after transfusion.
