<p id="Par40">PrEP-selected resistance is more likely in the presence of adequate drug pressure, since PrEP acted as an inadequate ART regimen, i.e. dual therapy, however, intermittent PrEP use can result in low and fluctuating drug levels, an environment in which selective pressure for resistance is periodic, and thus resistant mutations could be present at only low frequencies [
