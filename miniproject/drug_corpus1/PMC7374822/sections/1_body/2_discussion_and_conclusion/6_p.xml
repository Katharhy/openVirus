<p id="Par39">The findings of the HIV deep sequencing (i.e. dominant wild type virus at month one) suggest that resistance developed as a result of PrEP use, as one would expect that M184V would be a major population from the outset if it was a transmitted virus. The low genetic barrier brought about by using a combination of only two drugs (TDF/FTC) resulted in the emergence of other key mutations selected by TDF, e.g. K65R which we see in the later time points.</p>
