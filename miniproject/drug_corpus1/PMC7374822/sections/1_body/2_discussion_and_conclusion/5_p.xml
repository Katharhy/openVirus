<p id="Par38">PrEP-selected resistance (M184V mutation) is strongly selected by FTC and 3TC and emerges rapidly in patients receiving either of these drugs. Also, the M184V mutation occurs more frequently with dual ART use rather than triple therapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The M184V mutation virus strain adversely affects viral replicative capacity and is less fit compared to the wild type strain, hence it is less likely to be transmitted during infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Also, the undetectable HIV viral load at both 6- and 12-months post-ART initiation in the partner further supports that the noted drug mutations in the participant were PrEP-induced rather than transmitted from her partner.
