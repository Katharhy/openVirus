<p id="Par44">During scale up of oral PrEP in South Africa, it is crucial to consider the importance of accurate identification of HIV infection prior to oral PrEP initiation and rapid discontinuation of PrEP in those suspected to be HIV infected to reduce the risk of HIV drug resistance. This case provides evidence that support a recommendation for the use of fourth-generation HIV rapid tests for routine HIV screening in the setting of PrEP use and highlights the importance of prompt ARV resistance testing once HIV infection is identified, initiation on the appropriate ART regimen and subsequent follow-up of both participant and partner/s for early detection of ART regimen failure. This case also demonstrates that despite the prolonged exposure to dual therapy, if the above prompt actions are taken, HIV virological suppression is achievable with a first line ART regimen.</p>
