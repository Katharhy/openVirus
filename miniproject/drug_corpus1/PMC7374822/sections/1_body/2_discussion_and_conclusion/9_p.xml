<p id="Par42">Some studies have demonstrated blunted acute viraemia in PrEP breakthrough infections and likely reflects the strong ARV activity by the PrEP regimen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Subsequently, the attenuated HIV viral load associated with ARV use alters antibody production by decreasing titres or preventing antibody responses to certain viral antigens, possibly as a result of the paucity of adequate antigenic exposure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Similarly, in a study of rhesus macaques, PrEP was associated with delayed antibody maturation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This delayed antibody avidity raises the concern that PrEP may affect the performance of assays used to detect HIV infection in the setting of PrEP use.
