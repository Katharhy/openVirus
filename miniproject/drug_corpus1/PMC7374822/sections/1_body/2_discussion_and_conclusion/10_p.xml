<p id="Par43">The findings of this case report support the above conclusions that prolonged use of oral PrEP during undetected HIV infection may reduce clinical symptoms of HIV infection and be associated with delayed antibody avidity, as well as sustained partial viral suppression, which would in turn make it difficult to diagnose HIV infection, particularly if less specific assays are used for HIV screening, such as third-generation HIV rapid tests. A potential increase in acquisition of PrEP-related resistance would jeopardize choice of ART for both the PrEP user and their partner/s. However, the risk of potential PrEP-related resistance needs to be weighed against the number of HIV infections averted. The few documented cases of true PrEP-selected resistance could suggest that resistance is likely to be rare as PrEP is scaled up [
