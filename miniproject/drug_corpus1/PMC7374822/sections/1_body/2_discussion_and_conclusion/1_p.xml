<p id="Par34">This case reports an oral PrEP breakthrough infection despite confirmed high adherence to PrEP in a 20-year-old woman who was found to be HIV infected 9 months after PrEP initiation. A key first step is ensuring that PrEP is being initiated in an HIV uninfected person to minimise a recently infected person being initiated on dual therapy. Equally important is counselling on safer sex practices in the first month of PrEP initiation.</p>
