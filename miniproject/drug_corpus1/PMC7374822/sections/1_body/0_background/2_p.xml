<p id="Par26">CAPRISA 084, a PrEP Demonstration Project, assessed the feasibility, acceptability, uptake and patterns of daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) / emtricitabine (FTC) use as part of sexual reproductive health services to young women and men at risk of acquiring HIV in urban and rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The project was conducted between August 2016 and September 2018. The protocol, informed consent forms and study related materials were reviewed and approved by the University of KwaZulu-Natalâ€™s Biomedical Research Ethics Committee (Ref: BFC511/16). All participants provided written informed consent. Follow-up of enrolled participants occurred monthly for 3 months post-PrEP initiation and quarterly thereafter. Clinical evaluation, adherence counselling and rapid HIV testing using two third-generation HIV antibody tests (Uni-Gold Recombigen HIV-1/2 and Alere Determine HIV-1/2 (Alere)), were conducted at screening, enrolment and at each follow-up visit. Dry blood spots (DBS) were collected and stored from month one onwards. Screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) occurred quarterly.</p>
