<p id="Par30">HIV drug resistance testing was done at the highest HIV viral load time-point (month nine sample) using the SATuRN/Life Technologies genotyping system, using four sequencing primers to generate the 1197 bp 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequence covering all 99 HIV-1 protease codons and the first 300 codons of the reverse transcriptase gene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Amplification and deep sequencing of the 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene (reverse transcriptase region = HXB2 2735–3244) using the Illumina MiSeq platform using primer ID approach for quantification [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] was carried out on all available DBS samples, including those with low HIV viral loads, from month one onwards (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Deep sequencing was undertaken to ascertain whether the drug mutations found in the participant were transmitted from her partner or caused by drug pressure from oral PrEP.
