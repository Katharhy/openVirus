<p id="Par31">HIV drug resistance testing on the participantâ€™s month nine sample revealed the presence of both the M184V and the K65R mutations. The M184V mutation is linked to FTC and 3TC high level resistance, whilst increasing susceptibility to thymidine analogue NRTIs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This mutation also decreases HIV-1 replication capacity. K65R mutation is the signature TFV resistance mutation and confers intermediate/high-level resistance to TDF, didanosine (ddI), abacavir (ABC) and stavudine (D4T) and low/intermediate resistance to 3TC and FTC. This mutation also results in increased susceptibility to AZT [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. HIV drug resistance testing showed none of the following: protease inhibitor major, protease inhibitor minor, non-NRTI, integrase inhibitor major and integrase inhibitor minor resistance mutations.
