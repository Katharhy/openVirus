<p id="Par29">Tenofovir-diphosphate (TDF-DP) levels were retrospectively measured from DBS samples, from every visit, using a modified liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This validated assay (Division of Clinical Pharmacology, University of Cape Town), was conducted in batches by a trained technologist. Given that drug level measurements were not conducted in real-time they were not used for clinical management. Her TDF-DP levels ranged between 1100 and 1200 fmol/punch, corresponding to daily dosing (6â€“7 tablets per week) of oral PrEP (Fig.
