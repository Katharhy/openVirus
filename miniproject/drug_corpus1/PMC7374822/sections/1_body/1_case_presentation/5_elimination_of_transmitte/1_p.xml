<p id="Par33">HIV viral load testing was carried out on the participantâ€™s partner at the time of diagnosis of HIV infection in the participant. The sample was retained for HIV drug resistance testing, to elicit any ARV drug mutations present in the partner, if required. However, HIV drug resistance testing for the partner was not performed as he had an undetectable HIV viral load on first line ART (TDF/FTC/EFV) at the time of diagnosis of HIV infection in the participant. In addition, the partner had an undetectable viral load at both 6- and 12-months post-ART initiation.</p>
