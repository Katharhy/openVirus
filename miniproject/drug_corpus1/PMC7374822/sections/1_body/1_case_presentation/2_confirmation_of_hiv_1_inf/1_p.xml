<p id="Par28">HIV seroconversion was confirmed by HIV-1 GEENIUS assay and HIV-1 viral load testing (Roche Ampliprep-Taqman assay) at the month nine visit. Retrospective HIV viral load testing was done on all available stored samples which showed an increasing HIV viral load trend from month one onwards (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In addition, retrospective HIV testing using fourth-generation test kits (Alere HIV Combo), which detects antigen and antibody, was conducted on available stored samples which revealed HIV detection from month one onwards. In addition, all participants remaining in the CAPRISA 084 study were tested with the fourth-generation HIV rapid test, in addition to the third-generation HIV antibody tests, to exclude any additional masked HIV infections.
