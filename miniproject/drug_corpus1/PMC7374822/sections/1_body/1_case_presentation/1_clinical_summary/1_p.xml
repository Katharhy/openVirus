<p id="Par27">We report clinical data from a 20-year-old woman, in a HIV sero-discordant relationship, who was initiated on daily oral PrEP in October 2017 through CAPRISA 084 at an urban site in South Africa. The participant attended the study clinic regularly and clinical presentation at study visits was unremarkable, with no report of seroconversion illness. Self-reported PrEP adherence, including pill count, was high. She was diagnosed with HIV infection, using two third-generation HIV rapid antibody tests, 9 months after initiating daily oral PrEP (July 2018), with a HIV viral load of 31,730 copies/ml. Prolonged inadvertent dual therapy during an undetected HIV infection resulted in nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutations to both TDF and FTC. The participant was referred to a specialist infectious diseases clinic for further management of her HIV infection. She was initiated on a first line, TFV-sparing regimen (zidovudine (AZT) / lamivudine (3TC) / efavirenz (EFV)) in October 2018. Her month five HIV viral load (March 2019) was 380 copies/ml. At the time of this report (January 2020), the participant had been on ART for 13 months and had no signs of either clinical, immunologic or virologic failure on her treatment regimen. The postulate for HIV acquisition is: (i) recent occurrence of HIV infection prior to oral PrEP initiation, (ii) HIV exposure early in her PrEP use before adequate oral PrEP drug levels were achieved, and (iii) acquisition of a resistant viral strain from her sexual partner.</p>
