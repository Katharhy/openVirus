<p id="para0030">Prior to this study, few mathematical models have been specifically tailored to the AYA population. LA-ART has only recently been developed and the projected impact has not been widely studied using mathematical modeling. A major strength of our study is that our model allows more precise investigations of questions relevant to AYA, assessing the circumstances under which LA-ART would be considered cost-effective. We note that to date, all clinical trials of LA-ART have been conducted in adult populations. Additional clinical studies are needed to establish efficacy and safety of LA-ART among AYA before LA-ART can be administered to this population.</p>
