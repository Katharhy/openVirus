<p id="para0036">When LA-ART becomes available in the market, it may be formulated for one-month or three-month durations, rather than the two-month duration we modeled. AYA have shown more interest in a three-month option compared to two-month

 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. This would increase the proportion of currently non-adherent AYA that switch to LA-ART and allow a higher maximum incremental cost. In addition to injectables, other long-acting formulations such as implants or microarray patch are possible that may have different durations and acceptability to patients [

 <xref rid="bib0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. A once-weekly formulation of oral ART may be a cost-effective alternative to injectable ART, but there is a lack of clinical data on adherence and programmatic costs. Future studies should consider these additional ART formulations in development once more research is available on adherence and effectiveness.
