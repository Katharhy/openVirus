<p id="para0029">This study uses a novel mathematical model to investigate one of the emerging questions about the new long-acting antiretroviral formulation. Our model-based analysis shows that providing LA-ART to AYA has the potential to be cost-effective for reducing HIV burden in Kenya if it is less than double the cost of oral ART. Assuming 85% of AYA on ART switch to LA-ART and 94% maintain viral suppression, the annual cost of LA-ART and administration could be approximately 25% higher than the cost for oral ART and still be considered cost-effective under a $500/DALY threshold. If the threshold for cost-effectiveness is Kenya's per capita GDP, LA-ART could be considered cost-effective at a cost of up to double the cost for oral ART.</p>
