<p id="para0033">Results were most sensitive to assumptions about whether AYA who are not currently adherent to oral ART will be able to complete the oral induction period successfully to switch to LA-ART. For LA-ART to have maximum impact, administration should be prioritized for populations who struggle with adherence to oral ART mainly due to the requirement for daily pills. These populations may have difficulty completing the induction period on oral ART. Adequate drug supply, kind providers, transportation vouchers, and counseling during the induction period could improve the likelihood that AYA are able to successfully transition to LA-ART 
 <xref rid="bib0037" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. After the induction period, adherence counseling should be adapted to address barriers to LA-ART adherence. Spacing LA-ART injections with school break schedules could also improve adherence in the AYA population. Our results were sensitive to the assumed rate of viral suppression for AYA on LA-ART; as the rate approaches current oral ART suppression rates, the benefit of LA-ART declines. Although the cost threshold for LA-ART was not impacted by the proportion of AYA on ART who switched from oral to LA regimens, the clinical impact of LA-ART would be reduced if fewer AYA switched to LA-ART. If LA-ART is scaled up in Kenya, future surveys should monitor the number of AYA who are willing to switch treatment regimens.
