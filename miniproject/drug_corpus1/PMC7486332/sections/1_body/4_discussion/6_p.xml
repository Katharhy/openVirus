<p id="para0034">A previous study examined the maximum drug cost of LA-ART considered cost-effective for adult HIV patients in the United States 
 <xref rid="bib0038" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Using a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and assuming 91% LA-ART viral suppression, LA-ART would be considered cost-effective if it were roughly double the current oral ART regimen cost for those with multiple ART failures. In order for LA-ART to be considered cost-effective as a first- or second-line regimen, the cost would need to be similar to current oral ART costs. However, this model did not take into account the effect of LA-ART on averting HIV transmission, so the QALYs gained and the maximum cost were likely an underestimate. Our model captures the dynamics of HIV transmission, and therefore captures additional health benefits from preventing HIV infections.
