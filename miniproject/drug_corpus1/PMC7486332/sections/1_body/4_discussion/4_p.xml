An increase from 75% viral suppression under oral ART to 94% viral suppression under LA-ART assumes that the requirement for daily adherence to pills is a main driver of nonadherence for AYA in SSA. If factors, including not being informed of one's HIV status, difficulty attending clinic visits due to stigma, inability to leave school or work, cost of travel, or poor engagement in care play a substantial role in nonadherence, then our analysis may overestimate the maximum cost at which LA-ART would be cost-effective.
