<p id="para0026">Our base scenario assumed 85% of AYA on oral ART switch to LA-ART, with a 94% viral suppression rate, resulting in an overall (oral and injectable) AYA viral suppression increase from 75% with only oral ART to 91% including LA-ART. In this scenario, we projected that LA-ART would avert 40,540 HIV infections and 20,480 HIV-related deaths over ten years compared to standard of care (oral ART) (

 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). To have an ICER below Kenya's per capita GDP, the annual per-person cost of LA-ART, including both drug injections six times per year and administration costs, can be at most $236 higher than oral ART administration ($233 per year). Using a cost-effectiveness threshold of $500, the maximum annual cost can be at most $89 higher than oral ART.
