<p id="para0027">In the lower uptake scenario, AYA who are not virally suppressed under oral regimens switch to LA-ART at a lower rate than those who are virally suppressed (30% vs. 85%) due to the requirement to maintain a 20-week oral ART induction period before starting LA-ART. In this scenario, overall AYA viral suppression would increase only slightly from 75% to 78%. To have an ICER below Kenya's per capita GDP in this lower uptake scenario, the annual per-person cost of LA-ART can be at most $56 higher than oral ART administration, or $289. Using a cost-effectiveness threshold of $500, the maximum annual cost can be at most $20 higher than oral ART, or $253.</p>
