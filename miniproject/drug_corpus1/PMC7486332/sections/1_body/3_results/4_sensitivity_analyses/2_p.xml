 <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> shows tornado diagrams of the sensitivity of the maximum incremental LA-ART implementation cost for the $500 (3a) and $1508 (3b) ICERs to changes in the proportion of AYA who switch to LA-ART, oral ART drug cost, growth of oral ART coverage in the population, number of AYA sexual partnerships, proportion of population non-adherent to oral ART, proportion of AYA who are non-adherent to oral ART, and viral suppression rates under LA-ART. Maximum incremental costs were sensitive to LA-ART viral suppression and oral ART non-adherence rates, although results were qualitatively similar to the base scenario. Increasing the time horizon of LA-ART administration to 20 years roughly doubled the maximum incremental LA-ART cost to $185 and $461 under the $500 and $1508 ICER scenarios, respectively (not shown). Maximum LA-ART costs were robust to changes in the population-level increase in ART coverage by 2029, number of AYA sexual partnerships, or the percentage of AYA that switch to LA-ART, as changes in costs were mostly offset by changes in health benefits. Incremental LA-ART costs were also robust to changes in oral ART drug cost and variations in adherence by risk group (not shown).
