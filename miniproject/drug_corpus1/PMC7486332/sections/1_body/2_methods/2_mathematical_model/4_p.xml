<p id="para0017">The proportion of HIV-positive individuals receiving ART (oral or LA-ART) was assumed to increase from an average of 75% in 2017 
 <xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> to an average of 81% by 2029, with no change in suppression rates over time. Individuals adherent to ART have a 96% reduction in transmission risk 
 <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and are assumed to have the same mortality rates as those who are HIV uninfected. Individuals who are non-adherent to ART are assumed to not be virally suppressed. Rates of non-adherence vary by age, sex, and CD4 count, with AYA having lower adherence than adults 
 <xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Of AYA currently on oral ART, on average 75% are estimated to be virally suppressed, compared to roughly 85% of adults aged 25 and older
