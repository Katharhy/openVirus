<p id="para0016">Sexual behavior is assumed to change both as individuals age and over time as the epidemic progresses. The model estimates the force of HIV infection as a function of sexual mixing (by age and sexual activity), proportion of HIV infected individuals, ART use, circumcision, and HIV transmission probability (based on number of sex acts per year and the probability of transmission per sex act). Although the LA-ART intervention is targeted to the AYA population, the full population (ages 0–59) is included in the model to account for the effects of sexual mixing between AYA and other age groups and to capture the population-level benefits of implementing LA-ART. Young adults (ages 15–24) are assumed to have the highest levels of sexual activity and are therefore at high risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV. The model allows HIV risk to be modified by male circumcision, pregnancy, and sexually transmitted disease coinfection. For further details, see the Supplemental Appendix.</p>
