<p id="para0015">We adapted a previously published dynamic compartmental model of HIV transmission and progression to the setting of Kenya 
 <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> as part of a cost-effectiveness evaluation of an intervention to improve AYA retention in care 
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The population includes all Kenyans aged 0â€“59 years and is stratified by sex, five-year age group, sexual activity (low, medium, and high), and circumcision status. HIV natural history is modeled through five stages of viral load and five stages of CD4 count.
