<p id="para0020">We estimated the maximum incremental cost of LA-ART administered to AYA which would be considered cost-effective (i.e., having an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio less than the threshold). We assessed population-level effects of LA-ART over a 10-year time horizon. Health benefits and costs were discounted annually at 3%. Costs were inflated to 2017Â U.S. dollars using the Kenya GDP deflator (ratio of current to constant price GDP) 
 <xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Total incremental LA-ART drug and administration costs were divided by the number of person-years on LA-ART under each scenario to determine the incremental cost of LA-ART per person-year. Oral ART drug costs were assumed to be $72 USD per year 
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> (all costs for this study reported in 2017 USD). Non-drug costs including HIV-related health care for pre- and post-ART patients were taken from a study of comprehensive HIV treatment costs in Kenya 
 <xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The total annual per-person cost of ART administration, drug cost plus clinical services, was estimated to be $233.
