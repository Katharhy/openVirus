<p id="para0021">For both scenarios, we calculated the maximum incremental cost of LA-ART compared to oral ART that would be considered cost-effective. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted associated with LA-ART as the additional cost divided by the additional health benefit of LA-ART compared to oral ART only. We utilized two thresholds or cost-effectiveness: 1) $500 per DALY averted as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for high priority HIV interventions
