<p id="para0019">The health and economic impact of switching from oral ART to LA-ART was evaluated under two scenarios (
 <xref rid="tbl0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) with different proportions of AYA on ART who switch to LA-ART. Both scenarios assume 94% of LA-ART users are virally suppressed based on the LATTE-2 Phase II trial results 
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Based on a U.S. survey 
 <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, the “base” scenario assumes 85% of AYA on oral ART would switch to LA-ART with a two-month duration of viral suppression per injection. The second “lower uptake” scenario considers a 20-week oral ART induction period similar to those required in two of the current clinical trials of long-acting CAB/RPV [
 <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. If AYA who are currently non-adherent to their oral regimens are less likely to be virally suppressed at the end of the induction period, they will not be able to switch to LA-ART at the same rate. This “lower uptake” scenario assumes 85% of currently adherent AYA switch to LA-ART, but only 30% of non-adherent AYA successfully complete the induction period and switch, resulting in a total switch proportion of 71%.
