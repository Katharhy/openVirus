<p id="para0022">We conducted one-way sensitivity analyses on the base scenario to determine the impact of key parameters on the maximum incremental cost. We varied the growth in the proportion of the HIV-positive population receiving ART by 2029 from 0% (75% coverage) to 15% (90% coverage); base case assumes 81% coverage. We adjusted the percentage of AYA who are non-adherent to oral ART by 0•8 to 1•2 times the base case non-adherence rates, which vary by age, and we tested the effects of lowering or raising the number of sexual partnerships in the AYA population. While keeping overall adherence levels the same, we varied oral and long-acting ART adherence by sexual risk group, with lowest adherence in the high-risk group. We extended the model time horizon from ten to 20 years. Two assumptions directly related to LA-ART coverage were also tested; we varied the rate of viral suppression under LA-ART from 85% to 100% and varied the percentage of AYA who switch to LA-ART from 40% to 100%.</p>
