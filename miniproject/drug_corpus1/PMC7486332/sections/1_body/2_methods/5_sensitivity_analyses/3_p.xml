<p id="para0023">Finally, as dolutegravir (DTG) usage expands, it may have an impact on ART adherence and average oral ART drug cost. Since DTG has better drug tolerance and a lower resistance profile 
 <xref rid="bib0034" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect on cost thresholds if current oral ART non-adherence rates decrease across the population with scale-up of more tolerable drug. In addition to evaluating a 20% decrease in oral ART dropout starting in 2019, we evaluated the equivalent increase. If scale-up of DTG does not meet expectations, costs may be higher, and if two-drug formulations are approved for use, costs may be lower. We therefore varied annual oral ART drug costs from $60 to $90.
