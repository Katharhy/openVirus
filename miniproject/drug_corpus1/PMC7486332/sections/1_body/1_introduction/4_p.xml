 <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. A long-acting intramuscular injectable form of cabotegravir (CAB) in combination with long-acting rilpivirine (RPV) was effective as HIV treatment at both 4-week and 8-week durations in Phase 2 of the LATTE-2 trial (94% rate of viral suppression at 96 weeks)

 <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and ATLAS 
 <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> trials found that 93–94% of treatment-naïve adults were virally suppressed after 48 weeks of monthly CAB/RPV injections.
