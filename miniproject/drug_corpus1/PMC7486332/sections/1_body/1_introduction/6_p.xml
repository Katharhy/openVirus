<p id="para0014">Policymakers need to weigh the projected cost and benefits of LA-ART in order to make programmatic decisions. LA-ART will likely cost more than oral ART due in part to logistical challenges such as maintaining the transportation and storage cold chain, additional provider training and laboratory monitoring, and ensuring a steady supply 
 <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The threshold at which LA-ART would be considered cost-effective has not been evaluated in SSA. To inform these decisions, we used a mathematical model to simulate HIV acquisition, transmission, and viral suppression among AYA in Kenya to assess the cost threshold at which switching from oral to LA-ART would be considered cost-effective. Our model, among the first adapted to an AYA population in SSA, addresses an urgent need to evaluate new interventions to increase ART adherence in this population.
