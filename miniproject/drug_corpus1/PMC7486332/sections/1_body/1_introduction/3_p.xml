<p id="para0011">AYA face a number of biological and social barriers to adherence to oral ART, including cognitive development (poor impulse control and lack of future planning) 
 <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and susceptibility to HIV-related stigma 
 <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Adolescents may skip clinic visits to avoid missing school and possibly disclosing their HIV status to teachers and peers 
 <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Further barriers to adherence include poor engagement in care, inadequate support transitioning from pediatric to adult care, and not being informed of their HIV status by caregivers 
 <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Strategies to increase ART adherence among AYA are needed. Long-acting pharmaceuticals have shown increased adherence compared to daily pills in prior studies of antipsychotics 
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and contraception 
 <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Long-acting ART (LA-ART) is a promising potential intervention to overcome the need for daily adherence and improve clinical outcomes in this priority population.
