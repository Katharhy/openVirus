   <title>Evidence before this study</title>
   <p id="para250007">Stemming the HIV epidemic will require increased coverage and adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART). Adolescents and young adults (AYA) have lower ART adherence, and long-acting ART (LA-ART) is emerging as an effective treatment tool that may increase adherence in this population.</p>
   <p id="para0007">We searched PubMed for modeling analyses of long-acting antiretroviral therapy (LA-ART) on August 28, 2019 with the terms (model*) AND (HIV) AND (LA-ART OR long-acting ART OR long-acting antiretroviral* OR long-acting injectable*), with no date or language restrictions. Of the 17 papers identified, one used mathematical modeling to investigate long-acting antiretrovirals as HIV treatment. This study investigated the cost-effectiveness of LA-ART in the U.S. by estimating reductions in morbidity and mortality in the adult HIV-positive population, and found that LA-ART would be cost-effective only for patients with multiple ART failures. We found no studies modeling LA-ART in sub-Saharan Africa or in the AYA population.</p>

   <title>Added value of this study</title>
   <p id="para20008">Our model focuses on providing LA-ART to the AYA population in Kenya, a likely priority population to receive LA-ART due to low adherence to oral regimens. In addition to estimating health benefits and costs for HIV-positive AYA receiving LA-ART, we include the effect of LA-ART in preventing new HIV infections to estimate a comprehensive cost-effectiveness threshold for LA-ART in this population.</p>

   <title>Implications of all the available evidence</title>
   <p id="para025009">Administering LA-ART to AYA in Kenya may be cost-effective if LA-ART is less than double the current cost of administering oral ART. Prioritizing administration further to AYA who have difficulty taking daily pills, but can adhere to LA-ART, will increase the cost-effectiveness of LA-ART.</p>
