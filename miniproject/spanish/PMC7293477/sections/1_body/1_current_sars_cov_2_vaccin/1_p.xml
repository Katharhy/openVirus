<p id="par0030">Effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are crucial for controlling the CoVs pandemic. Vaccines decrease disease severity, viral shedding, and person to person transmission. Currently, no vaccine has been licensed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

 </xref> There are different vaccine development platforms against SARS-CoV-2, including live attenuated virus, viral vectors, inactivated virus, subunit vaccines, recombinant DNA, and protein vaccines. Several studies are in progress, but requires months to years to develop the vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. Currently, there may be many promising targets for SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 candidate vaccines under development include S protein or RBD subunit vaccines and replicating or non-replicating vector vaccines expressing mainly S protein or the RBD. Several studies showed that viral S protein subunit vaccines displayed higher neutralizing antibody titers and protection than live-attenuated SARS-CoV, full, and DNA-based S protein vaccines. Collectively, S protein/gene is the preferred target site in SARS vaccine development, and the same strategy can be potentially useful in developing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
