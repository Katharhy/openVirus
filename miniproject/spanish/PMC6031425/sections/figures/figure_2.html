 <caption> Respiratory system (in black), transpulmonary (in light gray) and chest wall (in dark gray) pressure volume curves constructed using end-inspiratory pauses (diagram A) and positive end-expiratory pressure steps and end-expiratory pauses (diagram B). The effect of chest wall mechanics is non-significant, as shown by overlapping transpulmonary and end-expiratory airway curves (diagram B). </caption>
