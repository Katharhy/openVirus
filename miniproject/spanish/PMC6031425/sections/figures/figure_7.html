 <caption> Relationship between the mechanical behavior of the respiratory system (bottom images) and end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) changes (top image) after a PEEP step. The increase in airway pressure (Paw, bottom left) coincides with the increases in both pleural (Ppl, bottom right) and transpulmonary (P L, bottom middle) pressures, resulting from the initial volume gain (MPV, minimum predicted volume), reflecting the combined mechanical response of the lung and chest wall. After the first ventilatory cycle at the new PEEP level, the pleural pressure begins to decrease, and consequently, the transpulmonary pressure increases, which generates volume gain (TDV, time-dependent volume, above), which, in this case, depends on the lung mechanical characteristics. PEEP - positive end-expiratory pressure. </caption>
