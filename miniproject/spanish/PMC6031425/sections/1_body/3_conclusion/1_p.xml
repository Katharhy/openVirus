<p>The chest wall effect on respiratory system mechanics is overestimated, which may lead to erroneous decision making. Monitoring airway pressure during mechanical ventilation is crucial given its key prognostic value and its ability to express pulmonary stress. The use of advanced monitoring tools (esophageal pressure) could be reserved for patients with clinically suspected increased intra-abdominal pressure in whom a protective mechanical ventilation strategy cannot be safely implemented. However, the pressure in the airway is not valid for correctly assessing the positive end-expiratory pressure toward restoring the end-expiratory lung volume. In this scenario, the best mechanical condition of the respiratory system likely coincides with the value of positive end-expiratory pressure that counteracts the intra-abdominal pressure effect. Estimates of alveolar recruitment induced by positive end-expiratory pressure based on respiratory system mechanics could reflect differences in the behavior of the chest wall according to the insufflation method and not actual alveolar recruitment.</p>
