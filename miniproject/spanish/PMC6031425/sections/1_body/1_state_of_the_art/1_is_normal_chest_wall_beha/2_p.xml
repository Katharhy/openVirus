<p>As all "elastic" structures, the lung and the chest wall have a resting volume. If the lung were isolated from the action of the chest wall, it would stabilize in a situation of collapse. Conversely, the relaxation volume of the chest wall is at 75% of vital capacity.

 <sup>)</sup> The elastic recoil of the lung in any situation will generate a positive elastic recoil (that is, tendency of the lungs to recoil inwards); however, the chest wall may exert negative (that is, the tendency of the chest wall to pull outwards) or positive elastic recoil, according to the relationship between a given volume and its resting volume (
