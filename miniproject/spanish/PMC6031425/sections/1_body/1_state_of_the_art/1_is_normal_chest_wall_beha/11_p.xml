<p>Thus far, no model based on the chest wall as an elastic structure has been able to explain the above findings. An alternative to the traditional behavior in which the chest wall is functionally divided into two components has been recently proposed: the rib cage, which generates a force that opposes the elastic recoil of the lung, and the abdomen, which is mechanically considered a hydraulic structure.

 <sup>)</sup> Systems consisting of hydraulic and elastic structures are governed by the principle of viscoelasticity. The response to the load of viscoelastic tissues is affected not only by the magnitude of the force applied but also by the temperature (could be considered constant in the case of the respiratory system) and by the rate of application of the load. At high application rates (insufflation with tidal volume - V
 <sub>T</sub>), the structure responds with greater stiffness, requiring a higher pressure for a given volume (response similar to that of an elastic structure); conversely, when applied slowly (insufflation with PEEP), the resistance to deformation decreases (
