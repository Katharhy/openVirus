<p>Dorsal decubitus, use of sedatives, neuromuscular blockers, obesity and/or increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) substantially reduce the chest wall and respiratory system resting volumes, resulting from the decrease in the negative elastic recoil of the chest wall concurrent to the decrease in FRC. Therefore, the resting volume of the chest wall remains higher than that of the respiratory system. Consequently, chest wall exerts positive pleural pressure only when the volume of the respiratory system exceeds the chest wall relaxation volume. This situation is described in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but it is unlikely to occur in patients with ARDS. Conversely, studies have shown that in parenchymal conditions that lead to increased lung weight (pneumonia or ARDS), the natural tendency of the lung to collapse is magnified.
