<p>The theoretical model can explain the behavior of the system during insufflation and deflation in MV; however, understanding why the respiratory system has a "viscoelastic" response is crucial for monitoring clinical variables. The incorporation of volume into the respiratory system moves the rib cage outward and the diaphragm downward (70% and 30%, respectively). The rib cage nears its relaxation volume, which could explain the negligible change in end-expiratory Pes.

 <sup>)</sup> The diaphragm and its close relationship with the abdominal cavity could be responsible for the different response to the insufflation mode.
