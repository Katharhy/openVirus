<p>The drop in EELV in patients with ARDS under MV may be aggravated when associated with comorbidities such as obesity and abdominal hypertension. Except for the increase in IAP, no condition alters the E
 <sub>CW</sub>. Therefore, the E
 <sub>RS</sub> could adequately reflect the PEEP effects on the pulmonary parenchyma (

 <sub>CW</sub> but rather to the decrease in EELV, for which basic monitoring lacks useful tools.
