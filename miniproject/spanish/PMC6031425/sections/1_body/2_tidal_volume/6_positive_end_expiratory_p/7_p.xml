<p>Another tool that could make it possible to calculate the overload on the lung imposed by the abdominal pressure is Pes. Yang et al. compared patients with ARDS with abdominal hypertension and those without it and observed that subjects with IAP higher than 12 mmHg had higher E
 <sub>RS</sub>, E
 <sub>L</sub>, E
 <sub>CW</sub> values and lower EELV. PEEP titration by esophageal manometry increased the EELV by 58.7% over the basal levels; conversely, the increase was only 26.4% in patients without abdominal hypertension.
