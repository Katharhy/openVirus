<p>Several research studies have been conducted towards titrating PEEP to counteract the increase in the IAP.

 <sup>)</sup> A PEEP/IAP ratio of 0.5 decreases the deleterious effects on oxygenation and on respiratory mechanics of abdominal hypertension and also limits the cardiac output deterioration.

 <sup>)</sup> However, IAP is usually quantified based on the bladder pressure, which could overestimate the abdominal pressure on the thoracic cavity in subjects under MV in a semi-sitting position and consequently guide the selection of excessive PEEP levels.
