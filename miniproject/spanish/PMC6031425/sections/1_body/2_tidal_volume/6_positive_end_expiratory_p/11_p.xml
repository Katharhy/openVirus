<p>In summary, the chest wall effect is likely overestimated during basic monitoring of patients with ARDS. Its main effect on respiratory system mechanics is the drop in the EELV of patients with abdominal hypertension. In these cases, PEEP should be selected towards reestablishing such volume. For such a purpose, Pes monitoring is available.

 <sup>)</sup> After selecting the appropriate PEEP level, airway pressure (despite the above limitations) has been shown to be a surrogate for inspiratory stress. Therefore, in the longitudinal follow-up of patients with ARDS, the change in airway pressure reflects, with an acceptable degree of certainty, changes in the characteristics of the lung. When nearing the safety limits proposed for plateau pressure, Pes monitoring could be useful (
