<p>The use of plateau pressure may not be a good surrogate for pulmonary stress inferred based on end-inspiratory P
 <sub>L</sub> and has been shown to be imprecise in predicting an end-inspiratory P
 <sub>L</sub> higher than 25cmH
 <sub>2</sub>O.

 <sup>)</sup> Moreover, the main disadvantage is that it disregards the pressure from wich the V
 <sub>T</sub> is delivered, that is, PEEP. In spite of the above limitations, levels higher than 30 cmH
 <sub>2</sub>O remain useful predictors of mortality.
