        <span class="abst" title="The respiratory system mechanics depend on the characteristics of the lung and chest wall and their interaction. In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome under mechanical ventilation, the monitoring of airway plateau pressure is fundamental given its prognostic value and its capacity to assess pulmonary stress. However, its validity can be affected by changes in mechanical characteristics of the chest wall, and it provides no data to correctly titrate positive end-expiratory pressure by restoring lung volume. The chest wall effect on respiratory mechanics in acute respiratory distress syndrome has not been completely described, and it has likely been overestimated, which may lead to erroneous decision making. The load imposed by the chest wall is negligible when the respiratory system is insufflated with positive end-expiratory pressure. Under dynamic conditions, moving this structure demands a pressure change whose magnitude is related to its mechanical characteristics, and this load remains constant regardless of the volume from which it is insufflated. Thus, changes in airway pressure reflect changes in the lung mechanical conditions. Advanced monitoring could be reserved for patients with increased intra-abdominal pressure in whom a protective mechanical ventilation strategy cannot be implemented. The estimates of alveolar recruitment based on respiratory system mechanics could reflect differences in chest wall response to insufflation and not actual alveolar recruitment.">

        <span class="abst" title="OBJECTIVE:Seasonal influenza epidemics are a major public health concern. They are caused by the influenza A and B viruses; although the A virus is more prominent, influenza B virus infection causes a disease with similar characteristics. There are two phylogenetically distinct influenza B lineages (B/Victoria and B/Yamagata), only one of which is present in the trivalent vaccine formulated each season. METHODS:Epidemiological data from the Spanish Influenza Surveillance System for 2007 to 2017 were reviewed to establish the relative proportion of each type of virus and the characterization of the B lineages in relation to the composition of the trivalent vaccine. RESULTS:The median proportion of B (2007-2017) was 27.2% (0.7%-74.8%) vs. 16.3% (0.4%-98.6%) for A-H3 and 44.2% (0.1%-98.0%) for pandemic A-H1N1 (20092017). The B lineages co-circulated in 8/10 seasons and there was mismatch with the B vaccine strain in 4/10 seasons. The B virus was dominant in 2007/08 and 2012/13 throughout Spain. There was a combination of dominance/codominance of influenza B and mismatch with the vaccine lineage in at least one third of epidemic seasons reviewed. CONCLUSIONS:Epidemiological information on influenza B has been less compiled in comparison with data on the A virus. Influenza virus type B is responsible for a significant number of cases in almost all seasons. The predominant B lineage in each season is unpredictable, affecting the protection conferred by the seasonal vaccine. Spanish epidemiological data support the rationale for a quadrivalent vaccine with both B virus lineages similarly to data from other settings.">

        <span class="abst" title="Objective:The Zika outbreak affected several tropical countries in 2015 and 2016, requiring the creation of intensified surveillance strategies for microcephaly and other neurological syndromes. The effect of the Zika outbreak on the reporting of birth defects in Colombia was evaluated from the perspective of the national surveillance system. Methods:National reporting of newborns with different birth defects was analyzed; variations in reporting attributed to the epidemic were determined through difference in differences (DID), a semiparametric model. Results:During the period of study, 18,234 cases of birth defects were reported in Colombia. The majority were congenital malformations (91.9%), and 82.3% was confirmed by clinical diagnosis or epidemiological link. In the case of microcephaly, eight new cases per epidemiological week were reported (coefficient of case reporting [D] = 8.8; P = 0.000) and 32 cases from other congenital anatomical malformations (D = 32.0; P = 0.000). The absolute value of the difference in differences estimator attributed to the Zika outbreak increased weekly case reporting of microcephaly (DID = |-5.0|; P = 0.008) and congenital malformations (DID = |-12.0|; P = 0.111). Conclusions:The Zika outbreak increased reporting of newborns with microcephaly, but caused no significant variation in reporting of other malformations and functional birth defects of sensory or metabolic origin in the surveillance system.">

Therefore, the current study aims to analyse the temporal behaviour of dengue cases in the both municipalities and forecast the number of disease cases in the out-of-sample period, using time series models, especially SARIMA model. We fitted SARIMA models, which satisfactorily meet the dengue incidence data collected in the municipalities of Ribeirão Preto and São Paulo. However, the out-of-sample forecast confidence intervals are very wide and this fact is usually omitted in several papers. Despite the high variability, health services can use these models in order to anticipate disease scenarios, however, one should interpret with prudence since the magnitude of the epidemic may be underestimated.">

        <span class="abst" title="Changes in the terminology and diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis are explained in this paper. This syndrome is a complex and controversial entity of unknown origins. It appears in the medical literature in 1988, although clinical pictures of chronic idiopathic fatigue have been identified since the nineteenth century with different names, from neurasthenia, epidemic neuromyasthenia, and benign myalgic encephalomyelitis up to the current proposal of disease of intolerance to effort (post-effort). All of them allude to a chronic state of generalised fatigue of unknown origin, with limitations to physical and mental effort, accompanied by a set of symptoms that compromise diverse organic systems. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) places this syndrome in the section on neurological disorders (G93.3), although histopathological findings have not yet been found to clarify it. Multiple organic alterations have been documented, but a common biology that clarifies the mechanisms underlying this disease has not been established. It is defined as a neuro-immune-endocrine dysfunction, with an exclusively clinical diagnosis and by exclusion. Several authors have proposed to include CFS/ME within central sensitivity syndromes, alluding to central sensitisation as the common pathophysiological substrate for this, and other syndromes. The role of the family doctor is a key figure in the disease, from the detection of those patients who present a fatigue of unknown nature that is continuous or intermittent for more than 6 months, in order to make an early diagnosis and establish a plan of action against a chronic disease with high levels of morbidity in the physical and mental sphere. OBJECTIVE: To carry out a bibliographic review of the terminology and diagnostic criteria of the chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis, in order to clarify the pathology conceptually, as a usefulness in the diagnosis of Primary Care physicians.">

Mortality is very low and mainly limited to secondary Guillain-Barré or fetal microcephaly cases. Diagnostic confirmation requires a RT-PCR in blood up to the 5th day from the onset or in urine up to the 10-14th day. Specific IgM are identifiable from the 5th symptomatic day. Clinically, a suspected case should comply with: a) a journey to epidemic areas; b) a clinically compatible appearance with fever and skin rash, and c) a generally normal blood count/basic biochemistry. There is some evidence that causally relates Zika virus infection with fetal microcephaly.

As a consequence of repeated, long-lasting antimicrobial treatments and deterioration of lung function, colonization by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter spp. and Burkholderia cepacia complex, is also frequent in adult CF patients. The special characteristics of the pathologic process and the microorganisms implicated in CF make it advisable to consider microbiological follow-up of chronic bronchopulmonary colonization-infection in these patients a specific diagnostic entity.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Respiratory syncytial virus and Influenza virus infections are known causes of hospital admission in infants. It is less well known the pattern of virus infections in infants under 6 months of age in the outpatient setting. OBJECTIVE:To describe the clinical and epidemiological pattern of community-acquired viral respiratory infections in infants under 6 months. PATIENTS AND METHODS:A cohort of infants from the 8 and 9 Madrid Health Districts was followed by telephone calls every two weeks since birth during the epidemic winter season. Clinical and epidemiological data were collected in pre-designed questionnaires. Nasopharyngeal aspirate was obtained in every patient with symptoms compatible with respiratory infection. Diagnosis of the more common virus was made with direct immunofluorescence and nucleic acid amplification test (PCR). RESULTS:Were recruited 316 newborns. The 1,865 phone calls made (median 4 for every child), produced 106 visits, and the illness confirmed in 89 illness. Rhinitis (91%) and cough (69%) were the most common symptoms. Upper respiratory infection was the principal clinical diagnosis (84.5%), and 17 of the 72 samples (23.2%) were positive. Most common viruses were RSV (41.1%) and rhinovirus (35.2%). Of the children visited, 17 out of 106 (16%) (5.3% of the cohort) were admitted to hospital. Diagnoses were febrile syndrome and bronchiolitis. We did not find any epidemiological factor associated with viral respiratory infection in positive cases. CONCLUSIONS:In our population most of the respiratory infections in infants are minor and do not need hospital assistance. Rhinovirus and RSV are the major pathogens. We did not find any epidemiological factor associated with viral respiratory infection.">

        <span class="abst" title="A review of the evidence on epidemiology, risk factors, etiology and clinical-etiological profile of acute bronchiolitis is presented. The frequency estimates are very heterogeneous; in the population under two years the frequency of admission for bronchiolitis is between 1 and 3.5%, primary care consultations between 4 and 20% and emergency visits between 1 and 2%. The frequency of admissions for respiratory infection by respiratory syncytial virus in the risk population is: in premature infants &lt; or =32 weeks of gestation between 4.4 and 18%, in patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia between 7.3 and 42%, and in infants with congenital heart disease between 1.6 and 9.8%. The main risk factors are: prematurity, chronic lung disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital heart disease and age less than 3-6 months at onset of the epidemic. Other factors are: older siblings or day care attendance, male gender, exposure to smoking, breastfeeding for less than 1-2 months and variables associated with lower socioeconomic status. Respiratory syncytial virus is the dominant etiological agent, constituting just over half the cases (median 56%; interval 27% to 73%). Other viruses implicated, in descending order of frequency, are rhinovirus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, influenza viruses, parainfluenza, enterovirus and bocavirus. In studies with genomic detection techniques, between 20 and 25% of cases the virus involved is not identified and between 9% and 27% of cases have viral co-infection. Although respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis shows more wheezing and retractions, longer duration of respiratory symptoms and oxygen therapy and are associated with lower use of antibiotics. This pattern is associated with the younger age of the patients and does not help us to predict the etiology. In general, the etiological identification is not useful for the management of patients. However, in young infants (&lt;3 months) with febrile bronchiolitis in the hospital environment, conservative management may help these patients and avoid diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.">

In addition, a relative fatality index has been created. Data are from international organizations. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to estimate the magnitude of the associations. RESULTS:Number of tests and of medical professionals are associated with a higher incidence rate. Mortality and case fatality rate are not associated with demographic, health expenditure, or health services variables. CONCLUSION:Differences suggest a general underestimation of the magnitude of the epidemic. Improvement of case identification and effectiveness of epidemiological surveillance systems is necessary.">

The widespread incorporation of molecular methods into clinical microbiology laboratories has not only led to notable advances in the etiological diagnosis of viral respiratory infections but has also increased insight into the pathology and epidemiological profiles of the causative viruses. Because of their high sensitivity, molecular techniques markedly increase the efficiency of viral detection in respiratory specimens, particularly those that fail to propagate successfully in common cell cultures, thus allowing more rapid etiologic diagnosis. However, there are also some disadvantages in the use of these new technologies such as detection of viruses that merely colonize the respiratory tract of healthy people, or those found in the nasopharyngeal secretions of patients who have recovered from respiratory infections, due to longterm viral shedding, when the viruses are unlikely to act as pathogens. Additionally, sequencing of the amplification products allows further characterization of detected viruses, including molecular epidemiology, genotyping, or detection of antiviral resistance, to cite only a few examples.">

We revise the literature on coronavirus infection of the CNS associated with neurological diseases. DEVELOPMENT:Neurological symptoms were rarely reported in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, although isolated cases were described. There are also reports of cases of neurological symptoms associated with CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E infection. The presence of neurological lesions, especially demyelinating lesions in the mouse hepatitis virus model, may explain the mechanisms by which coronaviruses enter the CNS, particularly those related with the immune response. This may explain the presence of coronavirus in patients with multiple sclerosis. We review the specific characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and address the question of whether the high number of cases may be associated with greater CNS involvement. CONCLUSION:Although neurological symptoms are not frequent in coronavirus epidemics, the high number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain the presence of the virus in the CNS and increase the likelihood of early- or delayed-onset neurological symptoms. Follow-up of patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic should include careful assessment of the CNS.">

At present, the virus has infected over 1.7 million people and caused over 100 000 deaths worldwide. Research is currently focused on understanding the acute infection and developing effective treatment strategies. In view of the magnitude of the epidemic, we conducted a speculative review of possible medium- and long-term neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with particular emphasis on neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin, based on the available evidence on neurological symptoms of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. DEVELOPMENT:We systematically reviewed the available evidence about the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immediate and lasting effects of the cytokine storm on the central nervous system, and the consequences of neuroinflammation for the central nervous system. CONCLUSIONS:SARS-CoV-2 is a neuroinvasive virus capable of triggering a cytokine storm, with persistent effects in specific populations. Although our hypothesis is highly speculative, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the onset and progression of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin should be regarded as the potential cause of a delayed pandemic that may have a major public health impact in the medium to long term. Cognitive and neuropsychological function should be closely monitored in COVID-19 survivors.">

        <span class="abst" title="INTRODUCTION:The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) has required adaptation by hospitals affected by the pandemic, which has caused a reduction in elective surgical activity. METHODS:Retrospective study of patients operated on in the previous month and during the peak of the pandemic. We analysed the COVID-19 infection rate, the severity of respiratory infection according to the Brescia respiratory COVID-19 severity scale, the adopted therapeutic measures and the overall postoperative complications. RESULTS:From 17th February to 31st March 2020, there was a progressive decrease in surgical activity, with only 213 patients operated on. This comprised 59 (27.8%) elective operations for oncological diseases, 97 (45.5%) elective operations for benign diseases and 57 (26.7%) as urgent procedures. There was a progressive increase in the rate of infection by COVID-19, with a total of 15 cases (7%). This included 10 patients (16.9%) in the elective group for oncological disease, 1 (1%) in the elective surgery group for benign disease and 4 (7%) in the urgent surgery group (P&lt;.001). Five patients presented with a severe respiratory infection, of which 4 were affected by oncological disease. There were 3 deaths (1.4%), which were all due to the worsening of a respiratory infection. CONCLUSIONS:The patients undergoing the surgical procedures showed high rates of COVID-19 infection and postoperative complications, especially the patients with oncological diseases. Local resumption of surgical activity must be based on the prioritisation of the cases to be operated on, respecting certain premises of security and optimisation of the available resources.">

Prevalence of COVID-19 by sexes differs between countries. The trend in Spain shows an unequal pattern, initially more frequent in men, but women outnumbered them from March 31, after two weeks lockdown. Infections are more frequent in women than in men in close contact with probable/confirmed COVID-19 cases. Consistent with deaths in men, they are hospitalized more frequently than women: Significant gender differences in signs/symptoms can drive this pattern, already observed in other pathologies. In late April, excess mortality is the same in women (67%) than in men (66%). But, lack of exhaustive information on deaths from COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients may contribute to lower notification of deaths in women. Invisibility of data by sex and gender is probably affecting negatively women with COVID -19 more than men.">

Therefore, admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is common. Ultrasound, which has become an everyday tool in the ICU, can be very useful during COVID-19 pandemic, since it provides the clinician with information which can be interpreted and integrated within a global assessment during the physical examination. A description of some of the potential applications of ultrasound is depicted in this document, in order to supply the physicians taking care of these patients with an adapted guide to the intensive care setting. Some of its applications since ICU admission include verification of the correct position of the endotracheal tube, contribution to safe cannulation of lines, and identification of complications and thrombotic events. Furthermore, pleural and lung ultrasound can be an alternative diagnostic test to assess the degree of involvement of the lung parenchyma by means of the evaluation of specific ultrasound patterns, identification of pleural effusions and barotrauma. Echocardiography provides information of heart involvement, detects cor pulmonale and shock states.">

Patients with cardiovascular risk and previous kidney risk have been identified as especially vulnerable for greater morbidity and mortality when they suffer from COVID-19. A considerable proportion of patients can develop a vascular lesion in the context of the disease that entails a greater lethality. Cardiovascular and renal complications represent a problem and, probably in the near future, may pose a threat to patients who have survived COVID-19. As physicians, we cannot forget that during an epidemic like this, other chronic diseases are present, and patients continue to require care. We are obliged to monitor even more intensely their treatments and control degree. Furthermore, we must not forget that urgent situations continue to arise in this pandemic situation and require prompt attention. In this current situation, it is very likely that many patients, out of fear, have not sought medical attention. The situation during the epidemic and the uncertainty of the post-COVID-19 period, requires intensification in the control and monitoring of cardiovascular and kidney disease in our patients. Primary care constitutes a key level of care for the care of the population with cardiovascular disease. Likewise, and in the face of this new health scenario, we need to promote the prevention and control measures that emanate from the studies currently underway. Now, more than ever, we need research, crucial to improve the cardiovascular and renal prognosis of our patients.">

The World Health Organization (WHO) called COVID-19 is a new virus of the coronavirus family. On March 12, the WHO declared this outbreak as a pandemic as it spread worldwide. Human epidemics usually follow the start of exponential growth, this means that from a small number of cases in a few days, a large increase in the number of infected people is observed. The clinical manifestations and spectrum of symptomatic disease range from moderate to critical presentations. In cases with fatal progression, the most serious complications sometimes are cause of a multi-organ failure and patient death. SARS-CoV-2 has a high transmission rate, the route of transmission between humans is through the secretions of infected people, hands or contaminated objects. In general, the epidemic control measures used so far have been based on adoption of interventions from the classical epidemiology, identifying and isolating the cases, following the contacts and establishing restrictions, including quarantine, closure of educational centers, avoiding events in which crowds of people occur, limiting mobility. These measures have been effective in China, the original focus of the outbreak.">

Five cases with a clinical history of biopolymers in the gluteal region that developed iatrogenic allogenosis (IA) are presented here. The 5 cases were put under colchicine treatment for IA crisis and had non-specific symptoms (headache, cough without dyspnoea, and arthralgias) with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Their close contacts had mild to severe symptoms and three of them died. In the SARS-CoV-2 infection different inflammatory pathways are altered where colchicine reduces cytokine levels as well as the activation of macrophages, neutrophils, and the inflammasome. The possible mechanisms that colchicine may use to prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with COVID-19 infection are also reviewed in this article.">

The origin of this new virus is presumed zoonotic, with bats being its probable vector. Due to the rapid number of infections and deaths that occurred first in China and later around the world, the infection of this virus quickly went from being an isolated outbreak in a Chinese region to becoming a health emergency of international concern and later, a pandemic.

The study aims to determine the mortality in our center due to covid-19 in cancer patients during the first 3 weeks of the epidemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS:The cancer patients who died of covid-19 during the analysis period have been reviewed describing the oncological and the covid-19 infection characteristics and the treatments established. RESULTS:Confirmed cases covid-19: 1069 with 132 deaths (12.3%). With cancer 36 patients (3.4%), 15 deceased (41.6%). Of the deceased, only 6 patients (40%) were in active treatment. The most frequent associated tumor was lung (8/15 patients, 53.3%), 11 with metastatic disease (11/15, 73.3%). No specific treatment was established in 40% (6/15) of the patients. The rest of them received treatments with the active protocols. CONCLUSION:Covid-19 mortality in cancer patients is almost four times higher than that of the general population. Until we have effective treatments or an effective vaccine, the only possibility to protect our patients is to prevent the infection with the appropriate measures.">

Only cases confirmed by molecular biology (reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) were known. We launched a web-based surveillance tool to estimate the number of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 to contribute to Public Health decision-making. MATERIAL AND METHODS:We implemented an anonymous web questionnaire and disseminated it through online social media social. We collected epidemiological information about «time» (date of onset of symptoms), «place» (zip code), and «person» (gender, age). We compared cases detected by RT-PCR with the estimated cases, according to the case definition of the Ministry of Health. We calculated the questionnaire response rate and the cumulative incidence at 14days. RESULTS:Between March 19 and 26, 128,009 people answered the questionnaire (5.5% of the Basque population). Of these, 26,375 met the case definition (symptom prevalence of 21.4%). The estimated cases were almost six times more than COVID-19 positive RT-PCR. The estimated 14-day cumulative incidence was 578.3 per 100,000 population compared to RT-PCR positive cases, which was 139.6 per 100,000 population. CONCLUSIONS:This tool was useful in estimating the minimum number of symptomatic cases in the Basque Country, which could support Public Health actions.">

Renal patients undergoing hemodialysis run the risk not only of suffering but also of transmitting and spreading COVID-19 due to multiple factors, both procedural and logistical, associated with the process. These include the long duration of the technique, collective transfer to and from the centres, and the waiting time before performing the technique, aspects that make strict isolation difficult and therefore increase not only the risk of contagion between patients but also between specialist health professionals, which makes it more difficult to replace professionals. Prevention, protection, detection, isolation and distribution measures are essential in the management of the epidemic and must be taken from the initial stage.

On the 30th of April, 64 days after this first diagnosis, the number of patients had increased exponentially, reaching 19 224 confirmed cases and 1859 (9.67%) deaths. In response to this global outbreak, we summarize the current state of our understanding regarding COVID-19 in Mexico. METHODS:We obtained the data from the official website of the Ministry of Health in Mexico. The study period was between the 27th of February and the 30th of April 2020. The cases were confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and we analysed epidemiological, demographic and clinical data. RESULTS:In Mexico, most cases of COVID-19 were located in Mexico City. The mean age of the patients was 46 years. Of the 12 656 confirmed cases, most infected individuals were between the ages of 30 and 59 years (65.85%), and there was a higher incidence rate in men (58.18%) than in women (41.82%). The patients who died had one or more comorbidities, mainly hypertension (45.53%), diabetes (39.39%) and obesity (30.4%). In the first 64 days of the epidemic, China had reported 80 304 cases with a mortality rate of 3.66%. CONCLUSIONS:Our results indicate an early transmission of COVID-19 in Mexico. The descriptive epidemiology shows similarities between the cases of COVID-19 in Mexico and those in China. In the same period of the epidemic curve, we observed a reduction in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Mexico and a higher mortality rate compared with that of China.">

        <span class="abst" title="Although we lack enough evidence to justify supplementing with vitaminD in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection, it is increasingly feasible that this hypothesis is valid. Two general underlying mechanisms should be considered. One would be the anti-infectious and immunomodulatory action that it exerts by improving intercellular barriers by stimulating innate immunity, as well as by modulating adaptive immunity. Also, vitaminD reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-2 and interferon-gamma (INF-γ). More recently, multiple pleiotropic effects have been demonstrated on the actions of vitaminD at the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory level with positive results in studies with influenza, coronavirus, and other respiratory infections. An inverse relationship between serum vitaminD levels and the prevalence of the respiratory infectious disease has been described. Of interest, another mechanistic approach responds to considering the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which is exacerbated in COVID-19 infection because the virus binds to the enzyme ACE2, making more angiotensinII available to cause damage. VitaminD inhibits mediators of RAAS - present in all cells of the body - and by inhibiting ACE activity and increasing ACE2, it lowers angiotensinII levels. We present studies with proposals for recommended doses of vitaminD, and although a single guideline is not specified, the possible benefits are promising. Finally, the purpose of this review is to share this idea with health professionals to ignite the debate and call for critical reflection, so that it can contribute to the undertaking of more and better clinical designs to validate the benefits of using high doses of vitaminD for the benefit of public health and especially in times of crisis for COVID-19.">

METHOD:Ecological study that used epidemiological, demographic, environmental and variables on the structure of health services as explanatory variables. The analysis period was from March 15th (the start of the alarm state) until April 22nd, 2020. Incidence and mortality rates were the main response variables. The magnitude of the associations has been estimated using the Spearman correlation coefficient and multiple regression analysis. RESULTS:Incidence and mortality rates at the time of decree of alarm status are associated with current incidence, mortality and hospital demand rates. Higher mean temperatures are significantly associated with a lower current incidence of COVID-19 in the autonomous communities. Likewise, a higher proportion of older people in nursing homes is significantly associated with a higher current mortality in the autonomous communities. CONCLUSION:It is possible to predict the evolution of the epidemic through the analysis of incidence and mortality. Lower temperatures and the proportion of older people in residences are factors associated with a worse prognosis. These parameters must be considered in decisions about the timing and intensity of the implementation of containment measures. In this sense, strengthening epidemiological surveillance is essential to improve predictions.">

Although there are no solid studies to support general recommendations, experiences with other viral infections (hepatitis C, cytomegalovirus) suggest that management of immunosuppression without mycophenolate mofetil or m-Tor inhibitors (drugs that are also associated with leukopenia and lymphopenia) may be beneficial. It is also important to pay attention to possible drug interactions, especially in the case of tacrolimus, with some of the treatments with antiviral effect given in the context of COVID 19 (lopinavir/ritonavir, azithromycin). Finally, the immunosuppressive effect of immunomodulating drugs (tocilizumab and similar) administered to patients with severe lung disease should be taken into account.

COVID-19 can cause dysregulation of the immune system, triggering an inflammatory response, and simulate haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Several studies have proposed that anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies, such as tocilizumab, play an important role in the treatment of severe acute respiratory infection associated with SARS-CoV-2. However, the role of anti-IL-1 receptor antibodies, such as anakinra, in the treatment of COVID-19 has not been established. We present a case report of a 51-year-old man diagnosed with severe respiratory infection associated with SARS-CoV-2 that was refractory to antiviral and anti-IL-6 treatment, with a favourable clinical outcome and analytical improvement after treatment with anti-IL-1 (anakinra).">

This review analyzes the impact of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic on pediatric care, and perspective of new COVID-19 outbreaks in coexistence with other viral infections. Changes secondary to pandemic involved in Hospital Pediatric units, how to prepare for future epidemics, also the involvement of pediatric units in adult care and the possible opportunities for improvement need to be revised. Assistance of patients with chronic complex conditions in epidemic circumstances, safety aspects, opportunities for teaching and ethical considerations are reviewed.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the incidence of potentially surgical abdominal emergency in our center during the epidemic of COVID-19. METHODS:A retrospective study was designed. It included all patients admitted for urgent abdominal pathology with potential surgical treatment in our General and Digestive Surgery Department from February 24, 2020 to April 19, 2020. RESULTS:Eighty-nine patients with a mean age of 58.85±22.2 were included. The median time from symptom onset to the Emergency Department (ED) visit was 48 (P25-P75 = 24-96) hours. On arrival at the ED, 18 (20%) patients presented with systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria. Fifty-one (57%) surgical procedures were performed. The rate of post-surgical complications at 30 days was 31% and the mortality rate was 2%. Concerning the same period from 2017 to 2019, the mean number of admissions from the ED to our Department decreased by 14% during the epidemic period. CONCLUSION:There has been a decrease in the number of patients admitted for urgent, potentially surgical, abdominal pathology during the period of the COVID-19 epidemic in our center.">

It is important, therefore, to identify their incidence, characterize them, and classify them to design strategies to minimize their impact. Objective: To estimate the overall incidence and the incidence of each one of the antiretroviral drugs-related problems in the treatment of the HIV infection in a cohort of hospitalized patients in Bogotá, Colombia. Materials and methods: We conducted a descriptive, retrospective cohort study in patients aged 18 years or more diagnosed with HIV infection and under antiretroviral treatment hospitalized between January 1st, 2015, and December 31st, 2016, in the Hospital Santa Clara, Bogotá. Results: The overall incidence of antiretroviral drug-related problems was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.85-0.93). The incidence of drug-drug interactions was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.80-0.90), 0.28 (95% CI: 0.22-0.35) for adverse reactions, and 0.12 (CI 95%: 0.08-0.17) for prescription errors. Conclusion: Drug-related problems should be studied, diagnosed, prevented, and treated. Their knowledge can enable health care professionals to anticipate their emergence, reduce their incidence, implement risk management plans, and optimize adherence to antiretroviral treatment.">

Muchos son agentes etiológicos de enfermedades en humanos. Actualmente, A. albopictus se encuentra en expansión geográfica por su adaptación a diversos ambientes y tipos de criaderos. En Colombia, este mosquito fue reportado por primera vez en 1998 y, hasta el momento, se ha registrado en 10 departamentos. Objetivo. Determinar la presencia de A. albopictus en Yopal, Casanare. Materiales y métodos. En una búsqueda activa de larvas de A. aegypti en la zona industrial de Yopal, se observaron por primera vez mosquitos adultos de A. albopictus. Por lo anterior, se realizó la inspección en el intradomicilio y el peridomicilio de las viviendas en ocho localidades del municipio, en la cual se recolectaron larvas y pupas al inspeccionar hábitats larvarios, y hembras adultas, mediante capturas sobre atrayente humano protegido. Resultados. Se identificaron 755 larvas de mosquitos, 71,5 % de A. aegypti, 24,8 % de A. albopictus, 3,2 % de Culex quinquefasciatus y 0,8 % de C. coronator y C. nigripalpus. Se capturaron 37 mosquitos adultos de A. albopictus. Los depósitos con mayor abundancia de este vector fueron las llantas. Conclusión. Ante la presencia de A. albopictus se sugiere intensificar el sistema de vigilancia entomológica para detectar nuevas poblaciones dentro del departamento y en las áreas cercanas. Se debe poner atención a los criaderos artificiales de las zonas cercanas a los parqueaderos de vehículos de transporte de alimentos, insumos y maquinaria, procedentes de áreas con presencia del vector.">

        <span class="abst" title="OBJECTIVE:The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic conditions high mortality rates in hospitalized elderly. Currently, a few studies include octogenarian patients and none of them analyze the impact of functional status on this health outcome. Our objective is to describe the characteristics of patients older than 80 years hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), to determine the mortality rate and to identify associated factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS:Prospective observational study carried out on patients over 80 years admitted for COVID-19 in a Geriatrics Service. Sociodemographic, clinical, functional, mental, analytical, radiological, therapeutic and healthcare variables were collected. The factors associated with in-hospital lethality were analyzed by bivariate analysis. RESULTS:58 cases with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included, mean age 88.3 ± 5.4 years, 69% women, 65.5% moderate-severe cognitive impairment and previous Barthel index 40.66 ± 36. The main symptoms were fever (60,3%), dyspnea (53.4%) and deterioration of functional condition (50%). The most frequent comorbidities were cardiovascular disease (75.9%), hypertension (HT) (74.1%) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (50%). A mortality rate of 41,4% was detected and the associated factors were: severe functional dependence (OR = 3.8 [1.2-12.2]), moderate-severe cognitive impairment (OR = 4.9 [1-25.4]) and CKD (OR = 3.2 [1.1-9.7]). CONCLUSION:High mortality rates are observed in older patients hospitalized for COVID-19, with a higher risk of dying in those with severe functional dependence or cognitive impairment. These findings reinforce the value of Geriatric Assessment to develop strategies to adapt diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making and to optimize care for elderly patients in the event of a new epidemic outbreak.">

This may cause some emotional difficulties and mental health problems. The aim of the present study was to analyze the emotional status among the health care workers form the Hospital of Igualada (Barcelona), while they were facing with Covid-19 in one of the most affected regions in all of Europe. PATIENTS AND METHODS:A total of 395 participants were included in the study. A cross-sectional assessment was carried out between the months of March and April. Information about anxiety, depression, and stress was gathered. We also collected demographic data and concerning potentially stressful factors. RESULTS:A significant proportion of professionals reported symptoms of anxiety (31.4%) and depression (12.2%) from moderate to severe intensity. Symptoms of acute stress were reported by 14.5% of participants. We performed a regression analysis, which explained the 30% of the variance associated with the degree of emotional distress (Ry=0.30). The final model reveals that females (or young males), who are working in the frontline as nursing assistants, caretakers or radiology technicians, with the uncertainty of a possible infection, the perception of inadequate protection measures and having experienced the death of a close person by Covid-19, showed a heightened risk of experiencing psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS:Coping with the Covid-19 pandemic caused a significant impact on emotional status of healthcare workers involved in this study.">

        <span class="abst" title="INTRODUCTION:Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly throughout the world. Smell and/or taste disorders have emerged as a very frequent symptom as the disease has spread in Europe. Spain is one of the European countries with the highest number of infections. OBJECTIVE:This study aimed to investigate the clinical progression of smell and taste disorders in Spanish patients with mild COVID-19. METHODS:An online survey was used to conduct a cross-sectional study of patients who presented sudden smell and/or taste disorders during the 2 months of total lockdown due to COVID-19 in Spain. RESULTS:In our sample, 91.18% of respondents with impaired smell and/or taste and who were able to undergo PCR testing were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anosmia and ageusia presented in isolation in 6.5% of participants. The remaining 93.5% presented other mild symptoms: headache (51.6%), cough (51.6%), myalgia (45.2%), asthaenia (38.7%), nasal congestion or rhinorrhoea (35.5%), fever (41.9%), low-grade fever (29.0%), odynophagia (25.8%), or diarrhoea (6.5%). The mean duration of anosmia was 8.33 days, with patients subsequently manifesting hyposmia; complete resolution occurred after a mean of 17.79 days. In 22.6% of respondents, olfactory deficits persisted. All participants recovered their sense of taste. CONCLUSIONS:Olfactory and gustatory disorders are prevalent symptoms in mild COVID-19. Most patients do not present associated nasal congestion or rhinorrhoea and a small group of patients present these alterations in isolation.">

METHODS:A survey was conducted of the tutors of rehabilitation departments. The questionnaire contained 31 questions divided into 6 parts about the following: general information on the department, adaptation of rehabilitation departments to the COVID pandemic, clinical work of rehabilitation physicians, the approach to rehabilitation in COVID patients, and the effects of the pandemic on the health and teaching activity of rehabilitation physicians during this period. RESULTS:A total of 54 responses were obtained. Almost half of the departments cancelled face-to-face medical consultations (40%) and 48% of the treatment rooms were turned into COVID beds. In 30 hospitals (55.6%), the physicians worked in COVID units. Most of the rehabilitation departments developed both graphic and audiovisual material with exercises, referral protocols and guidelines for the rehabilitation management and treatment of COVID 19 patients. Half of the departments reported some anxiety symptoms in medical staff. Tutorial work has been cancelled (40.7%) or reduced (35.2%). CONCLUSIONS:The organisation of Spanish rehabilitation departments in response to the COVID pandemic has been very similar throughout the country. The response of these departments to the healthcare crisis has revealed the versatility of rehabilitation physicians.">

The inclusion criterion was public civil actions that concerned health care and situations involving the COVID-19 pandemic. Two categories emerged from data analysis. Results four cases were identified. Conclusion the judicialization of health care consists of obtaining assets and rights in the courts. These assets and rights are essential to ensure the health of citizens but have been denied in various instances, often due to the omission of the executive and legislative powers.

OBJECTIVE:We compared the social and professional effects of confinement on patients with MS in 2 very different populations, from Spain and China. METHODS:Questionnaires were administered to a group of patients with MS who consulted at the MS unit of Vithas hospital (DINAC Foundation) in Seville, and patients with MS attended in several provinces of China in April 2020, with the aim of analysing the differences and similarities between populations in the social and professional effects of confinement. To this end, a database was created and subsequently analysed. RESULTS:The Chinese population includes a higher proportion of younger patients and no differences were identified regarding sex. Most of the variables studied behaved in the same way in both patient populations. Spanish patients presented a lesser impact (30.7%) on their socio-economic situation than Chinese patients (44%) (P &lt; .05). There were no significant differences between populations in the remaining variables. Social networks were widely used in the majority of patients from both populations. CONCLUSIONS:The social and professional consequences of the pandemic were very similar in both groups; the use of social networks and family support was also similar. Spanish patients seem to present greater economic stability, perhaps due to the social support they receive.">

        <span class="abst" title="INTRODUCTION:At this time there are still major questions about the characteristics of disease caused by the new coronavirus (COVID-19) in children as well as factors associated with the development of severe forms of the disease. STUDY DESIGN:Retrospective study including patients under 18 years of age admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 1 to April 30, 2020. Infection was confirmed by realtime reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or antibody testing. We describe the epidemiological and clinical data, laboratory and imaging findings, as well as treatment and outcome in these patients. In light of these findings, patients were classified into two severity groups and then compared. RESULTS:Thirty-nine children were included, with a median age of 9 years (range 12 days-16 years); 23 were boys. Cases with uncomplicated disease course (24) mostly presented to the emergency department (ED) with fever and/or respiratory symptoms without significant alterations in laboratory findings. Of the 15 children with a complicated course, 12 developed shock. In addition to fever, they frequently presented altered appearance, extreme tachycardia, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and/or conjunctival hyperemia. They also showed greater lymphopenia (p = 0.001), elevated neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.001), C-reactive protein (p &lt; 0.001), procalcitonin (p = 0.001), D-dimer (p &lt; 0.001), and ferritin (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS:SARS-CoV-2 infection in admitted children presents with great clinical variability. When provided supportive care, patients with predominant respiratory symptoms without altered laboratory-test results generally have an uncomplicated course. Patients with complicated disease present mainly with fever and abdominal and/or mucocutaneous symptoms. Most develop shock. Elevation of inflammatory markers may allow for early detection and the final outcome is good.">

Methods:he trend in new daily cases and the crude mortality rate (CMR) from COVID-19 were analyzed through the Joinpoint regression analysis methodology, using the Joinpoint Regression Program 4.8.0.1. Data was obtained from the Our World in Data registry. A multiple correspondence analysis was performed between the public health measures adopted in each country to face the COVID-19 pandemic (measured through the stringency index, Oxford University) and sanitary, demographic and social conditions, and the results of the evolution of the pandemic. SPSS software was used. Results:The Joinpoint regression analysis showed that the highest increase in the number of cases was observed in Brazil (11.3%) and the highest increase in CMR in Mexico (16.2%). The multiple correspondence analysis showed that CMR was associated with the total population, the stringency index, the level of urbanization, the proportion of the population living on less than one dollar a day, the prevalence of diabetes and the number of hospital beds. Conclusions:The countries of the region show a heterogeneous evolution in the incidence of COVID-19. This heterogeneity is associated with both the public health measures adopted, as well as with the population size, poverty levels and pre-existing health systems.">

VECTOS is a novel software for the integration of vector control strategies. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of the use of VECTOS in the routine control programs of diseases transmitted by A. aegypti in the municipality of San Juan de Girón (Santander). Materials and methods: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision analysis model from the perspective of the local health authorities. We considered the use of the VECTOS software in the routine control activities in the municipality of San Juan de Girón during 2016 as the treatment group while the routine control in the municipality of Floridablanca, where VECTOS is not implemented, was considered as the comparator. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) taking as effectiveness measure the disability-adjusted life years (DALY). Results: VECTOS was cost-effective at a rate of USD$ 660,4 savings per each DALY avoided compared to the routine control in Floridablanca. The probabilistic model showed that the system was cost-effective in 70% of the 10.000 iterations for a threshold between 1 to 3 GDP per capita. Conclusions: VECTOS software as implemented in the municipality of San Juan de Girón is highly cost-effective and could be used in other municipalities in the country where diseases transmitted by A. aegypti are endemic.">

A scoping review has the objective to review the information available in pregnant women infected with the MERS-CoV, SARSCoV, SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses to assess the similarities in terms of and differences in the clinical characteristics of the mothers and neonatal outcomes. METHODS:We carried out a bibliographic search (scoping review) according to the PRISMA guidelines between March and April 2020 in the MEDLINE, SciELO, and CUIDEN databases and the Elsevier COVID-19 Information Center. RESULTS:We analyzed 20 articles with a total of 102 cases. 9 of MERS-CoV, 14 of SARS-CoV and 79 of SARS-CoV-2. Fever (75.5%) and pneumonia (73.5%) were the most frequent symptoms in infected pregnant women. The most frequent obstetric complications were the threat of premature delivery (23.5%) and caesarean section (74.5%). No vertical transmission was documented in any of the infants. CONCLUSIONS:All three coronaviruses produce pneumonia with very similar symptoms, being milder in the case of SARSCoV2. Despite documented obstetric complications, neonatal outcomes are mostly favorable. Increased knowledge is needed to improve and prevent obstetric and neonatal complications from these infections in pregnant women.">
