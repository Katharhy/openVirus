<p>The results of the search for papers were transferred to the bibliographic manager 
 <italic>Endnote Web</italic>, an instrument that permits access by multiple researchers, the identification of duplicated papers, and the organization of the references in separate files, according to the database. To minimize selection bias, two independent researchers read and assessed the studies included. Disagreements were discussed until a consensus was obtained or with the help of a third reviewer.
