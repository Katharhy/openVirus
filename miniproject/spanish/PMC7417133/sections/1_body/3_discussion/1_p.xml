<p>This scoping review allowed mapping the body of knowledge currently available on how to deal with COVID-19 during the pregnancy-postpartum cycle and the main recommendations regarding labor, childbirth, postpartum, and breastfeeding. This topic should be a priority and has gained attention after a group of Brazilian researchers developed a survey in the field of womenâ€™s health. This document reports that five deaths caused by COVID-19 occurred in a context of 1,947 deaths while, in Iran, two maternal deaths were reported in a total of 3,800 deaths. Little has been mentioned about maternal deaths in the context of the pandemic in European countries or even in the remaining countries in the Americas. Hence, attention should be drawn to maternal deaths caused by the novel coronavirus
