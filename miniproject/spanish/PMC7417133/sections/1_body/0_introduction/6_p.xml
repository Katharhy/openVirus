<p>The number of pregnant women and NB infected is much lower than that of the general population, however, pregnant and puerperal women are more vulnerable to COVID-19 and, when they become infected, the symptoms may be more severe. Transmission may occur from mother to NB in the postpartum and, the NBâ€™s immunological system being still immature, they are believed to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hence, it is recommended to prevent infection of NB through contact with mothers, close family members, and health workers who are sick or carry the virus
