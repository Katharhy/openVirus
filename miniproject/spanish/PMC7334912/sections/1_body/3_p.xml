<p id="par0020">Since March 2020, routine childhood immunization services have been disrupted on a global scale in a way that has not been ever seen since expanded programs on immunization (EPI) in the 1970s were implemented. More than half (53%) of the 129 countries where data were available reported moderate-to-severe disruptions, or a total suspension of vaccination services during Marchâ€“April 2020. The reasons for disrupted services vary. Some parents are reluctant to leave home because of restrictions on movement, lack of information or because they fear infection with SARS CoV-2 virus. Also, many health workers are unavailable because of restrictions on travel, or redeployment to Covid-19 response duties, as well as a lack of protective equipment.
