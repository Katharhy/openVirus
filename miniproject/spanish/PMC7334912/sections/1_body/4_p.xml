<p id="par0025">The progress achieved worldwide for polio eradication is now under threat, risking the resurgence of the disease even though 2 wild polioviruses have been already eradicated. On the 25th of March, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) circulated the first update of the interim guide to help ensure continuity of the program's operations in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as its support to the pandemic response while also ensuring the safety of its personnel and the communities it works with. SARS CoV-2 transmission will likely continue worldwide in multiple overlapping waves throughout 2020 and, possibly 2021 until sufficient herd immunity to the virus is achieved either through populations’ exposure to the virus or mass vaccination. Until that happens, countries will focus on achieving containment of transmission keeping it at a low level whilst enabling a “new normality” of economic and social life.</p>
