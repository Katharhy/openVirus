<p id="par0025">Tesyla et al. suggest that information dissemination about COVID-19, which mainsprings individual endorsement of self-imposed prevention measures such as hand washing, mask-wearing, and social distancing, can be an efficacious strategy to take the edge off and delay the epidemic rather than short-lived government initiated intervention strategies such as social distancing and closures.

 </xref> Tesyla et al. revealed that the government initiated enforcement measures with self-imposed interventions caused a pivotal change in reduction of the rate of epidemic and mortality from infection. On the other hand, making the community disease-aware is a crucial issue and the fast spread of awareness in the population plays a substantial role in containing the spread of disease. Information, education and communication (IEC) activities provide fast dissemination of COVID-19 awareness on self-imposed intervention strategies among elderly, immunocompromised individuals, or those with no formal education. Social media and mobile based information dissemination has significant impact in fast paced awareness about importance of wearing face mask in public places.

 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> A strong enforcement measures should be introduced in public places where more individuals gathering such as restaurants, shopping malls, working areas and academic institutions, etc. All these premises may display IEC materials on self-imposed interventions such as wearing face mask, social distancing and hand hygiene.
