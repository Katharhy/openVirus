<p>In the first instance court, the judge of the 14
 <sup>th</sup> Public Finance Court dismissed the preliminary request based on the argument that an intervention on the part of the judicial branch would offend the principle of separation of powers (the judiciary cannot interfere in political decisions of the other powers, except in exceptional cases), also considering the principle of possible reserve (i.e., as the budget is finite, managers, based on technical evidence, make political decisions to allocate resources the best way possible). Additionally, he maintained that other diseases could not be ignored.
