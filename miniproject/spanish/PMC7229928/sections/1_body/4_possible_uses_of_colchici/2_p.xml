<p id="par0060">ARDS appears to be the common final path leading to the death of the patient. All patients die of respiratory failure thus indicating that the lungs are the target organ. Furthermore, when multiorgan failure occurs, the most compromised organ after the lung is the heart followed by the kidney and liver. There is elevated procalcitonin in 0.5% of the patients, probably as an indicator of bacterial infection. Patients who die have a severe inflammatory cascade which is reflected in increased C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A.
