<p id="par0080">A lot of attention has been given to the effects of colchicine on macrophages. Colchicine has been shown to modulate lipopolysaccharide-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by liver macrophages in a rat model.

 </xref> In a mouse brain macrophage cell line, colchicine inhibited ATP-induced IL1β release by preventing microtubule rearrangement and constraining activation of the Ras homolog gene family, which contains the protein kinase (ROCK) pathway. In the presence of colchicine, mouse peritoneal macrophages showed less ATP-induced permeability to ethidium bromide and less formation of reactive species of oxygen (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), IL1β release, crystal-induced chemotactic factor, myeloid inhibitory C type-like lectin, toll-like receptors, and vascular endothelial growth factor.

 </xref> All these compounds intervene to intensify the inflammatory process and are responsible for alveolar damage, interstitial infiltration, and lung collapse. Colchicine can minimize such damage using different paths.
