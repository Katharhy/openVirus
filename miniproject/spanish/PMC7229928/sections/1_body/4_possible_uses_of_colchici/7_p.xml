 </xref> recently studied its role in inhibiting respiratory syncytial virus replication infection in vitro in BEAS-2B cells as well in vivo in neonatal rats. They showed that colchicine inhibited RSV infection in neonatal rats through regulation of anti-oxidative factor production. The expression of IFN-Î²1 and RIG-I genes was also up-regulated in the RSV infected alveolar epithelial cells by treatment with colchicine.
