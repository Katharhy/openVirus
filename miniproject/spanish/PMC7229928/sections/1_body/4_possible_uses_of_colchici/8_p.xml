 </xref> demonstrated that colchicine inhibits interferon synthesis induced by the Lee strain of influenza B virus in chick embryo cells, but it does not influence the release of preformed interferon from cells. Colchicine was found to be most effective when it was introduced into the medium at early stages of infection. It may also inhibit the formation of messenger RNA for interferonogenesis.
