<p id="par0045">The five patients were diagnosed with IA and comorbidities (age, arterial hypertension, diabetes, hypothyroidism) and were put under colchicine treatment for IA crisis 3 weeks ago. These patients developed mild symptoms (headache, cough without dyspnea, and arthralgias) and were positive when tested for COVID-19 RT-PCRT. However, they did not need to be hospitalized for treatment. It should be noted that three close contacts presented severe symptoms and died, whereas other close contacts experienced mild symptoms. Based on these cases, we hypothesized a possible protective effect of colchicine among the IA patients who did not suffer a severe COVID-19 infection even though they had several comorbidities and a possible disrupted immune system because of ASIA Syndrome which has been reported to be a risk factor for patients with the new pandemic disease.
