The patient received antiviral therapy plus hydroxychloroquine. After progressive worsening of respiratory conditions requiring non-invasive ventilation and being considered for intubation, the antiviral therapy was ended, and the patient was put on colchicine (1 mg on day 8, and 0.5 mg/day thereafter) to reduce inflammation due to the unavailability of anti-IL-6 receptor mAb tocilizumab. Authors concluded that the immunosuppression interruption combined with the anti-inflammatory effects of colchicine may have synergized with the antiviral therapy and hydroxychloroquine to lower viral replication and minimize the cytokine storm triggered by SARS-CoV-2.
