<p id="par0030">Colchicine is eliminated from the body mainly through transportation by P-glycoprotein [P-gp, also known as multi-drug resistant protein 1 (MDR1) or ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1)] expressed in hepatocytes (biliary excretion), proximal renal tubules (renal excretion), enteric cells (intestinal excretion), monocytes, and blood-brain barrier cells. The P glycoprotein is encoded by the MDR1 gene, and certain MDR1 polymorphisms are associated with increased P-gp expression/activity and decreased serum colchicine concentrations.

 </xref> A smaller, but significant quantity of absorbed colchicine is metabolized by hepatic P450 cytochrome CYP3A4, or directly eliminated by the kidneys through glomerular filtration. All of these mechanisms are vulnerable to drug interaction which can affect bloodstream levels.
