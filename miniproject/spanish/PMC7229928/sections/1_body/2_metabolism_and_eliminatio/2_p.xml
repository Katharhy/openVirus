<p id="par0035">In general, colchicine has been safely administered. However, when there is an overdose, toxicity includes neutropenia, gastrointestinal upset, bone marrow damage, and anemia. Colchicine's toxicity is due to its antimitotic properties. It binds to tubulin in cells and causes impaired protein assembly, mitotic arrest, and multi-organ dysfunction but is safe when used according to the established therapeutic guidelines, and toxicity is rare if the recommended doses are not exceeded.
