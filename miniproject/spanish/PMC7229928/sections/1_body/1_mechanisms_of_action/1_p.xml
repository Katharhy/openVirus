<p id="par0025">Colchicine is a tricyclic alkaloid that is extracted from the plant Colchicum autumnale. Colchicine acts as a potent inhibitor of tubulin polymerization. The mechanism studied the most is colchicine's high affinity for binding to the β-tubulin subunit to prevent it from assembling and thus block microtubule polymerization.

 </xref> Microtubules are the key piece of the cytoskeleton and are involved in multiple cellular processes such as maintaining the shape of the cell, transferring intracellular substances, secreting cytokines and chemokines, cell migration, regulating ion channels, and cell division. Colchicine is an antimitotic substance that blocks cell division during metaphase.

 </xref> It stimulates independent GTPase activity to promote the loss of the microtubule GTP cap and prevent assembly. When colchicine binds to tubulin, the straight conformation of the αβ-tubulin heterodimeric subunits is lost resulting in curved tubulin heterodimers. The lateral contacts between adjacent αβ-subunits that are needed to maintain interaction between them is lost and, as lateral contacts decrease, microtubules disassemble. Colchicine may also modify the voltage-dependent anion channels of mitochondrial membranes, thereby limiting mitochondrial metabolism.

 </xref> Colchicine has an additional effect on the chemotaxis of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and monocytes and on the intracellular transportation of vesicles such as endosomes and exosomes. It also inhibits the expression of E-selectin, an adhesion molecule important for binding leukocytes to endothelial cells and the recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils to inflamed tissue. Finally, colchicine reduces the neutrophil production of free radicals like superoxide.

Peak plasma concentrations occur 1 h after administration and maximal anti-inflammatory effects develop over 24–48 h based on intra-leukocyte accumulation. Colchicine reaches much higher concentrations within leukocytes than in plasma and persists there for several days after ingestion. All of this explains in part its fast blockage of acute inflammatory diseases such as gout.
