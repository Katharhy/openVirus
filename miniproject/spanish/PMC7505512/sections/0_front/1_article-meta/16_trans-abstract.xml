  <title>Introduction:</title>
  <p> Diseases transmitted by 
   <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> are considered a public health problem. VECTOS is a novel software for the integration of vector control strategies. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of the use of VECTOS in the routine control programs of diseases transmitted by 
   <italic>A. aegypti</italic> in the municipality of San Juan de Girón (Santander).
  </p>

 <sec>
  <title>Materials and methods:</title>
  <p> We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision analysis model from the perspective of the local health authorities. We considered the use of the VECTOS software in the routine control activities in the municipality of San Juan de Girón during 2016 as the treatment group while the routine control in the municipality of Floridablanca, where VECTOS is not implemented, was considered as the comparator. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) taking as effectiveness measure the disability-adjusted life years (DALY).</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Results:</title>
  <p> VECTOS was cost-effective at a rate of USD$ 660,4 savings per each DALY avoided compared to the routine control in Floridablanca. The probabilistic model showed that the system was cost-effective in 70% of the 10.000 iterations for a threshold between 1 to 3 GDP per capita.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Conclusions:</title>
  <p> VECTOS software as implemented in the municipality of San Juan de Girón is highly cost-effective and could be used in other municipalities in the country where diseases transmitted by 
   <italic>A. aegypti</italic> are endemic.
