<p>Several papers displayed in 
 <xref rid="tab03" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> also presented out-of-sample forecasts, but, in general, they present confidence intervals for the forecasts only in the log-scale. Moreover, they omit the corresponding interval for number of cases, because they would be very wide. These wide intervals indicate that we must use these forecasts prudently.
