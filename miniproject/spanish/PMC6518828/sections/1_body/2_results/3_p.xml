<p>Thus, considering the seasonality of the disease, it was possible to adjust SARIMA models with different indications of the components 
 <italic>p</italic>, 
 <italic>d</italic>, 
 <italic>q</italic>, 
 <italic>P</italic>, 
 <italic>D</italic>, 
 <italic>Q</italic>, whose SARIMA(0,1,0)(2,0,0)
 <sub>12</sub> presented the lowest AIC for both Ribeirão Preto and São Paulo. The residuals obtained fitting this model present significant autocorrelations until the lag 6, indicating that SARIMA(6,1,0)(2,0,0)
 <sub>12</sub> is more appropriate and in fact it satisfied all the model assumptions. The next step was to estimate the parameters of the proposed model.
