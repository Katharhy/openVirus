 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7</xref> presents the observed and the forecasts of the number of cases in 2016. The forecast 95% confidence intervals are so wide that their upper limits reach more than the double of the monthly number of cases ever observed, highlighting the large variability of forecasts. Exemplifying this situation, for illustrative purposes, the 95% confidence intervals for the number of cases in April 2016 were [66; 114 479] in Ribeirão Preto and [983; 197 178] in São Paulo. Also in April 2016, there were 3554 cases in Ribeirão Preto and 4524 cases in São Paulo. The observed number of cases belongs to the intervals, however, they are very wide.
