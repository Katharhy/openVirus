<p>The graph presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6</xref> compares the observed, the predicted and forecast number of cases (not in the logarithm scale). In São Paulo, the predicted number of cases during the outbreak in 2014 was lower than the observed, since it was the first outbreak in São Paulo and the forecast for 2016 was larger than the observed. In Ribeirão Preto the predicted values are close to the observed number of cases and forecasts for 2016 are smaller than the observed number of cases.
