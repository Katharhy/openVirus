 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2(a)</xref> suggests that the standardised residuals estimated from this model should behave as an independent and identically distributed sequence with a mean of zero and a constant variance. The qq plot, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2(b)</xref>, shows that the standardised residuals for the model approximated a normal distribution. Based on the Ljung–Box test, the hypothesis of all autocorrelations up to lag 15 are null (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.3395), suggesting that the residuals behave as a white noise. This can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figures 2(c) and (d)</xref>, where the graphs of the autocorrelation function and the partial autocorrelation function suggest that the autocorrelations are jointly non-significant, that is, the autocorrelations approach of zero. Thus, all assumptions were satisfied and the model error variance is 0.6914.
