<p>The SARIMA model [
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] was chosen after fitting several models with different SARIMA(
 <italic>p</italic>, 
 <italic>d</italic>, 
 <italic>q</italic>)(
 <italic>P</italic>, 
 <italic>D</italic>, 
 <italic>Q</italic>) specifications, where 
 <italic>d</italic> and 
 <italic>D</italic> correspond respectively to the number of usual differences and seasonal differences necessary to achieve stationarity, 
 <italic>P</italic> and 
 <italic>p</italic> are the autoregressive orders and 
 <italic>Q</italic> and 
 <italic>q</italic> are the moving average orders. A first candidate model is the one which minimises the Akaike information criteria (AIC) [
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], corresponding to the one that maximises the likelihood, penalising an increase in the number of parameters, avoiding overfitting.
