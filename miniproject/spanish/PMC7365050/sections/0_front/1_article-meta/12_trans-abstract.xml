  <title>Objective</title>
  <p>The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic conditions high mortality rates in hospitalized elderly. Currently, a few studies include octogenarian patients and none of them analyze the impact of functional status on this health outcome. Our objective is to describe the characteristics of patients older than 80 years hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), to determine the mortality rate and to identify associated factors.</p>

  <title>Material and methods</title>
  <p>Prospective observational study carried out on patients over 80 years admitted for COVID-19 in a Geriatrics Service. Sociodemographic, clinical, functional, mental, analytical, radiological, therapeutic and healthcare variables were collected. The factors associated with in-hospital lethality were analyzed by bivariate analysis.</p>

 <sec>
  <title>Results</title>
  <p>58 cases with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included, mean age 88.3 ± 5.4 years, 69% women, 65.5% moderate-severe cognitive impairment and previous Barthel index 40.66 ± 36. The main symptoms were fever (60,3%), dyspnea (53.4%) and deterioration of functional condition (50%). The most frequent comorbidities were cardiovascular disease (75.9%), hypertension (HT) (74.1%) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (50%). A mortality rate of 41,4% was detected and the associated factors were: severe functional dependence (OR = 3.8 [1.2-12.2]), moderate-severe cognitive impairment (OR = 4.9 [1-25.4]) and CKD (OR = 3.2 [1.1-9.7]).</p>

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>High mortality rates are observed in older patients hospitalized for COVID-19, with a higher risk of dying in those with severe functional dependence or cognitive impairment. These findings reinforce the value of Geriatric Assessment to develop strategies to adapt diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making and to optimize care for elderly patients in the event of a new epidemic outbreak.</p>
