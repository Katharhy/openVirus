<p>The patient stated that he had never been out of Wuhan recently and denied a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market. Given the history of his household members with fever or history of fever, he was triaged to a fever clinic exclusively for patients with suspected SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. After waiting for approximately 5 hours, he was placed in a dedicated consultation room and underwent an examination by a physician. According to the records of physical examination, the vital sign of the patient revealed a body temperature of 38.2°C, pulse of 96 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 108/82 mm Hg and oxygen saturation of 96% breathing ambient air. Breath sounds were normal to auscultation. Chest computed tomography (CT) was performed and the CT images revealed ground glass opacities located in the right lower lobe of his lung. The laboratory results showed normal values of neutrophil count (2.52 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L), monocyte count (0.23 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L), haemoglobin (137 g/L) and platelet count (214 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L), but leukopenia (white blood cell count, 3.64 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L), lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.85 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L), elevated plasma C‐reactive protein (CRP, 12.6 mg/L) and serum amyloid A (SAA, 37 mg/L). Oropharyngeal swab samples were negative for influenza A and B viral antigens. Nucleic acid detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 was reported later as positive using his oropharyngeal swab by real‐time reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR). At this time point, dyspnoea developed while he increased his physical activity. However, the patient was not admitted to the hospital because of limited wards where only critically ill cases were allowed. Uncomplicated COVID‐19 patients are managed as outpatients.
