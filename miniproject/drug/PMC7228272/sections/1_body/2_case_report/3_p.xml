<p>The patient described that before the onset of fever, aching pain developed in his limbs on 19 January 2020. Considering the underlying bleeding disorder, human coagulation FVIII (Consipin, 400 IU) was administered as usual at home, but his myalgia complaint remained unchanged. The next day (20 January 2020), he felt fatigue and presented with repeated low‐grade fever with chills, recurrent vomiting and anorexia. The patient suspected that he might have infections with some bacteria, so he took oral amoxicillin and Chinese traditional medicines for 2 days on his own. However, his symptoms did not improve substantially. He disclosed that his mother developed fever and dry cough prior to his onset of symptoms and her condition had continued to worsen. The other family members also developed fever later except for his 3‐year‐old son. He decided to seek medical treatment because of suspicion of COVID‐19.</p>
