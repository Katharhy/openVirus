<p>This case report showed a recovery course of mild COVID‐19 with no bleeding events under active treatment at home with antiviral agents, empirical antibiotics and supportive therapies, which may be a good example in home management.

It seems that his haemophilia may not impact his ability to receive antimicrobial treatment. Haemophilia affects individuals lifelong.

In China, many have access to potent prescription drugs at home, resulting in a different regime at home than in the hospital. For example, as for discomfort with myalgia in limbs at the onset of COVID‐19 in this case, it would be more likely the occurrence of bleeding events because of the underlying bleeding disorder rather than infection of unknown cause. This case may benefit from the administration of FVIII at the onset of COVID‐19 that results in zero bleeding events. Moreover, home management with active monitoring is appropriate for mild infected cases with haemophilia when they are adequately isolated at home. Importantly, if clinical conditions deteriorate, the patient should promptly be hospitalized.
