<p id="p0125">In Canada, a prospective observational study of 38 adult and pediatric ICUs evaluated 168 critically ill patients infected with A(H1N1), of whom 136 patients (81.0%) required mechanical ventilation for a median duration of 12Â days. Additional lung rescue therapies included neuromuscular blockade (28% of patients), inhaled nitric oxide (13.7%), high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (11.9%), ECMO (4.2%), and prone positioning ventilation (3.0%).
