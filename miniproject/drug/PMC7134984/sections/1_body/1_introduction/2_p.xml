<p id="p0055">Although sometimes used interchangeably, the differences between the terms “outbreak,” “epidemic,” and “pandemic” are primarily ones of scale. 
 <italic>Outbreaks</italic> are local increases in disease incidence that may place strain on a single hospital or several hospitals in a region. In industrialized countries, the impact of outbreaks on critical care resources may be limited because of the availability of patient transfer to other facilities. 
 <italic>Epidemics</italic> are similar to outbreaks in that they refer to an often sudden increase in the rate of a disease in a geographic area, but the common usage of the word “epidemic” implies a larger geographic area than an outbreak, with a greater potential impact on health care resources. A 
 <italic>pandemic</italic> is an epidemic that affects multiple areas of the world; in the case of influenza, a pandemic is formally defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an epidemic occurring in at least 2 different nations in 2 different WHO regions.
