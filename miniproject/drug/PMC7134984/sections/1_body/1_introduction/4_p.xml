<p id="p0065">The sorts of infections most likely to require a disaster-level response for ICUs in industrialized settings are respiratory viruses, specifically influenza, although coronaviruses have produced similar sorts of outbreaks with SARS-CoV and the more recent Middle Eastern Respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Limitations in public health infrastructure in resource-constrained regions, such as reliable, clean water and vector control, may lead to epidemics of virulent but less-contagious pathogens such as cholera; natural disasters may directly cause or exacerbate such epidemics, as in Haiti following the January 2010 earthquake.</p>
