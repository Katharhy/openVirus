<p id="p0210">Although the practice of critical care is generally linked to the ICU as a location, critically ill patients may need to receive care outside of a traditional ICU in disaster settings. Considerations of infection prevention and the avoidance of cross-contamination may additionally dictate that infected patients be placed in a geographically separate location. In situations where there are inadequate numbers of individual rooms, patients with confirmed infections may be cohorted in common areas to reduce the risk of cross-contamination.
