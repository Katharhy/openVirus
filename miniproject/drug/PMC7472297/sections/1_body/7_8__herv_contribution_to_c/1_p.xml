<p>Potentially oncogenic properties of HERV at the genome level include non-allelic recombination of HERV sequences, which results in chromosomal rearrangements, and HERV LTR as an alternative promotor to cellular gene expression that contributes to tumorigenesis [

 <xref rid="B55-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], melanoma, Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, etc. [
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], where abnormal gene expression occurred due to HERV-induced translocation and/or LTR regulation. In addition, recent studies demonstrate that HERV-K(HML2) and HERV-H are concurrently expressed with pluripotent transcriptional factors NANOG, OCT-4, and SOX-2 in mesenchymal stem cells [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], while HERV-W has been detected in cancer-stem like colorectal cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. It has also been shown in melanoma cells that HERV-K(HML2) activation promotes phenotype-switching to obtain cancer stem-like features [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. It would be interesting to explore whether HERV contributes to the stemness or pluripotency in cancer stem cells in a similar way as in embryonic stem cells, i.e., through LTR and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) regulation, due to the common regulatory factors they share [
