<p>When the first clusters of AIDS epidemics were observed, at the beginning of the 1980s, the manifestations associated with immunodeficiency included Kaposi’s sarcoma, aggressive B cell lymphomas, and invasive cervical cancer. These malignancies were commonly found in AIDS patients and thus became the “AIDS-defining” cancers when observed in HIV-infected individuals [

In addition to AIDS-defining cancers, a number of other malignancies are known to be associated to HIV infection, even if non-AIDS-defining, showing an increased incidence among HIV patients. These HIV-associated cancers include lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, oropharyngeal cancers, and anal and genital cancers [

In most of these conditions, HIV does not have a direct transforming role, but the effects of its infection, especially on the host immune system, create a dysregulated environment triggering cancer development by both immunosuppression, which can aid in the immune evasion of oncoviruses and cancer cells, and chronic inflammation, which promotes cellular proliferation hence tumorigenesis [
