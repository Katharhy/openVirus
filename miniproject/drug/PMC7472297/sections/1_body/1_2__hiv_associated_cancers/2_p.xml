It is noteworthy that adolescents and young adults living with AIDS also have an increased risk of developing both AIDS-defining and non-AIDS-defining cancers compared to HIV-negative individuals of the same age, and their relatively low adherence to ARVs could aggravate the occurrence of malignancies [
