<p>Given the clear association between HIV infection and the increased incidence of human malignancies, a number of prevention and therapeutic strategies have been proposed. First of all, given that most HIV-associated tumors depend on co-infection with known oncoviruses, a significant cancer prevention clue is represented by the vaccinations available against the oncoviruses, such as HPV and HBV for cervical and hepatocellular cancers, respectively. Similarly, screening procedures are crucial for cancer prevention and early diagnosis, not only in HIV-infected patients but also in the general population. Another important action is the early diagnosis of HIV infection, allowing for the prompt initiation of effective ART before the drastic reduction of CD4+ T cell count. In fact, growing evidence suggests that early and uninterrupted ART can reduce the risk of cancer associated with HIV infection, restoring CD4+ T cell count and limiting oncovirusesâ€™ immune evasion [

Finally, the prevention of behavioral factors that increase HIV-associated cancer incidence, such as smoking for lung cancer or unprotected sex for sexually transmitted oncoviruses, can play an important role in reducing the incidence of these malignancies in HIV-infected individuals.
