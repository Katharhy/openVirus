<p>As mentioned earlier, HERVs are typically transcriptionally suppressed by DNA methylation in somatic cells [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and the activation of HERV sequences through the inhibition of methyl transferases may contribute to viral mimicry effect and/or enhanced expression of neoantigens that can be detected by host immune surveillance [
 <xref rid="B89-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. The idea of inhibiting DNA methylation represents a potential strategy to tackle cancers associated with HERV signatures. Indeed, upregulated HERV expression has been observed following treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) Guadecitabine (SGI-110) in hepatoma cells that are sensitive to its anti-tumor effect [
 <xref rid="B90-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. A similar observation was also found in ovarian cancer cells, in which a combination of the histone methyltransferase G9Ai and the DNMTi 5-aza-2â€™-deoxycytidine produced a synergistic anti-tumor effect that was associated with enhanced viral mimicry from the upregulated HERV expression [
 <xref rid="B90-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Indeed, the use of DNMTi has been demonstrated to trigger TLR3 and MAVS-associated dsRNA sensing pathways that accompanied ERV upregulation in ovarian cancer cells, and this higher viral defense signature expression also correlates with tumor sensitivity to immune checkpoint therapy, particularly with the addition of DNMTi [
 <xref rid="B91-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. These observations therefore support the use of DNMTi for cancers associated with HERV signatures and provide impetus to further explore their use in onco-immunotherapies.
