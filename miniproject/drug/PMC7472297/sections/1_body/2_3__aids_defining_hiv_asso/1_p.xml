<p>The first cancer historically connected to AIDS’ presence was Kaposi’s sarcoma, characterized by lesions on the skin and other organs, including oral mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, lungs, and bones [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Kaposi’s sarcoma is caused by human herpesvirus 8, also known as Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). KSHV does not require HIV infection to develop Kaposi’s sarcoma, but the immune dysregulation induced by HIV affects the immunologic control of KSHV and other oncoviruses found in HIV patients, sustaining carcinogenesis. Accordingly, the risk of Kaposi’s sarcoma in HIV patients is inversely related to their CD4+ T cell count, although a few patients with relatively high CD4+ T cell count still had persistent Kaposi’s sarcoma [

 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Of which, primary central nervous system lymphoma and plasmablastic lymphoma often consist of cells infected by Epstein Barr virus (EBV), while Burkitt’s lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma are mainly negative for EBV [

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The third and last AIDS-defining malignancy is invasive cervical cancer, whose risk is increased in HIV-infected women, being associated with age but not with CD4+ T cell count [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Overall, almost all cervical cancers arise from human papilloma virus (HPV) oncogenesis, and the concomitant presence of HIV may augment its incidence by affecting the host immune response and thus preventing the clearance of HPV infection [
