<p>In most tissues, HERVs are transcriptionally silenced by CpG methylation catalyzed by DNA methylase-1 [

 <xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], possibly suggesting their role in pathogenesis. Current literature suggests that HERV can be activated by a plethora of microenvironmental stimuli such as hormones, cytokines, epigenetic modifications or exogenous microorganisms [
