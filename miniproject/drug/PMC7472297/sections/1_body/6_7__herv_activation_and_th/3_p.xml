<p>In addition, it remains controversial whether the presence of HERV has a direct causative role or if it is simply a bystander effect of epigenetic changes, such as the hypomethylation of DNA and chromatin remodeling in the cancer cells, which could expose previously silent HERV LTRs [

As a result, the precise role of HERV in cancer development remains to be fully clarified, but several observations described below shed light to the evolving paradigm of HERV-cancer association.
