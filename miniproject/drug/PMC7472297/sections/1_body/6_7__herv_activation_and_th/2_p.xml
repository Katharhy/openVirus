<p>In the case of cancer, a considerable level of early investigation has been focused on the oncogenic properties of retroviruses. Many studies attempted to illustrate the role of HERV in cancer [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], as HERV elements and HERV-encoded proteins were found in a variety of cancers including melanoma, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatobiliary cancers, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and germ cell tumors [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. As such, HERV elements have been proposed to be potential biomarkers for cancers and could have an implication for therapeutic intervention [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Although the average expression of HERV appears quite homogenous among different types of cancers [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], it is noteworthy that in some studies the overexpression of HERV was not found. For instance, in the analysis performed by Rooney et al., little overexpression of the “tumor-specific” HERVs (ERVH−5, ERVH48−1, and ERVE−4 in the study) was found in glioma and thyroid cancer [
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In another study by Bergallo et al., while HERV-K 
 <italic>pol</italic> was overexpressed in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, the expression level was not significantly increased in those with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In contrast, Januszkiewicz-Lewandowska et al. demonstrated that HERV-K 
 <italic>env</italic> was overexpressed in AML but not ALL [
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In both studies, HERV-W 
 <italic>pol</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic> were not found to be associated with either AML or ALL [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. These examples suggest that HERV elements may not be overexpressed in all cancer types, and that different groups and different parts of HERV may be activated in specific malignancies.
