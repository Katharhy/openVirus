<p>In addition, HERVs play a role in the regulation of human gene expression in several aspects. HERV elements serve as crucial regulatory factors for the pluripotency in embryonic stem cells [

These observations highlight the importance of HERV as a subject of study to unravel the genetic evolution of various species, and more intriguingly, for deciphering the pathophysiological development of illnesses and even be potentially explored as therapeutic targets for the treatment of many present day diseases.
