<p>At the protein level, some Env proteins promote the tumorigenesis due to their ability to trigger cell-to-cell fusion, immunosuppression, and cell signaling pathways that are crucial for cancer development [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In the case of breast cancer, HERV-K Env protein plays an important role in tumorigenesis and metastasis through activating the Ras-ERK pathway [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Anti-HERV-K Env antibodies and Env-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells exhibited significant tumor-specific cytotoxicity and prevented metastasis in mouse xenograft models [
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In the case of melanoma, a HERV-K(HML6) Env spliced variant, HERV-K-Mel, was found to be targeted by cytotoxic T cells in melanoma patients [
 <xref rid="B62-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. HERV-K Env-specific CAR T cells similarly reduced tumor burden and metastasis in mouse xenograft models [
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Research in pancreatic cancer also demonstrated that HERV-K(HML2) Env regulates the Ras-ERK pathway, and knockdown of Env in vitro and in vivo reduced the growth of pancreatic cancer and metastasis [
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Finally, the 
 <italic>env</italic>-encoded H17 protein of HERV-H was found to induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumor cells and recruit immunoregulatory suppressor cells, suggesting its contributory role in tumor metastasis and immune escape [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. These findings support the role of HERV Env as a tumor-promoting antigen in various types of cancers. In addition, the two spliced variants encoded by HERV-K(HML2) 
 <italic>env</italic> gene, Rec and Np9 accessory proteins, may also play a role in transformation by binding to functional cellular proteins [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], such as the transcriptional repressor of the c-MYC proto-oncogene [
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], proteins involved in androgen receptor repression [
 <xref rid="B67-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], and the ligand of Numb protein X (LNX) [
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] involved in Notch signaling. Of note, the presence of a coding sequence for Rec putative protein has been recently reported also for HERV-K HML10 and HML6 groups [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="B71-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].
