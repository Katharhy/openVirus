<p>Since HERV elements are transcriptionally controlled in normal tissues, cancer environment can likely lead to their epigenetic dysregulation, possibly activating the expression of cancer-associated HERV proteins or transcripts forming double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that could induce immune activation. HERV-encoded antigens expressed in a variety of cancers are reported to be targeted by cytotoxic T cells. In vitro, cytotoxic T cells that target HERV-K(HML6)-encoded epitope effectively lyse melanoma cells [

 <sup>+</sup> T cells [

 <sup>+</sup> T cells against an RCC-specific HERV-E antigen were produced after the transplantation and led to disease regression [

For instance, HERV-K(HML2)-reactive antibodies were found in the sera of germ cell tumor patients and the decreased titer correlated with longer survival [
