<p>A great proportion of HIV-associated cancers affecting the oropharynx, genitals and anus are linked to HPV infection as well [

 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In fact, as mentioned for cervical cancer, HIV-infected individuals present immunosuppression that is linked to a higher risk to establish a chronic HPV infection and develop pre-malignant high-grade intraepithelial lesions [

 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. As for hepatocellular carcinoma, its etiological agent hepatitis virus B and C (HBV and HCV, respectively) are frequently transmitted with the same route of HIV, and thus often co-infect with HIV. This increases the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in HIV patients, with similar cancer progression in non-HIV-infected individuals with chronic viral hepatitis [

Concerning non-AIDS defining lymphomas associated to HIV infection, they are also often caused by the concomitant infection with transforming viruses, such as EBV and KSHV. Pharmacological therapy against HIV has not been able to reduce the incidence of Hodgkin lymphoma in infected individuals, but recent findings suggest that prolonged ART seems to reduce the associated risk [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Overall, besides a higher incidence of lymphomas, individuals infected with HIV tend to show extranodal and central nervous system involvement [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and elevated cancer-specific mortality [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] as compared to the general population. Lung cancer is another malignancy reported to have higher incidence in HIV-infected individuals than the uninfected population [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. There is a three-times increased risk in HIV-infected individuals, which depends in part on a high prevalence of smokers [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], but also on HIV-related factors such as elevated susceptibility to pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which contribute to a higher risk of lung malignancies [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The associated mortality, however, seems not to be linked to either HIV load or CD4+ T cell count [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In addition to the above HIV-associated tumors, the presence of the infection augments the risk of incidental cancers as well, including colon, breast, prostate, and squamous-cell skin cancers [
