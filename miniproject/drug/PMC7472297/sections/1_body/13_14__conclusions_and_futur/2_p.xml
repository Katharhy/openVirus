<p>With a better understanding of the link between HIV infection and HERVs, it is evident that HIV can alter HERV gene expression in specific cell types. This means that, in addition to the well-characterized increased risk for HIV-associated malignancies, HERV dysregulation by HIV infection can further prompt such a vicious cycle, providing possible oncogenes and oncoproteins absent in physiological conditions. As described above, recent investigations have pinpointed that ARVs, beside reducing the risk for HIV-associated cancers, can also affect HERV gene transcription and HERV-encoded protein function. These data have been exploited to use ARVs as an anti-cancer modality in controlling HERV activation in a cancerous condition. Further findings described here suggest that HERV elements may also be restrained by HERV-epitope-specific vaccination and by monoclonal antibody therapy, suggesting the need for the development of immunotherapy for rapidly evolving cancer types. Due to HERVsâ€™ background of retroviral origin and partial immune tolerance, these aliens inside us have become a potential target for future onco-immunotherapy. Understanding the role of HERV in cancer progression is analogously essential to building a steady approach to cancer management.</p>
