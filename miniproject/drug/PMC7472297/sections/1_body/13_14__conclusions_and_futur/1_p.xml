<p>Like other animal retroviruses, HTLV and HIV have the potential (either directly or indirectly) to promote oncogenesis, leading to the increased incidence of a variety of human cancers in the infected population (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00852-f001">Figure 1</xref>). In addition to this “traditional” scenario, HERVs are the age-old alien viruses residing in the human genome and exposing themselves in diverse human diseases. Increasing pieces of evidence indicate that the HERV gene expression is induced under specific physiological and pathological conditions. The exceptional depth at which cancer genomes are examined indicates that HERVs may have completely lost their direct tumor-causing ability due to insertional mutagenesis at the time of novel integration. Nevertheless, HERVs do still contribute to cancer pathology by distinct and often indirect mechanisms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00852-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Individual HERV members are selectively identified to possess tumor-associated properties that are significant in tumor carcinogenesis [
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, whether HERV is a causative agent or merely a consequence of the disease is still vague, since HERV activation or HERV-encoded protein expression at the disease microenvironment alone is insufficient to prove their pathogenic potency.
