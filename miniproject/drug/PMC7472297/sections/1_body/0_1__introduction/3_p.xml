<p>Viruses of the 
 <italic>Retroviridae</italic> family typically contain two copies of positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome at their core and are surrounded by host-derived lipid membrane inserted with the 
 <italic>env</italic> gene-encoded glycoproteins (e.g., gp160 in the case of HIV, which is processed to yield the surface gp120 and the transmembrane gp41 [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). The Env glycoproteins mediate the entry steps of HIV into the targeted host cells, whereas the viral enzymatic activities (reverse transcriptase (RT), RNase H, integrase (IN), and protease (PR)) encoded by the 
 <italic>pro-pol</italic> gene are crucial to viral replication [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Retroviruses are characterized by their ability to perform reverse transcription of their ssRNA genome and integrating them into the host chromosomal DNA [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. As such, ERVs are considered molecular remnants of ancient exogenous retroviruses resulted from their germ line infection and integration in vertebrate ancestors approximately over 100 million years ago [
