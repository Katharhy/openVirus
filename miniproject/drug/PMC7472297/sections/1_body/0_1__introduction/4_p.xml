<p>In this review, we have included in the first part the HIV–cancer relationship and the associated use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) to demonstrate the potential applications of ART as anti-cancer strategies relevant to retroviruses due the solid evidence in this field, whereas the second part focuses on the new implication of HERV and the development of novel anti-cancer strategies for HERV-associated cancer scenarios. Although HTLV is also an onco-retrovirus, evidence for treating HTLV-associated T cell leukemia with antiretroviral therapy remains limited. Currently, only the combination of interferon (IFN)-α and zidovudine showed some benefits in patients with T cell leukemia, and the underlying mechanism and the antiviral contribution of zidovudine require further investigation (as reviewed by Marino-Merlo et al. [
