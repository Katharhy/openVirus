<p>Of note, in addition to the above exogenous retroviruses, the DNA of all vertebrate contains endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), which are ancient traces of past infections found as viral footprints in the genome of the various species. The ones found in humans, the human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), represent as approximately 8% of the human genome and have been recently classified into 39 main groups [
