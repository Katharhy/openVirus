<p>This HERV-targeting approach could similarly be applied for cancer treatment, and the development of prophylactic vaccines against HERV-derived antigens has recently gained attention as a plausible strategy, although the possible use of HERV as the target for anti-cancer strategies is currently limited by the still incomplete knowledge of their role in the development and progression of the various human cancers. It has been demonstrated that HERV-derived epitopes are recognized, processed, and presented as targets for T cell immune recognition [

 <xref rid="B85-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] developed a recombinant vaccinia virus that expressed HERV-K(HML2) Env protein (MVA-HKenv) and tested it in a syngeneic mouse tumor model where HERV-K Env was expressed in the murine renal cancer cells (RLZ-HKenv cells). Intravenous injection of RLZ-HKenv cells in the BALB/c mice led to metastatic lung cancer. A single vaccination with MVA-HKenv drastically resolved the pulmonary tumor nodules, suggesting the efficacy of the vaccine. The vaccinated mice displayed cell-mediated cytotoxic immunity against RLZ-HKenv cells, which can be explained by T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis induced by the vaccine [

A similar strategy has also been employed through adenovirus-mediated delivery of murine melanoma-associated retrovirus (MelARV) proteins Gag and Env to form virus-like particles displaying the cancer-associated MelARV Env to the immune system in mice, which could stimulate T cell response to inhibit murine colorectal tumor growth [

Likewise, another group investigated the extent of vaccination protection in rhesus macaques against ERVs as means to target HIV- and cancer-associated endogenous retrotransposable elements. Sacha et al. immunized this primate model with Gag and Env proteins of simian endogenous retrovirus (SERV), which resulted in the polyfunctional T cell expansion and humoral immune response against both SERV-encoded proteins [
 <xref rid="B88-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. In addition, there were no toxicity and adverse pathological findings related to vaccination, suggesting that vaccination against ERVs can safely induce immune responses and is a potential strategy for the management of HERV-associated neoplasms. Nonetheless, in spite of the fact that HERV-derived epitope-based vaccination has established a potential outcome in preclinical animal models, clinical evaluation for the safety of such a vaccination approach is required to encourage further immunotherapeutic progression targeting HERV in cancer therapy.
