<p>Due to the potential contribution of HERV expression in certain diseases, it is theoretically feasible to target HERV expression via immunotherapies such as antibodies or vaccines. For example, studies have shown that some proteins encoded by individual HERV members are found in the active multiple sclerosis (MS) patients [

 <xref rid="B80-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Temelimab, also known as GNbAC1, is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody targeting the HERV-W Env protein that is associated with the pathogenesis of MS [

The therapeutic GNbAC1 antibody is designed to neutralize the impact of the HERV protein on inducing adverse pro-inflammatory responses associated with CNS inflammation and impaired remyelination. As such, neutralizing this HERV protein through GNbAC1 may elicit a desirable response against HERV-mediated pathophysiological mechanisms in MS disease progression.
