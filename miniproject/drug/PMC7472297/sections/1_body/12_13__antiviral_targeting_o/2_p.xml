<p>Richa et al. tested both nucleotide RT inhibitors (NtRTI) and non-nucleotide RT inhibitors (NNtRTI) against HERV-K(HML2) RT enzyme activity in vitro. NtRTIs including abacavir, tenofovir, lamivudine, and stavudine showed significant and dose-dependent inhibition, whereas NNtRTIs including efavirenz, etravirine, and nevirapine also showed a significant inhibitory effect. Both drug groups had similar doseâ€“response curves and IC
 <sub>90</sub> values [

To determine the effect of RT inhibitors on HML2 infectivity, the same group tested VSV-G pseudotyped HML2 infection in HeLa cells in the presence of RT inhibitors. RT inhibitors such as abacavir and zidovudine both exhibited an inhibitory effect on HML2 infection in a dose-dependent fashion [

RT activity was halted by the use of NNtRTIs, such as nevirapine and efavirenz, and RT-encoding LINE-1 elements were downregulated by RNA interference (RNAi). Reduced RT activity resulted in downsized cell proliferation, enhanced morphological differentiation, and renovated gene expression patterns in vitro. Moreover, the tumorigenic phenotype of prostate carcinoma cells in the xenograft nude mice model was attenuated by the pretreatment with RT inhibitors [

It suggests that the endogenous RT may have a pivotal role in epigenetic regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation and may serve as a novel target in cancer therapy. Alongside, the inhibitory potential of HIV protease and integrase inhibitors against HML2 has also been investigated. Protease inhibitors such as darunavir and lopinavir readily docked to the protease catalytic site, thereby inhibiting HML2 protease activity, while the integrase inhibitor raltegravir inhibited the VSV-G pseudotyped HML2 replication in a dose-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B97-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. This group also suggested that the replication of HML2 may be integration dependent, as the integrase inhibitor raltegravir showed a robust inhibitory effect against HML2 integrase [
