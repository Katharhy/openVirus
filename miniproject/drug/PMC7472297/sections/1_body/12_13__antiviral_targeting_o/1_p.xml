<p>Due to their similarity with HIV, it is theoretically possible to directly target HERVs through ARVs as an approach to defer their impact on disease progression. In the case of colorectal cancer, where HERV-H were found in almost 50% of samples [

 <xref rid="B57-viruses-12-00852" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], suggesting the need to justify the clinical impact of HERV-H blockade in colorectal cancer treatment. This points to potential usage of antiviral therapy targeting HERVs as a treatment strategy to manage cancers. There are no specific antiviral drugs developed to target HERVs so far; however, several studies began to screen FDA-approved ARVs, which may effectively inhibit HERVs due to their close association with HIV. Although initially antivirals targeting viral RT were explored, ARVs that can block all significant steps of the retroviral life cycle could be considered. This is also supported by the observation that HIV patients may have a lower risk of developing MS than the others, possibly due to the suppression of HERV by ART [
