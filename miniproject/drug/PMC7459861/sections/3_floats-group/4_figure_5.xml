  <p>Monthly temperature (degree C) reanalysis maps using ECMWF dataset of all the world. The temperatures at 2-m height, obtained from ERA-interim datasets (
   <uri xlink:href="https://climatereanalyzer.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://climatereanalyzer.org/</uri>), have been processed to extract monthly means maps for the period November 2019 to February 2020. ERA-interim is a global reanalysis of recorded climate observations over the past 3.5 decades. It is presented as a gridded data set at approximately 0.7 degrees spatial resolution and 37 atmospheric levels. ERA-interim is produced by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) (
