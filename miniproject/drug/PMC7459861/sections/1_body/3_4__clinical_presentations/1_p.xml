However, individuals who remain asymptomatic may also transmit the virus and cases infected by an asymptomatic individual in the prodrome period of COVID-19 have also been reported [

Asymptomatic infections can occur because of weakened immune responses and subclinical manifestations or also because the virus is waiting for opportunities to invade and reproduce. A recent study has shown that a viral load detected in an asymptomatic patient was just like to the one observed in symptomatic patients, indicating the capability of transmission in asymptomatic patients [
