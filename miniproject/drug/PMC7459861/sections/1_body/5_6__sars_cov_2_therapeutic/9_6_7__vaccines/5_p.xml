<p>Overall, a joint effort headed to apply both already consolidate and innovative approaches, such as AI to facilitate drug discovery, will be required to develop a broad-spectrum antiviral drugs and vaccines towards existing and potential future coronavirus infections to prevent another highly pathogenic virus epidemic. Moreover, continuous collaboration in basic and clinical studies will improve the discovery of new antiviral drugs with therapeutic potentials, decrease the time for drug release on the market and make them affordable for all countries. Furthermore, vaccine delivery strategies and cell-based therapies benefit from the significant progresses made by recombinant DNA technologies combined with emerging biotechnology and bioengineering methodologies. Thus, these approaches can speed up the development and set up of new vaccines and clinical therapies to fight against novel pathogens to protect public health all over the world.</p>
