<p>More recently, scientists from the University of Pittsburgh have announced a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, delivered throughout a fingertip-sized patch, capable of producing SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies, sufficient for virus neutralization in mice. This vaccine, called PittCoVacc (acronym of Pittsburgh coronavirus vaccine), is a trimeric recombinant SARS-CoV-2-S1 subunit vaccine delivered intracutaneously by microneedle arrays (MNAs) [
