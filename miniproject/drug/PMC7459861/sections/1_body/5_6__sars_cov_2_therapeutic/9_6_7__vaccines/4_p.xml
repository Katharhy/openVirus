<p>On April 24, the Oxford ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine was the first in Europe to start human trial stage, with 1110 healthy volunteers enrolled for the tests. Oxford scientists have already employed ChAdOx1 in the past to dispense vaccines against Ebola, Chikungunya, Rift Valley fever and, above all, MERS. ChAdOx1, a chimpanzee-derived adenovirus vector, has been employed to deliver the full-length MERS spike gene and shown to induce large amounts of neutralizing antibodies against MERS in a mouse model [

On April 30, the University of Oxford has announced a collaboration with the UK-based global biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca for further development, large-scale production and potential delivery of the COVID-19 vaccine candidate.

Since ChAdOx technology is already available and formerly tested in humans for other vaccines, Phase III will consist in administering vaccine to volunteers following them into their regular environments to ensure that these subjects actually become immune to the disease up to three years. If trials succeed, Oxford researchers have proposed to complete testing throughout ring vaccination, namely delivering vaccine to members of the first circle of contacts of COVID-19 positive people and then to evaluate if the virus spreads to the second circle, as was previously done during the 2018 Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
