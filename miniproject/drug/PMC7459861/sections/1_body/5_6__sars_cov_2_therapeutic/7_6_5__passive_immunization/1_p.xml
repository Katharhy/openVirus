<p>At the time of writing this review, due to the lack of a specific available therapy, plasma from convalescent patients containing specific antibodies has been proposed as a principal treatment [

 <xref rid="B191-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>], for patients in rapid disease progression, severe or critical conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05648-f008">Figure 8</xref>VI). In a recent retrospective study, one dose (200 mL) of convalescent plasma (CP) collected from 10 severe adult cases has been reported to be tolerated; thus, increasing or maintaining high level of neutralizing antibodies broke down the viral load in seven days, improve clinical symptoms and paraclinical criteria within three days and lung lesions were found to be differently absorbed on radiological examination within seven days [

Therefore, being CP a promising rescue option for severe COVID-19, several clinical trials (ChiCTR2000030010, ChiCTR2000030179, and ChiCTR2000030381) are in progress to investigate the efficacy and safeness of CP direct infusion in COVID-19 patients [

 <xref rid="B193-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>]. Pharmaceuticals companies are now focused on searching for specific and effective mAbs against COVID-19. Taking into account that technologies capable of making fully human antibodies such as human single-chain antibody variable fragments (Hu-scFvs) or humanized-nanobodies (single-domain antibodies, sdAb) able to overpass virus-infected cell membranes (trans bodies) and to interact or interpose with biologic processes required for virus replication are already available [
