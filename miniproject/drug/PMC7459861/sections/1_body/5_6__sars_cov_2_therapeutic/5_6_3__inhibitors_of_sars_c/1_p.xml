<p>A certain number of clinical trials on antiviral drugs aimed to arrest SARS-CoV-2 replication are currently in progress, such as Remdesivir (NCT04252664, NCT04257656) Favipiravir (ChiCTR2000029600, ChiCTR2000029544) and ASC09 (ChiCTR2000029603) (

In fact, a CRISPR/Cas13d technology, which is an RNA-guided RNA-targeting CRISPR system, has been employed to specifically chew up SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. In this system, a Cas13d protein and guide RNAs-containing spacer sequences are used to specifically complement the virus RNA genome (

Furthermore, RNA genome can be packaged into one adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector, making the CRISPR/Cas13d system more efficient for virus elimination and resistance prevention, taking into account that AAV has serotypes highly specific to the lung, the main organ infected by SARS-CoV-2 [
