<p>To date, several attempts have also been made in targeting viral main enzymes; in fact, many inhibitory drugs targeting the coronavirus main proteinase 3C-like protease (3CLpro) have been validated in clinical trials (e.g., Lopinavir/Ritonavir; ChiCTR2000029387, ChiCTR2000029468, ChiCTR2000029539) (

Moreover, a recent study by performing a virtual screening using a three-dimensional model of the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease (3CL), identified 16 biologic candidates that deserve further consideration. Among these, the antivirals Ledipasvir or Velpatasvir proved to be particularly attracting as therapeutics to combat the new coronavirus showing optimal anti-viral activity and minimal side effects, such as fatigue and headache; also, Epclusa (velpatasvir/sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) are promising antivirals, not only for their effective and synergic inhibitory activities against two viral enzymes, but also for their minimized possibilities to develop resistance [
