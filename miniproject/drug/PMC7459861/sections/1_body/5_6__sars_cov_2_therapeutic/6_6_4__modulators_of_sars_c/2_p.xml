<p>Apart from corticosteroids, IL-6 pathway inhibitors such as sarilumab, siltuximab and tocilizumab have been proposed as experimental approach considering the increased IL-6 levels that have been observed in patients with severe COVID-19 [

Tocilizumab is a recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibody commonly used for treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and psoriasis that binds to IL-6 receptors blocking FcR activation; in COVID-19 patients, Tocilizumab could reduce SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammatory responses [

In line, to further investigate the efficacy and safety of Tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19, a controlled clinical trial is now under way (ChiCTR2000029765) (
