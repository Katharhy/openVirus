<p>A large number of clinical trials regarding cell-based therapies have been started in China during COVID-19 outbreak. Among these, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)-based therapy displayed strong safety profile and possible efficacy in patients with ARDS, according to COVID-19-related clinical studies listed on the WHO’s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and National Institutes of Health’s clinical trials.gov databases [
 <xref rid="B195-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>]. Nevertheless, further investigations are required to better understand if these therapies could be effective in treating respiratory virus-induced complications. MSCs have been largely employed in basic research and clinical trials [

 <xref rid="B198-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>], and their safeness and effectiveness have been extensively documented especially in immune-mediated inflammatory disorders, such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) [
 <xref rid="B199-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>] and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [
 <xref rid="B200-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>]. MSCs immunomodulatory and differentiation abilities [
 <xref rid="B201-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>] as well as their competency to produce several cytokine types or to directly interact with immune cells have been already described [
 <xref rid="B202-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>]. Indeed, they are activated by pathogen-associated molecules (PAMPs) such as single or double-stranded RNAs [

 <xref rid="B204-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>], priming the immune response during infections. Two clinical investigations of systemic MSC administration in patients with either COVID-19 or avian influenza A (H7N9) have been recently published [

 <xref rid="B206-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. The first one, a single-center MSC transplantation pilot study, was aimed at exploring MSCs therapeutic potentiality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and conducted at the You’an Hospital in Beijing, China, from 23 Jan 2020 to 16 Feb 2020 (ChiCTR2000029990). Seven patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive, with different degrees of severity, including one critically ill requiring ICU care were enrolled and monitored for 14 days after MSC injection. A significant improvement of pulmonary function and symptoms were observed two days after MSC transplantation characterized by an increase of peripheral lymphocytes and of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels and a decrease of the C-reactive protein and TNF-α amounts [

 <sup>mid</sup> regulatory dendritic cell (DC) population and a decrease of cytokine-secreting immune cells such as CXCR3 + CD4 + T cells, CXCR3 + CD8 + T cells, and CXCR3 + NK were detected within 3–6 days in the treated patients compared to the placebo control group [
 <xref rid="B205-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>]. MSCs play a role in attenuating cytokine storm, most importantly, because these cells do not express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 viral receptors are insusceptible of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These observations are in agreement with the knowledge that MSCs induce the maturation of dendritic cells into a novel Jagged-2-dependent regulatory dendritic cell population [
 <xref rid="B207-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>], shifting the Th1/Th2 balance towards Th2. Thus, from these preliminary results, it seems evident that MSCs intravenous transplantation could represent a secure and effective treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially those critical. Indeed, it inhibits the over activation of the immune system and promotes endogenous repair by preventing pulmonary fibrosis and improving both pulmonary microenvironment and lung function [
