<p>Additional targetable epitopes that should be considered are the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and heptad repeat 2 (HR2) in SARS-CoV-2 S protein. In fact, the HR2-derived peptides (HR2P) and EK1 (a modified OC43-HR2P peptide), exhibit effective fusion inhibitory activity towards SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a promising strategy in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection, although further studies are required to strengthen these hypotheses (
