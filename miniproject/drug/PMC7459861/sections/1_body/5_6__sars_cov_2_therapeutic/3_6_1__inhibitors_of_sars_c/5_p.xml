<p>Reverse genetic strategies have been successfully used in live-attenuated vaccines to inactivate the exonuclease effects of non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) or to wipe out the envelope protein in SARS [
 <xref rid="B154-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. A recent study also revealed that the invasion process requires the priming of the S protein which is facilitated by the host cell produced serine protease TMPRSS211. The clinically demonstrated serine protease TMPRSS2 inhibitor Camostat mesylate, which partially blocks SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, was shown to be a good target to significantly reduce pulmonary infection in COVID-19 affected individuals (

Furthermore, other drugs such as arbidol (ChiCTR2000029621), a haemagglutinin inhibitor and chloroquine phosphate, a traditional antimalarial drug, have been added to the National Health Commission of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (NHC) guidelines for COVID-19 treatment (

 <xref rid="B173-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. Combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has also been suggested as a valid approach since it showed more rapid resolution of infection than hydroxychloroquine alone [
