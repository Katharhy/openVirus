<p>As outlined above, multiple strategies are aimed at developing CoVs vaccines, most of which are headed for the surface-exposed spike (S protein) glycoprotein as the major virusâ€“host cell membrane interactor. To this aim, vaccines under study are based on full-length S protein, S1-RBD, expression of virus-like particles (VLP), DNA or viral vectors [

As outlined above, the S1 includes the RBD that interacts with its host cell receptor, ACE2, whereas the S2 mediates fusion between the virus and host cell membranes promoting the entry and subsequent replication of the viral RNA into the cytoplasm [

The ACE2 receptor, as a specific biologic target for vaccine development, is under study in a controlled pilot clinical trial to investigate the effect of recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2; GSK2586881) in patients with severe COVID-19 (NCT04287686) (

Indeed, the first available SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody with neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV, named CR3022, was found to bind potently to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, in agreement with the high homology shared by this domain with SARS-CoV homolog [
