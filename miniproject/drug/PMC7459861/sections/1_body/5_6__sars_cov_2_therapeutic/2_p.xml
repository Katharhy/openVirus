<p>Most of the drugs that are being used to cope with COVID-19 epidemic are directed towards specific viral molecular targets and biologic processes through which the virus spreads damaging the host. In line, all available experimental therapies for COVID-19 management are based on previous experiences in treating SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, such as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 fusion/entry/replication, anti-viral agents against main viral proteases, regulators of SARS-CoV-2 induced host inflammatory response and direct administration of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (

Likewise, more prospective, rigorous population studies are urgently required to confirm the therapeutic effect as well as the safety of new potential therapeutic strategies in order to further implement robust preventive and control measures against SARS-CoV-2 spread.
