<p>Virologic as well as genetic studies have demonstrated that bats are reservoir hosts of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but also that they can use other species as intermediate hosts before spreading to humans [

 <xref rid="B60-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The detection of two genomes distinct from known swine in ill piglets were reported by two independent groups [

 <xref rid="B62-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The phylogenetic analyses showed that these novel swine enteric 
 <italic>Alphacoronaviruses</italic> (SeACoVs) were strongly related to the 
 <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> bat coronavirus HKU2 isolated in Guangdong Province, in southern China [

 <xref rid="B62-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. This suggests that coronaviruses of bat origin may have ‘jumped’ the barrier of the species to infect pigs as intermediate hosts. The CD26 receptor sequence alignment between humans and pigs demonstrates a 94.5% overlap, which is sufficient for the possible cross-species transmission [
 <xref rid="B63-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. It has also been documented that pigs are susceptible to human SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B64-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and MERS-CoV infections [
 <xref rid="B65-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The large number of mutations within the RBD enabled viruses to infect new hosts, representing a potential threat for both animal and human health. In southern China, the unique climate, the high density of domestic as well as wild pigs, along with the extensive bat distribution and carriage of tremendous quantities of recombinant novel coronaviruses may result in the appearance of more novel coronaviruses in the future [
 <xref rid="B66-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. It is generally acknowledged that numerous viruses have existed and were restricted to their natural reservoirs for lengthy times [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The consistent spillover of viruses from natural hosts to humans and other species is essentially related to human activities, including urbanization and modern agricultural practices, leading to the constant human exposure to the ever-changing mutant CoVs from their reservoirs [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The close contact between humans and animals and the practice of eating raw meat are both risk factors for causing a new human CoV outbreak [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Hence, COVID-19 should be considered as a zoonotic disease that spread from animals to humans.
