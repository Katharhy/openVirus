<p>Following the first SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan, secondary cases started to be identified after ten days. Although these new patients did not have any contact with the market, they had a history of contact with people who attended the market [

More recently, Forster et al., by using phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide mutations of 160 complete human SARS-CoV-2 genomes found that three variants of SARS-CoV-2 (A as the ancestral type, plus B and C) represent the bat outgroup coronaviruses. In particular, the A and C types were found mostly in European- American patients, whereas the B type was common in East Asia suggesting that this kind of analysis could help in following the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 [
