<p>It was demonstrated that SARS-CoVs have adapted themselves to bind to human ACE2 receptor and infect human cells effectively [

 <xref rid="B68-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Therefore, the human-to-human transmission that was seen in the course of the SARS-CoV outbreaks is directly attributable to the ability of SARS-CoVs to adapt their S protein to efficiently bind to human ACE2, thus infecting ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes [

 <xref rid="B69-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Similar to SARS-CoV, ACE2 is also used by SARS-CoV-2 as the entry receptor in the ACE2-expressing cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 has a life cycle similar to SARS-CoV [

As outlined before, SARS-CoV S protein regulates the receptor binding and membrane fusion activities determining host tropism and transmission capacity. Several evidences highlighted a higher binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to the ACE2 receptor. In particular, molecular and in silico analyses demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 RBD conformation and amino acid composition enhance the bonding between the S protein and ACE2 receptor [

 <xref rid="B71-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. A recent biophysical and structural analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein showed that it binds to ACE2 receptor with about 10- to 20-fold higher affinity than the S protein of SARS-CoV [

 <xref rid="B72-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. This high affinity could account for its extreme infectivity among human populations. Another feature of the powerful infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 is that the shedding pattern of viral particles in SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed patients is similar to that of influenza patients in which viral loads at the time of symptom onset are higher and gradually decrease within days; interestingly, this pattern seems to be different from that reported for SARS-CoV patients where the highest shedding is reported 10 days after the onset of symptoms [

 <xref rid="B74-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can spread more easily than SARS-CoV in the community even in the absence of symptoms or when only initial mild symptoms are present [
