<p>The human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 mainly occurs by inhalation of respiratory droplets spread by coughing or sneezing from an infected individual, but also by direct contact of contaminated surfaces and then touching the nose, mouth and eyes [

 <xref rid="B76-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,
 <xref rid="B77-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,
 <xref rid="B78-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The virus was shown to remain stable in favorable atmospheric conditions on different surfaces for days [
 <xref rid="B79-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Additionally, transmission in an unventilated environment or closed spaces due to high aerosol concentrations has been suggested [
 <xref rid="B76-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,
 <xref rid="B77-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. In agreement, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the surfaces of the houses of confirmed patients was reported, further strengthening this mode of contact transmission. Moreover, live viruses were also found in the stool of COVID-19 patients, as previously found for both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B77-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Given its capacity for survival in feces and the expression of ACE2 within intestine, it was demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can infect these tissues and can be released in feces; therefore, water supply contamination and fecal-oral route transmission is also hypothesized [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B80-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. However, at present, there have not been reported cases of fecal-oral transmission of the virus. Studies have also indicated that SARS-CoV-2 transmission via ocular surfaces should not be overlooked, as contaminated droplets and body fluids could easily infect the human conjunctival epithelium [
 <xref rid="B81-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 is also responsible for cluster transmission, in particular within family clusters [
 <xref rid="B77-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. In some cities, 50% to 80% of all reported cases of COVID-19 accounted for cluster transmission [
 <xref rid="B82-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Based on the current information, there is no evidence for transplacental transmission from infected pregnant women to their fetus, who underwent caesarean section [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B78-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Therefore, whether transmission during vaginal birth can occur remains to be established, neonatal COVID-19 disease as postnatal transmission was documented [
 <xref rid="B83-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Although, SARS-CoV-2 may definitely infect infants, it has been reported that neonates, infants and children develop significantly milder forms of the disease than their adult counterparts [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B84-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>].
