<p>The genome of HCoVs is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA (+ssRNA) (~26–32 kb) with 5′-cap structure and 3′-poly A tail, which is among the largest known RNA genomes [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The typical HCoVs gene order is 5′-replicase-S-E-M-N-3′, with numerous (6 to 11) open reading frames (ORFs) encoding accessory proteins scattered among the structural genes [
 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The first ORFs (ORF1a and 1b) comprise two-thirds (approximately 67%) of the genome length and encode 16 nonstructural polyproteins (nsps 1–16) and are directly translated from the genomic RNA [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. There is a −1 ribosomal frameshift between ORF1a and ORF1b, leading to the production of two large replicase polypeptides (pp): pp1a and pp1ab. These polypeptides are further processed by two virally encoded cysteine proteases, the papain-like protease (PLpro) and a 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) into 16 nsps [

 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. There are at least four structural proteins encoded by the coronaviral genome: a spike glycoprotein (S), an envelope protein (E), a membrane protein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N) with short untranslated regions at both termini, required to produce a structurally complete viral particle [
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The typical coronavirus virion structure and proteins are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05648-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The M protein is in higher quantities in comparison to any other proteins in the virus particle; with its three transmembrane domains, it shapes virions, promotes membrane curvature and binds to the nucleocapsid [

 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The N protein contains two domains, both of which can bind to nsp3 protein to help tether the genome to replication–transcription complex (RTC) and package viral RNA into the viral particle during viral assembly [
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The E protein is involved in virus assembly and virion release from host cells, while the S protein plays a vital role in attachment to host receptors, viral entry and determines host tropism [
 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Additionally, some coronaviruses, such as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, have a hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene between ORF1b and S [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This hemagglutinin, like the influenza homolog enzyme, binds to sialic acid on host cell-surface glycoproteins and possesses acetyl-esterase activity [
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Besides coronavirus-conserved genes, the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV genomes contain several specific accessory genes including ORF3a/b, 4a/b, ORF5, ORF6, ORF7a/b, ORF8a/b and 9b (

 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. All the structural and accessory proteins are translated from subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) generated during genome transcription/replication of CoVs [
