<p>Attachment, cell entry, translation of viral replicase, genome replication, translation of structural proteins and virion assembly and release are the phases of coronavirus replication cycle [

 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 bind to different host receptors to gain entry into host cells [

 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Viral entry is mediated by the transmembrane S glycoprotein that comprises two functional subunits (S1 and S2 subunits) responsible for receptor recognition and viral-host cell membranes fusion, respectively [

 <xref rid="B54-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. S1 receptor-binding domain (RBD) mediates binding to the cognate host cell receptor; however, the S2 domain mediates the fusion events, between viral envelope and host cell membrane [

 <xref rid="B57-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], as SARS-CoV, whereas MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) receptor (

 <xref rid="B58-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The fusion of the S protein to the plasma membrane of host cell generates a double membrane vesicle in the host cell, thereby allowing release of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm, followed by genome transcription [

 <xref rid="B54-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Upon entry into the cell, virus-specific RNA and proteins are synthesized, probably entirely in the cytoplasm. Translation starts with the expression of two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which undergo co-translational proteolytic processing into the proteins that form the replicase complex. This complex is used to transcribe a 3′-coterminal set of nested subgenomic mRNAs, as well as genomic RNA that have a common 5′ “leader” sequence derived from the 5′ end of the genome. New virions are assembled by budding into intracellular membranes of the pre-Golgi compartment and released through the cell secretory mechanisms [
