<p>CoVs can be isolated from different animal species, including birds, livestock and mammals such as camels, bats, masked palm civets, mice, dogs and cats [

 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Animal CoVs are known to cause acute diseases in several animals and could be responsible for economic losses in domestic animals or birds [

 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Domestic animals may play an important role as intermediate hosts that enable virus transmission from one species to humans [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The genera 
 <italic>Gamma</italic>- and 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic> infect birds, but some of them can also infect mammals [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These animal CoVs include transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)—and more recently—swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV). However, animal CoVs can also infect humans that can spread the infection through human-to-human transmission [

 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. On the other hand, 
 <italic>Alpha</italic>- and 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> infect only mammals and usually cause respiratory illness in humans; among these, strains 229E, OC43, HKU1 and NL63 are the most widespread infecting young children, infants as well as elderly individuals [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The high rates of mutation characterizing all RNA viruses [

 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the evolving nature of CoVs and the simplicity of transmission from one species to another are the most relevant features learned from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV previous outbreaks [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Importantly, most of 
 <italic>Alpha</italic>- and 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> were found only in bats, and many genetically diverse coronaviruses phylogenetically related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been discovered in diverse bat species worldwide [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, HCoVs such as SARS- and MERS-CoVs seem to have originated in bats by sequential mutations and recombination, including those occurring in the intermediate hosts, civets and raccoon dogs for SARS-CoV and camels in the case of MERS-CoV, finally acquiring the ability to infect humans [

 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Comparative genome studies published in recent papers strongly support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and that pangolins (Manis javanica) acted as intermediate mammalian hosts [
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05648-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Indeed, the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 showed more than 79% nucleotide identity with the sequence of SARS-CoV and 50% with MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The high degree of homology of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in several animal species can be considered as an additional evidence to support that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats [
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Based on findings from molecular studies, the ACE2 proteins of non-human primates, pigs, cats and ferrets closely resemble the human ACE2 receptor. Therefore, these species may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as has been shown for SARS-CoV. Although a recent study showed that neither pigs nor chickens are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 by intranasal or oculo-oronasal infections, more evidences are needed to exclude pigs as intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 [
