<p>Coronaviruses were not considered as highly pathogenic for humans before the beginning of the 21st century. Afterward, two highly pathogenic HCoVs, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), emerging from animal reservoirs, have led to global epidemics of deadly pneumonia in humans with high morbidity and mortality [

Compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be more readily transmitted from human-to-human, spreading to multiple continents and the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was declared on January 30, 2020 [

In this review, we will introduce the current knowledge on the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, emphasizing its characteristics and its genetic diversity from previous coronaviruses, with a brief comment on its epidemiology and pathogenesis. We also highlight the environmental factors involved in virus transmission. Knowledge about this novel coronavirus is rapidly evolving, and efforts must be implemented in order to protect the populations by reducing transmission and controlling the spread of this fatal disease.
