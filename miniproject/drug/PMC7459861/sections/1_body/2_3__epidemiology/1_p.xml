<p>Coronaviruses are responsible for 5â€“10% of acute respiratory illness while it has been estimated that 2% of the population is deemed as an asymptomatic carrier of these viruses. The first discovered HCoV was IBV that causes respiratory disease in human whereas, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause the common cold in humans [

 <xref rid="B91-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. The epicenter of infection was probably linked to a zoonotic pathogen being present in the seafood and exotic animal wholesale market [

The rapid increasing numbers and rate of fatalities indicated a second mode of transmission, from human-to-human, that allowed viral spreading primarily in other Asian countries such as South Korea and Iran followed by many countries such as Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Brazil and USA [

It is very intriguing to note that the SARS epidemic in southern China in 2002 and the current outbreak of COVID-19 had peaked in mid-February due to exposure to live animals sold in markets. Furthermore, similar to the SARS outbreak, this epidemic has occurred during the Spring Festival in China, as the most famous traditional countrywide festival in China, gathering nearly three billion people from different areas. These favorable conditions caused the wide transmission of this fatal pneumonia and severe difficulties for disease control and prevention of the epidemic [
