<p>The transmission of seasonal respiratory coronaviruses can be affected by several climate parameters such as temperature and humidity [

Therefore, understanding the relationship between weather and transmission of COVID-19 is the key to forecast the intensity and end time of this pandemic. To this regard, emerging evidence suggests that whether climate conditions may influence the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 by boosting the spread (much of the data have not been peer-reviewed yet). To date, COVID-19 has had a significant expansion in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) belt, given that it covers cities and populated areas; conversely, in the belt of the Southern Hemisphere (SH), which covers very low population and landless areas, COVID-19 has not been reported yet.
