<p>Based on climate and ERA-interim reanalysis dataset in NH belt from November 2019 to March 2020, we compared the average rate of humidity and temperature between five cities in European Countries with significant community transmission of COVID-19 versus five cities of North Africa which are expected to be less exposed to COVID-19. The information recorded by the meteorological stations has been used, since these are more accurate than satellite data [

 <xref rid="ijerph-17-05648-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the average amount of humidity is very close between European and African selected sites. The main reason is the proximity of these cities to the Mediterranean Sea coastline. In addition, the north wind, which blows from northern Europe to European cities (ECs), increases the humidity of these cities. Conversely, there are temperature differences between considered ECs and North African cities (
 <xref rid="ijerph-17-05648-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Thus, temperature and humidity should be considered parameters involved in the transmission of COVID-19. Up to know, few studies have investigated the association of temperature and humidity with COVID-19 incidence and death rates. The first meteorological study was done in 100 different Chinese cities each having more than 40 cases of COVID-19 in a 3-day period during the end of January [
 <xref rid="B98-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. This group showed that high temperature and humidity significantly reduces the transmission of COVID-19. Their results indicate that the increases of 1 °C in temperature and 1% in relative humidity lower R by 0.0225 and 0.0158, respectively [
 <xref rid="B98-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. A preprint study on confirmed COVID-19 cases collected from 429 cities showed that every 1 °C increase in the minimum temperature of higher-temperature cities reduced the disease incidence and death rates by 0.86 [
 <xref rid="B99-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Another preprint study suggested that the average increase of 1 °C in temperature correlates negatively with the predicted number of cases worldwide [
 <xref rid="B100-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. These results are in accordance with Wu Y et al. who showed that among all confirmed COVID-19 new cases and new deaths from 166 countries (excluding China), a 1 °C increase in temperature is associated with a 3.08% reduction in daily new cases and a 1.19% reduction in daily new deaths, whereas a 1% increase in relative humidity was associated with a 0.85% reduction in daily new cases and a 0.51% reduction in daily new deaths [
 <xref rid="B101-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. A recent study conducted in Italy showed a positive correlation of SARS-CoV-2 spreading and weather conditions including temperatures ranging 4–12 °C and relative humidity of 60–80% [
 <xref rid="B102-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. In a geographic and population modeling study conducted in five largest cities in Colombia, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be comodulated by temperature and humidity. Their observation revealed a strong reduction of transmission in climates with temperatures above 30 °C and relative humidity below 78% which may comodulate the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 within respiratory droplets [
