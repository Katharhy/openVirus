<p>Overall, these meteorological analyses support that the combination of temperature and humidity could represent a direct influence on the transmission of the COVID-19. It can be assumed that the arrival of summer and rainy season in the NH can effectively reduce the transmission of the COVID-19. The distribution of COVID-19 across different longitudes and latitudes with a range of temperatures and humidity may help to predict the prevalence of this disease in terms of environmental characteristics. This could lead to a better understanding of how the virus spreads around the world (

It should be noted that apart from the capability of SARS-CoV-2 to persist on environmental surfaces under favorable atmospheric conditions, the duration of its persistence may be affected by temperature and humidity. However, caution is needed when considering the implications of these findings, which may be subject to confounding. Although warmer climates may slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, relying on weather changes alone to slow the transmission of COVID-19 are unlikely to be enough. However, using this type of dataset and climate analysis modeling is possible to identify areas that are most likely to be at risk of significant COVID-19 cases in the future and serve as an alarm signal to various government departments and agencies to adopt the necessary measures to prevent virus spread [
