<p>COVID-19 clinical evaluation is focused mainly on epidemiological data, clinical symptoms and clinical and laboratory tests. Although the scenario is continually changing, several approaches were selected as standard laboratory methods for COVID-19 diagnosis. Lab tests, differently from clinical-based analyses, immediately reveal SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. This was particularly important for diagnosis due to the difficulties in detecting specific clinical signs and symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, atypical manifestations revealed by pulmonary imaging [

Lastly, the analysis of personal history of each patient played a fundamental role in COVID-19 diagnosis and up to now is considered one of the key information for detecting infected patients also in the early phases of infection. Therefore, the epidemiological history together with clinical and laboratory tests are all required for the diagnosis of COVID-19. A detailed description focused on clinical diagnostic methods was reviewed by Taisheng Li [
