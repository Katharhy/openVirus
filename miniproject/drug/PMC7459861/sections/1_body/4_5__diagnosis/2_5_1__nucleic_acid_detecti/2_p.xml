<p>Overall, the WHO summarized all the primer pairs and probes that can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical specimens with the description of RT-PCR settings and the specificity. Apart from the possibility to perform the RT-PCR in house using the selected primer pairs and probes, several ready to use kits were developed for RT-PCR performing. One of the most used is the Allplex 2019-nCoV (Seegene, Seoul, South Korea) which includes three different viral targets and a positive control [

Another example is represented by the BGI’s real-time fluorescent RT-PCR Kit for detecting SARS-CoV-2 that includes one SARS-CoV-2 specific target and an internal control of the reaction (BGI, Cambridge, MA, USA). Both companies declared a sensibility of 100–150 viral copies per mL and a high specificity that excludes most respiratory tract viral and bacterial pathogens. The recommended samples for both in-house and ready-to-use RT-PCR kits include upper and lower respiratory specimens such as throat, nasal nasopharyngeal (NP) and/or oropharyngeal (OP) swabs, lower respiratory tract aspirates, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate or nasal aspirate. It was observed that samples of the lower respiratory tract provide the higher viral loads [

One of the most important is related to the sensibility because it was extensively reported that in the presence of low viral load this technique fails in detecting viral genome leading to false negative results [

Due to this problem, clinical governance as well as kit troubleshooting indicate to retest all the samples showing only single positive target along with patient resampling. To this respect, it should be underlined that operator skills or sampling sources can profoundly affect RT-PCR testing results [

Finally, during this pandemic several microbiologic labs worldwide are experiencing scarce availability of RNA extraction as well as ready-to-use RT-PCR kits increasing the timing of diagnosis confirmation through molecular approaches. Very recently, it was reported that the Allplex 2019-nCoV and the RealStar SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR kits can amplify the target genes bypassing the RNA extraction step for a faster diagnosis [
