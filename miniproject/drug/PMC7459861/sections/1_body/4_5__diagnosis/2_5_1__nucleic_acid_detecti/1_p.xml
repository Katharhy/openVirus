<p>High-throughput sequencing and real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) are the best nucleic acid detection techniques for SARS-CoV-2. However, in clinical diagnosis, the application of high-throughput sequencing technology is limited due to high cost and its equipment dependency [

 <xref rid="B121-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Moreover, to speed up the development of standardized analytic kits for diagnostic application, the quantification of viral load was not considered. Therefore, the RT-PCR method was chosen as the gold standard for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections from the commonly used samples such as naso- and oropharyngeal swabs [

 <xref rid="B122-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. This molecular method relies on the amplification of up to three SARS-CoV-2 specific targets including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (

 <italic>E</italic> and 
 <italic>N</italic> genes [

Three of those protocols are mentioned below. The US centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) developed an RT-PCR that includes three sets of oligonucleotide primers and probes recognizing three regions of the virus 
 <italic>N</italic> gene (named N1, N2 and N3) and an additional primer/probe set to detect the human 
 <italic>RNase P</italic> gene (RP) representing an internal control for RNA extraction and retro-transcription. Moreover, the positive control consisting in retro-transcribed viral RNA is also available at CDC. To report the positivity for SARS-CoV-2 two out of three N regions must be positive. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) recommends the use of specific primers and probes targeting the ORF1ab and 
 <italic>N</italic> gene regions for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR [
