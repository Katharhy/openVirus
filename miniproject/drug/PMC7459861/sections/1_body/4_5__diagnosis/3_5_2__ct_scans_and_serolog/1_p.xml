<p>Although RT-PCR is specific for the diagnosis of COVID-19, its false-negative rate cannot be overlooked due to the severe consequences of missed diagnosis. Clinicians have demonstrated the usefulness of CT and chest radiography for the diagnosis of COVID-19 associated pneumonia [
 <xref rid="B128-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. Moreover, the ability of radiologists to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia from chest CT evaluations has been reported to be very high [
 <xref rid="B129-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Then a combination between RT-PCR and CT imaging represents the best approach for the correct COVID-19 diagnosis. In particular, for early detection and assessment of disease severity, the high-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest is considered necessary [
 <xref rid="B130-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>,
 <xref rid="B131-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. One study analyzed the consistency and diagnostic value of RT-PCR test compared with chest CT in 1014 patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Findings indicated that the chest CT sensitivity in suspected patients was 75% based on negative RT-PCR results and 97% based on positive RT-PCR results [
 <xref rid="B132-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. Moreover, Salehi et al. confirmed the higher sensibility of pulmonary imaging with respect to RT-PCR for COVID-19 diagnosis and showed a positive correlation between specific CT findings with the different stages of the disease and its severity [
 <xref rid="B116-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. The collection of numerous CT images has opened the possibility to build a database of pulmonary images from COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, the recent progress in integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with computer-aided design (CAD) software for diagnostic imaging revealed that AI could be used to support disease diagnosis [

 <xref rid="B134-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Ito et al. reviewed the literature on the use of AI for lung diagnostic imaging of COVID-19 patients. Among the 15 selected studies, 11 used AI for CT and 4 used AI for chest radiography. The number of datasets ranged from 106 to 5941, with sensitivities ranging from 67–100% and specificities ranging from 81–100% for prediction of COVID-19 pneumonia. This study revealed the usefulness of AI approach to support the diagnosis of COVID-19, but also for future emerging diseases [
 <xref rid="B134-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. All the collected knowledge on lung lesions revealed some characteristic CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia: the pulmonary ground-glass opacities in a peripheral distribution and the consolidation referring to an increase in pulmonary parenchymal density [
 <xref rid="B135-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>,
 <xref rid="B136-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>,
 <xref rid="B137-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. However, chest CT manifestations can vary in different patients and stages of infection, highlighting certain shortcomings of this approach. Apart from atypical manifestation that cannot be recognized by radiologists, several lung images are common in viral pneumonia leading to misdiagnosis [
 <xref rid="B138-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Soon after the beginning of SARS-CoV-2 spreading, infected patients underwent antibody research for both basic research and clinical applications. One of the first studies reported the seroconversion of 100% of infected patients (
 <italic>n</italic> = 285) within 19 days after symptom onset. Seroconversion for IgM and IgG occurred simultaneously or sequentially and both immunoglobulins titers plateaued within 6 days after seroconversion. Importantly, the application of serology testing in surveillance in a cluster of 164 close contacts of COVID-19 patients identified 4.6% of positive patients showing negative RT-PCR results [
 <xref rid="B139-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. Hence, several studies underlined the recommended usage of serology to promote the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections where NP swab specimens were improperly collected, molecular assays were unsatisfactorily carried out and for determining asymptomatic infections [
 <xref rid="B122-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Based on these data, several companies developed kits for IgM/IgG testing showing a high detection rate of infected patients. Basically, there are two different testing methods: the rapid IgG-IgM test and the classical enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based test. The rapid test consists in a lateral flow qualitative immunoassay on a strip to detect the presence of both anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgM and anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG in human specimens such as whole blood, serum and plasma. This IgG-and IgM-combined antibody test kit has a sensitivity of 88.66% and specificity of 90.63%. Results are obtained in 15 min leading to its useful application as point-of-care testing and in supporting RT-PCR-based diagnostic [
 <xref rid="B140-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. On the other hand, several ELISA-based kits are now commercially available, and their sensitivity and specificity were compared showing an overall high specificity, but a variable sensibility [
 <xref rid="B141-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Differently from the rapid tests, the ELISA-based test should be performed on serum or plasma samples collected from venous sampling. Interestingly, the authors showed the neutralizing capacity of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies on Caco-2 cells directly incubating the sera from patients with the cell monolayers [
 <xref rid="B141-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. This assay is extremely important for the plasma-based therapies that are successfully used to treat seriously ill patients (see below). Finally, recently published papers described the seroconversion of COVID-19 patients including the evaluation of IgA that seems high in the early stages of infection (about 4 days’ post symptom development) [
 <xref rid="B142-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>,
 <xref rid="B143-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. Another interesting application of antibody detection is represented by the fluorescence immuno-chromatographic assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in human specimens such as NP swab [
 <xref rid="B144-ijerph-17-05648" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. It shows the fastness of rapid tests (results in 10 min), the possibility to use the same type of sample that is commonly used for RT-PCR-based diagnosis and high sensibility (detection of the nucleoprotein in all positive samples tested). Although these methods were suggested for COVID-19 diagnosis, the extent of antibodies production by infected patients is greatly variable. Moreover, the delay of antibodies production with respect to the onset of symptoms affects the use of this approach for diagnosis. Vice versa, it is reported that several governments, included Italy, are using serologic test for population screening to assess the proportion of people that have developed an immunological response against SARS-CoV-2 (
