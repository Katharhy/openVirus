<p>Since there is an approved serine protease inhibitor that could be used to block TMPRSS2, it is possible that this could be used to treat COVID-19. Another potential alternative could be to saturate the airways with recombinant ACE2 or soluble ACE2 so that viral particles are “mopped up” leaving bronchial pulmonary ACE2 intact. Treatment with recombinant human ACE2 could have the added beneficial effect of protecting the lung against lung injury.</p>
