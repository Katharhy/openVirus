<p>To summarize; the data described above demonstrate that there could be a problem in treating coronavirus infections. While it is most advisable to prevent viral infection and reduce the viral load, prevention of coronavirus-associated lung and cardiac injury saves lives. The dual role of ACE2 as a receptor for the virus in the lungs and heart but a “protector” of the lungs and heart from coronavirus-induced injury has led to debate concerning the use of anti-hypertensive drugs that inhibit the RAS because they upregulate ACE2 in the lung, increase receptor availability and therefore may increase viral load.</p>
