<p>There is no doubt, however, that Ang II-acting via the AT
 <sub>1</sub>R causes acute lung injury and probably cardiac injury when the ACE2-Angâ€“(1-7)-Mas receptor pathway is blocked by downregulation of ACE2. This pathway also protects from other forms of acute lung injury as well as SARS-CoV induced injury. ARBs would prevent downregulation of this pathway once infection has occurred and ameliorate any unopposed pro-inflammatory effects of Ang II mediated via its AT
 <sub>1</sub>R. ACEIs on the other hand may not upregulate ACE2 but would prevent Ang II-induced inhibition of ACE2 activity.
