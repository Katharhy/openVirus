<p>The major problem facing treatment of coronavirus-induced lung and probably cardiac injury is that there is reduced ACE2 caused by the virus binding to ACE2. This means that Ang II is no longer metabolized by ACE2, and the anti-inflammatory Angâ€“(1-7) pathway is lost. Thus, lung and cardiac Ang II-AT
 <sub>1</sub>R pro-inflammatory pathways are activated and unopposed by the protective arm of the RAS. As suggested by Kuba et al. (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), ARBs are an appropriate adjunct therapy for treating coronavirus-induced lung injury. Recent analysis of clinical data from patients with COVID-19 support the use of RAS blocking drugs in the treatment of this infection (
