<p>Recently, a SARS-CoV-2 infected patient presented with acute heart failure a week after experiencing “flu-like symptoms” and was diagnosed with acute myocarditis without any interstitial pneumonitis (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). It is known that SARS binds to myocardial ACE2 and downregulates myocardial ACE2 protein (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The protective effects of ACE2 in the heart are well-described (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) and it is the major metabolic pathway for breakdown of Ang II in the heart (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). ACE2 protects the heart from Ang II-AT
 <sub>1</sub>R signaling induced injury (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).
