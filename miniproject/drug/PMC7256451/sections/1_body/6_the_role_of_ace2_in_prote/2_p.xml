<p>We suggest that pulmonary ACE2 plays a critical role in protecting the lung from Ang II-AT
 <sub>1</sub>R induced inflammation because not only is there a local pulmonary RAS but the lung is also the major site for conversion of Ang I (which is inactive) to Ang II (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Therefore, loss of ACE2, by binding of SARS-CoV-2, not only exposes the pulmonary epithelium to locally formed Ang II but also to Ang II formed in the lung from circulating Ang I.
