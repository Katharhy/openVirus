<p>ACE2 protects the lung from acute lung injury because it reduces levels of Ang II by converting it to Angâ€“(1-7). In 2005, Imai et al. (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) showed that ACE2 played a critical role in the prevention of lung injury. Briefly, they induced acute lung injury in mice by sepsis, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin or by acid aspiration. These treatments all caused severe lung inflammation in 
 <italic>ACE2</italic>-/- knockout mice, which was mitigated by intraperitoneal injections of recombinant human ACE2 (

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) not only showed that ACE2 was the definitive receptor for SARS-CoV, but that loss of ACE2 from the lung caused by the binding of viral spike protein was responsible for the acute lung injury caused by coronavirus infections. They also showed, as would be expected from the known actions of ACE2, that this viral infection was associated with raised Ang II levels, which caused acute lung injury via the Ang II-AT
 <sub>1</sub>R pathway. Treatment with the ARB, losartan, prevented SARS-CoV-induced lung injury (
