  <p>ARBs cause a rise in Ang II levels. This increase in Ang II results from blocking Ang II's effects on blood pressure and sodium and water balance and indirectly causing positive feedback on renin release. High levels of Ang II will result in increased conversion of Ang II to Ang–(1-7) by ACE2 and increased interaction of Ang II with the AT
   <sub>2</sub>R. This means that not only are the pro-inflammatory effects of Ang II-AT
   <sub>1</sub>R prevented but the anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the ACE2-Ang–(1-7)-MasR axis are enhanced and Ang II-AT
   <sub>2</sub>R's anti-inflammatory effects are also sustained. As well, it has been shown in the heart that ARBs cause upregulation of ACE2 because they prevent Ang II-AT
   <sub>1</sub>R mediated reductions in ACE2 activity (

  <p>ACEIs block the formation of Ang II, so there is no associated enhancement of any anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the ACE2-Ang–(1-7)-MasR axis and the AT
   <sub>2</sub>R nor would there be up-regulation of ACE2. There is only withdrawal of Ang II-AT
   <sub>1</sub>R's pro-inflammatory actions.
