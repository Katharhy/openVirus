 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref> shows two sites of action of drugs that block the activity of the RAS mediated by the interaction of Ang II with the AT
 <sub>1</sub>R. One of the two classes of drugs commonly used in clinical practice, blocks the activity of the RAS by blocking the formation of Ang II; it inhibits the activity of ACE. ACE is a Zn containing carboxypeptidase that removes a dipeptide from the C-terminal end of the decapeptide, Ang I, thus generating the active peptide responsible for most actions of the RAS, Ang II. Drugs that block this enzyme are known as ACE inhibitors (ACEIs). They have no direct effect on the activity of ACE2, except by limiting the amount of Ang II that is produced.
