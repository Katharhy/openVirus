<p>Zhang et al. in a clinical study of 140 patients found that hypertension and diabetes were the two most common comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 (

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Of the 15% that had hypertension, and 7.4% that had diabetes, 13.1 and 6.1% (respectively), of these patients reached the composite end-point. It should be noted that hypertension and diabetes are very common comorbidities, no other co-existing disorders were as prevalent in this cohort.
