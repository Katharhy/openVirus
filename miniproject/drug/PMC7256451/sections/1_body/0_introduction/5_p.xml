<p>SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both enter the cell by binding to ACE2 (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), as does HCoV-NL63 (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). HCoV-NL63, like SARS-CoV-2, can cause mild respiratory infections, but most commonly affects the young (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). It has, however, been associated with bronchiolitis and croup but does not cause the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The differences in the severity of illness caused by these two viruses could be related to a differing affinity of the viruses to ACE2 (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) or the fact that entry of HCoV-NL63 into cells requires intracellular acidification while SARS-CoV entry can occur independent of intracellular acidification (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). MERS-CoV binds to a different receptor, Dipeptidyldipeptidase4 (DPP4) (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), and another human coronavirus, HCoV-229E, uses aminopeptidase N (APN) as its receptor (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). These receptors are membrane-bound proteases, and all can affect the production or metabolism of angiotensin peptides (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).
