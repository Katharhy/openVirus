<p>There has been considerable debate about the use of drugs that block the RAS in the treatment of hypertensive patients who have COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). This debate has not adequately considered the roles of local pulmonary and circulating RASs in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Put simply, ACE2, the receptor for entry of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, also activates a RAS pathway that prevents acute lung injury (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). These ‘Ying' and ‘Yang' actions of ACE2 have caused an apparent dilemma concerning the use of RAS blocking drugs in the treatment of hypertension and diabetes. This is because while they upregulate the SARS-CoV-2 receptor (ACE2) (a means for viral entry into cells), they also protect tissues from the pro-inflammatory actions of Ang II and could be an effective therapeutic strategy to manage COVID-19 induced lung injury [see also (
