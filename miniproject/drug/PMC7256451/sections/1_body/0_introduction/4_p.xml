<p>Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that have in recent years caused epidemics of acute respiratory syndromes. The first major epidemic was SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)-CoV in 2003 which was responsible for 8,000 deaths; the second was MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), which occurred in 2012. The most recent is SARS-CoV-2 which causes COVID-19. It was first recognized in China in December 2019 and is now sweeping the world. SARS-CoV-2 is already responsible for more cases of infection and also more deaths than the two previous coronavirus epidemics. There are also a number of other coronaviruses that cause upper respiratory tract infections, in particular HCoV-NL63.</p>
