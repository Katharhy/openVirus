<p>The Ang II-AT
 <sub>1</sub>R axis is well-known because it is responsible for hypertension; it raises blood pressure both through actions in the brain on the sympathetic nervous system, and in peripheral blood vessels causing vasoconstriction. This axis also controls sodium reabsorption partly through its own actions in the kidney but also because it stimulates the release of the sodium retaining hormone, aldosterone, from the adrenal gland.
