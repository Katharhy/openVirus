 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> shows the major arms of the RAS that are involved in the pathogenesis of coronavirus-induced acute lung injury. We have avoided including a number of other RAS pathways involved in the metabolism of Ang II for simplicity. A more thorough description of these pathways can be obtained elsewhere (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). As seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, there are two major pathways involved in the pathogenesis of coronavirus-induced infections. Both pathways involve the formation of Ang II from Ang I, a peptide produced by the action of renin on angiotensinogen. The octapeptide, Ang II, is formed by the action of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) on Ang I. Ang II can bind to two receptors, the AT
 <sub>1</sub>R and the AT
 <sub>2</sub>R, or it can be broken down by number of proteases to smaller peptides that have a variety of biological actions.
