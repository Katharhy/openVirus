<p>There are other actions of this pathway that are pro-inflammatory, and which stimulate fibrosis. The ACE2-Ang–(1-7)-MasR pathway on the other hand lowers blood pressure, possibly through production of nitric oxide. Furthermore, the ACE2-Ang–(1-7)-MasR pathway is anti-inflammatory. Thus, ACE2 not only breaks down Ang II but also produces a vasodilator anti-inflammatory molecule, Ang–(1-7) (
