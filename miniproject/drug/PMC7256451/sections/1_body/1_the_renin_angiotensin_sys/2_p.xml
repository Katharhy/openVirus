<p>The most important pathway for Ang II break down is via the removal of one amino acid from its C-terminus by a zinc-dependent carboxy peptidase, ACE2, to generate the peptide, Ang–(1-7), which acts on another receptor known as the MasR. There are other pathways that can also generate Ang–(1-7) (

 <sub>1</sub>R) and ACE2-Ang–(1-7)-MasR have opposing actions. In addition, Ang II can act via the AT
 <sub>2</sub>R to produce effects similar to those generated by the ACE2-Ang (1-7)-MasR pathway (
