<p>The spike (S) protein on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) mediates receptor recognition and membrane fusion. The spike protein is trimeric and, on fusion, separates into S1 and S2 subunits. S1 contains the receptor binding domain that directly binds to the catalytic site of ACE2. When this occurs a cleavage site on the S2 protein develops which is acted on by host proteases resulting in membrane fusion (
