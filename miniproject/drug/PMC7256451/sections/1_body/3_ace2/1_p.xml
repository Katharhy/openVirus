<p>The gene for ACE2 is located on Xp22 and contains 18 exons, many of which are similar to the ACE gene. It is a Zn carboxypeptidase with only one catalytic site, and it has 40% homology with ACE. It is an ectoenzyme with its N-terminus and catalytic site facing the extracellular space so it can metabolize circulating peptides (
