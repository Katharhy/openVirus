<p>ACE2 levels vary with age, being highest in young animals and lowest in older animals, levels in older males and females being 78 and 67% lower, respectively (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). This suggests that young people are more likely to get the SARS coronavirus infection than older people, as appears to be the case. On the other hand, decreased production of ACE2 in the elderly could be one reason why coronaviruses cause more serious complications in older persons. It has to be said however, that there has not been a systematic study of the relationships between age and ACE2 expression in human tissues and, as explained below, there may be species specific differences. In the lungs (

 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), and the kidney, ACE2 (
