<p>Binding of the SARS-CoV spike protein to ACE2 results in reduced ACE2 protein levels (

 <italic>ACE2</italic>-/- knockout mice did not get infected with SARS-CoV and did not get acute lung inflammation (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Thus, it would appear that low levels of pulmonary ACE2 protect against coronavirus infection. There is however a sinister side effect to the loss of pulmonary ACE2 because it plays a critical role in preventing acute lung injury.
