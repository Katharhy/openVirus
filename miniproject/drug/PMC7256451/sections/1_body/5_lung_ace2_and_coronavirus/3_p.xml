<p>Xie et al. suggest that there is a greater prevalence of SARS-CoV in young people because they have higher ACE2 levels (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Yet there is a paradox, because if young people, like other mammals, have high levels of pulmonary ACE2, they should be more susceptible to symptomatic infection with coronaviruses. The prevalence of infection is however based on the appearance of symptoms and in the young, the disease is usually so mild that infection rates appear to be low. In fact, the milder nature of the disease in the young compared to the old could be a consequence of the age-dependent nature of ACE2 expression in the lung (see above). On the other hand it is possible that the animal data on ACE2 expression and age is misleading as some human studies have shown that the older the patient the higher the level of circulating ACE2 (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). As stated above, there is no systematic study exploring the effects of age on ACE2 expression by human tissues. The differences between animal-based studies and human data may well be related to the short life span of animals used and the fact that they are housed in environments that protect them from infections and pollution etc.
