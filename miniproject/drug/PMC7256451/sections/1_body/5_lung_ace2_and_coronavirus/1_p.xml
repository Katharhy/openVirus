<p>Lung ACE2 is the receptor for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The spike (S) protein binds to ACE2 and enters the cell where it is modified by a serine protease (TMPRSS2). This protease is essential for cell entry of the virus (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The binding of coronaviruses to ACE2 and the modification of its spike protein by TMPRSS2 are essential for infection.
