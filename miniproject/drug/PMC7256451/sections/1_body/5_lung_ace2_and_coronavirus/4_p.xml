<p>It has also been claimed that ARBs stimulate the expression of ACE2 in the lung and that this accounts for a higher morbidity in hypertensive patients suffering from COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). As stated above, there is no evidence that ARBs have this effect on pulmonary ACE2, but ARBs upregulate cardiac ACE2. Ang II levels are likely to be elevated in patients treated with an ARB. As Ang II is the major substrate from which ACE2 produces Ang–(1-7) (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), it might be expected that high levels of Ang II would upregulate ACE2. However, Ang II and Ang–(1-7) have counter regulatory actions on ACE2 expression via MAP kinase/phosphatase pathways (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Furthermore, Ang II downregulates ACE2 activity in cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Therefore, the overall effects of ARBs on pulmonary ACE2 could be modified by counteracting the effects of Ang–(1-7).
