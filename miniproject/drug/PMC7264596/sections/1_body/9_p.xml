<p>An additional intriguing therapeutic possibility will be to suppress the cytokine storm that results from the host inflammatory response to the virus. The release of cytokines appears to play a central role in pulmonary edema, inflammation, and respiratory failure associated with COVID‐19 
 <xref rid="onco13337-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>. Although evidence is preliminary, IL‐6 may be a key component of the cytokine storm: anecdotal observations of beneficial responses in patients treated with anti‐IL‐6 receptor antibodies support this notion. Two IL‐6 antibodies (tocilizumab from Hoffman‐La Roche and sarilumab from Sanofi) are currently approved for rheumatoid arthritis and have anecdotal efficacy in treating side effects of cancer immunotherapy. Multiple trials of anti‐IL‐6 receptor antibody in ventilator‐dependent COVID‐19 infection are under way. An inhibitor of the JAK2‐STAT pathway (ruxolitinib, Novartis), currently used against myelofibrosis, also blocks cytokine production and will be tested. A more detailed understanding of the role of cytokines in lung injury would be invaluable, and additional immune system targets will likely emerge from this research.
