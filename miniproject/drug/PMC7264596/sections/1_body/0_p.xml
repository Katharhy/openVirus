<p>The U.S. health system and governmental structures are stressed to their limit, trying to cope with the devastating effects of COVID‐19 on patients, on our community and family relationships, and on our national economy. In the absence of a vaccine or effective antivirals, social distancing is currently the primary public health strategy for containing the epidemic and has been successful in South Korea and China, where it was stringently employed. In the U.S., it has been applied too late and in patchwork fashion on a national level, allowing the virus to spread broadly. Home isolation and social distancing measures inevitably impede our ability as physicians to care for patients with non‐COVID‐19 illness. There is a very real prospect of COVID‐19 recurring in epidemic scale among those not immune to the virus. What are the prospects for dealing with this virus more effectively in the future?</p>
