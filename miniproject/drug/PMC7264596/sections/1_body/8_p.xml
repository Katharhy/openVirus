 <xref rid="onco13337-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> describes the relatively potent antiviral activity of berta‐D‐N4 hydroxycytidine against SARS‐CoV‐2 in human epithelial airway cultures. In vivo studies against the MERS and SARS viruses (but not against SARS‐CoV‐2) showed partial protection against lung injury, but the effect was dependent on early drug administration after inoculation of the virus. The study lacks pharmacokinetic data to assure that the drug reaches and maintains significant antiviral concentrations in mice. Notably, the research lacks a suitable animal model for SARS‐CoV‐2 antiviral testing, but testing against monkey models may be possible in the near future
