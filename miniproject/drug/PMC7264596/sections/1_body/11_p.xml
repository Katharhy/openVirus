<p>In conclusion, from the perspective of long‐term control of coronavirus infection, both vaccines and antivirals will be necessary to avoid the death and destruction imposed by the current epidemic. Vastly improved preparedness, early deployment of viral testing, and quarantine of infected individuals will help limit the spread of the next wave of coronavirus infection. However, vaccine development and its worldwide implementation, coupled with effective antiviral treatment, will be required to control COVID‐19 and prevent another pandemic. In order to be ready for the next iteration of COVID‐19, the worldwide medical community will need to cooperate in conducting extensive clinical trials of vaccines, antivirals, and immune therapies on an accelerated time scale. Sadly, but necessarily, this worldwide effort will divert resources from other areas of medical research, including cancer research, for the foreseeable future, but we have no choice.</p>
