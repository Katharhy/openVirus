<p>Regarding the chances of creating an effective vaccine against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, in the U.S. the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) of the Department of Health and Human Services is devoting significant support for two currently approved trials: a lipid nanoparticle vaccine that contains mRNAs directing the synthesis of the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein (Moderna) and an adenovirus construct of virus material co‐supported by Johnson &amp; Johnson

The Wellcome Trust and Gates Foundation have implemented an international effort, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), to select and promote the development of three promising vaccines, with the intent to achieve worldwide distribution of an effective agent in the next year 
 <xref rid="onco13337-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>. Multiple other approaches to vaccine development are in play, including the use of DNA and mRNA vectors, as well as viral proteins and peptide epitopes, delivered in different formulations and with different adjuvants. Proving efficacy and safety in large‐scale randomized trials is the critical step that determines failure or success, and all of this will take many months, if not 1–2 years.
