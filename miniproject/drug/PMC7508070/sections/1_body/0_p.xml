<p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which originated from Wuhan in China, has spread to almost 200 countries across the globe. As the pandemic is ravaging across the world, the health workers are desperately trying to contain the spread, while trying to manage the existing cases. The disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (Severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]-CoV2), has a high rate of transmission mainly through fomites and aerosols.[
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The virus gets released as an aerosol during coughing and sneezing settles on surfaces. Subsequently, it is transmitted from contaminated hands to mouth, nose, and eyes, these being the leading portals of entry and exit. SARS-CoV2 has been detected in tear secretions by a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in a recent study.[
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] One of the earlier studies claimed a very low incidence of conjunctivitis in patients with COVID-19 infection. However, a recent study from China reports that almost 31.6% of patients with COVID-19 had ocular involvement. It was also interesting to note that 91.7% of the patients with COVID-19-related conjunctivitis tested positive on a nasopharyngeal swab.[
