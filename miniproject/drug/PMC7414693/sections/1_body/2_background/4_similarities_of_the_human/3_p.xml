In the early years of the HIV epidemic, there was no effective ART, whereas, in the OUD epidemic, there is effective therapy but few are accessing it. The reasons include lack of insurance provisions in non-Medicaid expansion states for SUD treatment; prior authorization requirements to prescribe buprenorphine, or making it mandatory to provide behavioral treatment in order to receive MOUD; Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) 2000 X-waiver mandatory training, which has been identified as burdensome and inadequate as well as placing limitations on the number of persons who can be prescribed buprenorphine; lack of same-day billing for an OUD treatment and other potential associated medical conditions that might require patients to come back another time and expose them to on-going opioid use and thus increased risk of overdose death or acquisition of infectious diseases; inadequate training of medical professionals and lack of providers to take on treatment; lack of harm reduction expansion services or of federal funding for syringes; and stigma in the general community and across the medical community.
