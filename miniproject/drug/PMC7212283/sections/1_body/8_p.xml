<p id="p0050">Since ACE2 receptors are seen in the hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, it is not surprising that the liver is also involved with COVID-19 infection, as there may be an upregulation of ACE2 receptors in the presence of this viral infection.

 </xref> Interestingly, cholestatic pattern is rarely seen with this infection and most reports suggest that alkaline phosphatase is normal. The cytokine storm and ischemic hypoxic reperfusion also may a place role in those with severe hepatocellular damage. Underlying liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis B could have contributed to elevated liver enzyme abnormalities as most of these studies are reported from China, which has a high prevalence of hepatitis B. Further characterization of liver injury and its independent role in mortality will be defined in future studies. Until then, physicians need to be cautious when using experimental drugs in these patients as many of these drugs are likely to eliminated by the liver.
