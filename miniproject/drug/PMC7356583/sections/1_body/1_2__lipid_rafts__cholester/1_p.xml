<p>In order to further characterise the underlying mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and CVD, it is important to understand the interaction of the virus with the host cell. Coronavirus is a single-stranded, positive sense RNA virus with a lipid envelope. The virus has four structural proteins: the nucleocapsid protein, membrane protein, envelope protein, and the spike protein (S glycoprotein), which mediates attachment to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [

 <xref rid="B11-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Lipid rafts are subdomains of the plasma membrane enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids, which have been shown to play an important role in viral entry into host cells [

 <xref rid="B14-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] showed that ACE2 was largely co-localized with the raft marker caveolin-1 and GM1, and that ACE2 was shifted to the non-raft environment after depletion of cholesterol. In addition, lipid rafts also contain caveolins, clathrins, and dynamin, which may be as important as cholesterol in the process of viral entry [
