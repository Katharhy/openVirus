<p>The apparent effects of COVID-19 at exacerbating cardiac injury, inflammation, and plaque activity have resulted in the hypotheses that drugs reducing all these unfavourable outcomes might be effective resources for COVID-19 management [

In this context, the pleiotropic effects of statins (beneficial effects beyond cholesterol-lowering) include anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antithrombotic properties, which, importantly, can be observed before lipid-lowering is evident [

 <xref rid="B31-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It has been shown that statin therapy promotes regression and stabilisation of vulnerable plaques, and the effect seems to be dose dependent [

 <xref rid="B33-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This suggests that COVID-19 patients with baseline CVD, being at very high or extremely high cardiovascular risk, require optimal intensive statin therapy with maximally tolerated doses in order to promote plaque stability [
