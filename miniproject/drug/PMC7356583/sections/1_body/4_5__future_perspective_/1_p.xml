<p>Further investigation is needed on the role of cholesterol and use of statins amongst patients with COVID-19 infections. The safety and availability of statins makes it worthwhile to consider whether such host-response modulating drugs may promote a milder clinical infection if initiated early in the disease process. We also should keep in mind the possible occurrence of muscle symptoms during the course of COVID-19. While myalgias are easily attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection in statin untreated patients, their differential diagnosis may be cumbersome in COVID-19 patients receiving statins. Current guidelines for the management of statin intolerance may help to guide clinical decisions, with the recommendation for patients at higher CV risk to continue statin therapy unless absolutely contraindicated [
