  <title>Pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2</title>
  <p>(A) SARS-CoV-2 utilizes a spike (S) protein on its surface in order to bind to ACE2 receptors on the surface of human alveolar epithelial cells. The S protein is divided into two domains, S1 and S2, which are responsible for receptor binding and cell membrane fusion, respectively. The S1 domain contains the RBD, which has the specific ACE2 receptor affinity. (B) Human secretory proteases, such as TMPRSS2 and furin, localize to virally-target cells. (C) These proteases enhance viral entry into host cells through the proteolysis of both the S1, S2, and ACE2 proteins (S1/S2 priming and ACE2 down-regulation). The renin-angiotensin system has a crucial role in acute lung injury and ACE2 serves a protective role against that lung injury. ACE2 downregulation therefore contributes to the severity of illness [
