<p>The first multicenter randomized control (RECOVERY) trial was launched in March 2020 in an effort to explore more of the potential benefits of corticosteroids in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 [

Preliminary analysis of 6,425 patients (2,104 from the dexamethasone arm and 4,321 from the control arm) revealed statistically significant reductions in 28-day mortality among patients within the treatment arm. This effect seems to be influenced by the patient’s baseline SARS-CoV-2 severity. Patients on mechanical ventilation or receiving supplemental oxygenation saw reductions in 28-day mortality, meanwhile patients not on oxygen therapy at enrollment saw no reduction. While this trial serves as the basis for the NIH’s recommendation for the use dexamethasone in SARS-CoV-2 patients who require ventilator or supplementary oxygen support, the results should still be interpreted with caution as they are preliminary [
