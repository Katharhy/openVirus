<p>On August 23, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the use of convalescent plasma in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, stating that the “potential benefits outweigh the potential risks” (press release. Gupta S, Gumbrecht J, Fox M. US FDA announces emergency authorization for convalescent plasma to treat Covid-19, August 23, 2020). However, more robust evidence is needed before any statement on its true efficacy can be stated. Current guidelines do not recommend either for or against the use of convalescent plasma in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 [

Convalescent plasma utilizes the principle of passive immunity in that individuals who have generated an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 may donate their antibodies to individuals in an effort to suppress the viral inflammatory response. Several small case-series have reported clinical efficacy and minimal adverse events; however, the evidence remains inconclusive [

Results from a randomized clinical trial revealed that there was no clinical or mortality benefit observed among patients with severe or life-threatening SARS-CoV-2 who were treated with convalescent plasma. However, this trial was terminated early and therefore the sample was insufficient to determine subtle clinical differences among the treatment arms [

In addition, a safety analysis conducted on 20,000 patients who received convalescent plasma through the National Extended Access Program revealed that although adverse events were uncommon (&lt;1%), they did include transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), allergic reactions, and death [
