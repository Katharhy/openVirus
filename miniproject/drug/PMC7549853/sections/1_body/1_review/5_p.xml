<p>The S protein is divided into an S1 domain and an S2 domain, which are responsible for receptor binding and cell membrane fusion, respectively [

 <xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The S1 domain is what contains the RBD, which has specific receptor affinity. In prior coronavirus outbreaks, SARS-CoV-1 targeted the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, whereas MERS-CoV utilized the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor [
