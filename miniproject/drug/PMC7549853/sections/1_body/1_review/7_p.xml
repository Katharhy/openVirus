<p>The proteolysis of ACE2 not only promotes viral entry but also seems to be a key mechanism for the severity of lung disease [
 <xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The renin-angiotensin system has a crucial role in acute lung injury in that the ACE2 receptor has a protective role against acute lung failure [
 <xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. ACE2 is therefore a key negative regulatory factor for severity of lung disease and thus its downregulation contributes to the severity of illness [
