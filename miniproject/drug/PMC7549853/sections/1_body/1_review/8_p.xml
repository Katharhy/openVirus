<p>Like TMPRSS2, furin is also responsible for the cleavage “priming” of SARS-CoV-2 surface receptors. Researchers have identified a furin cleavage site in the S2 domain of SARS-CoV-2, thus suggesting that S2 priming serves a role in the pathogenesis [

However, it is present among more genetically-distant coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV, suggesting a possible convergent evolutionary pathway between the two. Furthermore, the high expression of furin in human lungs may help to explain why SARS-CoV-2 has more efficiently spread throughout the population in comparison to SARS-CoV-1 [
