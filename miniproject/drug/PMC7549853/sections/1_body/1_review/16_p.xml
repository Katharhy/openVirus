<p>Interestingly, several studies have found that in contrast to other forms of ARDS, some patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS may present with normal lung compliance, and thus a high PEEP in these individuals may subject them to barotrauma or reduced cardiac output [

One study characterized the stages of SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS as “type L” and “type H”. “Type L” occurs soon after the onset of respiratory distress and the patient’s lungs retain their normal lung compliance, whereas “type H” occurs after progression of the patient’s ARDS, resulting in clinical deterioration and lower lung compliance. Therefore, the study suggests that it may be helpful to adjust the ventilatory approach based on the patients underlying stage and physiology [
