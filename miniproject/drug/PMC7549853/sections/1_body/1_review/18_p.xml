<p>Prone positioning improves oxygenation and outcomes in intubated patients with ARDS due to improved ventilation-perfusion matching and alveolar recruitment [

Several case series examining its efficacy have found improvements in oxygen saturation and respiratory rates in patients who can adjust their position independently and tolerate lying prone [
