<p>Current guidelines recommend that patients on standard oxygen supplementation with refractory hypoxia should be trialed on high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) over non-invasive positive-pressure ventilatory (NIPPV) strategies, such as bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), as long as there is no urgent need for intubation [

 <xref rid="REF27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This recommendation stems from the increased risk of aerosol generation and subsequent viral transmission associated with NIPPV. However, if HFNC is not available, then a trial of NIPPV is warranted [
