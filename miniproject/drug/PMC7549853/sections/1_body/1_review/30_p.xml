<p>Current guidelines recommend against the use of high-dose chloroquine (600 mg BID for 10 days) or hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Chloroquine and its analog hydroxychloroquine have historically been used to treat malaria and certain autoimmune conditions. However, it has been postulated that they may interfere with viral-cell fusion of SARS-CoV-2 through the increase of endosomal pH. In addition, their immune-modulating effects may control the cytokine storm that occurs in critically ill patients. High in vitro potency has been demonstrated; however, concerns for their safety profile exist, specifically cardiotoxic effects (prolonged QTc) [
