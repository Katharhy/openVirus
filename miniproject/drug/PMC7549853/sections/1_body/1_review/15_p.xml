<p>Currently, there is no strong evidence to suggest that ventilator management of patients suffering from ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 should differ from standard ARDS management of patients with other viral pneumonias. This strategy includes low tidal volume (4-8 mL/kg of predicted body weight) and high positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEPs) [

Due to the poor lung compliance seen with advanced stage SARS-CoV-2 ARDS, patients require a high PEEP in order to improve overall lung recruitment and oxygenation. The panel suggests that the PEEP be individualized for the patient, with the clinician monitoring the patient’s response as well as for signs of hypotension or barotrauma [
