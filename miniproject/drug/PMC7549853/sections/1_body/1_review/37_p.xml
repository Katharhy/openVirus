<p>The incidence of thrombotic disease in individuals affected by SARS-CoV-2 is reported as high as 31% [
 <xref rid="REF50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The precise mechanism behind this pro-coagulable state associated with SARS-CoV-2 is poorly understood. Current guidelines suggest that hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 should receive the same prophylaxis against arterial thrombosis or venous thromboembolism as per the SOC of other hospitalized individuals. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 who do experience a thrombotic evident should be managed with anticoagulation therapy as per SOC as well [

Despite the link between SARS-CoV-2 and thromboembolic events, little evidence demonstrating the benefits of using therapeutic dosages of anticoagulants in patients with SARS-CoV-2 exists. One retrospective analysis of 2,773 patients treated either with or without systemic anticoagulation found no difference in overall mortality among the two groups; however, subgroup analysis of ventilated patients did show potential mortality benefit [
