<p>Thus far, the safety and efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 have been evaluated through a number of small clinical trials, case series, and observational studies. Studies on chloroquine have shown minimal efficacy in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and increased mortality when taking the high-dose regimen (600 mg BID for 10 days) [

One study found that hydroxychloroquine was more likely to be given to patients who were more severely ill at baseline (i.e. older, underlying comorbidities) and therefore could not be determined whether hydroxychloroquine administration resulted in an increased or reduced risk of death/intubation [

 <xref rid="REF45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Given these safety concerns as well as the lack of robust evidence to support their use, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 [
