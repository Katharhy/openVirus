<p>In addition, various human secretory proteases, such as transmembrane protease/serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2) and furin, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of coronaviruses [

 <xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Human secretory proteases are responsible for the cleavage “priming” of various viral surface receptors and adhesion molecules and thereby enhancing viral fusion with host cell membranes. In both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, TMPSSS2 has the ability to localize to viral-targeted cells and enhance entry through the proteolysis of both the S1 and ACE2 proteins, which enhances membrane fusion and viral uptake (S1 priming and ACE2 downregulation) [
