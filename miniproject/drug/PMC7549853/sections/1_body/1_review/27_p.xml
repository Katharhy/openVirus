<p>The NIH’s ACTT trial is a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among hospitalized adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 who had an SpO
 <sub>2</sub> of &lt;94%, or required supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or ECMO [
 <xref rid="REF40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Over 1,000 patients were enrolled, of which half received IV remdesivir (one day of 200 mg followed by nine days of 100 mg). Preliminary results indicated a significant reduction in time to recovery among the treatment arm (11 vs 15 days). Subgroup analysis revealed that this benefit was greatest among hospitalized patients with an oxygen requirement or SpO
 <sub>2</sub> &lt; 94%. No benefit was observed among patients with no oxygen requirement or SpO
 <sub>2</sub> &gt; 94%, or those receiving mechanical ventilation and ECMO [

However, given uncertainties in this study’s ability to detect differences in the subgroups, there is question as to whether remdesivir does confer a benefit among mechanically ventilated patients. Nevertheless, these uncertainties along with supply chain limitations with remdesivir have led toward a prioritization in its use for patients in whom efficacy has been demonstrated and those on supplemental oxygen [
