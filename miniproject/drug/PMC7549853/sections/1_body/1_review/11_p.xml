<p>Interestingly, the pediatric population is at a lower risk of severe complications and more likely to be asymptomatic or have milder symptoms [

 <xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. When compared to adults, children reported symptoms such as fever and cough at lower frequencies and were much less likely to have severe/critical disease (5.9% vs. 18.5%) [

 <xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, when stratified among age groups, 10.6% of children aged &lt;1 year were severe/critical, indicating that although children manifest in a milder form overall, it varies depending on the age group [
 <xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It is hypothesized that children have these milder pulmonary disease manifestations due to decreased gene expression of ACE2 receptors on respiratory epithelial cells [
