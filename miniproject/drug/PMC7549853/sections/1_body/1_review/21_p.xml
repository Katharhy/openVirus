<p>Corticosteroid use in critically-ill patients suffering from ARDS is a topic that has been abundantly covered in the literature [
 <xref rid="REF32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>-
 <xref rid="REF34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Several multi-center randomized control trials have shown that the early introduction of dexamethasone or methylprednisolone to patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS can reduce both mechanical ventilation and overall mortality with comparable adverse effects [

 <xref rid="REF34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, their impact on patient survival varied greatly depending on the duration of ARDS prior to treatment initiation with corticosteroids. For example, patients receiving corticosteroids greater than 14 days after the onset of ARDS saw no benefit in mortality reduction [

Despite the strong evidence supporting its use in early ARDS, corticosteroid use for the treatment of viral infections has been a controversial due to concerns for possibly delayed viral clearance and subsequent increase in illness duration and poor outcomes.
