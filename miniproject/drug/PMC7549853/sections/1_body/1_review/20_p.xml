<p>Current guidelines recommend the use of dexamethasone (6 mg/day for 10 days) in patients with SARS-CoV-2 who require supplemental oxygen and/or mechanical ventilation; however, it is not currently recommended for patients off supplemental oxygenÂ [

It is therefore presumed that the potent anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroid therapy may help to mitigate or prevent these viral complications.
