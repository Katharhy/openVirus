<p>Current guidelines recommend against the use of non-SARS-CoV-2 IV immunoglobulins (IVIG) [
 <xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. There are currently no published studies demonstrating the efficacy of non-SARS-CoV-2 IVIG. The panel has recommended against this therapy given that it is unlikely that the plasma of donors without confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection contain high titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Additionally, it is unknown if the theoretical immunomodulatory benefits of this therapy outweigh the risks. As for SARS-CoV-2 specific IV immunoglobulins, there is currently no available data on its use in treatment, and therefore there is not a recommendation for or against its use [
