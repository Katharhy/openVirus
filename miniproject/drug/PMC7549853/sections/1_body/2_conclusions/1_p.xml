<p>This review provides a concise summary of relevant literature on the pathogenesis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Information on this topic is changing rapidly, but the authors believe that this review serves as an accurate representation of the current state of knowledge on these topics. Patients with persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure on conventional oxygen supplementation should be treated with HFNC over NIPPV. Both types of NIPPV (CPAP and BiPAP) are acceptable strategies to treat SARS-CoV-2 for short-term life-threatening respiratory conditions if HFNC is unavailable and there is no urgent need for intubation. If required, endotracheal intubation should be administered by health care providers with extensive airway management experience. Both dexamethasone and remdesivir have demonstrated positive early results in clinical trials. Dexamethasone should be trialed in patients who require supplemental oxygen and/or mechanical ventilation; however, it is not currently recommended for patients off supplemental oxygen. Additionally, remdesivir should be prioritized for hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients who are on supplemental oxygen but do not require high-flow oxygen, noninvasive, or invasive ventilation. Dexamethasone seems to have a greater benefit in patients with more severe pulmonary disease (in need of supplemental oxygen), whereas remdesivir seems to help stop the virus from replicating; however, it doesnâ€™t seem as beneficial for some severely ill patients who are suffering from massive inflammation. Thus, the medical community is racing to find the perfect treatment combination against SARS-CoV-2 by blending remdesivir with other drugs to reduce inflammation. Lastly, it has been proposed that convalescent plasma may be beneficial for SARS-CoV-2, and studies are currently underway to evaluate its use for both treatment and prophylaxis of certain high-risk patients. Despite the recent EUA, a lot is still unknown and larger studies are needed.</p>
