<p>For example, we should be testing the ability of senolytics (drugs that preferentially kill senescent cells) as a way to mitigate the cytokine storm that is widely believed to be at the core of why frail older adults are more susceptible to serious outcomes including death. Senescent cells accumulate in people as a consequence of age and disease, and they secrete multiple cytokines (the so‐called senescent‐associated secretory phenotype [SASP])
 <xref rid="jgs16489-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> that cause inflammation, activating resident macrophages and other elements of the innate immune response. As a result, when a virus or other acute insult activates this already alert innate immune system, a deadly cytokine storm might occur. Preliminary data in mice and other models indicate that killing senescent cells with these senolytic drugs alleviates the problem.
 <xref rid="jgs16489-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> This needs to be tested immediately in animal models challenged with COVID‐19, and shortly, in controlled clinical trials in patients. It is important to emphasize that senolytics do not directly target the mechanism of pathogenesis of this (or any other) virus, or even the immune system. They target the aging process itself. However, it is possible that attenuating the nonspecific cytokine storm exacerbated in frail older adults affords time for the patient to develop a better and stronger antigen‐specific immune response to COVID‐19 or other pathogens.
