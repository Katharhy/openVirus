<p>Other geroscience approaches currently under consideration include inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway of nutrient sensing.
 <xref rid="jgs16489-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> Inhibition of this pathway with a combination of everolimus (a derivative of rapamycin) and RTB101 (a catalytic site mTOR inhibitor), was shown to be effective in increasing antibody titers against influenza vaccination.
 <xref rid="jgs16489-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> In phase 2 trials in adults 65 years of age and older, RTB101 upregulated pan‐antiviral gene expression, decreased the levels of inflammatory cytokines, and decreased the incidence and severity of laboratory‐confirmed viral respiratory tract infections including coronavirus infections. Although a recent large phase 3 trial of RTB101 failed to reach its primary end point, that point was not the incidence or severity of viral respiratory tract infections. Importantly, both everolimus and RTB101 have been shown to be well tolerated in older adults at the doses and frequency used in these studies. Again, the approach here is not either to attack this specific virus or to boost the immune system by specific targeting; rather, the approach is to improve health including immune health by targeting one of the main pillars of aging biology.
