<p>Because the immediate problem at hand is a virus attacking mainly the respiratory tract, naturally the focus has been on the immune system and the lungs. We need to continue those efforts to reduce the incidence and severity of the pandemic. But protecting the more vulnerable among us will require a different approach. Here I have proposed a more general strategy that should serve us to fight not only the current COVID‚Äê19 epidemic, but also all those that are yet to come. We have been successful in fighting pandemics and epidemics in the past, and no doubt we will continue to be successful. However, the current approach of addressing each onslaught as it occurs does not seem to be a particularly effective strategy. Geroscience is a better solution.</p>
