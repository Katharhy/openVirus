<p>COVID‐19 is the largest pandemic in decades, but it is not unusual. We have been there before with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), as well as the seasonal flu. In each case, a large mobilization of research and health resources resulted in effective treatments and/or prophylactics including vaccines. This is an appropriate response, but it is not sufficient. In the long run, we will succeed in our efforts against COVID‐19, but in a few years we will be confronted with a new challenge, in the form of another virus that has succeeded in zoonotic transmission, and the cycle will begin again. Of note, the geroscience approach is not “ageist”: the affected individuals are not those “chronically old,” but rather those that are “physiologically old” through loss of function and resilience, irrespective of their chronological age.</p>
