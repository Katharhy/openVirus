<p>Of note, this geroscience approach is not specific to COVID‐19, but once tried and proven, it would be effective against any future pandemics or epidemics. As a note of caution, senolytics and other geroscience‐based approaches would not limit infection rates. They would only protect the frail against the more severe consequences of the disease including death. Thus the geroscience approach needs to be viewed as an adjuvant to the current approaches, not a replacement.</p>
