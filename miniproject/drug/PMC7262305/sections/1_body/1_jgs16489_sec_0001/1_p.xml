<p>Because those most affected are the frail older adults, I propose to add geroscience as a new tool to our strategy against COVID‐19. There is no doubt that a long‐term approach to this crisis involves the rapid development of vaccines and other prophylactics. But unfortunately, this takes time, and in the meantime the frail are dying. Geroscience posits that all diseases affecting primarily older adults, even diseases as disparate as cancer and heart disease, have as a common (and major) cause the declining function and resilience that often accompanies the aging process.
 <xref rid="jgs16489-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> This is true for chronic diseases, but it is also true for acute ones such as COVID‐19. Weakened resilience lowers our capacity to respond to the physiologic challenge of an acute infection. Importantly, preclinical work is already showing that interventions addressing the basic biology of aging, such as elimination of senescent cells

 <xref rid="jgs16489-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> can have a positive effect on the ability of a variety of preclinical models to withstand both chronic and acute challenges. Some are already being tried in the clinic, and it is imperative that these approaches be further advanced rapidly.
