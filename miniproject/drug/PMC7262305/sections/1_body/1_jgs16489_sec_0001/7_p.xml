<p>In the case of COVID‐19, the frail older adults are the most affected, in part because they often already present with multiple morbidities, in the form of more than one chronic disease. And then the complications get exacerbated by the sudden appearance of yet one more disease: acute infections with SARS‐CoV2. In such patients, addressing any of their comorbidities (including COVID‐19) amounts to playing a game of whack‐a‐mole. You take care of disease 1, only for disease 2 to become the major issue. This is not the case with geroscience, which is disease blind, in that it aims to improve the host’s defenses, irrespective of the challenge at hand, so the same strategy can be rapidly deployed in future epidemics.</p>
