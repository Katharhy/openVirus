<p>Viewed more globally, the problem is that our approach to medicine is reactive rather than proactive and focused on diseases rather than improvement of health and resilience. As a general approach, modern medicine focuses on developing treatments against chronic diseases such as cardiovascular or cancer or diabetes, to try to redress damage already produced, and there is a relatively scarce effort at improving the individualâ€™s ability to fight those diseases, other than through diet and exercise.</p>
