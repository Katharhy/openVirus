  <p>SARS-CoV-2 Knowledge Scape.</p>
  <p>Different colors represent different research subdomains. The gray hollow circle represents the intersection of key words. Different research subdomains will involve the overlap of key words, such as the "nuclear acid detection" in the topic "testing and sampling methods" and the "morphology, structure, replication" in "pathway." Therefore, the two research subdomains are anchored together at this node, represented by a hollow circle, with two lines pasted together.</p>
