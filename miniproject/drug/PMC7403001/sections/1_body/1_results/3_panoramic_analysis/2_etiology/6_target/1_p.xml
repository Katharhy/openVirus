<p id="p0130">As a specific receptor that facilitates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into target cells, ACE2 is a potential therapeutic target; the S protein (RNA binding domain and S2 subunits) of SARS-CoV-2 may also serve as an important antigenic target for neutralizing antibodies and vaccines. In addition, Mpro and RdRp, which are both involved in viral replication; TMPRSS2, which is essential for entry and viral spread of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor;
