<p id="p0110">Sequence analysis showed that the ORF regions, such as ORF1ab, ORF3b, and ORF8, are important functional domains that may be related to protein stability and nucleophilic effects, as well as to mutations subject to selection pressure (e.g., Nsp2 and NSP3, aa83-aa89).

 </xref> The spike glycoprotein on the virion surface mediates receptor recognition and membrane fusion. The conserved RNA binding domain in subunit S1 may be involved in the novel coronavirus's ability to cross species barriers imposed by receptor specificity. The C/N termini of the S1 subunit may also be responsible for direct interaction with the host receptor.
