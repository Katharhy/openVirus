<p id="p0190">Prevention and control measures implemented by the Chinese government include managing the source of infection, cutting off the routes of transmission, and protecting the susceptible population. In addition, Singapore, the US, the UK, and other countries have also taken active measures to contribute to global joint defense efforts. Main measures includes:

   <p id="p0195">Advanced technologies have been applied in epidemic surveillance and control. Big-data technology, machine learning algorithms, and artificial intelligence technology were widely used in epidemic data analysis and fitting. These new applications can scientifically simulate the spread dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak, monitor and manage data on urban health, apply new corrective measures to control spread of infection, and improve possible-COVID-19 case identifications.

   <p id="p0200">Daily prevention measures have been focused on key populations and areas. Pregnant women and children were the priority groups for COVID-19 prevention as pregnant women were considered an at-risk group while the low infection rates among children might be due to having more mild cases that are not reported. Related studies have reported clinical recommendations for diagnosis, prevention, and control among these groups.

    </xref> In several studies, technologies and requirements for protection and disinfection in key places, such as passenger transport stations, transportation facilities, and mobile cabin hospitals, have been discussed. Nursing research focuses on the health management and mental health care of pregnant women, severe cases, and patients with chronic disease.

   <p id="p0205">Protective measures for front-line workers have received widespread attention. Many studies are calling for interventions to protect the health of medical staff. In addition to front-line medical staff in infectious disease and respiratory departments, those in dermatology departments, dentistry departments, ophthalmology departments, blood transfusion departments, burn departments, radiology departments, and general surgery wards were all subject to increased risk of infection. In accordance with the specific clinical practice characteristics of these departments, studies designing precautions and control measures against the novel coronavirus aimed at decreasing the risk of nosocomial COVID-19 infection have been published.</p>

   <p id="p0215">Global strategies for joint prevention and control of COVID-19 transmission have been implemented. In addition to China, the US Health Community has reviewed and updated protocols developed for previous epidemics, rapidly expanded diagnostic testing, established protocols for emergency departments and urgent care centers, taken public health actions to slow the spread of the epidemic, and restricted temporary travel.
