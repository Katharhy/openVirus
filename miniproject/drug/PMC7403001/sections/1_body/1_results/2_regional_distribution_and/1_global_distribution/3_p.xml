<p id="p0070">In the US, considerable studies on the epidemiology (30 papers), prevention and control, and etiology of COVID-19 have been published. For instance, the University of Washington has studied the impacts of travel restrictions on disease spread, the Mayo Clinic has investigated the establishment and rationality of prevention and control measures, and the University of Chicago has explored the pathological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. Studies in the UK have mainly focused on the epidemiology and prevention and control of COVID-19; for example, University College London and the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine have studied the effects of the disease on public health and the corresponding prevention and control measures to be undertaken at different phases of epidemic development. Research in Canada has focused on the epidemiology of COVID-19, such as the study from University of Toronto about the transmission dynamics and risk assessment. Japan has placed significant emphasis on epidemiological studies, with studies published by Hokkaido University and the Japan Science and Technology Agency describing the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 and quarantine duration. Similarly, Germany has mainly focused on epidemiological studies; for example, Heidelberg University established a model to assess the epidemic potential of SARS-CoV-2 and predict its transmission dynamics and impact. Studies in Italy have placed a relatively higher focus on the epidemiological and etiological aspects of COVID-19. Scientists at the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases have reported an unusual radiological presentation of COVID-19 using chest computed tomography (CT) scans. The Biomedical University of Rome has focused on investigating the pathogenesis and evolutionary pattern of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
