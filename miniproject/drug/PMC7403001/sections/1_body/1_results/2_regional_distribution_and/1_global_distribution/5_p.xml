<p id="p0080">Epidemiological, etiological, and diagnostic studies (75.6%) predominate among research arising from collaborations between China and other countries across a range of research topics related to COVID-19, including predictive modeling (e.g., R0), infection mechanism, genome sequencing of the virus, origin of the virus, receptors, PCR techniques, and immunological detection methods. In addition, China and Japan have collaborated to conduct clinical studies on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, noninvasive respiratory support, potential antiviral therapeutics, and clinical features of patients. Furthermore, China has launched joint research projects with the US, Australia, and Canada to study protective measures for postpartum women and newborns, the experience of handling the epidemic, and to undertake discussions on countermeasures.</p>
