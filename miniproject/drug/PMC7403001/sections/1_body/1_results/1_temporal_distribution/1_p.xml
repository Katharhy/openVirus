<p id="p0050">Since the outbreak and global spread of COVID-19, researchers worldwide have embarked on intense research efforts, and the number of publications on COVID-19 has shown an increasing trend, with fluctuations, over time. The first related study, which was published on January 22, 2020, discussed the transmission of COVID-19 across species.

 </xref> Before February 5, 2020, the number of daily publications increased by single digits, and thereafter by double digits. In terms of research topic, etiology, epidemiology, and prevention research were the focus of early published papers. As the outbreak progressed, the focus of publications shifted to diagnosis and prevention. There were relatively fewer studies on prognosis and nursing as of March 8, 2020.
