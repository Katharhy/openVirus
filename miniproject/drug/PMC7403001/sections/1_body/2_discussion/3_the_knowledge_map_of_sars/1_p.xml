<p id="p0230">Considerable information was available to researchers all over the world within 2Â months of the outbreak of COVID-19, making the contextual knowledge system for SARS-CoV-2 increasingly clear and forming a knowledge scape that includes etiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and control. It should be noted that our understanding of novel coronavirus is still not comprehensive enough, and knowledge gaps still exist in subdomains such as the origin of the virus; modalities of transmission between animals and humans; surrogate markers for infectivity; spectrum of clinical disease; adequate animal models; supportive care interventions; immunotherapy; safe provision of care; psychological care; and ethical problems. It is imperative to establish timely and clear research routes and to coordinate and accelerate research aimed at filling the above-mentioned gaps to control the pandemic and prepare for future outbreaks involving other coronaviruses.</p>
