<p id="p0220">China has made great contributions to scientific progress related to the COVID-19 pandemic, responding rapidly and initiating critical research in considerable scope and depth. The early stages of the outbreak in China provided a large number of cases for scientific research on both the causative virus and treatment strategies. Chinese researchers first isolated the novel coronavirus from patients on January 7, 2020, and sequenced the viral genome on January 12, 2020. Furthermore, China shared its diagnosis and treatment strategies worldwide, actively participated in international scientific research cooperative efforts, and promoted the rapid dissemination of research results related to COVID-19. Since February 2020, the number of publications by Chinese researchers has increased dramatically on a daily basis. In view of the seriousness of the epidemic during the early stages, the focus of Chinese publications has been on treatment, prevention, and control, with the aim of applying the research findings to outbreak control in a timely manner in response to the call of the government. Among articles written in English, the collaboration between provinces and cities in China, as well as among medical communities, scientific research communities, and industrial communities was the focus of study, along with an emphasis on epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, prevention, and control. These findings have been shared globally, representing unremitting efforts contributed to global joint research. In general, compared with the SARS epidemic in 2003, the scientific research capability of China has demonstrated great qualitative progress, promoting more virus-related research and yielding important results in a short time.
