<p id="p0040">In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which the WHO declared the sixth Public Health Emergency of International Concern, researchers worldwide raced to characterize the virus through joint scientific research efforts. Around 60 key research organizations and journals, including BMJ, signed a joint statement pledging to “rapidly and openly” share research data and findings relevant to the outbreak. Medical journals, such as the Lancet, the New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, BMJ, Springer Nature, National Medical Journal of China, and China Biotechnology set up a special hub to support the global response to COVID-19 by enabling fast and direct access to the latest available research, evidence, and data.
