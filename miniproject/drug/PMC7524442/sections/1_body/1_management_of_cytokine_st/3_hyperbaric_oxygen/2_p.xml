<p id="par0075">One study (NCT04327505) is focused on efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen which significantly reduces inflammatory cytokines. It is expected to be effective in the treatment of cytokine storm in viral infections (SARS-CoV-2). It is possible to suppose that a clinical effect of hyperbaric oxygen is caused by immunological factors. The effect on monocytes may be the basis for reduced levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines under stress conditions [
