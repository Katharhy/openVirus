<p id="par0120">Not far from alleviating effect of previously mentioned antioxidants on CRS in animal models, similar protection on excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by use of sodium cromoglycate was published by Han et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Sodium cromoglycate or ketotifen generally used to treat allergic diseases, significantly inhibit degranulation and the acute release of histamine and inflammatory mediators from mast cells. Han observed that sodium cromoglycate protects mice effectively from death after viral infection by alleviating inflammatory injury via its function as an inhibitor of mast cell degranulation. Other experimental study evaluated mast cell degranulation after cromoglycate and ketotifen in rat liver resulting in decreased levels IL-6 and TNF-Î± [
