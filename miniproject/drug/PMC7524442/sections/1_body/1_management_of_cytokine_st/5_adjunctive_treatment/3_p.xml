<p id="par0115">Reactive oxygen species may be involved in signal transduction pathways that stimulate production of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the activation of transcription factors (NF-kB). The decrease in oxidative stress by widely used antioxidants (N-acetylcysteine and erdosteine) encourages us to use them in the treatment of cytokine storm. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) serves as a prodrug to L-cysteine and L-cysteine is a precursor to the naturally occurring antioxidant molecule â€“ glutathione. NAC, a modified form of the amino acid cysteine inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory molecules (e.g., IL-6, CCL5, CXCL8, and CXCL10) in H5N1-infected lung cells and reduces migration of monocyte in experimental model. With its anti-inflammatory effects, it may also be effective for the treatment of cytokine storm induced by severe influenza [
