<p id="par0095">Perspective pathway in immunomodulatory approaches is to modulate levels of IL-1 by using anakinra or canakinumab. It is well established that an over-expression of interleukin-1 is one of the hallmarks in CRS, probably through activation of nuclear factor transcription and activator protein 1. Environmental trigger binds to TLRs which activate the formation of pro-IL-1 and activation of the inflammasome [

Inflammasome activation is important for the regulation of both the innate and adaptive immune mechanisms paving the way for specific immune responses. After the inflammasome activation, IL-1β is subsequently produced, which mediates the inflammation and thus contributes to cytokine storm. Shakoory et al. in 2016 [
 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] reported that IL-1R blockade with anakinra is associated with higher survival rate of septic patients presenting signs of cytokine storm. The safety and wide therapeutic margin of anakinra and the central role of IL-1 in the cytokine storm merit reconsideration of this therapeutic agent as a potential treatment option for CRS. This cytokine is not consistently elevated in patients with severe CRS [
