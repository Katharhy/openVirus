<p id="par0070">Seven of these studies are focused on using haemoadsorbtion in CRS management caused by SARS-CoV-2 (NCT04324528, NCT04385771), in severe burns (NCT04195126), septic shock (NCT02288975), cardiac arrest (NCT03685383) and after CAR-T cell therapy (NCT04048434). Haemoadsorbtion can lead to a reduction of the circulating pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and thus improve the course of the disease and the outcome of patients. One of them (NCT03974386) recruits patients with sepsis to establish influence of environmentally induced inflammation caused by gram-negative bacterial endotoxin as the main trigger for systemic inflammatory reaction. Endotoxin binds to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and so induces a cytokine storm. The amount of endotoxin is associated with shock, insufficient intestinal perfusion, and poor prognosis. Therefore, haemoadsorbtion can antagonize the action of endotoxin reducing the cytokine storm and inflammatory response to improve the prognosis of sepsis.</p>
