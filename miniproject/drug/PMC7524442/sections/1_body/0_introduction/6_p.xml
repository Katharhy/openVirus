<p id="par0045">Such broad spectrum of etiological factors leading to clinical and laboratory manifestation of CRS like hypotension, hypoxia, fever, fatigue, myalgias, malaise, nausea, hypoxia, coagulopathy, capillary leakage, tachycardia, tachypnea, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome, organ toxicity, pulmonary edema, pneumonitis, and renal insuï¬ƒciency support the basic scientific postulate: cytokine storm results from excessive pro-inflammatory stimuli, inadequate regulation of inflammation, immune cells or both [
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Not only pro-inflammatory cytokines, but also anti-inflammatory cytokines appear in circulating blood, such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Cytokines work in counterbalance mode, as demonstrated on typical example: products of the Th2 immune response suppress the Th1 immune response and vice versa [
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In a case of robust activation of immune balance, without the ability to resolve the inflammation, the collateral damage to surrounding cells can be catastrophic, resulting in septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction, immunosuppression and even death [
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. If the inflammatory response is properly regulated, regulatory mechanisms prevent the body from being damaged by systemic inflammation caused by sudden activation of cytokine release. Such inflammation can be resolved effectively, with little or no long-term damage to the host [
