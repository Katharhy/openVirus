<p id="par0030">Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or “cytokine storm” is a form of uncontrolled systemic inflammatory reaction that can be triggered by a variety of factors. It starts fairly quickly in cases of severe (mainly respiratory) infections, in other types of massive immune activation such as severe courses of some systemic diseases (RA, SLE), rarely anaphylaxis. It can be frequently mentioned in connection to medical interventions such as transplantation [
