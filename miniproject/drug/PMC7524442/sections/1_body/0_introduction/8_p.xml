<p id="par0055">Canna and Behrens [
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] propose a conceptual model of various cytokine release syndromes based on the nature of mechanisms of inflammation. Careful assessment of host and environmental factors strengthen the idea of rational therapeutic approach. In a case of host dependent mechanism of inflammation, they emphasize the use of cytotoxic agents while in a case of environmentally induced inflammation (infection) antimicrobials are predominately indicated. Data about cytokine storm in human anaphylaxis or other severe allergic (drug) reactions are scarce [
