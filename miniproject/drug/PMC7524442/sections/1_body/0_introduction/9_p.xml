<p id="par0060">The clinical picture of cytokine storm slightly varies in its several forms, but generally manifests as “overlap syndrome” laboratory manifesting in decreasing cell counts, decreasing ESR, increased ferritin level, NK dysfunction, and hemophagocytosis [

Although the primary cause of CRS is crucial to understand for restoring immunologic balance, the main focus in treatment should be directed towards final common pathway. At that level, influence on all pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory humoral and/or cellular compounds might have been considered. When activating intense inflammatory pathways through immune cells, endothelium, bone marrow, liver and kidney, a vicious circle of harmful processes can lead to death. Immunopathology could also be associated with extensive microthrombosis mostly in lungs, thus ischemic/reperfusion injury contributes to broadening of immune mediated inflammation [
