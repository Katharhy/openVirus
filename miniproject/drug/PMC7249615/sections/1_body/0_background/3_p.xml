<p id="Par4">McLellan and colleagues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] produced samples of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and analyzed the structure via the imaging tool cryo-electron microscopy. They confirmed that the S protein on SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of its close relative, SARS-CoV, with sequence identity of 76% for this protein between the two origins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein is known as a class I fusion protein. It is a large transmembrane protein of approximately 150 kDa and is highly glycosylated. S glycoproteins assemble into trimers on the virion surface (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The S protein consists of two subunits: the S1 subunit contains a signal peptide, followed by an N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD). The S1 subunit mediates attachment of the virion to host cell surface receptors and rests above the other subunit, the C-Terminal S2, containing conserved fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat (HR) 1 and 2, transmembrane domain (TM), and cytoplasmic domain (CP), responsible for fusion of viral and cellular membranes [

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The S2 subunit mediates subsequent fusion between viral and host cellular membranes, facilitating entry into the host cell [
