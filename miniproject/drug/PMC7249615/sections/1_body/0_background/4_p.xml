<p id="Par5">An important question is why the lungs seem to be the most vulnerable target organ. One possible reason could be due to the large alveolar epithelial surface of the lungs being incredibly susceptible to inhaled noxious agents and pathogens such as viruses. Another reason could be that the lungs and especially the alveolar epithelium have a high density of cells expressing angiotensin converting enzyme 2

This particularly suggests that these cells are a preference for viral invasion. In addition, genetic analysis indicates that ACE2-expressing AECII have a high level of multiple proviral genes, including regulatory genes for viral processes, viral life cycle, viral reproduction, and genome replication [
