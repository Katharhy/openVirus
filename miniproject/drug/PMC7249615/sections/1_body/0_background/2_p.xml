<p id="Par3">CoVs are spherical enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses, characterized by club-like spikes that project from their surface giving them their solar corona or crown-like appearance (hence the name “Corona”). CoVs have an unusually large genome for RNA viruses, containing approximately 30 kilobases (kb). SARS-CoV-2, like the other CoVs, is also spherical and enveloped with a diameter of approximately 60–140 nm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The SARS-CoV-2 virion genome is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA comprising 29,903 nucleotides, and encodes 12 putative, functional open-reading frames (ORFs) responsible for the synthesis of viral structural and nonstructural proteins [

The genome encodes the structural [spike (S) protein, envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) phosphoprotein] and nonstructural [3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), helicase (Hel), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)] proteins as well as accessory proteins [
