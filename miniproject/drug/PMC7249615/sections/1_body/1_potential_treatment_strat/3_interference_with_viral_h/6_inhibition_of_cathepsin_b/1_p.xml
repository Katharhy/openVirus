<p id="Par16">Most coronaviruses enter their target cells via plasma membrane fusion, a further entry mechanism is the endosomal acidic pH-dependent endocytosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Once the virus is internalized, only then does the fusion of virus with lysosomes depend on a low endosomal and lysosomal pH [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Following this, the S glycoprotein is cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits by endosomal proteases cathepsin B/L, with the resulting S2 subunit-mediating membrane fusion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. To date, numerous protein inhibitors of cathepsin B/L have been described, some of which are of endogenous origin and led to the design and development of several specific peptide- and peptidomimetic inhibitor drugs. One such drug, named E-64d, an epoxysuccinyl cathepsin inhibitor blocked SARS-CoV-2-driven entry into the TMPRSS2
 <sup>-</sup> (knockout) cell lines 293T and Vero [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, even if E-64d and analogs are therapeutically effective from a drug perspective, they are not widely accepted or approved. In addition, some exogenous protein inhibitors of cathepsin B/L have been isolated from various natural sources. Amongst such inhibitors are aziridines like miraziridine and aldehydes like tokaramide but also other non-peptidic natural compounds such as flavonoids. Quercetin is a strong cathepsin inhibitor with an IC50 in the low micromolar range [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Quercetin is a common and readily available supplement and, therefore, must be considered as an adjuvant to prevent or to weaken the course of such viral infections. Cathepsin B/L activity is inhibited by an elevated endosomal pH and, thus, chloroquine treatment will also work [
