<p id="Par11">TMPRSS2 is expressed highly in localized high-grade prostate cancers and in the majority of human prostate cancer metastases. Lucas et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] showed a decrease in the frequency of metastases and a slowdown of the spread of metastases in mice with prostate cancer using TMPRSS2 inhibitors. In particular, they identified bromhexine, an FDA-approved ingredient [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] in mucolytic cough suppressants, as a potential TMPRSS2 inhibitor for their application. Bromhexine is orally readily bioavailable. Endonasal application is also a good alternative option. Bromhexine is an over-the-counter (OTC) drug [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] that is affordable with proven safety. Typically bromide compounds, especially aromatic bromide compounds, show a relatively high binding affinity for serine-containing peptide sequences, proteins, and enzymes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Lucas et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] show that this effect is due to a selective inhibition of TMPRSS2 by bromhexine.
