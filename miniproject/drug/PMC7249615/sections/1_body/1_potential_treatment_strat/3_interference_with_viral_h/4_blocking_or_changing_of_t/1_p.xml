<p id="Par14">The interaction sites between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 are interesting therapeutic targets with the aim of blocking or changing the ACE2 receptor. It is important to note that ACE2 has an imperative lung protective function [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and is, therefore, of limited use as a target as it has to maintain its physiological function. ACE2 inhibitors will go hand-in-hand with partial loss of this lung protection. Chloroquine and the less toxic HCQ are of particular importance here, as it interferes with the glycosylation of ACE2 which is considered one of the cellular receptors of SARS-CoV [
