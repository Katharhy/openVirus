<p id="Par19">The HIV protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir inhibit the major CoV protease 3CLpro. A patient in Korea that contracted SARS-CoV-2 was successfully treated with this antiviral combination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. However, this result could not be confirmed in a recent clinical trial as a treatment in adults with SARS-CoV-2. Their results demonstrated no difference from standard care with respect to the time to clinical improvement [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. A recent drug moleculesâ€™ docking study of the 3CLpro pocket indicates that chloroquine and bromhexine have high binding affinity to 3CLpro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Interestingly, quercetin also has a strong binding affinity for 3CLpro, greater than both bromhexine and chloroquine, and thus, all three drugs are inhibitors of 3CLpro. This is an added beneficial mechanism of action for these drug molecules. PLpros, in general, are not as well characterized as 3CLpros and have not generated as much interest as pharmaceutical targets.
