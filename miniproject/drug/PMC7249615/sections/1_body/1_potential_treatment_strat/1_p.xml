<p id="Par7">The topic of clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 infections is too vast to be adequately covered in the current review. Consequently, we would like to focus our effort on lessons learned and practical considerations important to frontline clinical personnel. Although patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and respiratory distress share many clinical similarities with patients suffering from other types of severe viral pneumonia and often meet the Berlin definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [

While most patients do not require immediate intubation on emergency department (ED) arrival, patients can decompensate quickly depending upon their viral load, comorbidities, and length of clinical illness among other factors. A systematic, escalating, step-wise approach to respiratory support is essential. A patient who arrives to the ED with hypoxia should immediately be placed on nasal cannula (NC) or facemask (FM) supplemental oxygen and their response monitored closely. Currently, the treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive care, and for patients with severe infection oxygen therapy represents the major treatment intervention. Preventive strategies aimed at reducing transmission are focused on the isolation of patients and careful infection control.
