<p id="Par8">Vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 is in advanced stages of development in approximately 40 companies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Disadvantages with cutting-edge vaccines are that they take months to years to develop and to approve, and they become obsolete if the virus evolves. Below, we summarize several approaches to targeting SARS-CoV-2, looking at the notable features of the virus and drug molecules with possible antiviral activity that have repurposing potential. Some of the drugs described have activity against other virus families and have already been used for treating other viral infections in a clinical setting, indicating potential broad-spectrum applications.
