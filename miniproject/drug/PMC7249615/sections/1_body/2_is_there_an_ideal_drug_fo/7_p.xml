<p id="Par26">Recent publications on COVID-19 have brought attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine in the treatment of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. Whether chloroquine can treat COVID-19 alone and also work as a prophylactic is doubtful. This needs to be further investigated before masses of people start to take this relatively toxic drug as a preventive measure. People have been poisoned and one death has occurred due to overdose using chloroquine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. The FDA does say that studies are under way to see if chloroquine can be effective in the treatment of COVID-19. Chloroquine had been approved for “compassionate use” where patients are in a life-threatening condition. Past research on chloroquine has shown in vitro activity against many different viruses, but no benefit in animal models [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Chloroquine in almost all animal models of different viral infections only partially worked or did not work [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Treatment with chloroquine did not prevent influenza infection in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Conversely, it worked very well in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. This could indicate that the main mechanism of action of chloroquine, in vivo
