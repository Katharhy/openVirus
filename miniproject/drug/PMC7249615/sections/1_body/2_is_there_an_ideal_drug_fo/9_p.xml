<p id="Par28">The recommended dose of HCQ sulfate for prophylaxis is 400 mg per week and for a curative treatment a loading dose of 800 mg (twice daily 400 mg) for the first day and 400 mg (twice daily 200 mg) for the following 4 days [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Especially, since chloroquine derivatives are quite toxic, a combination with bromhexine and a lower dose of HCQ could be applicable. A combination of airway protease inhibitors with other antiviral drugs is known to obtain a synergistic effect or reduce the risk of resistance. An example shows that a combination of oseltamivir with the serine protease inhibitor BAPA (benzylsulfonyl-
 <sc>d</sc>-Arg-Pro-4-amidino-benzylamide) is able to suppress influenza virus replication in human airway epithelial cells at remarkably lower concentrations compared to a treatment with each inhibitor alone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. One can deduce that the same could be applicable for the herein proposed drug application. Bromhexine would be a valuable addition in combination with antivirals such as remdesivir. The beneficial role of flavonoid supplements like quercetin to contribute to an inhibition of the viral entry and replication must also be considered as additional support to current and also our proposed treatment scheme [
