<p id="Par25">A clinical trial (registration number NCT04273763), carried out by WEPON Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd., is the first human body-based preliminary exploratory randomized-controlled clinical study on treating COVID-19 with bromhexine hydrochloride tablets (BHT). The clinical study evaluated the efficacy and safety of oral intake of 96 mg (32 mg tid) BHT combined with standard treatment (experimental group) compared to standard treatment alone (control group) in suspected patients and confirmed patients with mild or common COVID-19. The study results showed the signs of efficacy from multiple angles using BHT (WEPON Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd. communication. Appendix 3. Exploratory Study on First Use of BHT for Prevention and Cure of COVID-19. 2020). Treatment with BHT alleviated lung injury to a certain extent, as we have proposed, and no severe adverse effects were experienced. The experimental group compared to the control group required less oxygen inhalation days (2 days on average for the experimental group and 4 days on average for the control group), had lower proportion of patients requiring oxygen inhalation (16.67% for the experimental group and 33.33% for the control group), and had smaller incidence of adverse events of liver injury which is expected (25% for the experimental group and 66.67% for the control group). Bromhexine and ambroxol appear to have a liver protective effect. Comparatively, liver toxicity when given chloroquine/HCQ and liver damage in COVID-19 is a high risk. The exploratory results of the study support our proposal that bromhexine hydrochloride may have a good effect on the treatment of COVID-19.</p>
