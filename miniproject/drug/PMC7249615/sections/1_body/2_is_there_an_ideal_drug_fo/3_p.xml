<p id="Par22">Bromhexine or bromhexine hydrochloride (
 <italic>N</italic>-cyclo-
 <italic>N</italic>-methyl-(2-amino-3,5-dibromo-benzyl) amine hydrochloride) is derived from Vasicin, a plant-derived ingredient and alkaloid that was developed from the Indian lung herb, 
 <italic>Adhatoda vasica</italic>, and is a brominated aniline and benzylamine derivative [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Bromhexine hydrochloride acts as a mucolytic (breaks down mucus and helps clear chest congestion) and is approved in many countries as an OTC drug. It is characterized by low side effects and a low purchase price. Bromhexine is structurally related to ambroxol, an active demethylated metabolite of bromhexine, that is also a known medicine in the market. The available data suggest further that ambroxol is a potent inducer of surfactant synthesis in AT2 cells [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Thus, bromhexine also provides indirect protective effects. Bromhexine hydrochloride is sold under a few brand names, such as, Bisolvon
 <sup>®</sup>, Broncholyte Elixir, Paxirasol, and Bisolex amongst others. According to the package inserts (information for use), the medicinal products containing bromhexine hydrochloride are usually administered three times a day (8–16 mg per dose for adults). It shows a quick and almost complete absorption in the intestine. Lung-tissue concentrations 2 h post dose are 1.5–4.5 times higher in bronchiolo-bronchial tissues and between 2.4 and 5.9 times higher in pulmonary parenchyma compared to plasma concentrations. Unchanged bromhexine is bound to plasma proteins by 95% [
