<p id="par0030">Most cases of human coronavirus infection are mild, and patients usually can recover without complication or treatment. However, recent epidemics of the two coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have affected more than 10,000 people with mortality rates of 10% for SARS-CoV

 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. A new respiratory illness, SAR-CoV-2 (COVID-19), is genetically similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV viruses but is significantly more infective. In the period between the discovery of the virus in December 2019 to the time this article was under revision in June 2020, the WHO has reported a total of 10.5+ million confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected cases including 512k + deaths 
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. As the global case numbers of SAR-CoV-2 infection keep rising, health experts are focused on finding a solution with fast track vaccine and anti-viral drug development. By using knowledge from SARS and MERS vaccine development path, several research groups have been able to start the development of the SAR-CoV-2 vaccine within a few weeks of the initial outbreak. However, there is no evidence this strategy would be timely or successful in combatting the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Despite decades of efforts, there are still no vaccines against viruses that kill tens of millions of people every year such as HIV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
