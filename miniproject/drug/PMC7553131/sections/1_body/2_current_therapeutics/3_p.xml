<p id="par0045">Corticosteroids are frequently used to treat patients with viral illnesses by reducing inflammatory-induced organ damage. However, based on historical data, caution should be taken when using corticosteroids in coronavirus infections. Retrospective reviews on SARS and MERS treatment suggest that receiving corticosteroids failed to achieve mortality rate reduction and potentially delayed viral clearance

 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This fact was confirmed by a larger meta-analysis of twenty-three studies with a total patient population of n = 6,105 by Zhang et al. assessing the efficacy of corticosteroids treatment for influenza A (H1N1). Their analysis confirmed that there was a similar trend of steroid treatment associated with mortality

High doses of corticosteroids were observed to increase the risk of nosocomial infections of acute lung injury/ARDS and severe pneumonia; patients were associated with prolonged viral shedding of hematopoietic cell transplant recipients infected with seasonal influenza virus

 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Mechanistically, corticosteroids suppress inflammation induced by severe influenza infections; however, they increase the risk of opportunistic infections that occur secondary to immunosuppression. Administration of corticosteroids is likely to increase overall mortality, with this observation being consistent throughout the literature. Moreover, it was shown that corticosteroids might be associated with a higher incidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia and longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.
