<p id="par0150">Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is typically screened for prior to high dose IV C administration due to two case reports of hemolytic anemia in G6PD deficient individuals following 80 g intravenous administration.
 <xref rid="bib0375" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref> However, the lower of intravenous vitamin C doses typically used for prevention and therapy with less than 16 g/day would be unlikely to cause hemolytic anemia in G6PD deficient individuals due to lack of hydrogen peroxide generation at these doses. High concentrations of vitamin C can also affect blood glucose measurements for some point-of-care glucometers, leading to false results.
 <xref rid="bib0380" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref> This can lead to hypoglycemia if aggressive insulin therapy is applied. Therefore, glucose measurements after the administration of pharmacological doses of vitamin C should be performed at the central laboratory.
