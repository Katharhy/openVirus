<p id="par0175">Given the fact that vitamin C is inexpensive and has a history of efficacy and safety in similar clinical circumstances, further investigation should be done on its prophylactic ability in low doses and therapeutic ability in a high. Instead of traditional double-blind control clinical trials, we recommend conducting comprehensive retrospective studies comparing disease progression and post-infection complications among patients who were or were not self-administering vitamin C during the course of their diseases. This may provide timely data on the possible preventive and therapeutic values of vitamin C for the medical and public interest in the current COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
