<p id="par0165">Viral infections such as SAR-CoV-2 (COVID-19), influenza, RSV, and many others are usually associated with increased oxidative stress leading to oxidative cellular and tissue damage resulting in multi-organ failure. Vitamin C has demonstrated favorable therapeutic properties safety profiles throughout a wide range of clinical applications. Administration of high dose of vitamin C as a therapeutic agent can favorably impact patients with viral pneumonia and ARDS in severe SAR-CoV-2 infected patients by decreasing inflammation, pathogens infectiveness and virulence, optimizing immune defense, reducing tissues and organs injuries and improving the overall outcome of the disease.</p>
