<p id="par0065">Vitamin C has many properties that make it a valuable therapeutic agent for respiratory infections. It is a potent antioxidant with anti-inflammatory and immune-supportive properties. Vitamin C is a small water-soluble molecule that readily acts as a one- or two-electron reducing agent for many free radicals and oxidants. Specialized cells can take up reduced vitamin C (AscA) through Na+-dependent ascorbate cotransporters (SVCT1 and SVCT2). Most other cells take up vitamin C in its oxidized form (DHA) via facilitative glucose transporters

Vitamin C is an essential vitamin that acts as a cofactor for several enzymes and facilitates the production of catecholamines, vasopressin, L‚Äêcarnitine, collagen, neurotransmitters, and cortisol 
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, these molecules are central to cellular function and homeostasis. Additionally, Vitamin C plays a significant role in viral infection, including attenuation of the proinflammatory response, enhancement of epithelial barrier function, increasing alveolar fluid clearance, and prevention of sepsis-associated coagulation abnormalities
