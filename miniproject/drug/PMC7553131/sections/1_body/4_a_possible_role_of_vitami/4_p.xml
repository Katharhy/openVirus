<p id="par0075">Sepsis is a life-threatening illness from a dysregulated host response to infection. Untreated, it can lead to severe organ damage throughout the body. It is difficult to manage, requiring a combination of different treatments and supportive care for critically ill patients. Fisher B.J et al demonstrated in a mice model that Vitamin C plays a crucial role in multiple pathways associated with sepsis

Mice that were given vitamin C did not experience multiple organ dysfunction syndromes, while mice that were deficient in vitamin C were much more susceptible to sepsis-induced organ damage. A proposed mechanism is that ascorbate enhances the synthesis of vasopressors norepinephrine and vasopressin by acting as a cofactor. Therefore, the administration of ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) in patients with hypovitaminosis C, during severe sepsis or septic shock, supports the endogenous synthesis of vasoactive compounds, reducing the need for external vasopressors. These vasopressors help with the widespread vasodilation during sepsis, regulating blood pressure and fluid loss.
