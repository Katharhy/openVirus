<p id="par0160">Other ongoing clinical trials are studying the effects of Ascorbic Acid as a prophylactic taken alongside conventional medication. In a 600-participant double-blinded randomized trial (Identifier: NCT04335084), Ascorbic Acid is given alongside Hydroxychloroquine, Vitamin D, and Zinc to test if the drug Hydroxychloroquine has more effect than normal nutritional supplements. This study is mirrored in sponsored trial ProgenaBiome (Identifier: NCT04334512) who are testing the same treatment. While a study in Turkey (Identifier: NCT04326725) is testing the effects of vitamin C and Zinc alongside hydroxychloroquine to see if the supplements can boost the effects of an experimental drug. Other trials use Ascorbic Acid as a control in double-blinded studies. In a randomized, multi-center blinded trial (Identifier: NCT04328961), Ascorbic Acid (500â€‰mg daily) is given as the placebo arm to test against the experimental arm of Hydroxychloroquine.</p>
