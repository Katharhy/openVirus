<p id="par0155">Several ongoing clinical trials are investigating the effects of Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, in patients with COVID-19. According to the clinical trials database (

Three of these studies are specifically studying the interaction of infusing Vitamin C through IV and its effects on COVID-19. One of these studies (Identifier: NCT04323514), conducted in Italy, is an uncontrolled longitudinal study in a cohort of 200 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The patients will be administered 10 grams of vitamin C with 250 mL of saline intravenously on top of conventional therapy. The study will be measuring endpoints such as mortality, PCR levels, length of hospital stay, and resolution of symptoms. A trial in China (Identifier: NCT04323514) is mirroring the study taking place in Italy, with the same methods and endpoints measured. However, they are using a larger cohort of 500 infected patients. Lastly, a study in Virginia (Identifier: NCT04357782), is also studying the effects of administering intravenous Vitamin C for coronavirus infection and on decreased oxygenation. They have a study cohort of 20 patients and are giving the infusion of ascorbic acid at 50 mg/kg L every 6 hours for 4 days.
