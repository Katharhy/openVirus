<p id="par0090">Studies have shown that a high percentage of critically ill patients are deficient in vitamin C despite receiving standard nutrition. In an observational study, Carr et al. 
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> found that 75% of critically ill patients had plasma levels of vitamin C that were abnormally low, resulting from increased metabolism from an overactive inflammatory response. A common way to supplement vitamin C in a clinic is through an intravenous (IV) vitamin C administration. A phase I trial in patients with severe sepsis demonstrated that IV infusion of ascorbic acid was safe, well-tolerated, and had positive outcomes, including a significant reduction in multiple organ injury and reduced inflammatory biomarker levels

High dose IV vitamin C is commonly used by complementary and alternative medicine practitioners to treat a wide variety of conditions, including infections. A survey sent out to practitioners showed that over 20,000 patients received IV vitamin C over periods of 2 years, with a mean number of infusions per patient of 19-24. There were no definitive serious adverse events reported and had very low numbers of minor reported adverse effects
