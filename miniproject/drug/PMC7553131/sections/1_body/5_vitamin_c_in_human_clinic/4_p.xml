<p id="par0095">Clinical trials have reported positive results in vitamin C therapy for respiratory infections. Nathens et al. infused ascorbic acid at 1 g every 8 hours for 28 days in 594 surgically critically ill patients and found a significantly lower incidence of acute lung injury and multiple organ failure than in patients receiving mechanical ventilation.

Fowler III AA et al. reported in a case study of a 20-year-old female who contracted respiratory enterovirus/rhinovirus infection that led to acute lung injury and ARDS. Twelve hours following ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) initiation, high dose IV vitamin C began with the dose being 200 mg/kg every 24 hours divided equally into four doses and infused every 6 h. The patient’s recovered rapidly and ECMO and mechanical ventilation were discontinued by day 7. The patient recovered with no evidence of post-ARDS fibroproliferative sequelae
