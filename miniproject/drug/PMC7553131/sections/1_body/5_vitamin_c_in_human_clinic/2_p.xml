<p id="par0085">In a study looking at the impact of vitamin C on oxidative stress and inflammation in common infectious disease, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), researchers measured values including, reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and IL-6 in patients. The results show that severe CAP patients had significantly increased ROS, DNA damage, TNF-α, and IL-6 but significantly decreased SOD.
 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> Administration of Vitamin C improved these redox imbalances by mitigating oxidative stress and proinflammatory markers, suggesting a possible therapeutic benefit for vitamin C in patients with severe CAP and other types of pneumonia. This antioxidant and anti-inflammatory property of has been shown in a multitude of studies, demonstrating efficacy in preventing lung injury and protect against the damage of other organs, such as heart, kidney, and liver in animal models of oxidative stress
