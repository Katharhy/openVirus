<p id="par0100">Vitamin C has also been shown to be effective against other medical conditions. Marik et al. 
 <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> reported their use of IV vitamin C in 47 sepsis ICU cases, finding a significant reduction in mortality rate in groups treated with a high dose of IV vitamin C. Several other trials have also shown that administration of vitamin C to patients with sepsis is associated with better patient outcomes 
 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. However, in the CITRIS-ALI randomized clinical trial by Fowler et al., the researchers did not observe significant differences in either organ failure scores or biomarker levels with 167 patients comparing vitamin C infusion with placebo 
 <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. This lack of difference might be explained in the low dose of 50 mg/1 kg body weight daily and short time frame of only 96 hours vitamin C infusion in these patients with sepsis and ARDS.
