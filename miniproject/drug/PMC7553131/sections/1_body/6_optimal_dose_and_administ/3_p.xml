<p id="par0125">Different from oral administration, which is regulated via the sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter-1(SVCT1), intravenous administration bypasses this pathway and resulting in significantly higher plasma concentrations. Mark Levine’s group documented the dramatic differences between the pharmacokinetics of oral and intravenous administration of vitamin C 
 <xref rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. They noted IV vitamin C was much more bioavailable inside the body, and there was a significant difference in the amount of ascorbic acid found in urine between the two groups. In other studies, IV administration can produce plasma concentrations as high as 26,000 μmol/L 
 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, vitamin C serum levels reached 70-fold compared to those that may be achieved through oral dosing alone 
 <xref rid="bib0310" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. De Grooth et al showed in their studies that plasma concentrations &gt; 1000 μmol/l can be achieved with the administration of 10 g intravenous vitamin C/day. To restore plasma levels in critically ill patients, a minimum of 2–3 g intravenous vitamin C is necessary 
 <xref rid="bib0315" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. For therapeutic purposes, the intravenous dose of vitamin C can be range between 10-16 grams per day to obtain plasma levels of above 1000 μmol/l and to achieve optimal benefit
