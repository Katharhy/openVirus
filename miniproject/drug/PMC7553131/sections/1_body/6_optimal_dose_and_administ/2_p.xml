<p id="par0120">The dose and pharmacokinetics of vitamin C have varied greatly, especially with high dose vitamin C treatment.
 <xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Pharmacokinetic trials concluded that IV 2 to 3 g/d of vitamin C was required only to normalized plasma levels, while a higher dose was required to obtain supraphysiological therapeutic levels 
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. For oral supplementation, doses over 3 g appear to be safe and demonstrated efficacy in preventing and ameliorate respiratory and systemic infections 
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The antioxidant capacity of vitamin C is dose-dependent, and direct radical scavenging capacity is maximal at a plasma vitamin C level &gt; 175 mg/l (1000 μmol/l), more than ten times normal physiological level. Ascorbate prevents the interaction of superoxide and nitric oxide only at very high concentrations 
 <xref rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Results from pharmacokinetic studies indicate that oral doses of 1.25 g/day ascorbic acid produce mean peak plasma vitamin C concentrations of 135 μmol/L, which are about two times higher than those produced by consuming 200–300 mg/day ascorbic acid from vitamin C-rich foods. Pharmacokinetic modeling predicts that even doses as high as 3 g ascorbic acid taken every 4 hours would produce peak plasma concentrations of only 220 μmol/L
