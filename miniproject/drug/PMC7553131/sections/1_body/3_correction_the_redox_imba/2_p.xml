<p id="par0050">Understanding how the coronaviruses cause damage to human cells and organs could offer clues for developing a more effective therapy. Viruses cause infections that are often associated with redox modification’s characteristic of oxidative stress. Changes in redox homeostasis in infected cells are one of the key events in the pathogenesis of respiratory viral infection in all phases of the disease, contributing to severe inflammatory reaction and subsequent tissue damage 
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Redox changes to an oxidized state also play a critical role in the activation of numerous cell pathways that are hijacked by viruses to assure their replication and suppress the patient’s immune defense.
