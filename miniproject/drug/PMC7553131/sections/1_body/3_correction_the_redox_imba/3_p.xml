<p id="par0055">Viruses use several strategies to manipulate host cell machinery to their advantage. Among these, the imbalance of intracellular redox state caused by viruses could play an important role in modulating the activity of several signaling pathways. An oxidative imbalance caused by viral infections

 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, or cytokine storm 
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> could result in localized oxidation of reactive residues of redox-sensitive proteins. Increased oxidative stress leads to a systematic inflammatory response from increased production of cytokines, contributing to ARDS, the key pathology in the high mortality of acute respiratory viral infections 
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Despite the anti-viral role of cytokines in respiratory infections, their overproduction during the cytokine storm is more damaging to lung tissue than the viruses themselves.
