<p id="par0035">Medical doctors have published several clinical and observational studies that documented the clinical features and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a retrospective observational study of 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 98% of the patients had a fever, 77% of the patients had a cough, and 63.5% of the patients had dyspnea. Another report with 41 patients reported that all 41 patients exhibited pneumonia and had complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (29%), acute cardiac injury (12%), and secondary infection (10%). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to the ICU and 6 (15%) died after intensive treatment

 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Wang et al. reported clinical characteristics of 138 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and showed a 26% ICU admission rate and a 4.3% mortality rate

Among the patients in the ICU, 11.1% received high flow oxygen, 47.2% received invasive ventilation, and 41.7% received noninvasive ventilation, suggesting that patients in the ICU could not breathe spontaneously. Lastly, Chen et al. in a separate report of 99 confirmed cases, found that 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that led to 11 (11%) patients quickly worsening in a short period and dying of multiple organ failure 
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. These preliminary clinical pieces of evidence demonstrate considerable uncertainties are present in terms of prognosis and mortality rate. Additional studies are needed to confirm and refine the details of the disease. These early observations still show that COVID-19 is a dangerous illness with a poor clinical prognosis.
