    "Coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses increase oxidative stress in the body leading to cellular and tissue damage. To combat this, administration of high dose vitamin C (ascorbic acid or ascorbate), in addition to the standard conventional supportive treatments, has been shown in literature as a safe and effective therapy for severe cases of respiratory viral infections. Morbidity, mortality, infectiveness, and spread of infectious diseases are dependent on the host-pathogen relationship. Given the lack of effective and safe anti-viral drugs for coronaviruses, there should be more attention in supporting host immune defense, cytoprotection, and immunoregulation. The implementation of a high dose of vitamin C therapy could dramatically reduce the need for high doses of corticosteroids, antibacterial and anti-viral drugs that may be immunosuppressive, adrenal depressive, and toxic, complicating the disease course. In order to effectively fight the novel virus, medical professionals should explore readily available pharmaceutical and nutritional therapeutic agents with proven antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immune-supportive properties. Supplemental Vitamin C may also provide additional benefits for the prevention of viral infections, shorten the course, and lessen the complication of the disease."
