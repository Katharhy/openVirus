For instance, it has been shown that animals subjected to concomitant exposure to certain fungicides, such as ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors, are able to increase the pyrethroid and neonicotinoid insecticides cytotoxicity up to 1000- and 8-fold respectively. This combined exposure may result in enforced lipogenesis and/or oncogenic transcriptional alterations, which may not occur with individual chemicals (
