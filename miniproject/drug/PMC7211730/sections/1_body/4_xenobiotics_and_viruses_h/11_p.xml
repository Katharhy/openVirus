<p id="p0290">On the other hand, the relation between ACE2 levels and SARS-CoV-2 virulence might go in both directions, i.e. both high and low ACE2 activity could theoretically increase Covid-19 severity (

Therefore, more research is urgently needed about the interaction between the ACE-inhibitor/ARB use and the susceptibility to increased Covid-19 severity. Observational studies are currently underway on this issue, and need to be expanded. In the meantime, caution has been suggested by scientific and professional societies about any modifications to current anti-hypertenive drug therapy based on ACE-inhibitors and ARBs in people with high blood pressure, in the absence of convincing clinical evidence of their benefits against severity of Covid-19 (
