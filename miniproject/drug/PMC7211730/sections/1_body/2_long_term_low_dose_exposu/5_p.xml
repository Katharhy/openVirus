<p id="p0195">A number of studies similarly linked MWCNT-induced oxidative stress, phagolysosomal permeabilization, cathepsin B release, NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, and caspase-1 activation with the secretion of important regulatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1β and IL-18). Titanium dioxide nanomaterials, long carbon nanotubes, asbestos and silica, affect innate immune activation through reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, cathepsin B activity that activate Nalp3 inflammasome and induce Il-1α and IL-1β secretion by caspase1, autophagy and lung fibrosis (
