<p id="p0185">The immune system recognizes engineered nanomaterials (NMs) as foreign bodies, resulting in multilevel responses that can range from acute to chronic. These responses can range from immune-stimulatory to immunosuppressive, but can also vary in host toxicity and/or reduced therapeutic efficacy of conventional pharmaceuticals (

Additionally, NMs-induced suppression may reduce maturation and proliferation of immune cells, resulting in increased susceptibility to infectious diseases or tumor growth.
