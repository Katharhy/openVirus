<p id="p0180">Exposure to single chemicals during development has been shown to impair immune responses. However, under real-life exposure scenarios, humans are widely exposed to mixtures of numerous chemicals and other stressors, such as radiation, sound, biotoxins, etc., present in different sources (environment, diet, workplace). Thus, the relevant exposure framework for evaluating potential impairment of the immune function relies on assessing mixtures of chemicals (and other toxic stressors) rather than single chemicals in our changing environment. According to this approach, exposure to chemical mixtures during development could be more detrimental to the immune system than exposure to single chemicals, depending on the nature of the chemicals and their dosages. While the developmental stage is the most vulnerable period to chemical toxicity, exposure during non-critical periods should also be considered. Furthermore, it should be highlighted that low-dose disruptive effects of chemicals on key biological pathways and mechanisms in certain subpopulations may enhance susceptibility to diseases.</p>
