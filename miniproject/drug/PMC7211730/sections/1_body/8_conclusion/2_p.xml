<p id="p0380">This paper highlights that environmental-related diseases (e.g., energy-metabolism-immune mediated obesity, type II diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cancers) and infectious diseases (e.g., parasitic, influenza or coronavirus-related epidemic or pandemic) share the same pathogenic mechanisms at the molecular level, particularly the AhR pathway. Viral epidemics and pandemics, in addition to causing significant morbidity and mortality, can challenge societal structure and healthcare. As novel viruses continue to emerge, novel therapies and preventative measures must be sought. Understanding and optimizing host cell health and viral infectivity parameters are critical steps for any successful cytolytic virology.</p>
