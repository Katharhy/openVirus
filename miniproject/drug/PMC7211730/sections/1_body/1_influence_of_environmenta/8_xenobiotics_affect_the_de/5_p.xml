<p id="p0160">Early-life exposure to environmental and anthropogenic chemicals may result in reprogramming of the immune system. Exposure of the developing immune system to heavy metals, specifically lead, has been shown to adversely affect the generation of innate immune cells, such as macrophages and DCs (

 <sub>2</sub>) by activation of the Erk/MAP kinase pathway, contributing thus to persistent Th2-biased immune responses and increasing the risk for inflammatory disorders and disease unmasked later in life (
