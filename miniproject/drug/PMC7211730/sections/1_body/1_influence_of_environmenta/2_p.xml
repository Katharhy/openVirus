<p id="p0050">The immune system can be the target of many chemical, biological, and physical agents that may elicit adverse effects on the host's health; however, it is still unknown the extent to which low exposure to environmental toxic stimuli may adversely affect human health. The proinflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of many toxic stimuli may have limited effects on the immune system, unless exposure occurs early in life or concurrently with infections or malignant diseases. Under these circumstances, there is an increased risk of progression from exposure to infection, autoimmune diseases, or even cancer. Nevertheless, the compensatory mechanisms of the immune system limit the potential health impact at the individual level, although minor immunomodulatory effects may have an impact at the population level by contributing to increased burden of diseases (
