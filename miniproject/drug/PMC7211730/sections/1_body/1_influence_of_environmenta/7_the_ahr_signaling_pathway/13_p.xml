<p id="p0130">Exposure to airborne particles (urban dust, PAH, diesel exhaust, cigarette smoke) by intranasal administration has been shown to increase pulmonary IL-17 expression (

 <xref rid="bib192" ref-type="bibr">Zambrano-Zaragoza et al., 2014</xref>), but also glomerulonephritis, severe spontaneous colitis, asthma, dengue virus disease (

Epidemiologic studies have linked ambient particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and other air pollutants exposure to immunologic diseases of the respiratory system (asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), atopic diseases, allergic sensitization, eczema and polymorphisms of inflammatory cytokines via AhR-dependent mechanisms (
 <xref rid="bib113" ref-type="bibr">Morgenstern et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, COPD has also been associated with an abnormal pulmonary and systemic immune response to tobacco smoking, although only the so-called “susceptible smokers” develop the disease (

Smokers and COPD patients are subpopulations with an increased risk of severe COVID-19, likely because of the enhanced airway expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, the entry receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in lower airways (
 <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Leung et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, many COVID-19 patients with COPD develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to pulmonary edema and lung failure. They also have liver, heart, and kidney damage, reflecting acute systemic inflammatory reaction syndrome and further multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (
