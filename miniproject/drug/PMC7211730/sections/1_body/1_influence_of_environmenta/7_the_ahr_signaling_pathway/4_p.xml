<p id="p0085">It is recognized that polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dioxins, and biphenyls can activate AhR given their structural resemblance to physiologic ligands. This, in turn, may increase the metabolic turnover of physiologic ligands, thus decreasing their half-life. As a result, uncontrolled or persistent activation of the AhR by exogenous small molecules or UVB radiation may alter the tightly controlled and transient AhR-regulated cell functions (
