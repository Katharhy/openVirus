<p id="p0125">It is well established that pulmonary tissue is the most sensitive human tissue in COVID-19. Of particular interest is the fact that alveolar cells express the AhR at high levels at the basal matrix underneath the alveoli in which immune cells are found [namely mast cells, lymphocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs)] (

This part of the respiratory system, however, is vulnerable to the effects of very fine particulate matter (especially matter with a diameter less than 2.5 μm, which is mainly produced by diesel engines, charcoal-burning, wood-burning, and industrial exhausts). This vulnerability is because particles of this size are able to bypass the protective mechanisms of the respiratory tract and accumulate in the alveolar tissue. If the particles are less than 0.1 μm, they can penetrate completely the alveolar cell membrane and enter the bloodstream. However, airborne particulate matter may act as AhR activators and thus trigger immune responses (
