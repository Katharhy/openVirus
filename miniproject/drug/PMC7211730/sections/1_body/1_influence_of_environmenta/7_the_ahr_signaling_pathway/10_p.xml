 <xref rid="bib139" ref-type="bibr">Reyes et al., 2012</xref>). Diet, antibiotic use, and geographic variation can substantially affect the gut virome. Synthetic diets or diets with no vegetables and fruits have very low AhR activators, such as polyphenols and glucosinolates. These deficient diets can adversely affect the organogenesis of intestinal lymphoid follicles and innate immune cell homeostasis in the gut (
