<p id="p0120">Exposure of the gut microbiota to various antibiotics has led to a substantial enrichment of the gut microbiome with phage-encoded genes that confer resistance to the administered and similarly acting antibiotics. This increased resistance, however, has created rather complicated biofilms promoting persistent infections or chronic inflammation (
