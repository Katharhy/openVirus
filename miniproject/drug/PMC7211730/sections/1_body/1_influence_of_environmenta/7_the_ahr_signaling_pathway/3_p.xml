<p id="p0080">The AhR signaling pathway plays a key role in innate and adaptive immune responses, and controls transcription of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes like cytochrome P450 family members (e.g., CYP1A1 and CYP1B1) (
 <xref rid="bib155" ref-type="bibr">Stockinger et al., 2014</xref>). Exogenous AhR ligands include environmental toxic stimuli (e.g., dioxin), bacterial metabolites, or naturally occurring ligands, such as dietary ligands (e.g., flavonoids and glucosinolates), abundantly found in plants (

Thus, while innate immune cells in children have high expression of AhR, immune cells in adults have conservative to low AhR expression (
