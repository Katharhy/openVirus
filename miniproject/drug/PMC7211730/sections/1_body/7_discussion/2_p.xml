 <xref rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr">Malagoli et al., 2010</xref>). Historically, viruses may have been used in the past as biological weapons. Today, despite the ‘Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention’ that entered into force in 1975, it is known that many countries are still working on and stockpiling biological weapons (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Christopher et al., 1997</xref>). Chemicals, metals, particulate matter, nanoparticles, anthropogenic climate change, and increased UVB radiation disrupt health, ecosystems and environment. These toxins, along with the toxic modern lifestyle and smoking, constitute an ideal man-made environment for the development, and spread, of modern diseases, including the new viral epidemics/pandemics that occurred during the two last decades (
