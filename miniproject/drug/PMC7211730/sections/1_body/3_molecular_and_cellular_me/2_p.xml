<p id="p0215">SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the coronavirus family that has a single-stranded RNA genome of positive sense. This gene encodes four structural proteins, namely spike glycoprotein (S), a small envelope protein (E), matrix glycoprotein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N) (
 <xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>). The entry of the virus into cells is mediated by the S protein, in particular by attaching its surface unit (S2) to ACE2, an enzyme present in primarily type II pneumocytes (lung alveolar epithelial cells). Then the S protein is cleaved by cellular proteases and the viral capside is fused with the cellular membrane, thus allowing intracellular translocation of SARS-CoV-2 coupled with ACE2 by endocytosis (

In this regard, ACE2 genetic polymorphisms and expression levels in different tissues might alter host susceptibility to COVID-19 by affecting the interaction with SARS-CoV-2 S-protein.
