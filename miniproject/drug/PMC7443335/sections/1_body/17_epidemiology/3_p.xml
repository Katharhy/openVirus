Finally, the original transmission to humans may not have happened at the market itself but elsewhere, with the market serving as a location for viral contamination and further exposure of humans. The reproductive number for the corona virus is yet to be determined accurately to understand the dynamics of transmission. The importance, impact and existence of symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission need to be understood clearly along with the role of environmental factors (temperature, humidity and so on). The severity profile, the range of clinical presentations, classification of symptoms is the essential knowledge gaps in the area of epidemiology. The need to determine asymptomatic or symptomatic transmission of COVID âˆ’19, across the range of severity with aid of detailed observational studies [
