<p id="p0340">The research regarding the natural history of virus includes its origin, genomic sequence to support the clinical management and development of interventions. The compartments of replication, prognosis information, surrogate markers for infectivity, phenotypic changes are all concerns that need to be addressed in the ground work of research agenda. A rapid task to be undertaken at this moment is the modification of clinical skill for the rapid diagnosis of the infection and tracks the changes in virulence. Newly emerged virus may change its phenotype making it difficult for the research and development of the therapeutics in future. The demanding research activities included termination, development of diagnostic kits with high quality and performance to detect the virus.</p>
