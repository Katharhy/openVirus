In addition to remdesivir, we tend to evaluate all of the evidence related to the other antiviral drugs, which called the attention, such as ribavirin, favipiravir, oseltamivir and umifenovir [

Simultaneous use of three or more antiviral drugs is not recommended and patient symptoms will recover after drug withdrawal. Antiviral drugs should be stopped if nucleic acid test results from sputum specimens remain negative for more than three times [
