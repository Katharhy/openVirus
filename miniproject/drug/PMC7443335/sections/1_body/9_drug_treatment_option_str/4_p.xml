<p id="p0140">Mostly remdesivir, an inhibitor of RNA polymerase with in vitro activity against multiple RNA viruses, including Ebola- could be effective for both prophylaxis and therapy of HCoVs infections. In vitro, Remdesivir inhibits all human and animal coronaviruses tested to date, including SARS-CoV-2 and have shown antiviral and clinical effects in animal models of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infections. Remdesivir was found superior to a therapeutic regimen as compared to combination therapy of interferon β and lopinavir-ritonavir in a lethal murine model of MERS. In SARS-CoV-2 replication, Remdesivir is identified as potent inhibitor in bronchial airway epithelial and human nasal cells. Administration of early remdesivir was shown to exert significant antiviral and clinical effects in a non-lethal rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, (reduced pulmonary infiltrates and virus titres in broncho-alveolar lavages vs. vehicle only. Authors reported that patients received remdesivir had a 31% times faster recovery in comparison to placebo (

Results also suggested a survival benefit, with a mortality rate of 8.0% for the group receiving remdesivir versus 11.6% for the placebo group (
