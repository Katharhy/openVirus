This study was carried out on total 368 patients and it was divided in three groups namely HC treatments, without HC treatments and combination treatments of HC and azithromycin. Primary outcome of this study was analysis of mortality rate and required ventilation facility on these groups. It was found that 27.8, 22.1 and 11.4 mortality rate was found in HC group, combination group and without HC group, respectively. It was also found that mechanical ventilation occurred in 13.3% of the HC group, 6.9% of the combination group, and 14.1% of the without HC group. Therefore, it was investigated that no effect was found in mortality rate after HC treatment and combination treatments but, significant reduction of mechanical ventilation was observed after combinational treatments when compared to other two groups [
