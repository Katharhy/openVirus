The principal mechanisms of particle deposition in the respiratory tract depend on particle size; for larger particles, impaction and sedimentation are important, but for nanoparticles less than 160 nm in diameter, diffusion represents the principal mechanism. Hence, nanoparticles and micro-particles approaches provide a broad range of opportunities for COVID-19 with new solutions for clinical problems [
