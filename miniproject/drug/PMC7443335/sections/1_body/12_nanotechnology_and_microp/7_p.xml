<p id="p0235">The performance of the COVID-19 therapeutics can be ameliorated by various approaches of particulate drug delivery systems such as (i) encapsulation of therapeutics in the core to increase stability (ii) specific targeting through targeting moieties (iii) functionalization with polymer like PEG to decrease the amount of drug required to produce action. Metallic, organic, and hybrid NP as well numerous nanocarriers are different approaches of nanotechnology in conjunction with large porous micro-particles (LPMP), solid lipid micro-particles (SLMs) can be used for anti-viral therapy [
