<p id="p0230">Nanotechnology has immense potential to aid in the development of COVID-19 drug delivery due to wide range of advantages such as (i) the small size and morphology of the nanoparticles (NP) enables the drug delivery to physiologically in-accessible sites and eliminate immune response by reticular endothelial cells [

 <xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], (iii) the ability to cross negatively charges membranes due to surface charge modification of NP [
 <xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], and (iv) NP possess intrinsic virucidal activity, such as gold and silver NP [
