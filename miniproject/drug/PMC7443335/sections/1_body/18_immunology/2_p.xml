<p id="p0360">The knowledge of immunology directly or indirectly aids in the development of interventions and clinical management of COVID −19. The basic information of immunology is to know about the role of innate and adaptive immune response in clearance of pathogen. As a part of innate immunity body produces inflammatory proteins like interferons (including IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, etc.) as first line defense. Adaptive immune response involves B cell activation resulting in antibody production. In addition, T lymphocytes including CD4+ T cell derived cytokines, CD8+ T cell mediated cytotoxicity play important role in clearance of virus. However, adaptive and innate immune responses work together in sequence to combat any viral infection in healthy immune cells. In case of defective immune response or dysfunctional immune, cytokine storm will be triggered and circulates to other organs, leading to lung and multi-organ damage [
