<p id="p0310">Dendrimers NP are three-dimensional hyperbranched organic compounds, well-organized nanoscopic molecules, possess low poly-dispersity index, biocompatibility and biodegradability in the field of nanomedicine [
 <xref rid="bb0525" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. This allows the potential utilization of dendrimers NP in various therapies against tumors, bacterial and viral infections. Dendrimers act as extraordinary vehicle for the targeted delivery of drug/ gene/ peptides in biological system with limited utility and application in antiviral therapy [
 <xref rid="bb0530" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. The globular structure of dendrimers enables NP to accommodate drug molecules in the interior cavity i.e. by physical encapsulation and on surface by covalent conjugation [
 <xref rid="bb0535" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. To date, dendrimers with anti-viral activity in conjugation with therapeutic agents have already been documented against some viruses including influenza virus, Ebola-virus, zika virus, HSV-1, 2 and HIV. Research on the efficacy of dendrimers as a nanoparticulate system for designing an anti-viral therapy have been introduced by some of the pioneering researches, but their efficiency against is yet to be evaluated [
