<p id="p0305">As an alternative to synthetic polymers, some natural polymers e.g. sodium alginate and chitosan are characterized by unique muco-adhesive properties and therefore used in design of controlled release MPs. Chitosan, and N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide/N-isopropyl acrylamide are other examples, which showed promising results as intranasal vaccines against viral infections. Chitosan is attracted particular interest for intranasal administration due to their non-toxic nature, biocompatibility, biodegradability, capability to open up tight junctions between epithelial cells [
