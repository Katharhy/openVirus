<p id="p0315">Hybrid nanosystems are combination of inorganic-organic, inorganic-inorganic, and organic-organic nanoparticulate systems engineered based on specific requirement or use at targeted site. Joshy et al. reported the zidovudine loaded polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)/stearic acid (SA)-polyethylene glycol (PEG) nanoparticles led to significant improvement in cellular internalization murine neuro-2a and HeLa cells. Authors concluded that hybrid nanoparticles may be a promising approach for anti-viral drug delivery for use in HIV/AIDS therapy [
