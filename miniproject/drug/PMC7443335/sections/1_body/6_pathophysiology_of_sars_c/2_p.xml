<p id="p0095">Specific replication mechanism is still unclear for SARS-CoV-2. It had been reported that replication of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of other viruses of the coronavirus family, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It may be two step reaction of SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter in the body to spread the infection. Firstly, binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) or CD-147or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) [
