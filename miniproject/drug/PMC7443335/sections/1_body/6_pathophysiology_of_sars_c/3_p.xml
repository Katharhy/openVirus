<p id="p0100">ACE-2 receptors have been found as the main cellular receptor for binding with the receptor-binding domain of virus spikes and responsible receptors for human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. ACE-2 protein is abundantly found in alveolar epithelial cells of lungs and enterocytes of small intestine. It was found that the virus primary binds to the target site on lung epithelial cells. Wang et al also found that ACE-2 was abundantly expressed in gallbladder, liver, kidney, testes, gastrointestinal tract, and bladder suggesting that these organs may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may help to understand the routes of infection and disease manifestations [
