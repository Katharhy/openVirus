<p id="p0190">Various monoclonal antibody has been explored in the treatment of COVID-19. Mainly, gimsilumab and leronlimab have been used in the treatment of COVID-19. Gimsilumab targets a pro-inflammatory cytokine known as a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was inhibited by gimsilumab, which increases inflammation. By this mechanism, it reduces the cytokine storm in the airway pathways and provides symptomatic relief to patients from COVID-19 [

Therefore, ACE-2 receptor cannot bind with the epitopes of monoclonal antibody, which cover the RBD of virus. Although entry of virus into body, it cannot be replicated due to unavailability of binding site of host virus [

CR3022 has the potential to be developed as a therapeutic candidate, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection. Leronlimab CCR5 is a protein on the surface of white blood cells that plays an important role in the way HIV develops in the human body. Leronlimab is a monoclonal antibody being studied as a potential treatment for HIV. It binds to the CCR5 receptor, which inhibits the release of inflammatory cytokine [
