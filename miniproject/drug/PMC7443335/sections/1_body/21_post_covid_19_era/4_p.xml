<p id="p0405">Immunity remains the cornerstone for post COVID−19 survival. The strength and duration of immune response in COVID−19 survivors remain as the major knowledge gap. There is no evidence at this point that people can't be reinfected with the virus and the development of an antibody response will be protective from secondary infection, according to WHO. Some countries suggested detection of antibodies to COVID−19, could serve as the basis for an ‘immunity passport’ or certificate of immunity assuming that they are protected against re-infection. But WHO said that issuing such certificate increases the severity of the disease. HERD immunity would be played an important role to address the devastating COVID-19, which is an indirect protection conferred to the susceptible ones by immune individuals against a specific pathogenic infestation in a given population [

Vaccine approval may take up to a decade or more to win approval based on their ability to prevent disease in population. Typically, HERD immunity isn't achieved in a short time like year or two and would take several years to confer sufficient ‘HERD immunity’ to fight COVID-19 [
