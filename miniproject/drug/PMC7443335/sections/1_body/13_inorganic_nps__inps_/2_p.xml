 <xref rid="bb0375" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Metallic NP such as silver, gold, iron oxide and nanocarriers of silica, titanium, carbon are the most common inorganic -NP. Silver nanoparticles (AgNP) are widely researched nanotechnology approach to treat viral infections. Many assumptions of NP have already been made to develop a novel strategy to eliminate or improve the severity of the infection.
