<p id="p0260">Anti-viral activity of AgNP is well established in treating viruses such as HIV, HBV, HSV, RSV [
 <xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The virucidal activity of AgNP may not be similar in all viruses. For example, the viral inhibition in HSV-2 is achieved due to binding of AgNP to sulfhydryl group of surface glycoproteins of virus which prevent viral internalization. In virus like Peste des petits ruminants, AgNP interacts with virion surface and core protein to impair viral entry into target cells [

In recent literature survey, Oron Zachar concluded that colloidal silver of particle sizes between 3 nm- 7 nm can be highly effective to prevent and treat viral infection at initial stage of respiratory infections [
