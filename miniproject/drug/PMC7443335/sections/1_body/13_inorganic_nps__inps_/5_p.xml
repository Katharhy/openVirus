<p id="p0270">Fullerenes are formed by 60 carbon atoms and have the shape of a truncated icosahedron that form a hollow sphere one nanometer in diameter. Fullerenes are water insoluble, but derivatization makes them water soluble.C60 spontaneously forms a stable aggregate in contact with water with nanoscale dimensions (25–500 nm), termed nano -C60 that are both soluble and toxic to microorganisms. Glyco-fullerenes are the carbohydrate derivatives possess combination of interesting biological properties due to the amphiphilic nature with fullerene lipophilic part. Fullerenes are advantageous compared to other carbon nanostructures due to the 3D structure and the possibility of operating the different locations of the C60 cage in a controlled manner.

Munoz et al. synthesized amphiphilic glycodendro fullerene monoadducts and tested for antiviral activity in an experimental infection assay using Ebola virus glycoprotein pseudotyped viral particles on Jurkat cells over expressing DC-SIGN and an improvement in the IC50 [
