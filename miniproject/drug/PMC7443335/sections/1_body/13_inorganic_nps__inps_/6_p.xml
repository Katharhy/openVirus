<p id="p0275">Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are unique, 3D carbon-based nanoparticles, composed of thin graphite tubular sheets rolled up into hollow and tiny nano-needle tubular structure used in the field of biological sciences in last few decades [
 <xref rid="bb0430" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. CNTs belong to the fullerene family. They have small size dimensions (10–100 nm), high dimensionality (2D, and 3D),excellent electrical, thermal and mechanical properties and physicochemical features like surface load capacity and great storage space in the inner tube (inner void space) will result in biological properties, such as good biocompatibility, bio-absorption rate, permeability of biological barriers, multi-energy surface/tube chemical functional group capability, and targeted bio-molecules modification potency, etc. [
 <xref rid="bb0435" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Currently, the applications of CNTs in the biomedical field are explored by surface functionalization, grafting targeted molecules on the surface for site specific delivery, exploiting it superior near-infrared light absorption characteristics and good photothermal conversion [

Yang proposed project to illuminate new way to fight COVID-19 with acidizing and RNA lyase-modified CNTs in conjunction with photodynamic thermal effect. Authors explored the nature of CoV, as they are labile to acidic environment and high temperature [
