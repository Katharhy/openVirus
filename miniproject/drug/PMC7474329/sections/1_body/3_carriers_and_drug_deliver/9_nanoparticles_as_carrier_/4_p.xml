<p id="Par48">Although CRISPR-based solutions are very promising for the control of COVID-19, there is still a limitation on finding the most appropriate delivery systems. Some challenges are: (i) Cas9 proteins have a molecular weight around 150 kDa and a positive charge, which can decrease its encapsulation by nanoparticles; (ii) the nanoparticles need to cross the cell’s nucleus and release CRISPR/Cas9 for effective gene editing; and (iii) CRISPR/Cas9 are derived from bacteria that can activate the immune system; for this reason, a nanocarrier system that avoids triggering the host’s immune system needs to be developed [

(2017) developed a delivery system for Cas9 ribonucleoprotein and donor DNA based on functionalized gold nanoparticles and obtained interesting results in the correction of DNA mutation in vitro and in mice afflicted by Duchenne muscular dystrophy [
