<p id="Par46">In addition, CRISPR-based systems have also been highlighted as an alternative to be explored in the search for containment of SARS-CoV-2. Abbot et al. developed a strategy based on CRISPR against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, denominated PAC-MAN (prophylactic antiviral CRISPR in human cells) [

Promising results were obtained, with degradation of the RNA of the sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus in A549 cells (human lung epithelium).
