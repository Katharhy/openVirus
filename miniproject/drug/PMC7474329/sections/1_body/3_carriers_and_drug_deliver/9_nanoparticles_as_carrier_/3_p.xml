<p id="Par47">Nguyen et al. also consider the CRISPR/Cas13d system as an alternative for the control of SARS-CoV2. They developed 10,333 guide RNAs targeting 10 virus peptides and used adeno-associated virus (AAV) for the targeted transport of cas13d and guide RNAs to the lung. According to the authors, this is an innovative and fast approach [

The system, employing specific guide RNA and a specific single-stranded oligodideoxynucleotide (ssODN), induced point mutations in the region of the human ACE2 gene involved in binding of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, weakening that [
