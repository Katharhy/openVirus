<p id="Par42">Focusing on the cell surface receptors heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which are the binding regions of some viruses in cells, including coronaviruses, Baram-Pinto et al. applied gold nanoparticles capped with mercaptoethanesulfonate (Au-MES NPs) to mimic this receptor, aiming to inhibit herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) attachment to cells [

Although this study was carried out with the herpes virus, this tool can also be explored for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, considering that HSPGs are one of the pathways for the entry of this virus into cells [

The authors reported that the virus associates with these structures and undergoes deformation, losing its infectious potential. The nanoparticles caused the definitive inhibition of different viruses, such as HSV, human papilloma virus (HPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), dengue and lentivirus in vitro, HSV-2 ex vivo and RSV in mice, which indicates a broad-spectrum potential [

As in the previous study, with the aim of mimicking heparan sulphate, Jones et al. developed cyclodextrins modified with mercaptoundecane sulfonic acids, which promoted broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro against different HSPG-dependent viruses, with good compatibility and using low concentrations. In addition, promising results were also observed in ex vivo and in vivo assays, with no report of toxicity or development of resistance [
