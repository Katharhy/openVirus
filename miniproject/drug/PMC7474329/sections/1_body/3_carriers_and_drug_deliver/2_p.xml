<p id="Par34">In addition, viruses belong to the same family and share similar characteristics, which makes it possible to use drugs already approved by the FDA for the treatment of emerging viruses. Viral epidemics are challenging from a therapeutic and public health point of view. According to Clercq and Li [

Nevertheless, the administration of these drugs is often accompanied by side effects, and most of them are poorly water-soluble, which limits their successful use. For example, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been associated with cardiotoxicity, as well as hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity [

In this way, approaches that could target the delivery of the drug into the desired organ and/or decrease the toxicity of these drugs are very promising to improve the efficacy of antiviral treatment [
