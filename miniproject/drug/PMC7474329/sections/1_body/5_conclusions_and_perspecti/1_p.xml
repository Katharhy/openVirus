<p id="Par58">Very little is known about SARS-CoV-2, and therefore, there are currently more questions than answers. Research addressing the aetiology, epidemiology, mechanism of pathogenesis and detailed host immune response to the virus needs to work together to develop diagnostics, treatments and other control measures to combat the epidemic. Recent research into the use of metal nanoparticles as antimicrobial agents [

Nanotechnology has already been employed in the diagnosis and treatment of other viral diseases and may provide a “fresh start” for trying pre-existing drugs and treatments against COVID-19, by addressing the issues of toxicity, poor stability and low bioavailability [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Nano-based formulations could also be designed to target a specific tissue and with controlled-release properties, which would increase the efficiency of treatment and consequently reduce the period and dose of the treatment for control of the virus. Altogether, these approaches could simplify the multidrug therapies that are currently used to treat infectious diseases [
