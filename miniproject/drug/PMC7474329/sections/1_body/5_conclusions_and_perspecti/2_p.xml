<p id="Par59">Nanotechnology applications, however, have some bottlenecks that need to be addressed to facilitate its broader implementation in the wider healthcare system. One of the major challenges is to ensure the safe use of nanomaterials, since most of the studies have only evaluated the biocompatibility using in vitro approaches. The fate and behaviour of nanomaterials in the body can also change when they reach blood circulation due to the formation of protein corona [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">203</xref>]. Due to these limitations, generic protocols have been employed for characterization during the early stages of R&amp;D, which explains the huge numbers of failures in terms of clinical translation of the final nano-based therapies [

To overcome the abovementioned hurdles, a closer collaboration between regulatory agencies, scientific experts in material science, pharmacology and toxicology is needed. Capacity for large-scale manufacturing is another hurdle that needs to be overcome for broader commercialization of nano-based formulations [
