<p id="Par32">Therefore, progress in research related to nanosensors depends on a detection system that is ultra-sensitive and can combine low-cost, high-speed and simple instrumentation. In this context, the future for these nanotechnology-based systems is to explore the integration of various properties (optical, magnetic, electrochemical and biological) to promote a more precise and fast response for the diagnosis [
