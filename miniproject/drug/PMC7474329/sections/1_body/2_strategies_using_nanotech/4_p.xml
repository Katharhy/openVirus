<p id="Par27">In this context, nanotechnology-based probes have been widely used for the production of biosensors [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. Specific thiolated probes, for example, functionalized with gold, can form disulphide bonds with complementary RNA from the target. It was this concept of a colorimetric assay that Kim et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>] used for detection of MERS-CoV. The gold nanoparticles were functionalized with probes modified with thiol on the surface, which hybridize with the target, preventing the aggregation of the nanoparticles by salts and consequently, the colour change, and this platform can be easily adapted for the diagnosis of other infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. Other tests incorporating gold nanoparticles combined with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM showed the potential for rapid symptomatic and asymptomatic screening for COVID-19 [
