<p id="Par24">Viruses are simple biological structures, size in the nanometre range (in the case of SARS-CoV-2, the size ranges from 60 to 140Â nm) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>] and intracellular life cycle, often making their detection difficult, as they are difficult to be isolated and cannot be observed by ordinary optical microscopes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. As with other viral infections, SARS-CoV-2 requires rapid response tests [
