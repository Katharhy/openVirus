<p id="Par57">Vaccines candidates for COVID-19 were developed right after the publication of the complete genome of SARS-CoV-2. According to a report produced by the WHO, up to 9 June 2020, there were 136 vaccine candidates for COVID-19 being developed, 10 of which are currently in clinical trial phases [

With the understanding of the interactions between nanoparticles and the immune system, it can be expected that nanotechnology will fare better in terms of delivering quicker, safer and more effective vaccines compared to those developed by conventional approaches.
