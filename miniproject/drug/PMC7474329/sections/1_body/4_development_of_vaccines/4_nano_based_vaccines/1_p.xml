<p id="Par52">Recently, nanoparticles have caught attention as a promising approach to the development of a new generation of vaccines, since the nanoparticles can both serve as a carrier for the antigen and behave as an adjuvant in many cases. In addition, nano-based vaccines can protect antigens against premature degradation and provide sustained release, enhanced antigen stability, and provide targeted delivery of an immunogen, as well as increase the period of antigen exposure and uptake by antigen presenting cells (APCs) [

Studies have shown that nanoparticles who range in size between 20 and 200 nm are preferentially internalized by endocytosis into APCs (resulting in the T cell response), while large particles (0.5-5 µm) are usually internalized by phagocytosis (inducing the humoral immune response) [
