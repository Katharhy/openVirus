<p id="Par53">The nanoparticles work on the same scale as viruses and can be designed to release a compound into a specific target. The fact that these systems can be developed to cross cell membranes and target specific subcellular locations enhances the potential of nano-based vaccines. For this, different materials can be used for the development of nanocarriers, such as lipids, polymers and polysaccharides [

For instance, lipidic nanoparticles for the encapsulation of genetic material enhance the immune response to the vaccine, once the nanocarrier system can protect the DNA or RNA against enzymatic degradation and increase cell uptake, releasing the genetic material in target cells [
