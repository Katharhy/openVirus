<p id="Par55">The development of a vaccine for the novel coronavirus can be challenging. Some studies have shown that the S protein is an excellent target for vaccine development; however, optimizing the design of the antigen is essential to ensure an adequate immune response [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188">188</xref>]. To date, studies have used the full-length S protein or carefully chosen regions of the protein, for example, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) or N-terminal domain, which are combined with adjuvants in order to enhance the immunological response [

Vaccine candidates formulated with the full-length S protein of SARS-CoV-2 combined with saponin-based Matrix-M™ adjuvant developed by Nanovax is currently in Phase 1/2 clinical trials (NCT04368988). It has been demonstrated that the Matrix-M™ adjuvant stimulates the entry of APCs into the injection site, which enhances the antigen presentation in local lymph nodes, increasing the immunological response [
