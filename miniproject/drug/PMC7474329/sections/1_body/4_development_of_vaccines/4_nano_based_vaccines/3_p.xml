<p id="Par54">Antigens can either be encapsulated inside the nanocarriers or bound (conjugated) to the surface of the nanoparticle and administered together with the adjuvant to the target [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">182</xref>]. To date, a large variety of delivery systems, such as polymeric nanoparticles, lipid nanoparticles, virus-like particles, virosomes, liposomes, emulsions, proteins and immune-stimulating complexes, have been investigated as antigen carriers [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">183</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">184</xref>]. The efficacy of vaccines may be further enhanced through targeted modifications to the nanoparticle-antigen conjugates to achieve the desired level of immunological response [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Amongst these properties, the size, shape and surface charge of the nanoparticles can be controlled, as well as the functionalization of the surface with a variety of ligands to make them adaptable vehicles for vaccines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">185</xref>]. The route of administration could be via subcutaneous or intramuscular injection or by oral or intranasal mucosa, as well as capillary penetration [
