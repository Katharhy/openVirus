<p id="Par6">Nanotechnology can be broadly defined as design and application of several materials and devices where at least one dimension is less than 100 nanometres. In the medical field, the application of nanotechnology is known as nanomedicine, which includes the use of nanomaterials for diagnosis, treatment, control and prevention of diseases [

Over the decades, nanoparticles have been extensively used and studied due to their unique properties, such as small size, improved solubility, surface adaptability and multifunctionality, resulting in the development of better and safer drugs, tissue-targeted treatments, personalized nanomedicines and early diagnosis and prevention of diseases [
