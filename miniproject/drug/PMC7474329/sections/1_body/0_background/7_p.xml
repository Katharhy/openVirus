<p id="Par8">Several nano-based formulations have been shown to improve the target delivery and therapeutic efficacy of antiviral drugs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In addition, due to the absence of therapeutic choices for various viral infections, many attempts have been done to explore the antiviral activity of natural compounds, such as plant metabolites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, most of the compounds found in plants have poor water solubility and low availability, resulting in a lack of therapeutic effect. In order to improve the therapeutic effect, botanical compounds have been combined with different nano-based carriers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Moreover, nano-based biosensors could be used in diagnostics for the viral infection with high specificity and sensitivity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Another very promising approach is the new generation of vaccines based on different types of nanomaterials, with improved antigen stability, target delivery and controlled-release [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Finally, the use of nanoparticle-based markers can enable the study of the mechanism by which viruses infect host cells [
