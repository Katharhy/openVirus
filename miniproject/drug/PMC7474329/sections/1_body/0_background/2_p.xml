<p id="Par3">The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 shows that around two-thirds of the RNA is composed of replicase 
 <italic>ORF1a/1b</italic>, which encodes 16 non-structural proteins and translates two polyproteins, followed by approximately 13 downstream ORFs. The rest of the viral genome encodes essential structural proteins that are spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This genomic organization is similar to bat-SL-CoVZC45, bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and SARS-CoV, as well as the length of most proteins encoded by these coronaviruses. However, a longer spike (S) protein is encoded by SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to bat SARS-like coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that novel SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infect host cells using the same angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to the surface receptors of host cells are mediated by the S proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Wrapp et al. showed the binding efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 receptors is 10- to 20-fold higher than that observed in SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, it was observed that cells that express ACE2, but not express the enzymes aminopeptidase N and human dipeptidyl peptidase-4, were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 entry [
