<p id="Par7">It is likely that nanotechnology holds huge potential in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Nanotechnology could help the fight against COVID-19 through different approaches, such as avoiding viral contamination and spray by: (a) design of infection-safe personal protective equipment (PPE) to enhance the safety of healthcare workers and development of effective antiviral disinfectants and surface coatings, which are able to inactivate the virus and prevent its spread; (b) design of highly specific and sensitive nano-based sensors to quickly identify the infection or immunological response; (c) development of new drugs, with enhanced activity, decreased toxicity and sustained release, as well as tissue-target, for example, to the lungs; and (d) development of a nano-based vaccination to boost humoral and cellular immune responses.</p>
