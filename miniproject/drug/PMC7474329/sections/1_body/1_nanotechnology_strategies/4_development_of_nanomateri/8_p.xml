<p id="Par23">Despite all the potential of nanomaterials for use in PPE products, the materials must also be evaluated for any side effects, such as skin irritation, allergy, or toxic effects, in humans. On the other hand, the nanoparticles can be released from clothes during the washing process, and they will eventually be released into the environment as waste. They may become a source of contamination, and therefore also need to be appropriately recycled to avoid negative environmental impacts.</p>
