<p id="Par10">COVID-19 is known to be very contagious and has many routes of transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 spread through micro-droplets emitted mainly from person to person or through touching contaminated surfaces. The study by Van Doremalen et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] showed that SARS-CoV-2 has the ability to persist for more than 3 h in aerosolized form. The study of Kampf et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] indicated that, depending on the surface, the human coronavirus can persist for up to 9 days and at temperatures above 30 °C. It is in this context that the use of PPE, disinfectants and sanitizers is extremely important [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of physical and chemical factors to mitigate contamination through the use of masks and hygiene personal care procedures, as well as disinfection of surfaces, especially for frequently touched surfaces, such as door handles, tables, chairs, handrails and switches. Different disinfectant agents are described in the literature, including sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, alcohols, soaps/surfactants, etc. [
