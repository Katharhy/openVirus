<p id="Par12">This is where nanotechnology offers a lot of opportunities for the development of more efficient and promising disinfectant systems. Studies based on nanotechnology for the development of new materials, open perspectives for surfaces with self-cleaning properties [

Also, it can contribute to bringing in additional properties, such as responsive systems, that deliver active substances in response to different stimuli, such as photothermal, electrothermal, photocatalytic and others [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Some metallic nanoparticles are also known to have a broad spectrum of action against viruses and other microorganisms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Rai et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] performed a literature review on the antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral potential of metallic nanoparticles. According to the authors, metallic nanoparticles, especially silver nanoparticles, could be used as a potent and broad-spectrum antiviral agent either with or without surface modification. However, the antiviral activity of these nanoparticles is still largely unexplored.
