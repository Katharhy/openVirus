  <p>Schematic representation of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the nanotechnologies tools to prevent and control COVID-19. The virus entering into cell by the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and use the host cell’s machinery to reproduce and contaminate new host cells. Nano-based materials could help in: (i) enhanced the speed and sensitivity of virus detection; (ii) help in the development of more efficient and safer treatment and vaccines and (iii) improve the safety of healthcare workers through the development of nano-based Personal Protective equipment (PPE)</p>
