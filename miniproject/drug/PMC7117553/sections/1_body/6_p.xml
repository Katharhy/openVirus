<p id="Par8">Physician-derived data from the rheumatology COVID-19 registry will enable rheumatologists to accumulate a rapid, worldwide case series with which to compare trends in COVID-19 outcomes across diseases, therapies and geographical areas. Such data will help the rheumatology community to generate hypotheses regarding risk and therapy and to provide information to physicians and patients in the short-term. Longer term, the data might serve as preliminary information for the design of larger, systematic studies that address outcomes in specific sub-groups of patients or on the management of immunosuppressive therapies during infection. Although the rapid accumulation and dissemination of information is critically important during this pandemic, the alliance also recognizes that the initial data will have limitations and will need to be interpreted conservatively. Issues such as the lack of a control group and a probable reporting bias of more severe cases will limit conclusions about epidemiology and causal inference. The registry will hopefully enable the rapid global exchange of case information to inform the design of studies that can address these important issues in the future.</p>
