<p id="Par7">The rheumatology COVID-19 registry will enable the rapid collection of case information from physicians who treat those with rheumatic diseases and is designed to answer two questions: what are the COVID-19 outcomes among patients with rheumatic diseases, particularly those treated with immunosuppressive therapies; and can we make any inferences regarding the potential harms or benefits of particular immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies in COVID-19 infection? Given the need for global collaboration, data is being collected for the registry through a survey that is accessible to clinicians on the registry website. Data on patient demographics, rheumatic disease phenotypes, comorbidities, immunosuppressive and other drug therapies and COVID-19 outcomes will be collected. The registry has been determined ‘not human subjects research’ under US Federal Guidelines by the University of California, San Francisco Institutional Review Board (IRB): a category that covers activities such as quality improvement and surveillance. No patient identifiers such as name or date of birth will be collected. International partners in Europe and elsewhere are working to address issues related to regional IRBs. Collected data will be rapidly analysed and shared with the rheumatology community.</p>
