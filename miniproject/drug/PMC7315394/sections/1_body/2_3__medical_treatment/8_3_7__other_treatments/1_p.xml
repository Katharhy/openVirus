<p>Vaccines are another promising treatment to prevent or cure specific viruses. Currently, there is no effective vaccine against 2019-nCoV. Fortunately, two COVID-19 vaccines are undergoing clinical trials. The first is Moderna's mRNA-1273, an mRNA vaccine, which started at KPWHRI in Seattle, USA, on March 16, 2020 [

 <xref rid="B238" ref-type="bibr">238</xref>]. The trial was jointly developed and administered by CanSino Biologics Inc. and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences. Ad5-nCoV, a genetically engineered vaccine, expresses the 2019-nCoV S protein using replication-defective adenovirus type 5 as an expression vector, thereby inducing a virus-specific immune response to prevent COVID-19. There are also several other types of COVID-19 vaccines, including deoptimized live attenuated vaccines, protein vaccine, DNA vaccine, RNA vaccine, and subunit vaccine, all of which are in the preclinical stage (

 <xref rid="B239" ref-type="bibr">239</xref>]. Notably, there is a new microneedle array (MNA) approach based on delivering coronavirus S1 subunit vaccines against COVID-19. Expedited by prior experience in developing vaccines against MERS, this approach was developed within 4 weeks and enabled long-term induction of potent virus-specific antibody responses. Significantly, the MNA work can be extended to other emerging infectious diseases. However, these will require further clinical studies for efficacy and safety, which requires more time.
