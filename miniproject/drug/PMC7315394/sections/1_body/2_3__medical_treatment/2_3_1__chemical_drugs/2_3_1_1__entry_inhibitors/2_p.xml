<p>As mentioned above, coronavirus particles comprise four structural proteins: the S, E, M, and N proteins [
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>–
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. The S protein is the most crucial in viral attachment, fusion, and entry [
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. It comprises two subunits. S1 facilitates attachment to the host cell receptor, while S2 mediates membrane fusion of the virion and the host cell. As mentioned above, viruses have specific attachment sites. SARS-CoV recognizes ACE2 as its host receptor, while MERS-CoV recognizes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 [
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Like SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV also targets host ACE2 [
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>–
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Biophysical and structural analysis indicates that the 2019-nCoV S protein binds ACE2 with higher affinity than the SARS-CoV S protein [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, it is vital to target ACE2 for the development of viral entry inhibitors.
