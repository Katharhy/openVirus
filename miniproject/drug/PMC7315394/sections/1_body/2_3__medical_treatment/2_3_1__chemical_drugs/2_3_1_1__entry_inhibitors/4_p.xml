<p>A small antiviral molecule, umifenovir, has entry inhibitory effects on the influenza virus. Umifenovir targets hemagglutinin for its anti-influenza virus effect [
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>–
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Hemagglutinin, a viral cell surface protein, facilitates infection by undergoing a conformational change when the virus binds to host cells [
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Umifenovir interacts with hemagglutinin to stabilize it against low pH-induced conformational change via the formation of an extensive network of noncovalent interactions that prevent hemagglutinin-mediated membrane fusion [

 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. It also interacts with phospholipids by altering membrane fluidity [
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>], which is vital for the fusion process. This is most likely due to umifenovir's molecular interactions (bearing both the H donor and acceptor groups) with the interfacial region of the lipid bilayer by competing for the hydrogen bonding of phospholipid C=O groups with water molecules [
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. This renders lipid bilayers of host cells less prone to viral fusion [
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. No studies have shown that umifenovir is effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV or 2019-nCoV. Wang et al. reported that 4 patients with mild/severe COVID-19 recovered after prescription of combined lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol (umifenovir), and Shufeng Jiedu Capsule (a traditional Chinese medicine) [
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. On the other hand, Dong et al. found in an
