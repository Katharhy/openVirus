<p>To the best of our knowledge, not much is known about ACE2-specific inhibitors that are commercially available or under commercial development [
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. However, ACE2 stimulators have been used in the treatment of hypertension, cardiac diseases, and diabetes mellitus to regulate the renin-angiotensin system [

 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. There are also ACE inhibitors known for treating the diseases mentioned, but these lack inhibitory activity toward ACE2 due to their distinct substrate-binding pockets [

 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. In brief, there are concerns that both ACE2 stimulators and ACE inhibitors can increase the expression of ACE2, which in turn may increase susceptibility to viral host cell entry [
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Much work needs to be done on ACE2-targeting drugs, and controversial issues that lie beyond the treatment pathway need to be addressed soon.
