<p>Ribavirin is a synthetic guanosine nucleoside analog that mimics purines, including inosine and adenosine, and ribavirin has been used in the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus [
 <xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>]. It has only one ring at the heterocyclic base, compared with guanine's two rings. Notably, ribavirin has a ribose sugar moiety with a hydroxyl group at the 2′-carbon position, enabling preferential activity in RNA-related metabolism [

 <xref rid="B169" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. Ribavirin inhibits cellular enzyme and inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase involved in purine nucleotide biosynthesis [

 <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. Ribavirin is also known for its inhibitory effect on viruses by forcing viral genome replication to become catastrophically error-prone. It is likely that as a nucleoside analog, ribavirin is incorporated by RdRp into the newly synthesized viral genome, where it induces mutagenesis [

 <xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. Although ribavirin has proven effective against viral infections, its mechanism of action has not been firmly established, and there are several proposed mechanisms of action that require further validation [

 <xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. Ribavirin was initially used in treating SARS; however, ribavirin treatment lacked an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiviral effect and caused adverse side effects including anemia, hypoxemia, and decreased hemoglobin levels [
 <xref rid="B174" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. However, ribavirin was used as the primary treatment during the MERS outbreak [
 <xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. In general, clinical studies of ribavirin treatment for SARS and MERS did not show strong evidence of efficacy against these coronaviruses [
 <xref rid="B176" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>–
 <xref rid="B178" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. There have been no studies of ribavirin's efficacy against COVID-19. Therefore, the use of ribavirin remains controversial and requires more investigation for a better understanding of its mechanism of action, efficacy, and toxicity, even though it is a widely available drug.
