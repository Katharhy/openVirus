<p>In the section Protease Inhibitors, we mentioned that RdRp is released upon successful priming. RdRp is a necessary polymerase that catalyzes the replication of RNA from an RNA template for coronaviruses [
 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. Release of RdRp from the virus initiates the synthesis of a full negative-strand RNA template to be used by RdRp to replicate more viral genomic RNA, which eventually turns host cells into virus factories [
 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. Therefore, RdRp is an attractive therapeutic target to prevent host cells from producing viruses.
