<p>Proteases are essential enzymes that regulate cell life processes such as cell growth and death, blood clotting, inflammation, fertilization, and infection [
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Viral entry into host cells requires S protein priming by host proteases, which subsequently enables the fusion of viral and cellular membranes [
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Membrane fusion enables the release of the viral genome into the host cytoplasm, initiating RNA translation into protein. Most viruses also encode their proteases to protect viral proteins by modulating host cell responses. While proteases are vital for cell life processes, they have become promising targets for antiviral therapeutic agents. Protease inhibitors prevent viral replication by binding selectively to viral proteases or blocking proteolytic cleavage of protein precursors necessary for the production of infectious particles [
