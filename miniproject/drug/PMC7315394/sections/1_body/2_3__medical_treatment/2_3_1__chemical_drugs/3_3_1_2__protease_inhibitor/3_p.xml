<p>Camostat mesylate is a small molecule that has shown an excellent therapeutic effect for chronic pancreatitis treatment by targeting proteases [
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. Camostat mesylate primarily inhibits enzymatic autodigestion of the pancreas [
 <xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic> studies on rats with pancreatic fibrosis showed that camostat mesylate inhibits inflammation, cytokine expression, and fibrosis in the pancreas [
 <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. It has an additional clinical benefit for pancreatic pain by preventing enzyme-evoked activation of pain receptors [
 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. As mentioned above, the TMPRSS family, especially TMRPSS2, is most likely the protease targeted by a coronavirus. Camostat mesylate inhibits TMPRSS2 activity on primate cells 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, completely blocking membrane fusion between the host cell and the viral MERS-CoV particle [
 <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. Zhou et al. claimed that camostat mesylate displays an inhibitory effect in mice for SARS-CoV infection [
 <xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. Recent research by Hoffmann et al. showed a promising 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibitory effect of this serine protease inhibitor in SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV on human lung cells, showing potential as a viable option for COVID-19 treatment [
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Unfortunately, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> data for camostat mesylate against coronaviruses are limited. More investigation is required to evaluate camostat mesylate as a potential therapeutic against COVID-19.
