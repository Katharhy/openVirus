<p>There are three general approaches to develop potential antiviral treatments of the human coronavirus. Firstly, standard assays may be used to evaluate existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. Secondly, chemical libraries containing existing compounds or databases may be screened. Thirdly, specific, new medications based on the genome and biophysical understanding of 2019-nCoV can be designed and optimized. Therefore, this section will discuss some of the potential 2019-nCoV therapeutics obtained through these general approaches. Besides chemical and biologic drugs commonly used in antiviral therapies, we further elaborate on how nanomaterials, nutritional interventions, traditional Chinese medicine, and stem cell therapy can be potentially used for treatment or as an adjuvant to reduce the mortality and morbidity rate of 2019-nCoV patients. Finally, to end this section, we highlight vaccines as a key therapeutic option to eradicate COVID-19 through herd immunity without getting the disease.</p>
