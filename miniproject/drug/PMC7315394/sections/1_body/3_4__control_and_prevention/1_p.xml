<p>As the most recent pandemic, COVID-19 induces much fear. It is highly infectious and is transmitted asymptomatically. As such, our best options to slow and prevent transmission are to understand the origin of 2019-nCoV, its transmission route, and associated disease pathways and systems. Generally, a pathogen must remain viable outside the host to allow for environmental spread [

As of now, COVID-19 is thought to be transmitted directly from person-to-person through liquid (droplets) and, more importantly, transmitted indirectly via contact with contaminated surfaces. 2019-nCoV remains viable for a fairly long period outside the human body (up to 72 hours) and is more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard [
 <xref rid="B241" ref-type="bibr">241</xref>]. Therefore, aerosol and fomite transmission of 2019-nCoV is possible, as the virus lingers among particles or fibers, in airborne liquid droplets, and on surfaces, in some cases for days [
 <xref rid="B241" ref-type="bibr">241</xref>]. Although there are currently insufficient data on the inactivation of environmental 2019-nCoV, data from other coronaviruses can be used as a reference. However, it should be noted that biocidal agents may only limit the survival of coronavirus in critical environments and have no efficacy for infected patients.
