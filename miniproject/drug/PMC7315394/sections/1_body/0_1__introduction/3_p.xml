<p>A typical CoV genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA (+ssRNA) (~30 kb) enclosed by a 5′-cap and 3′-poly-A tail [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The genome size of 2019-nCoV is 29,891 nucleotides, encoding 9860 amino acids, with a G+C content of 38% [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The 2019-nCoV genome contains two flanking untranslated regions (UTRs) on 5′- and 3′-terminals, one single long open reading frame

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(c)</xref>). The first ORF (ORF
 <italic>1a/b</italic>) is about two-thirds of the whole-genome length and encodes the 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16). The other one-third of the genome contains four ORFs encoding the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, whereas other ORFs encode accessory proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref> and (c)). Most of the nonstructural proteins are essential for 2019-nCoV replication, while structural proteins are responsible for virion assembly and viral infection [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The M and E proteins are required in viral assembly, while the N protein involves RNA genome assembly.
