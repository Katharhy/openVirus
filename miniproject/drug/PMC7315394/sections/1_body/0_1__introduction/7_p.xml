<p>Currently, there are no effective antiviral drugs or specific vaccines against COVID-19. Thus, there is an urgent need for rapid detection to prevent further spread, to reduce the intensity of the pandemic, and to slow the increase in cases. Recently, several new technologies, including LAMP-LFA, RPA-LFA, RPA-CRISPR, and other nanomaterial-based IgG/IgM kits, have been adopted for 2019-nCoV detection. A significant number of drug candidates, including chemical drugs, biological drugs, nutritional interventions, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), have been proposed for clinical trials after the 2019-nCoV outbreak. In this review, we concentrate on the most significant developments in 2019-nCoV detection and provide an overview of medical treatments and vaccines currently in development to combat and contain the disease.</p>
