<p>Although some COVID-19 patients show no symptoms, most patients have some common symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, sputum production, shortness of breath, sore throat, and headache. In some severe cases, infections can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and death. According to the WHO-China joint report [

People over 60 years of age and those with hypertension, diabetes, or cardiovascular diseases are at high risk for severe illness and death. In comparison, children under 19 years appear to be infected minimally by 2019-nCoV (around 2.4% of all reported cases). Based on the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) report (from 72,314 patient records, dated 11 February 2020), among the confirmed cases, 86.6% of patients are 30-79 years of age, 80.9% of patients have mild-to-moderate disease, 13.8% have a severe illness, and 6.1% are critically ill [
