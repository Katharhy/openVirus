<p>Previous coronavirus epidemics like SARS and MERS have expedited the process of finding useful diagnostic and therapies against 2019-nCoV. It is of paramount importance for all countries to share essential information about 2019-nCoV to mitigate its spread. Because of this strategic approach, research has been mobilized to rapidly develop diagnostic methods and worldwide implementation to minimize the impact of the pandemic. Practical diagnostic tests have aided management and contact tracing of COVID-19 cases in hotspot areas. In this regard, molecular virological techniques have assisted the scientific community in characterizing infectious agents for years. These include qRT-PCR, isothermal amplification, and CRISPR technology.</p>
