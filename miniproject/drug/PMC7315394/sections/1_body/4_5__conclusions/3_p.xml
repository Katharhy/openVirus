<p>Despite these signs of progress, the present data suggest that current public health policies and improved diagnostic measures alone may not be sufficient to eradicate COVID-19 in the short term. Efficacious and novel treatments are desperately required. Presently, large numbers of ongoing clinical trials of various drugs may succeed in minimizing morbidity and mortality. We have highlighted several of them in this review. Some are highly promising, while others may require more time to demonstrate usefulness. While some drug candidates appear promising and have been used in treating COVID-19 patients in desperation, it does not necessarily mean that they are proven safe and efficacious in the long run. As such, stringent criteria must be established by health regulatory agencies. However, in the long term, vaccines and prophylactics may be required to curb the spread of 2019-nCoV.</p>
