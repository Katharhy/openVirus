<p>On the other hand, serological assays for antibodies and antigens present essential tools to obtain valuable information about prior exposure to 2019-nCoV and the prevalence of infection. These include ELISA and LFA technologies. Serological screening also enables novel vaccines to be assessed and supports the design of functional vaccine approaches. Other approaches, including chest computed tomography (CT) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), can boost existing detection approaches. Notably, there has been a marked increase in the use of both CT and TEM to detect 2019-nCoV and other coronaviruses. These complimentary tools reveal the progression of suspected infection, which cannot be accomplished by conventional diagnostic means. Nonetheless, there is a pressing need for continuous development of rapid, accurate diagnostic devices and strategies to characterize unknown respiratory pathogens.</p>
