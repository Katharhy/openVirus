<p>Mechanistically, TEM operates based on interactions between electrons emitted from a source and materials under examination. In the present context, it is usually 2019-nCoV in a cellular sample [
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. The detector collects a multitude of signals from transmitted electrons, before processing them to reveal viral morphology and location within cells [
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Typical specimen preparation for TEM includes sample fixation, embedding, sectioning, staining, and loading onto the TEM copper grids [

 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. 2019-nCoV sampling typically uses supernatants from patient airway epithelial cells. Infected cells are fixed and dehydrated before embedding in resin. A negatively stained, film-coated grid for examination is similarly prepared for contrast enhancement. 2019-nCoV virus particles seen with TEM are shown [
