<p>In a bold, novel approach, a team of infectious disease experts in Singapore utilized an ELISA against 2019-nCoV to ascertain that suspected subjects were infected with COVID-19 and discovered the connection between two COVID-19 clusters in the local community [

Using blood samples taken from alleged COVID-19 patients, the researchers detected antibodies targeting the spike protein that prevented the virus from killing cells in laboratory tests. They verified that a couple allegedly infected with COVID-19 had the disease because they had exceedingly elevated levels of virus-specific antibodies in their blood. Interestingly, PCR tests on the couple yielded negative results. Because the couple had recovered from the 2019-nCoV infection, they had no viral genetic materials in their bodies, but the antibodies persisted. There were also other reports of using ELISA to diagnose 2019-nCoV infection [
