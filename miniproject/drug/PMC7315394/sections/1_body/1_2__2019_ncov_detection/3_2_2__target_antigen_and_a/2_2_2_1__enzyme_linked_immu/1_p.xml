<p>Early diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection is of utmost importance both for medical teams to manage patients effectively and for policymakers to curb the viral spread. Presently, ELISA in cell culture extracts has proven to be the working “gold standard” for laboratory diagnosis of 2019-nCoV [

ELISA techniques depend on specific antibodies to bind target antigens and a detection system to indicate the presence of antigen binding. In an ELISA, an antigen must be immobilized to a solid surface and then complexed with an antibody that is linked to an enzyme. Detection is accomplished by assessing the conjugated enzyme activity after incubation with a substrate to produce a measurable product [
