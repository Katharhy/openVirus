<p>As mentioned above, the primary diagnostic methods are virological detection involving viral nucleic acids. Another approach to detection is with serological assays that measure antigens or antibodies present in the host. Such testing provides vital information about host exposure to 2019-nCoV and is useful for detection and surveillance purposes. For instance, this method greatly helps medical professionals to determine whether some recovered patients have a higher risk of reinfection. However, the disadvantage is that one should be cautioned that in the early stages of COVID-19 infection, the host's antibodies are often not within the detectable range of serological test kits. Besides, there was no proven evidence on the duration of IgM or IgG antibodies circulating in the host after recovery. It could be merely a short time frame for detection. As such, serological tests should not be solely used for COVID-19 diagnosis.</p>
