<p>RT-PCR is considered the gold standard to detect nucleic acids extracted from 2019-nCoV specimens qualitatively. Positive results indicate infection with 2019-nCoV. RT-PCR is an advanced technique for coronavirus detection because of its optimized sensitivity, specificity, and simplicity for quantitative assay [

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It provides accurate and reliable identification for confirmed and suspected cases. There are many commercial 2019-nCoV detecting kits with oligonucleotide primers and probes (SYBR Green or TaqMan chemistries) for detecting double genes of 2019-nCoV (nucleocapsid N gene and ORF

Recently, Roche (Indiana, USA) developed two automated cobas® 2019-nCoV test systems: cobas® 6800 and cobas® 8800 (approved in testing patient samples by the US FDA), which can process up to 384 results and 1056 results in an 8-hour shift, respectively [

The tests produce results in about 3.5 h and can process up to 4128 results in 24 h, boosting screening capacity to help restrain the sudden growing epidemic in the USA. RT-PCR is widely applicable to 2019-nCoV detection in the clinic, but limitations of this technology are obvious, such as high false-negative rate and low sensitivity. False-negative results may occur due to the following factors: first, mutations in the primers and probe-target regions in the 2019-nCoV genome [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; second, low viral load present in test specimens, improper extraction of nucleic acid from clinical samples, or inappropriate restrictions on sample collection, transportation, or handling [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Real-time RT-PCR has been adopted as the gold standard diagnostic approach for 2019-nCoV worldwide. However, RT-PCR is time-consuming (4-6 h) and requires well-equipped laboratories and skilled technicians, thereby limiting full deployment in developing countries.
