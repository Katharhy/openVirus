<p>Isothermal amplification technology has been developed to eliminate the need for a high-precision instrument in RT-PCR assays. This approach can amplify DNA at isothermal conditions without a thermocycler [

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In NASBA and TMA assays, input RNA is converted to a double-stranded DNA intermediate with a promoter region. Detection of RNA using DNA polymerase-based amplification requires a reverse transcriptase step. LAMP and RPA do not require thermal or chemical melting with the aid of enzymes. Combined with a visual detection platform, such as a lateral flow assay (LFA) or organic dyes, LAMP and RPA have been widely employed in viral detection kits.
