<p>LAMP is a rapid, one-step amplification technique that amplifies nucleic acids with high sensitivity and specificity at an optimal temperature of 65Â°C [

LAMP employs six primers to amplify targeted genes by creating stem-loop structures that promote new DNA synthesis using a DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity. The two inner primers (FIP, BIP) and two outer primers (F3, B3), along with loop structures (LF, LB), create multiple initiating sites in the growing DNA products, enabling rapid amplification. LAMP is also highly specific since the amplification reaction occurs only when the primers correctly recognize all six regions. A reverse transcriptase step is included in the LAMP reaction to allow RNA targets to be detected [
