<p>Microfluidics, combined with enzyme-DNA nanostructures, is also applied to detecting 2019-nCoV. Ho et al. developed a modular detection platform (termed enVision) consisting of an integrated circuit of enzyme-DNA nanostructures for direct and versatile detection of pathogen nucleic acids from infected cells [

The assay is fast (&lt;2 h), sensitive (limit of detection &lt; 10 attmol), and readily quantified with smartphones. Recently, they adopted the enVision microfluidic system to detect 2019-nCoV [
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Preliminary results showed that the enVision platform is sensitive, accurate, fast (within 0.5-1 h), and inexpensive (less than $1 per test kit). This novel platform works at room temperature and does not require a heater or special pumps, and it uses a minimal amount of samples, making it highly portable. However, this platform needs to be further validated with real clinical samples.
