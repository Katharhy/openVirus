For a friendly consulting and further investigations, all the compounds here described, endowed with the respective accessory information, are available also through anti-HCoVS, a dedicated web based resource, available at 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bigdatainhealth.org/letsbe/anti-HCoV.php" id="intref0090" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://bigdatainhealth.org/letsbe/anti-HCoV.php</ext-link>. This resource was designed to offer a comprehensive collection of natural compounds that resulted effective against human coronaviruses. The goal was to define a collection of natural compounds documented to be effective in coronaviruses absorption and replication. All data can be friendly searchable and all references are also crosslinked to the respective journal website. Moreover, compounds that can have multiple purposes can be easily identified, supporting validation of possible efficacy on multiple targets, but also to proof specificity of action.
