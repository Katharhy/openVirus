<p id="p0280">Moreover, Zhang et al. in 2020 (
 <xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">Zhang, Wu, et al., 2020</xref>), performed a literature search for natural compounds that resulted to be bioactive against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. They identified 13 natural compounds that were analyzed by protein structure computational approaches, based on the docking methodology, to identify possible direct interactions with SARS-CoV2 proteins and, therefore, possibly inhibiting their activity (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> a) (
 <xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">Zhang, Wu, et al., 2020</xref>). Independently, the authors reported the 26 herbs from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology database (

 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>b). The authors also evaluated the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the compounds, after boiling in water and oral assumption, based on the traditional chinese medical treatments (
 <xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">Zhang, Wu, et al., 2020</xref>). Since the authors did not list the specific compounds per herb in their work, we re-analyzed the different databases to identify the exact correspondence (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>b), so that we could report the complete list also in 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>. Specifically, starting from the list of the 13 natural compounds identified by the authors we cross-searched for these compounds in the three databases they indicated in their work, i.e. the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology database (

 <xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">Zhang, Wu, et al. (2020)</xref>, and, therefore, we could report the compound and the corresponding herbal plants (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>b).
