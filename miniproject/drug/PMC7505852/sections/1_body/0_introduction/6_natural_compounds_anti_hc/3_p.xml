<p id="p0170">Interestingly, the bioactivity assays revealed a strong antiviral activity influenced by the chemical structure of the selected compounds. For instance, considering the friedelane derivatives, the antiviral activity of the two epimers, 3β-friedelanol and 3α-friedelanol, was substantially affected by a different orientation of the C-3 proton. Moreover, the comparison of 3β-friedelanol and 3β-acetoxy friedelane suggested the involvement of the acetyl group in the reduction of the activity.</p>
