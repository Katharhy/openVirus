<p id="p0220">In 2014, Sun et al. (
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2014</xref>) tested the sinefungin activity against SARS-CoV. The sinefungin, isolated from 
 <italic>Streptomyces species</italic>, known for its antifungal, antiviral and antiparasitic activity, is able to inhibit DNA methyltransferase. It was demostrated, in a yeast cell system, that sinefungin was more effective against coronavirus RNA guanine-N7-methyltransferase (expressed in 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strain YBS40) than on human N7-MTase (yeast-based assays for the high-throughput screening of inhibitors of coronavirus RNA cap guanine-N7-methyltransferase) indicating its possible useful effect on the viral replication and subgenome expression (
