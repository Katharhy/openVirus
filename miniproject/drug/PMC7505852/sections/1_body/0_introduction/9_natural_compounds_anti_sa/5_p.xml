 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Keyaerts et al., 2007</xref>). The authors analyzed the role of plant lectins against SARS-CoV. Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins capable of specific recognition and reversible binding. The specificity of lectins versus different carbohydrates determines their anti-viral properties. Since SARS-CoV spike protein is heavily glycosylated, the coronavirus infectivity can be inhibited by lectins, that specifically bind to glycans. The screening of many plant lectins tested on Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV (Frankfurt 1 strain) led to the selection of SARS-CoV specific antiviral lectins. The lectins selected in the work included those specifically binding mannose, glucose, galactose, N-acetyl glucosamine and N-acetyl galactosamine. The highest anti-coronavirus activity was found among mannose-specific lectins. In the SARS-CoV spike protein there are 12 N-glycosylation sites. Two of the four sugars attached to four of these N-glycosylation sites were found to be mannose (
