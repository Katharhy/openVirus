<p id="p0260">In 2012, Park et al. (
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2012</xref>) studied the role of diarylheptanoids isolated from the stem bark of 
 <italic>Alnus japonica</italic> were found to be inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro, using a recombinant vector expressed in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. Interestingly, at the same concentration, no detectable inhibition of the other Coronavirus protease (3CLpro) was observed. The most effective inhibitor of PLpro was the hirsutenone (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 4.1 μM). Moreover, differently from the others derivatives, hirsutenone resulted an efficient inhibitor of also the other protease, 3CLpro (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 36.1 μM). The structure activity analyses revealed that catechol and α, β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety in the molecule were fundamental factors influencing its inhibitory actions against PLpro (
