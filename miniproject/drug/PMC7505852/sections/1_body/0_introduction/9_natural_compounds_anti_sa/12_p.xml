<p id="p0245">In 2005, Li et al. (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2005</xref>) massively screened over 200 medicinal herbs, that were reported as useful against viral infection, looking for possible anti SARS-CoV medicaments. They infected Vero E6 and HepG2 cells, an immortal cell line derived from hepatocellular carcinoma, with two different strains of SARS-CoV (BJ001, BJ006). They found that the extracts

The antiviral activities against SARS-CoV infected cells was evaluated using the MTS vitality assay in comparison with cells that were not infected by the virus. After the addition of active compounds, the viral infection and replication was sharply reduced resulting in and increased cell vitality. Nevertheless, the mechanism of antiviral activity of these active compounds has yet to be define.
