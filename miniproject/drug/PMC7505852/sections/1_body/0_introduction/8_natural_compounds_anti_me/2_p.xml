<p id="p0180">In 2017, Lin et al. (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2017</xref>) described the role of stilbene derivatives against MERS-CoV infection. In particular, they focused on the role of resveratrol, as a natural compound present in different plants, including cranberry (

 <italic>Polygonum cuspidatum</italic>). Previous studies already demonstrated the antiviral role of resveratrol against SARS-CoV, but also positive effects against bacterial infections, only reduced in case of
