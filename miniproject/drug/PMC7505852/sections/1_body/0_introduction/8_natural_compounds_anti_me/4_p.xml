<p id="p0190">In 2017, Park et al. (
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2017</xref>) focused on the role of polyphenols extracted from 
 <italic>Broussonetia papyrifera</italic> against MERS/SARS-CoV proteases. The authors expressed the viral 3CL and PLpro in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and performed an inhibition assay to evaluate viral proteases activity after exposure to 10 plant root derived glucosidase inhibitors (
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>). They found that all isolated polyphenols can inhibit both 3CL and PLpro proteases, and that, among them, papyriflavonol A has its highest activity against PLpro (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.7 μM) (
