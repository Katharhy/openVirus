<p id="p0140">The N protein functions primarily by binding the viral genome and organizing it as a nucleocapsid. Putatively, it can also contribute to the virion formation. The M protein defines the shape of the envelope, promotes the final viral assembly, and together with the E protein forms the envelope. The E protein is the smallest viral protein inside the infected cells, but only a small portion is incorporated into the virion envelope. The S protein mediates the attachment of the virus to the host cell membrane receptor (
