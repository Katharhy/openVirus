<p id="p0160">When the virus binds its receptor, the S-priming, i.e. the cleavage of the S protein, may occur through specific transmembrane proteases, like protease serine 2 (TMPRRS2), with cathepsin B and L (CatB/L) also contributing in the process in SARS-CoV2 (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Hoffmann et al., 2020</xref>). The entrance of the virus occurs via endocytosis or simply via membrane fusion, and the release of the viral genome into the cytosol appears to take place through acidification. Subsequently, the viral RNA overlapping ORFs forming the ORF1ab are translated, exploiting the host apparatus. The two resulting polyproteins, the replicases 1a (pp1a) and 1b (pp1b), undergo the autoproteolytic processing by 3CLPro and PLPro generating components of the replication/transcription complex (RTC): mature replicases and other non structural proteins. Once the RTC of the virus is assembled, it can start replication process. The replication process gives rise to a full-length viral RNA genome which functions as a template for the new viral genomes and for subgenomic RNAs coding for viral structural proteins (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bergmann et al., 2006</xref>). Here copies of the viral genome, forming the nucleocapside with the N proteins, contribute to formation of the viral-like particles (VLPs), together with M and E proteins, that produce the CoV envelopes. Mature virions, included in cell endosomes are released by exocytosis.
