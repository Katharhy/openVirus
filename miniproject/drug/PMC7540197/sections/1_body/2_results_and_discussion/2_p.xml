<p id="p0040">Binding affinities and major interactions between SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease and tropane alkaloids from Schizanthus porrigens were obtained using Autodock Vina. Binding affinities were compared with those obtained with Lopinavir as inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease. The binding affinity obtained from 6WX4 binding with the Lopinavir and tropane alkaloids from Schizanthus porrigens are shown in 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> . The binding affinity values vary from −5.6 to −7.5 kcal/mol. Discovery Studio 2020 Client software was used to illustrate the molecular interactions between active site SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease and the ligands. The ligands showed the expected interactions with the amino acids present in active site of protein, which implies powerful antagonistic properties towards SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease. Exhibiting the highest binding affinity Schizantina Z with a value of −7.5 kcal/mol followed by Schizantina Y with a binding energy value of −7.1 kcal/mol. The ligands with the lowest values obtained in this study correspond to ligands 3 and 4 with binding affinity that −5.7 kcal/mol and −5.6 kcal/mol respectively. In general, the binding affinity values of Schizantin Z and Schizantin Y obtained from the set of 4 tropane alkaloids from Schizanthus porrigens suggest that they can be used as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease. The binding energies of all compounds are close to that of the reference ligand, except for compounds 3 and 4. As shown in

 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows that all of tropane alkaloids from Schizanthus porrigens that form hydrogen bonds with the key amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease. Natural products provide a source for the development of new antiviral drugs 
 <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Identifying the antiviral mechanisms of these natural agents has shed light on where they interact with the virus life cycle, such as viral entry, replication, assembly, and release, as well as on the goal of virus-specific interactions and host

 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. This is vital since several proteins have recently been described that play a key role in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and that are considered possible pharmacological targets. These include in addition to the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease considered in the present study, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease Mpro

Therefore, it should be borne in mind that the best candidate for a drug against SARS-CoV-2 is the molecule that can specifically bind to one of the pharmacological targets mentioned above to form a thermodynamically stable complex, this is a compound with the energy of highest possible binding expressed in terms of Gibbs free energy variation (ΔG)

The results of virtual detection of two tropane alkaloids from Schizanthus porrigens based on molecular docking scores, hydrogen bridge interactions, and Lipinski's rule of five suggest that they are potential inhibitors of the major protease SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease, which is essential for virus maturation and infectivity

Schizanthine Z is the best drug candidate between the two successes since, in addition to fully obeying Lipinski's rules, it exhibits the highest binding energy. Schizanthine Z, being the one with the highest docking score and the most favorable pharmacokinetics was subjected to a molecular dynamics simulation. Schizanthine Y was also subjected to a molecular dynamics simulation since it was the next best candidate.
