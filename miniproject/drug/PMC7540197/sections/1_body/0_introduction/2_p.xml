<p id="p0030">Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and therefore this new virus has been given the name severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Coronaviruses non-structural polyprotein is processed by two proteases, the main protease (Mpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro), inhibition of PLpro affects virus replication through poor viral protein processing and can also affect activities of other PLpro 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Other PLpro that can be affected are desubiquitination proteases, which recognize ubiquitin through an enzymatic ubiquitin binding site and can specifically bind and cleave polyubiquitin by binding to diubiquitin through the ubiquitin active site, in contrast, SARS PLpro recognizes Lys48 bound polyubiquitin through ubiquitin binding sites and is, therefore, capable of directly removing Lys48 bound diubiquitin from substrates 
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Maiti (2020) reports that the PLpro encoded by SARS-CoV-2 has a labile Zn site formed by the amino acids Cys189, Cys192, Cys224 and Cys226 and a classic catalytic site formed by the amino acids Cys111, His272 and Asp286, which play key functions for viral replication and represents promising drug targets, because sulfur-based drugs such as peptide-based inhibitors can block Cys residues at the catalytic site or Zn site of CoV-2-PLpro, which leads to CoV-2-PLpro dysfunction and thus stops viral replication 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Moreover, de-ISGylation proteases 
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and innate anti-host immunity reactions can also be affected, PLpro comprises a central catalytic domain and the ubiquitin-like domain, which interferes with the host's antiviral pathways and modulates the immune response of the host, furthermore PLpro subdomains showed different reaction patterns in presence or absence of ubiquitin, lastly, it should be mentioned that PLpro was an important drug target against several Coronaviruses, including MERS CoV 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Freitas et al (2020) reported that naphthalene-based PLpro inhibitors are effective against SARS-CoV-2 
 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, other researchers have also reported that a naphthalene derivative inhibited SARS-CoV-2 PLpro 
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Due to the above, the search for new drug prospects is the most reliable option to design an efficient therapy for infected patients without delay 
 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, because the development of vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus can take many months. Furthermore, virus-encoded peptide-based vaccines may not be effective against future coronavirus epidemics, as virus mutations could render them useless 
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In the pharmaceutical industry the development and discovery of new drugs is the main driver of it. In the past, the design of drugs was directly related to Chemistry of natural products, which were later modified by organic synthesis. Currently, the development of more powerful and efficient computers has allowed the generation of methodologies and simulations that have optimized this process 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, Natural Products Chemistry continues to be a source for obtaining drugs, for example, S. porrigens Graham is an herbaceous plant that grows only in humid soils in northern Chile (IV Region) 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Studies on Schizanthus have shown that a series of tropane-derived alkaloids accumulate in this genus 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, which have anticholinergic activity 
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, antiemetic 
 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, anesthetics 
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, mydriatics 
 <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, antispasmodics 
 <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, bronchodilators 
 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and antivirals 
 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Species Schizanthus porrigens, native to Chile and Argentina 
 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, was chosen as source of potential inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease, which have not yet been investigated, choosing molecular docking for carry out the investigation in silico of tropane alkaloids of Schizanthus porrigens since this method predicts the orientation of a ligand that binds to a protein forming a stable complex and the strength of the bonds generated between them 
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Molecular docking is one of the most frequently used methods in the design of structure-based drugs, due to the ability to predict the conformation of the ligand to the binding site 
 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Kandeel et al (2020) investigated PLpro use of SARS-CoV-2 to select virtually 1,697 FDA-approved clinical drugs, finding that Losartan, Montelukast Sodium, Quercitrin, Zanamivir, NAD1, Candesartan, Chlorhexidine chlorhydrate and Fostamatinib disodium exhibited binding energy superiors to −7.5 kcal/mol 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and within the natural compounds Laskar and Choudhury (2020) repot Baicalin, Quercetin, Licoleafol, Biopterin, Luteolin and Rutin with binding energy equal to or greater than −25 kcal/mol 
 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The characterization of the protein ligand bond in the cases of viral proteins plays an important role in the search for drugs 
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Thus the objective of this work was the identification of potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease from tropane alkaloids from Schizanthus porrigens using molecular docking.
