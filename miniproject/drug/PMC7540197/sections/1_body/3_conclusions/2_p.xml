<p id="p0045">The development of new drugs to treat COVID-19 is of vital importance to design an efficient therapy, because development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 virus can take many months. Furthermore, virus-encoded peptide-based vaccines may not be effective against future coronavirus epidemics, as virus mutations could render them useless. While researchers are looking for molecules with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity using organic synthesis techniques, another way is to promote chemistry research on natural products. Considering the enormous amount of existing phytocomposites, we can refer to computational chemistry to help in the study of different plant activities such as Schizanthus porrigens candidates from the set of 4 tropane alkaloids from Schizanthus porrigens using molecular docking and ADME properties. The reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease with 4 tropane alkaloids from Schizanthus porrigens showed that the most stable complex is obtained with Schizanthine Z with a binding affinity value of −7.5 kcal/mol, followed by Schizanthine Y with −7.1 kcal/mol. Finally, Lipinski's rule of five based on ADME analysis and molecular dynamics simulation confirms that Schizanthine Z is the best candidate for the drug, which is why it is recommended for in vitro tests.</p>
