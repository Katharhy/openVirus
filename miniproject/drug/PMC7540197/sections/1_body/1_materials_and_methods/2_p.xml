 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The crystalline structure of the papain-like protease was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/" id="ir010" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.rcsb.org/</ext-link>) code 6WX4 
 <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The water molecules together with the VIR251 ligand were removed and then the hydrogen atoms were added to the protein to correct the ionization of the amino acid residues of the protein using the Discovery Studio 2020 Client program 
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, in order to prepare the protein to effect molecular docking. The obtained protein was saved in pdb format and imported into the PyRx program 
 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> to perform the molecular docking, which was carried out with the Autodock Vina program 
 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows complex between SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease and inhibitor VIR251. 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> shows the 2D structure of tropane alkaloids from Schizanthus porrigens, which were imported from the ChemDraw 3D program 
 <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> in sdf format. The most stable conformer was determined with the PyPx program 
 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, then the ADME properties (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) were analyzed using the SwissADME database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.swissadme.ch/" id="ir015" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.swissadme.ch/</ext-link>) 
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Since the main objective in molecular docking is to evaluate protein–ligand interactions to predict binding affinity 
 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, Autodock Vina 
 <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and PyRx 
 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> were used to determine the orientations of the ligands in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease, according to those reported by Rut et al. (2020), deep hydrophobic pocket formed by the residues Asp164, Met208, Pro247, Pro248, Tyr264, Tyr268, Tyr273 y Thr301 was considered as active site 
 <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Discovery Studio 2020 Client software 
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> was used to determine and illustrate the intermolecular interactions between tropane alkaloids and residues of active site SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease. The molecular dynamics simulation was performed using NAMD v.2.14 
 <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> with CHARMM36 force field 
 <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Then each structure was converted to a psf protein structure file by automatic psf generation plugin within the VMD v program. 1.9.3 
 <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The simulation was carried out with 5000 steps that were carried out for all the atoms of the system to ensure the elimination of any residual steric shock 
 <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Then, the structure was simulated at a constant temperature of 310 K and a pressure of 1 atm using Langevin dynamics
