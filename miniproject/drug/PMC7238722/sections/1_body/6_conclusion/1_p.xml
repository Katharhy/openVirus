<p>Currently, COVID-19 continues to spread. Latest estimates of the replication number remain well above two, so proliferation will continue. Healthcare providers will play aÂ major role in the early identification and isolation of infected patients, important measures to prevent dissemination. Measures to prevent nosocomial spread are also paramount to control. Finally, while treatment is largely supportive, the scientific community is working ceaselessly to develop interventions and vaccines to end this outbreak. Health professionals need to stay abreast of all these developments.</p>
