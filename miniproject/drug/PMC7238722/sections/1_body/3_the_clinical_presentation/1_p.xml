<p>Human to human transmission was realized early in the SARS pandemic. Primary symptoms included fever, cough and dyspnea [

Healthcare facilities served as a reservoir for the virus, with many healthcare workers sustaining infections. It is theorized that nosocomial spread occurred because the human receptor for the SARS spike glycoprotein occurs in the lower respiratory tract. Hence, most patients present with pneumonia rather than upper respiratory tract symptoms. Viral shedding occurs about 10 days after initial infection, when most patients were already hospitalized. Then, interventions such as nebulizer treatments, oxygen, intubation and mechanical ventilation contributed to aerosolization of the virus, with increased risk of iatrogenic infection [
