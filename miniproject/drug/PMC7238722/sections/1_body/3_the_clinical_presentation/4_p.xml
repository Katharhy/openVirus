<p>The adult patients in the Wuhan study had a mean incubation period of 5.2 days, with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. At onset, the epidemic grew exponentially, doubling in size every 7.4 days. The basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2, meaning “that on average, each patient has been spreading infection to 2.2 other people” [
