<p>In the care of critically ill patients, where airborne transmission is possible, recommended personable protective gear includes fluid-resistant gowns, gloves, eye protection, full face shield and fit-tested N‑95 respirators. Hair covers or hoods should also be worn. Longer sleeved gloves are preferred to prevent wrist exposure in the case of glove slippage. If necessary, vertical tape strips can be applied to keep gloves in place. Circumferential taping is not advised as it may make glove and gown removal more difficult. Full face protection with a shield is preferred. If not available, goggles or side shields are needed. Scrubs or full coveralls should be worn under the personal protective gear. Shoes worn should be impermeable to fluids and capable of being decontaminated. Shoe covers can increase the risk of self-contamination during removal. Strict hand hygiene must be performed after removal of protective equipment. Wax and Christian advised that infection control coaches should be used in some circumstances of equipment removal, such as after a “code blue.” The coaches go through a checklist as the equipment is removed, to reduce the risk of self-contamination [
