<p>Coronaviruses include aÂ large number of viruses found in animals. Human coronaviruses were first identified in the 1960s, isolated from patients with mild upper respiratory infections [

Since then, additional human coronaviruses have been discovered, including the causative agents of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The first human coronaviruses identified cause approximately one third of mild upper respiratory infections in humans. In immunocompromised hosts and children, however, they can result in severe pneumonia and bronchiolitis [
