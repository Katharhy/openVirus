  <p>Lifecycle of SARS-CoV-2. The attachment occurs at ACE2, followed by release of viral RNA into the cytoplasm. The replicase (REP) complex is responsible for RNA replication. RNA and the translated nucleocapsid (N) protein form nucleocapsids, while the spike (S), envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins go through the ERâ€“Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and Golgi before the assembly of virus particles takes place on the plasma membrane from where mature virions are released.</p>
