<p>The virion structure has been studied by cryo-electron tomography and microscopy, showing the prominent club-shaped spike projections on spherical particles of approximately 125 nm in diameter [
 <xref rid="B44-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The N protein is helically symmetrical, with both N- and C-terminal domains needed for optimal encapsulation of the RNA genome [
 <xref rid="B46-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The transcription regulation sequences (TRSs) [
 <xref rid="B47-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and the genomic packaging signal [
 <xref rid="B48-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] have been identified—of which, the latter has been demonstrated to bind specifically to the C-terminal RNA-binding domain facilitating the packaging of the genome into viral particles [
 <xref rid="B49-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The M protein containing three transmembrane domains may exist as a dimer, binds to the N protein [
 <xref rid="B50-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and is thought to give the virion its shape [
 <xref rid="B51-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The topology of the small 8–12 kD E protein is not completely resolved but is believed to have a transmembrane structure with an N-terminal ectodomain and a C-terminal endodomain with ion channel activity [
 <xref rid="B52-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. It facilitates the assembly and release of virions and has been associated with pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="B53-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The spikes consisting of the S protein give the virion the appearance of a solar corona and mediate the attachment to the host receptor [
 <xref rid="B54-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The S protein is cleaved by a host cell furin-like protease into S1 and S2 polypeptides for most coronaviruses [
 <xref rid="B55-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. However, SARS-CoV and SARS-related CoV lack the furin cleavage site, while SARS-CoV-2 accommodates it [
 <xref rid="B57-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. A fifth structural protein, the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), is present in the genome of some coronaviruses such as MHV [
 <xref rid="B58-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The function of the HE is thought to be the enhancement of the S protein-mediated cell entry and spread through the mucosa [
 <xref rid="B59-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] as well as increase of the neurovirulence of MHV [
 <xref rid="B60-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].
