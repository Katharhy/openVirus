 <xref rid="B43-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It contains a 5′ end cap structure, replicase genes (rep 1a and rep 1b) coding for the non-structural proteins (nsPs) comprising two-thirds of the genome and the structural protein genes S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane) and N (nucleocapsid) and various accessory genes interspersed within the structural genes at the 3′ end [
