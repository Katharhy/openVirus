<p>The murine hepatitis virus (MHV) is the best studied animal coronavirus resulting in respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neurological infections and is also a useful disease model [

A59 and MHV-3 are associated with severe hepatitis, and JHMV causes severe encephalitis. Interestingly, A59 and an attenuated JHMV cause chronic demyelinating disease in mice, which resembles multiple sclerosis (MS), providing a mouse model for MS [

Another advantage of MHV is the requirement of BSL2-level laboratory conditions, whereas SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV require BSL3-level laboratory conditions, making MHV ideal for studies on replication in cell cultures as well as pathogenesis and immune responses in vivo.
