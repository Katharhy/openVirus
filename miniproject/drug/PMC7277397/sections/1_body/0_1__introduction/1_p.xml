<p>Coronaviruses belong to the family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> and are characterized by causing respiratory tract infections ranging from mild diseases such as common cold to pneumonia with a lethal outcome [
 <xref rid="B1-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Typically, coronaviruses have been associated with a large number of diseases in livestock and companion animals such as pigs, cows, chickens, cats and dogs (

 <xref rid="B2-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In this context, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [
 <xref rid="B3-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) [
 <xref rid="B4-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in young piglets. Similarly, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) causes enteric infection in pigs but can also lead to encephalitis by targeting the nervous system [
 <xref rid="B5-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In cattle, bovine CoV (BCoV) is responsible for mild to severe respiratory tract infections, resulting in significant losses in the cattle industry due to diarrhea, dehydration, decreased milk production and depression [

 <xref rid="B7-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition to cattle, BCoV also infects other ruminants such as elk, deer and camels. Another coronavirus, rat CoV (RCoV), causes respiratory tract infections in rats, providing a useful model for studying early events of innate immune responses to coronavirus infections in lungs [

 <xref rid="B9-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. IBV has a significant negative effect on egg production and growth of chickens, leading to substantial losses in the chicken industry [
 <xref rid="B7-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In domestic cats, a mild or asymptomatic infection has been associated with feline enteric coronavirus (FCoV) [
 <xref rid="B10-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], although a highly virulent strain of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) causes lethal feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) [
 <xref rid="B11-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which shows similarities to human sarcoidosis [
