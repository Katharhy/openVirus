<p>The first major human coronavirus outbreak caused by the β-coronavirus SARS-CoV originated in Guangdong in China [
 <xref rid="B21-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. During the 2002–2003 epidemic, approximately 8098 cases were recorded, with 774 deaths at a mortality rate of 9% [
 <xref rid="B22-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, the mortality rate was much higher in the elderly population, reaching almost 50% in individuals over 60 years of age. Although closely related viruses were isolated from exotic animals such as Himalayan palm civets and raccoon dogs [

 <xref rid="B27-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. They utilize the same receptor, ACE2, as SARS-CoV, another indication that SARS-CoV originated in bats. The SARS outbreak was only spread through direct contact with infected individuals due to the relatively inefficient transmission of the virus, which allowed containing the outbreak within households and health care institutions [
