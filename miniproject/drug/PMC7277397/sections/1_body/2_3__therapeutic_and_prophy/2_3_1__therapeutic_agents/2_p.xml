<p>A hot topic today has been the potential therapeutic effect of the widely used antimalarial and auto-immune disease drug chloroquine on coronaviruses [

 <xref rid="B110-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. The application of chloroquine for COVID-19 patients has been justified by its common use by travelers in malaria-endemic geographic regions for decades and continuous use by locals [
 <xref rid="B111-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. However, as indications of severe side effects of chloroquine use have been reported, hydroxychloroquine, possessing a similar antiviral potency to chloroquine but a safer clinical profile, should be considered [
 <xref rid="B112-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. In a limited clinical trial, 20 French COVID-19 patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine, resulting in a significant reduction in viral load in comparison to control patients [
 <xref rid="B103-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Addition of azithromycin further significantly improved the efficiency of virus elimination. Despite the small sample size, the study indicated that hydroxychloroquine treatment was associated with a significant viral load reduction and disappearance of COVID-19. However, the trial design was poor and the results unreliable, as six patients dropped out and the assessment of efficacy was based on viral load, which was not a clinical endpoint. Additional studies are therefore needed in a larger number of patients to thoroughly validate the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine.
