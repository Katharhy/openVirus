<p>Chinese traditional medicine has also tried to provide support in the fight against coronaviruses. In this context, case studies of treatment with the Shuanghuanglian oral liquid (SHL) of a family suffering from COVID-19 has been reported [
 <xref rid="B104-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Case 1, a 51-year-old female with high fever diagnosed with COVID-19 was confined into an isolation ward five days later, where she started to take oral SHL twice a day. The following day, SHL administration was increased to three doses a day without taking any other drugs. The fever decreased in two days, and she gradually recovered. Case 2, the 27-year-old daughter of Case 1 presented with a high fever, vomiting and diarrhea. Two days after she was confined in an isolation ward, she started to take SHL three times a day. A couple of days later, a decrease in body temperature and recovered appetite were noted. Case 3, the husband of Case 1, had mild diarrhea, vomiting and fever and was diagnosed with COVID-19. He started to take SHL three times a day, as well as moxifloxacin and arbidol, which resulted in all symptoms with exception of light nausea disappearing within four days. In another study, four patients with mild or severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia were treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol and traditional Chinese medicine in the form of Shufeng Jiedu capsules [

Three patients showed significant improvement related to the pneumonia symptoms and tested 2019-nCoV negative, and one patient with severe pneumonia also showed improvement. Another potential approach for COVID-19 treatment relates to AHCC, an Î±-glucan-based standardized mushroom extract from

Likewise, lianhuaqingwen capsules have proven to be efficient for the prevention and treatment of respiratory infections caused by influenza A [
