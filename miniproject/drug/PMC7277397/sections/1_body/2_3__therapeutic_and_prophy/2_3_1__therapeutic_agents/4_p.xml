<p>In light of therapeutic strategies to rapidly target SARS-CoV-2, one approach aims at blocking virus entry using a soluble version of ACE2 fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain [
 <xref rid="B81-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. This approach will elicit broad-ranging neutralizing antibodies and stimulate the immune system. Recombinant protein expression can be utilized for the rapid production of a drug for compassionate use while formal clinical trials are undertaken, and vaccines developed. Another target related to ACE2 comprises the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) involved in S protein priming, for which TMPRSS2 inhibitors might be approved for clinical use to block coronavirus entry [
 <xref rid="B106-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. It was also demonstrated that sera from convalescent SARS patients are capable of cross-neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 S-driven entry [
 <xref rid="B106-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. In the context of ACE2, although the binding affinity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is similar, the presence of the furin cleavage site uniquely in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein sets it apart for the design of specific inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B57-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Moreover, the finding that SARS-CoV S murine polyclonal antibodies can potently prevent SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated cell entry indicated that cross-neutralizing antibodies against conserved S epitopes might be a feasible approach for therapy. In the context of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, the first SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody (mAb) CR3022 showed potent binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain [
 <xref rid="B107-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. However, the CR3022 epitope does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site, which indicates that CR3022 could have the potential as a therapeutic as such or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies. Interestingly, the potent SARS-CoV-specific m396 and CR3014 neutralizing antibodies, which target the ACE2 binding site, failed to bind the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, suggesting differences in the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. It is therefore necessary to develop mAbs with specific binding affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain. Another tentative approach comprises the evaluation of existing angiotensin receptor 1 (ATR1) blockers such as losartan, commonly used for the treatment of hypertension [
 <xref rid="B108-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>], for a reduction in aggressiveness and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infections [
 <xref rid="B115-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. The approach is based on the finding that ACE2 most likely represents the binding site for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, thereby providing a sensible target for therapeutic interventions for coronavirus infections. Targeting ATR1 might also address the problem with new emerging coronavirus mutations. Very recently, the first report on the human 47D11 mAb targeting a conserved epitope in the spike receptor-binding domain was published [
 <xref rid="B109-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. It cross-neutralizes SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 independently from receptor-binding inhibition and will be useful for the development of antigen detection tests and serological assays. Moreover, it adds to the potential to prevent and treat COVID-19 and possible future emerging coronaviruses.
