<p>An immunotherapeutic approach of great interest relates to the use of plasma from convalescent COVID-19 patients. Convalescent plasma has previously been used successfully as post-exposure prophylaxis and/or treatment of SARS and MERS [

The treatment allowed the patient to be released from mechanical ventilation 11 days after plasma transfusion and then transferred to a general ward. In another case study, five critically ill COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were treated with convalescent plasma obtained from patients who had recovered from COVID-19 [

The patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation and had been treated with antiviral agents and methylprednisolone showed a normalized body temperature within 3â€“4 days and their viral load decreased and became negative within 12 days. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2-specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers increased, ARDS resolved in four patients after 12 days and three patients did not need mechanical ventilation after two weeks. Three patients were discharged from the hospital and the two remaining patients were in stable condition. Obviously, the limited number of patients and study design do not permit an evaluation of the efficacy of the treatment and further larger clinical trials are required.
