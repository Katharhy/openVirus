<p>The classic approach for vaccine development against viral diseases has involved immunization with live attenuated or inactivated viruses [
 <xref rid="B129-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. The availability of genetic engineering and efficient recombinant protein production technologies has shifted applications to the utilization of recombinantly expressed antigens and immunogens for immunization [
 <xref rid="B130-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. In the context of coronaviruses, vaccine development started seriously after the SARS and MERS outbreaks, providing alternative approaches of applying subunit vaccines, whole inactivated virus, vectored, and live attenuated virus vaccines [

 <xref rid="B131-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. The vaccine was proven safe and intramuscular injection in calves elicited high antibody titers against BCoV 30 days post-vaccination. The intranasal drug Bovilis

 <xref rid="B132-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. The lack of relevant vaccines for equine coronavirus (ECoV) catalyzed the study on antibody responses to ECoV in horses after vaccination with the BCoV vaccine [
 <xref rid="B133-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. Antibody titers against ECoV increased in all six vaccinated horses at 14 days post-inoculation, although the titers were lower against ECoV than BCoV, and it remained unclear whether the elicited antibodies provided protection against ECoV.
