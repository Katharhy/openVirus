<p>Related to the safety of vaccine development, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) comprises an important mechanism facilitating viral cell entry, in which virions are complexed with antibodies, resulting in enhanced viral replication [

In the context of COVID-19, prior infection with other coronaviruses, from common cold to SARS-CoV, may have primed COVID-19 patients, causing severe disease once infected with SARS-CoV-2. This could explain the discrepancy between the severity of disease in COVID-19 patients in the Hubei province in China compared to other regions of the world [
 <xref rid="B162-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. Recently, a novel molecular mechanism for ADE was revealed, demonstrating that a neutralizing antibody binding to the coronavirus S protein can trigger a conformational change of the S protein mediating viral entry via IgG Fc cellular receptors [

 <xref rid="B164-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. Therefore, a highly regulated immune response in the lungs can protect from pathogen infection. In contrast, inefficient immune responses can trigger various pulmonary diseases. Related to SARS and COVID-19 lung pathology, recovery requires rigorous innate and acquired immune responses and epithelial regeneration [
