<p>Finally, self-replicating RNA viruses have proven to be efficient as vaccine vectors due to the highly efficient replication of their ssRNA genome of positive polarity directly in the cytoplasm [

As vectors have been engineered allowing immunization of plasmid DNA replicons, naked RNA replicons or replication-deficient particles, the application range is wide. Moreover, due to self-replication, the amounts required for obtaining similar immune responses as seen for conventional DNA plasmids or synthetic mRNA molecules are 100- to 1000-fold lower [

 <xref rid="B154-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. It was demonstrated that VEE particles expressing SARS-CoV S but not N provided complete short- and long-term protection against challenges with homologous strains in both young and senescent mice. To evaluate challenges of heterologous strains, a chimeric virus (icGDO3-S) encoding a synthetic S gene of the most genetically divergent human GDO3 strain was engineered. The chimeric virus was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the Urbani strain. However, immunization with VEE particles expressing SARS-CoV S provided complete short-term protection against challenges with icGDO3-S in young mice, but not in senescent mice. The failure to protect senescent mice was addressed in another study, where mice were vaccinated with VEE particles expressing SARS-CoV S antigen packaged with either attenuated (3014) or wild-type (3000) VEE glycoproteins [
 <xref rid="B155-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. The results revealed that aged animals immunized with VEE (3000)-based vaccine were protected against SARS-CoV, while mice immunized with VEE (3014)-based vaccine were not. Furthermore, the superior protection was also confirmed for challenges with influenza virus.
