<p>An interesting approach has been to utilize plant expression systems for coronavirus vaccine development. For instance, the N-terminal part (amino acids 1-658) of the SARS-CoV S protein was optimized for codon usage in plants and expressed as a fusion protein with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in tobacco leaves [
 <xref rid="B147-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. It was demonstrated that the S1-GFP fusion protein was expressed in the cytoplasm. Stable expression from the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter resulted in a high level of expression of the fusion protein in tobacco and lettuce leaves. Moreover, S1 production was also achieved in chloroplast-transformed plants, suggesting the potential for developing safe oral plant-derived subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV. In another study, an N-terminal fragment of the SARS-CoV S protein was expressed at high levels in tomato and low-nicotine tobacco plants [

Significantly increased levels of SARS-CoV-specific IgA antibodies were detected in mice after oral administration of tomato fruits expressing the S1 protein. Moreover, SARS-CoV-specific IgG antibodies were detected in the serum of mice primed with tobacco-derived S1 protein. Enhanced expression of the SARS-CoV N protein was achieved in the tobacco plant

Intraperitoneal administration of plant extract in BALB/c mice elicited N protein-specific IgG antibodies and, overall, it could be concluded that plant-based expression of the SARS-CoV N protein can induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. Finally, recent progress in plant-based expression systems has allowed the production of numerous antigens and monoclonal antibodies in plants [
