<p>In another plasmid DNA-based study, immune responses to a naked plasmid vector and plasmid/polyethylenimine nanoparticles expressing the SARS-CoV S protein were investigated in BALB/c mice after intranasal administration [

Immunization with nanoparticles elicited significantly higher S-specific IgG1 antibodies in sera and mucosal secretory IgA antibodies in lung wash than in mice receiving naked plasmid DNA. In another study, DNA plasmid-based prime immunization was combined with a boost vaccination with a protein [
 <xref rid="B144-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Turkeys were immunized with one or two doses of 750 μg of a DNA plasmid carrying a turkey coronavirus (TCoV) S protein fragment containing neutralizing epitopes (4F/4R) followed by a boost with 200 μg of 4F/4R fragment. Animals were challenged with infectious TCoV and clinical signs were monitored by an immunofluorescence antibody assay. Immunized turkeys showed less clinical signs and a lower viral load compared to control animals. The vaccination also induced humoral immune responses and provided partial protection against challenges with TCoV.
