<p>In the context of lopinavir/ritonavir, a randomized, controlled, open-label trial conducted on 199 COVID-19 patients showed no difference related to clinical improvement compared to the standard-care control group [

Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common for patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, but serious adverse events were more frequent in the standard-care group. The Efficacy of Lopinavir Plus Ritonavir and Arbidol against Coronavirus Infection (ELACOI) single-blind randomized controlled trial in China included 44 patients with mild or moderate clinical status taking lopinavir/ritonavir or arbidol (Umifenovir) [

The study showed no differences in the time to negative pharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR detection, pyrexia, cough or lung CT findings between the treatment and control groups. However, in the lopinavir/ritonavir group, 38.1% of patients deteriorated to severe/critical status compared to 12.5% and 14.3% for the arbidol and control groups, respectively. No adverse events were registered in the arbidol and control groups. In contrast, gastrointestinal and deranged liver adverse events were seen after lopinavir/ritonavir treatment.
