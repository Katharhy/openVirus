<p>Overall, although drugs developed for other infectious diseases might provide alternative treatment strategies for COVID-19 when evaluated in well-designed and well-executed clinical trials, development of prophylactic drugs and vaccines targeting specific structures of SARS-CoV-2 seems like the preferred approach. In the context of vaccine development, utilization of purified epitope peptides and antigens and cellular or viral delivery systems should all be explored in parallel to achieve maximum success in a minimum time frame. Not surprisingly, more than 60 vaccine projects are in progress at pre-clinical or clinical levels [
