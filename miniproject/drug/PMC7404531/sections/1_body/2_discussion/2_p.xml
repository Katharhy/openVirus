<p>Although the number of confirmed COVID‐19 cases in SSA is currently low compared to the number of confirmed cases in Europe and the United States, the region’s weak and poorly resilient health systems, poor emergency preparedness, low testing, and poor contact tracing, are causes for concerns about effective management of the COVID‐19 pandemic. Probably because infection preventive measures such as total lockdown are not economically sustainable, some African countries are gradually lifting this control strategy. To address the concerns of a likely spike in the reproductive ratio of COVID‐19 infections following easing lockdowns in these countries, we support the implementation of a community‐based approach adopting syndromic diagnosis (clinical diagnosis based on the constellation of symptoms and signs that are characteristic of COVID‐19 infection) using active case finding, especially in hard‐to‐reach areas where laboratory‐confirmed diagnosis is non‐existent. Contact tracing, home quarantining, district‐level facilities for appropriate respiratory support that can be managed by locally available human resources, equipped with adequate personal protection, need to be developed as long‐term assets for the healthcare system.
