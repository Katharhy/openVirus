<p>A secondary outcome of these clinical trials should include concerted efforts to build biorepositories and support the development of regulatory systems for biorepositories in the region as this will help current and future vaccine and therapeutic COVID‐19 research. All COVID‐19 related research should be approved by the appropriate ethics committees, with considerations for research protocols to be fast‐tracked. Community engagement in the design and implementation of these trials should not be excluded.

 </fn> This recommendation is appropriate for the COVID‐19 pandemic. Community engagement also needs to facilitate effective communications with communities through education and information dissemination by trusted community leaders. Early engagement of community leaders in the design and implementation of COVID‐19 control measures, to think through and proffer context‐specific responses to the call for social distancing, self‐isolation or quarantine in overcrowded cities and informal settlements, and appropriate burial practices cannot be overemphasized.
