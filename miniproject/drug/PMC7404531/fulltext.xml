It was first confirmed in sub&#x02010;Saharan Africa in Nigeria on 27 February 2020 and has since spread quickly to all sub&#x02010;Saharan African countries, causing more than 111,309 confirmed cases and 2,498 deaths as of 03 June 2020. The lessons learned during the recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks in some sub&#x02010;Saharan African countries were expected to shape and influence the region&#x02019;s responses to COVID&#x02010;19 pandemic. However, some of the challenges associated with the management of the EVD outbreaks persist and create obstacles for the effective management of the COVID&#x02010;19 pandemic. This article describes the commonalities between the EVD epidemics and COVID&#x02010;19 pandemic, with a view to draw on lessons learned to effectively tackle the ongoing pandemic. Key successes, failures and lessons learned from previous EVD outbreaks are discussed. Recommendations on how these lessons can be translated to strengthen the COVID&#x02010;19 response in sub&#x02010;Saharan Africa are provided.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd id="dewb12275-kwd-0001">COVID&#x02010;19</kwd><kwd id="dewb12275-kwd-0002">Ebola</kwd><kwd id="dewb12275-kwd-0003">lessons</kwd><kwd id="dewb12275-kwd-0004">sub&#x02010;Saharan Africa</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="6"/><word-count count="4280"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>edited-state</meta-name><meta-value>corrected-proof</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:5.8.6 mode:remove_FC converted:05.08.2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><p content-type="self-citation">

Probably because infection preventive measures such as total lockdown are not economically sustainable, some African countries are gradually lifting this control strategy. To address the concerns of a likely spike in the reproductive ratio of COVID&#x02010;19 infections following easing lockdowns in these countries, we support the implementation of a community&#x02010;based approach adopting syndromic diagnosis (clinical diagnosis based on the constellation of symptoms and signs that are characteristic of COVID&#x02010;19 infection) using active case finding, especially in hard&#x02010;to&#x02010;reach areas where laboratory&#x02010;confirmed diagnosis is non&#x02010;existent. Contact tracing, home quarantining, district&#x02010;level facilities for appropriate respiratory support that can be managed by locally available human resources, equipped with adequate personal protection, need to be developed as long&#x02010;term assets for the healthcare system.<fn id="dewb12275-note-1061"><label><sup>61</sup></label><p>Cash &#x00026; Patel, op. cit. note 30, pp. 1687&#x02010;1688.</p></fn>
</p><p>In addition, the social impact of stigma and discrimination, myths and misconceptions, extensive required changes in socio&#x02010;cultural practices and financial hardship resulting from the public health measures may be problematic for the COVID&#x02010;19 response in SSA as it was for the EVD response. The dearth of COVID&#x02010;19 related clinical trials on the continent and the poor preparedness for storage of biological specimens and data is problematic for generating regional specific evidence&#x02010;informed responses for COVID&#x02010;19 now and in the future with implications for its positive contribution to global health security. The COVID&#x02010;19 related experiences in China, the United States of America, Italy and Spain indicate that a lot more than an efficient health system delivering quality care is needed to control the pandemic. A pandemic&#x02010;resilient system for countries in SSA will require investments in strengthening and efficiently coordinating its huge informal community&#x02010;based health care system. If that is done, governments can rely on the system to deliver the care and community participation that is needed during pandemics.

There is a dire need to facilitate the involvement of countries in SSA in COVID&#x02010;19 related trials.

Within the four years interval between the West Africa EVD epidemic and the COVID&#x02010;19 pandemic, the region has improved its ability to handle emergencies, even though this improvement may seem marginal. Key lessons from the EVD epidemics must be translated to actions that enable countries respond promptly and adequately to the COVID&#x02010;19 pandemic. The continent needs to strengthen its coordination of responses to an epidemic, while it supports systems for handling research protocols, data sharing and sample transfer. Community systems need to be strengthened to support prompt organization and efficient responses during epidemics, not only for health education and promotion but in anticipation of care facilities being overwhelmed and unable to serve patients in need.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="dewb12275-sec-0011"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="dewb12275-sec-0010"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>We appreciate with thanks Prof Oyewale Tomori for reviewing the manuscript.</p></ack><bio id="dewb12275-biog-0001"><p>
