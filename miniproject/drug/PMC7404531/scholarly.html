Abstract</div> <p>COVIDâ€�19, caused by a novel coronavirus named SARSâ€�CoVâ€�2, was identified in December 2019, in Wuhan, China. It was first confirmed in subâ€�Saharan Africa in Nigeria on 27 February 2020 and has since spread quickly to all subâ€�Saharan African countries, causing more than 111,309 confirmed cases and 2,498 deaths as of 03 June 2020. The lessons learned during the recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks in some subâ€�Saharan African countries were expected to shape and influence the regionâ€™s responses to COVIDâ€�19 pandemic. However, some of the challenges associated with the management of the EVD outbreaks persist and create obstacles for the effective management of the COVIDâ€�19 pandemic. This article describes the commonalities between the EVD epidemics and COVIDâ€�19 pandemic, with a view to draw on lessons learned to effectively tackle the ongoing pandemic. Key successes, failures and lessons learned from previous EVD outbreaks are discussed. Recommendations on how these lessons can be translated to strengthen the COVIDâ€�19 response in subâ€�Saharan Africa are provided.</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="kwd" title="kwd">

DISCUSSION</div> <p>Although the number of confirmed COVIDâ€�19 cases in SSA is currently low compared to the number of confirmed cases in Europe and the United States, the regionâ€™s weak and poorly resilient health systems, poor emergency preparedness, low testing, and poor contact tracing, are causes for concerns about effective management of the COVIDâ€�19 pandemic. Probably because infection preventive measures such as total lockdown are not economically sustainable, some African countries are gradually lifting this control strategy. To address the concerns of a likely spike in the reproductive ratio of COVIDâ€�19 infections following easing lockdowns in these countries, we support the implementation of a communityâ€�based approach adopting syndromic diagnosis (clinical diagnosis based on the constellation of symptoms and signs that are characteristic of COVIDâ€�19 infection) using active case finding, especially in hardâ€�toâ€�reach areas where laboratoryâ€�confirmed diagnosis is nonâ€�existent. Contact tracing, home quarantining, districtâ€�level facilities for appropriate respiratory support that can be managed by locally available human resources, equipped with adequate personal protection, need to be developed as longâ€�term assets for the healthcare system. </p><div class="fn-type-" title=""><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label"><sup>61</sup></span><p>Cash &amp;amp; Patel, op. cit. note 30, pp. 1687â€�1688.</p> </div> <p /> <p>In addition, the social impact of stigma and discrimination, myths and misconceptions, extensive required changes in socioâ€�cultural practices and financial hardship resulting from the public health measures may be problematic for the COVIDâ€�19 response in SSA as it was for the EVD response. The dearth of COVIDâ€�19 related clinical trials on the continent and the poor preparedness for storage of biological specimens and data is problematic for generating regional specific evidenceâ€�informed responses for COVIDâ€�19 now and in the future with implications for its positive contribution to global health security. The COVIDâ€�19 related experiences in China, the United States of America, Italy and Spain indicate that a lot more than an efficient health system delivering quality care is needed to control the pandemic. A pandemicâ€�resilient system for countries in SSA will require investments in strengthening and efficiently coordinating its huge informal communityâ€�based health care system. If that is done, governments can rely on the system to deliver the care and community participation that is needed during pandemics. Considerations for cultural beliefs were central to the mitigation efforts of the EVD epidemic; </p><div class="fn-type-" title=""><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label"><sup>62</sup></span><p>Li, Zâ€�J., Tu, Wâ€�X., Wang, Xâ€�C., et al.

There is a dire need to facilitate the involvement of countries in SSA in COVIDâ€�19 related trials. This needs to be pushed by both the government of countries in SSA and the Africa Centre for Disease Control.<p /> <p>A secondary outcome of these clinical trials should include concerted efforts to build biorepositories and support the development of regulatory systems for biorepositories in the region as this will help current and future vaccine and therapeutic COVIDâ€�19 research. All COVIDâ€�19 related research should be approved by the appropriate ethics committees, with considerations for research protocols to be fastâ€�tracked.

CONCLUSION</div> <p>The COVIDâ€�19 pandemic and EVD epidemics in subâ€�Sahara Africa have commonalities. Within the four years interval between the West Africa EVD epidemic and the COVIDâ€�19 pandemic, the region has improved its ability to handle emergencies, even though this improvement may seem marginal. Key lessons from the EVD epidemics must be translated to actions that enable countries respond promptly and adequately to the COVIDâ€�19 pandemic. The continent needs to strengthen its coordination of responses to an epidemic, while it supports systems for handling research protocols, data sharing and sample transfer. Community systems need to be strengthened to support prompt organization and efficient responses during epidemics, not only for health education and promotion but in anticipation of care facilities being overwhelmed and unable to serve patients in need.</p> </div> <div class="COI-statement" title="COI-statement"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
