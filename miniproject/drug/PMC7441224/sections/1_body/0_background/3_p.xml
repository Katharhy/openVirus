<p id="Par17">The objective of this systematic review is to investigate how data for drug treatments of A(H1N1)pdm09 accrued during the pandemic (detailed objectives listed in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This review is not only limited to completed clinical trials, but also includes registered trials which were not completed, and reports of treatment outside a formal trial setting (case studies or series and observational studies). These are included as they may represent both the best quality evidence available at the time and also opportunities lost to gather high-quality evidence.
