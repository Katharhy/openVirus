Twenty-five per cent (7/28) of prospective observational studies and 22% (28/130) of retrospective or mixed-enrolment research were published by the end of the PHEIC. The median date of publication for all papers was March 18, 2011 (IQR September 28, 2010, to October 24, 2011); this was 213 days after the PHEIC ended. Overall, the median delay between final patient enrolment (or inclusion) and date of publication was 444 days (IQR 281–684). The median date between final patient enrolment and submission was 302 days (IQR 142–534), between submission and acceptance 93 days (IQR 63–144), and acceptance to publication was 56 days (IQR 24–94) where data existed for these intervals.
