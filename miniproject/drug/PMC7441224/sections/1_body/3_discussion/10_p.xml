<p id="Par45">Initiatives to minimise publication delay now include fast-track review for manuscripts likely to change clinical practice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]; this approach been widely employed by journals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pre-approval of trial protocols (where some peer-review occurs before a study is conducted) or results-free review (where review excludes results and some discussion) are alternative peer-review models which aim to improve focus on study quality and reduce bias toward publication of only positive findings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. These may also have utility in speeding up the dissemination of quality clinical research in the outbreak setting, by allowing for peer-review to begin at the same time as data collection; whether this is the case is yet to be tested. There is also support for pre-publication online release of preliminary findings. Indeed, the increasing utilisation of pre-publication servers (such as medRxiv) has been reflected in the COVID-19 outbreak. Dissemination of research findings via pre-publication (prior to peer-review) reduces delays but carries risks for validation of methodology, accuracy of data and interpretation of findings. The extraordinary number of COVID-19 articles being submitted to pre-publication servers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] has led to several rapid, open, peer-review platforms for COVID-19 preprints being developed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. These aim to improve quality control in the period between preprint dissemination and the formal peer-review/publication process; such ‘overlay’ review models are new and how these will impact on the quality of data generation and dissemination is not yet known.
