<p id="Par17">Qin et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] reported that the total number of B cells, T cells, and NK cells decreased significantly in patients with COVID-19. And the sum of lymphocytes of the severe group dropped more significantly than the moderate group. So, the infection of SARS-CoV-2 might be dramatically for the people living with HIV. On the one hand, the immune system might be impaired after the infection of SARS-CoV-2 by the depletion of T lymphocytes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. On the other hand, during the chronic phase of HIV infection, generalized immune activation, and systemic CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte depletion occur. Fortunately, the CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell count of our case was normal from 2016 to now, which might be the reason for not causing severe pneumonia. But the prolonged viral shedding duration.
