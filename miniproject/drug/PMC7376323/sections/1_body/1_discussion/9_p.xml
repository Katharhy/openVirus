<p id="Par19">Lu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] revealed that prolonged viral RNA shedding in children was associated with symptomatic infection, fever, pneumonia, and lymphocyte count less than 2.0 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L. The lymphocyte count of our case was also less than 2.0 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L, which might be a co-factor for the prolonged viral shedding duration.
