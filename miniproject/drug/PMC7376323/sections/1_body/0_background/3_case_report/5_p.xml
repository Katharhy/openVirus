 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). We consistently tested the RT-PCR for COVID-19 on day 19, day 25, and day 31 to 34, but all the results remained positive. The RT-PCR for COVID-19 turned negative for the first time on the day 35. Meantime, the IgM antibody for SARS-CoV-2 on day 35 was positive. Then we tested the RT-PCR and IgM for SARS-CoV-2 every 3 days. The RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 remained negative, while the IgM antibody for SARS-CoV-2 turned negative on day 44. We confirmed the viral clearance, and the patient was discharged on day 47.
