  <title>Background</title>
  <p id="Par1">The COVID-19 has been a severe pandemic all around the world. Nowadays the patient with co-infection of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 was rarely reported. Here we reported a special case with HIV and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection, which showed a prolonged viral shedding duration.</p>

  <title>Case presentation</title>
  <p id="Par2">The patient was infected with HIV 8 years ago through sexual transmission and had the normal CD4
   <sup>+</sup>T cell count. She was found SARS-CoV-2 positive using real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) during the epidemic. Most importantly, the patient had a prolonged viral shedding duration of SARS-CoV-2 about 28 days.

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p id="Par3">The viral shedding duration may be prolonged in people living with HIV. The 14 days isolation strategy might not be long enough for them. The isolation or discharge of these patients needs further confirmation for preventing epidemics.</p>
