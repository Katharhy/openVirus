 <bold>Drop-in centres and shelters:</bold> The large number of clients has led to crowds causing higher risks of infection and transmission. For this reason, the time spent by clients in the centres has been reduced and they are not allowed to be too close together. In addition, the capacity of shelters has been reduced because the distance between the beds must be maintained. There are not enough centres to provide services, so a significant number of homeless PWUD has been deprived of harm reduction services, especially shelter. This may affect the spread of other diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and viral hepatitis.
