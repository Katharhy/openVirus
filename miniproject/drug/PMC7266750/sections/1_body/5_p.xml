 <bold>Education:</bold> People living at ‘spots’ rarely have access to cell phone or the Internet, hence it is not possible for them to receive online training or information. It is very difficult to maintain a safe distance during face-to-face education, so increases the risk of infection and transmission. It has been helpful to make educational podcasts and play them with a loudspeaker on a mobile van, although it is not feasible in some spots which are close to residential neighbourhoods.
