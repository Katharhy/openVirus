<p>Heart problems have been reported fairly frequently, at least among MERS and COVID-19 patients. In a Saudi cohort of 70 MERS patients, for example, 11 of them (15.7%) developed arrhythmia, and 10 (14.3%) developed rhabdomyolysis (Saad 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) (it is unclear if the arrhythmia and rhabdomyolysis were related). Among COVID-19 patients, heart problems also seem fairly prevalent; acute cardiac injury or elevated cardiac enzymes were reported in five (12%) out of a cohort of 41 patients from Wuhan (Huang 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
