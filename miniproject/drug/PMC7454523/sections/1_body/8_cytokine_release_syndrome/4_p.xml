<p>Another recognized immune hyperactivation mechanism is secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH). The pathophysiology of sHLH is conceived as a positive feedback loop between cytokines and immune cells that eventually escapes regulation, thus leading to tissue damage and multi-organ failure. sHLH has commonly been described in the setting of underlying disease states such as malignancies, autoimmune conditions and viral infections (Ramos-Casals
