<p>Cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) also known as cytokine storm, is the excessive proliferation of immune cells and increased release of inflammatory cytokines resulting in multi-organ system failure and tissue damage (Shimabukuro-Vornhagen 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The trigger for this phenomenon is either a pathogen such as a virus (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>), or an iatrogenic intervention such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy or anti-PD-1 (Programmed cell death protein 
 <bold>1)</bold> agents used to target specific malignancies (Rotz 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Elevated Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Interleukin-10 (IL-10) values have been described in patients with CRS (Tanaka, Narazaki and Kishimoto

 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). IL-6 and IL-10 in addition to other cytokines such as Interferon-gamma (IFN- γ), Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- α) were also found to be elevated in patients with COVID-19, in a number of cohort studies (Chen

 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Moreover one report disclosed a positive correlation between higher values of IL-6 and IL-10 and increased severity of the disease (Qin

 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Wan

 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). While relatively few studies (Tang

 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Baas 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Hong 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) have described CRS in SARS and MERS, in comparison with COVID-19, this might be explained by the great discrepancy in case numbers between the current pandemic and previous epidemics.
