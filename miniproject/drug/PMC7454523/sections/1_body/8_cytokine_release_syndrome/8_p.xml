<p>Other immune-modulating medications were also considered in the treatment of COVID-19, after evidence of immune-mediated damage emerged. Hydroxychloroquine, which has held the attention of the media for some time, was among them. This malaria-prophylaxis drug, previously proven effective in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematous (SLE; PAGE

The resulting evidence for its efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 infection was contradictory: Results from some trials suggested that hydroxychloroquine is effective in facilitating viral elimination and decreasing time to recovery (Chen

One trial found no significant efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin in severe cases of COVID-19 and was discontinued due to severe side effects (Molina
