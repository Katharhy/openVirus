<p>CRS, sHLH and T-cell dysregulation all have been reported to cause interstitial pulmonary inflammation and ARDS, among other types of organ-system dysfunction (Seguin 
 <italic>et al</italic>.

 <italic>et al</italic>.

 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Similar reports on the cytokine profile of MERS patients might help confirm the importance of CRS in the pathogenesis of MERS-associated ARDS: A higher concentration of IL-6, among other cytokines, was described in non-survivors versus survivors among MERS patients (Hong 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). However, other reports stop short of endorsing a definitive role for CRS in disease severity, since no studies have described a direct link between CRS and death of the patient (Josset 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Still, the proposed mechanisms of CRS morbidity involve syndromes of organ-system failure such as ARDS, which indeed are themselves associated with increased mortality. Hence, it may be advisable to screen all COVID-19 patients with severe disease for hyper-inflammatory responses, using laboratory trends such as increasing ferritin, decreasing platelet counts and/or increasing erythrocyte sedimentation rate (Fardet 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), which are similar to trends associated with COVID-19 coagulopathy (Connors and Levy
