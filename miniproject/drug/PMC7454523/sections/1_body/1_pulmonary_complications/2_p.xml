<p>Some clinical features are unique to each pandemic. While the presentation of COVID-19 can be variable, ranging from no symptoms to mild upper respiratory tract infection to respiratory failure (Zhou 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), upper respiratory symptoms appear infrequently in MERS (Arabi 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Perhaps unique among the coronavirus pneumonias is SARS’ bi- or triphasic presentation. A SARS patient may appear to recover from his/her initial illness before rapidly deteriorating (new fever, chest infiltrates, respiratory failure and watery diarrhea) a few days later (Sampathkumar 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). The first phase corresponds to viral replication and is marked by fever, myalgia and systemic symptoms, while the second phase reflects immune-mediated lung damage coinciding with a decrease in viral load (Hui, Wong and Wang 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>); this phased course may be explained by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like pathophysiology (discussed below).
