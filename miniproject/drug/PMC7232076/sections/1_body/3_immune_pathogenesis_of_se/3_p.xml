<p id="p0030">Many cytokines are implicated in the massive response observed in seriously ill patients. The rapid activation of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells leads to proliferation and differentiation into Th1 cells which secrete proinflammatory cytokines 
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The response consists of high concentrations of IL1B, IFNγ, IP10, and MCP1 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Severely ill patients who required intensive care unit (ICU) admission had higher concentrations of granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα than did those not requiring ICU admission. Other studies report the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, interferon gamma, and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). GM-CSF activates monocytes to release more IL-6 leading to the formation of a cytokine storm, which triggers ARDS, multi-organ failure (MOF) and even death 
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Furthermore, the infection also initiates an increased secretion of T-helper-2 (Th2) cytokines such as IL4 and IL10. These suppress inflammation and this phenomenon is not seen with SARS-CoV infection
