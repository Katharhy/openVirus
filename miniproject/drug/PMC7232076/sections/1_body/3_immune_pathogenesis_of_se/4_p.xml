<p id="p0035">The role of the arachidonic acid related prostaglandin pathways in COVID is less well known. Recent studies have shown age-related changes in this pathway and associated T-cell defects that could account for the increased susceptibility of SARS-CoV infection in the elderly 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The mechanism involves respiratory dendritic cells (rDC) in the lungs that migrate to the mediastinal lymph nodes and prime T-cells that in turn migrate to the lungs to mount an immune response. An age-related defect in T-cell function is linked to decreased migration of rDC because of increased levels of prostaglandin-D (PGD
 <sub>2</sub>) in ageing mice. The resulting poor T cell response is associated with severe infection
