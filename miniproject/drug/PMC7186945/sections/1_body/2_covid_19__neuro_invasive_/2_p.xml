 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], CoVs are large, enveloped viruses with a large positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Human pathogenic CoVs include those causing recent epidemics, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) HCoV-229E, and other identified coronaviruses, i.e. HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. CoVs have been associated with CNS diseases such as acute viral encephalopathy, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and multiple sclerosis and are increasingly recognized as presenting a neurologic crisis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Such propensity of CoVs has been documented for several of the beta-CoVs, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Acute necrotizing encephalitis has also been described in one case of SARS-CoV-2. The patient presented with fever, cough, and altered mental status and was found to have hemorrhagic rim enhancing lesions in the deep gray matter of the cerebral cortex bilaterally [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Animal studies suggest coronaviruses are delivered through the peripheral nerves and may access the central nervous system through retrograde synaptic transmission [
