<p id="Par12">The exact mechanism for neurotoxicity may depend on the brain entry route, which has not been fully elucidated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The SARS-CoVs enter human host cells mainly via a cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), expressed not only in the entire respiratory tract (which it destroys resulting in the leading cause of death), but also in the upper esophagus or enterocytes and showing very low expression level in the brain under normal conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The virus entry route may be respiratory, via oro-fecal route, but also directly intranasal [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. The possible brain entry routes for CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, include either direct intranasal access to the brain via olfactory nerves (with anosmia as an early symptom) or indirect access to the brain by crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via hematogenous or lymphatic spread [
