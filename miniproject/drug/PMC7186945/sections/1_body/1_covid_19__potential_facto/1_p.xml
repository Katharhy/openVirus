<p id="Par6">Delirium, the most frequent clinical expression of acute brain dysfunction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], is especially important in the context of COVID-19. It may be regarded as an early symptom of infection, as previously described in septic patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Therefore, delirium should be actively screened for using dedicated psychometric tools, i.e., CAM-ICU [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] or ICDSC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It is also plausible that delirium severity, which could be measured with CAM-ICU-7 or DRS-R-98 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], may be associated with COVID-19 severity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes pneumonia, especially in elderly patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Since advanced age is a well-described independent risk factor for delirium, it could be postulated that those who are at the greatest risk for severe pulmonary disease related to COVID-19 are likely at the greatest risk for delirium as well. It has been reported that nearly 90% of COVID-19 patients whose condition required admission to the intensive care unit need mechanical ventilation, either non-invasive (NIV) (42%) or invasive requiring intubation (48%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Currently, due to the reports of increased aerosolization of the viral load, NIV is not recommended yet still being used when ICU resources become limited [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].
