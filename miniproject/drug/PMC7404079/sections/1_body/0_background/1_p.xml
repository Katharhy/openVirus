 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. High frequency of RNA recombination, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) fickleness, and the bulky genomes for RNA viruses are considered leading factors for CoVs’ diversity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Humans are infected by seven CoVs, including HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 belonging to Alphacoronavirus; HCoV-OC43 and HCoV HKU1 belonging to Betacoronavirus lineage A; these four viruses are known to be endemic [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Three human coronaviruses (HCoVs) caused epidemics expressing high morbidity and mortality rates: SARS-CoV belonging to Betacoronavirus lineage B, MERS-CoV or HCoV-EMC belonging to Betacoronavirus lineage C, and the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 [
