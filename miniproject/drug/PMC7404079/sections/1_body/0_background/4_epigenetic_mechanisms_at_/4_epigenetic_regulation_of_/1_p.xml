<p id="Par96">Newly synthesized viral polyproteins are cleaved by viral proteases, namely, the 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. ORF1a encodes the two cysteine proteases, 3CLpro and PLpro. While PLpro cuts the first three cleavage sites of its polyprotein, 3CLpro is responsible for cleavage of the residual 11 locations resulting in release of a total of 16 Nsp in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Upon comparing SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, correspondences have been detected in 5′UTR and 3′UTR regions, protease cleavage positions and amino acid conformation of both structural and non-structural proteins. Yet, the number of spike precursors and specificity of accessory proteins differ in SARS viruses. SARS-CoV processes two spike precursors (S1p and S2p), while SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV produce only one. AP11 is characteristic for SARS-CoV, whereas SARS-CoV-2 translates a specific accessory protein AP12 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Nsp5, the coronavirus 3CLpro, is critical for the maturation of non-structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Actively, 3CLpro binds to HDAC2 and tRNA methyl transferase 1 (TRMT1) resulting in their cleavage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Thus, 3CLpro mimics HDAC2 inhibitor and might therefore facilitate viral and/or cellular gene expression in infected cells. TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications are required for redox homeostasis to ensure proper cellular proliferation and oxidative stress survival [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Since TRMT1 is cleaved by 3CLpro, SARS-CoV-2 might interfere with tRNA methylation in infected cells. Numerous drugs have been reported to inhibit the activity of 3CLpro including the anti-HIV drug lopinavir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The structural viral proteins (NP, M, E, and S) participate in the formation of new virions across the endoplasmic reticulum. SIRT1 activation following treatment of the infected cells with resveratrol results in decreased viral replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The viral envelope E binds to BRD2 and BRD4 and could be the target for BET inhibitors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Therefore, blocking SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins’ maturation could result firstly from the usage of SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors to annihilate the viral polyprotein cleavage by 3CL pro and/or PLpro, and secondly from the epigenetic treatments to decrease the amount and/or activity of structural viral proteins.
