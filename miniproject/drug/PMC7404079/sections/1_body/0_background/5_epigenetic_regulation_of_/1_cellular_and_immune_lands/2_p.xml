<p id="Par99">Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common immunopathological event for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. A massive cytokine storm is considered as one of ARDS’ principle mechanisms which is the chief death cause of COVID-19 in addition to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV severe diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. During the cytokine storm, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, IL-33, TNF-α) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10) are upregulated by effector cells in SARS-CoV infection linked with respiratory distress [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Unlike the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, the anti-inflammatory Th2 cytokine TGF-β is not overproduced in COVID-19 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Augmented levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), TNF-α, IFN-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP10), macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α (MIP1A), and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP1) were associated with COVID-19 severity; a cytokine outline favoring secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Poor prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients can be forecasted by SARS-CoV-2 viral load which is concomitant with cytokine storm caused by the extremely high IL-6 levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. Older, chronically ill and immunocompromised patients are expected to be more susceptible to hyperinflammation. Demethylation of IFN-regulated genes, NF-kB, and key cytokine genes favors the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines thus increasing cytokine storm incidence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. As a result, minimizing IL-6 plasma concentrations and controlling ACE2 gene epigenetically might be a target for prevention and therapy in COVID-19 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. In contrast to SARS-CoV-2, delayed serum levels of IFN, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, CCL-2, CCL-3, CCL-5, and IL-2 were detected in MERS-CoV-infected patients. Recent data revealed that pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6) and chemokines (IL-8, CXCL-10, and CCL5) responses were elevated in severe MERS-CoV cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Low levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was seen in confirmed SARS cases with severe disease. It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV infects monocyte-macrophages, DCs, and T cells which produce IL-10 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. In addition to the role of immune cells, the immune landscape in the lung of COVID-19 patients can also be shaped by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the airway epithelial cells. Thus, prominent epigenetic regulators including HDAC2 and BRDs (BRD2, BRD4) interact with viral proteins Nsp5 and E, respectively. Nsp5 antagonizes HDAC2 transport into the nucleus; therefore, affecting HDAC2-induced inflammatory functions and IFN response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Altogether, the hyperinflammatory cytokine and chemokine storm observed in ARDS patients result from epigenetic modifications present in both HCoV infected epithelial cells and immune cells present in their vicinity.
