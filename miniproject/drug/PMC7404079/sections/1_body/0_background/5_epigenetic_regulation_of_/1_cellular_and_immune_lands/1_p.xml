<p id="Par98">In the course of viral infections, innate immune cells initiate a transcriptional signal that is cell and stimulus specific. Several main performers of innate immunity, such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), 
 <italic>Toll-like receptor (</italic>TLR)4, TLR7, and TLR3/TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-beta (TRIF) diminish infection severity during HCoV infection in vivo. Moreover, interferons (IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma) which are regulated by histone marks aid in controlling HCoV infections in vivo and in vitro. IFN and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are the primary response genes of the innate immune system whose promoters show poised promoter features. H3K4me3, H3k27me3, and H3k9me2 are responsible for modulating the activation of the main player IFN. H3K9me2, a repressive histone mark, contributes to DNA methylation and heterochromatin formation and hence stopping histone tail acetylation by recruiting the transcriptional repressor of the heterochromatin protein 1 family. H3K4me3, a histone modification enriched in promoter regions, regulates Toll-like receptors (TLRs). As a result, IFN and innate immune responses are subject to epigenetic regulation mediated by specific epigenetic marks, the operation of histone modification enzymes, DNA methylases, and chromatin remodeling complexes. CoVs have progressed genetic functions that antagonize or delay pathogen recognition as well as IFN sensitive gene (ISG) effector functions. Upon the activation of danger sensors, dendritic cells (DCs), and macrophages a temporal and spatial response is epigenetically initiated. The ability of their epigenome to change within minutes after a stimulus is essential for initiating a speedy antiviral host response and to ensure a persistent/specific defense response. Hence, epigenetic mechanisms are responsible guaranteeing a functional and highly regulated host response beyond the initial activation wave [

Upon utilizing chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) PCR approaches, it is possible to determine differential occupancy of histone marks at the promoters of ISG genes. During SARS-CoV infection, the promoter regions of ISG genes had more histones with active marks of H3K4me than the repressive H3K27me3 mark, therefore favoring open chromatin and promoting active transcription and ISG expression. MERS-CoV infection of Calu3, a continuous human airway epithelial cell line, resulted in increased levels of H3K27me3 and depletion of H3K4me3 occupancy at the promoter regions of subsets of specific ISGs. These viruses favored a closed chromatin conformation that inhibits ISG expression, which rather was regulated by epigenetic control mechanisms [
