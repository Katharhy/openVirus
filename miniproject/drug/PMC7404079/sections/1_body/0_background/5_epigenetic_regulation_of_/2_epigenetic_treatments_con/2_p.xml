<p id="Par101">Resveratrol counteracts hyperinflammation by interfering with NF-kB pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. It potentiates SIRT1 which directly interacts with p65 via deacetylation on lysine 310 resulting in the inhibition of NF-κB activation. Additionally, inhibiting NF-κB activity via SIRT1-AMPK signaling pathway in the cytoplasm promotes an enhanced anti-inflammatory effect. In fact, NF-kB activation is required for the production of numerous proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and proinflammatory chemokines. Besides, resveratrol reduces TNF-α-induced phospho-p38 MAPK expression [
