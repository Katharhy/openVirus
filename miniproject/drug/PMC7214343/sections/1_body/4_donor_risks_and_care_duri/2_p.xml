<p id="p0035">Two types of LTX techniques are available; the first is the conventional or standard method, which involves implantation of whole liver grafts DDLT, and this type is the most widely used in the USA and Europe 
 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The other type is LDLT, and this is the only option available for patients living in some countries like Egypt as cadaveric organ transplant is still banned there, and that is why some patients travel abroad seeking organ transplant elsewhere 
 <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. At present, the organ procurement organizations (OPOs) and hospitals having LDLT programs should screen potential donors for exposure and clinical symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, and as more information builds up, the ideal approach would hopefully be developed 
 <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Although personal contact is the basis of the doctor-patient relationship, which allows rapid and accurate assessment of the patient's condition, unfortunately, it exposes physicians to the risk of infection and becomes a source of the virus spread. Therefore, it is considered wise to substitute direct contact with patients with more distant interactions with the utilization of available technology. The same approach could also be applied to the post-operative period for the donor in the case of LDLT, aiming to be discharged as soon as possible from the hospital 
 <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. With the increasing number of infected cases and mortality caused by COVID-19, a recent discussion for using organs from patients infected with COVID-19 has led to several points of debate. For instance, from the clinical point of view, it could potentially be a life-saving procedure, especially that delays might result in more deterioration for the patient's need for the organ and even increase the risk of COVID-19 exposure. On the other hand, it may transmit infection, which would even be more severe in transplant recipients, especially in the absence of effective therapy. Financially speaking, it can be a possible source of income for hospitals despite reimbursements remain uncertain. It might be argued from the legal point that organs with HCV have already been transplanted after getting informed consent from patients. Nevertheless, this disease has a different risk profile compared to HCV. As regards the ethical perspective, this procedure respects the wishes of donors and their families and ensures the autonomy of patients willing to do so. However, patients could be overwhelmed with responsibility for informed consent in the presence of little guidance
