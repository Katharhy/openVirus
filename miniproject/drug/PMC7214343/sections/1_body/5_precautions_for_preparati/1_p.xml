<p id="p0040">The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has posed extensive threats and problems to all the healthcare facilities, including LTX centers 
 <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. These effects are not only confined to donor or recipient issues but also extends to involve many other problems in the availability of healthcare resources 
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. We are faced with enormous challenges owing to the high communicability and virulence of the virus, the risk of introducing immunosuppressive therapies during this pandemic, and our utmost need for all the health care utilities. On the other hand, we do have a very long list of miserable patients waiting for LTX, which is the only available treatment option for this difficult to treat a group of patients, so judicious decisions and strict precautions became now mandatory 
 <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Streptococcal pneumonia and influenza vaccines are strongly recommended to all recipients prior to LTX, together with strict prophylaxis against complications of cirrhosis to reduce the number of hospital admissions 
 <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. It is also recommended to test for COVID-19 in patients with acute decompensation or Acute on top of chronic liver failure (ACLF) 
 <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. For those on LTX lists, it is recommended to test both donors and recipients for COVID-19 before LTX, putting into consideration that negative results do not totally exclude the infection. Alternatively, computed tomography (CT) of the chest can be considered 
 <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Pre-procedure consent should include the potential hazard for the acquisition of nosocomial COVID-19infection 
 <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Accepting only grafts with a low risk of delayed graft function to reduce complications and minimize the length of postoperative stay is also recommended 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Diminishing exposure of health care workers as much as possible, through using online clinics and phone calls as a substitute to primary clinics can prevent unnecessary risk of infection. Doctors may also talk to all patients by phone before their visits to rule out any possibility of COVID-19 infection. Deferring optional visits and restricting it only to urgent ones also help to prevent nosocomial infections 
 <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Modifications of the outpatient transplant clinics by widening the patientsâ€™ waiting areas and following strict infection control precautions is of utmost importance
