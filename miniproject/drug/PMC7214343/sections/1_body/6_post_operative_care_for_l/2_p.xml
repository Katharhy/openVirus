<p id="p0055">Liver transplant recipients should be admitted to separate wards where there is complete separation from COVID-19 admission wards, along with the strict implementation of standard disinfection measures. It is recommended to limit surgical and medical rounds, requests for the image, and blood tests to the least required number 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Follow up of Liver transplant recipients is usually performed in tertiary referral hospitals, where COVID-19 hotspots may be present 
 <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. It is thus recommended to limit in-person outpatient visits even in areas without significant COVID-19 community spread 
 <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Hospital admission of liver transplant recipients should be considered only for patients suffering from major complications like rejection, decompensation, or vascular complications. During in-person outpatient follow up visits, liver transplant recipients should be evaluating in dedicated hepatology/liver transplant clinics away from clinics where confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 are evaluated 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Once the patient is clinically stable, it is recommended to perform his routine laboratory investigations, including drug levels at primary care facilities 
 <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Telemedicine can mitigate exposure of both patients and healthcare workers to COVID-19 as it allows better physician-patient communication. Development of COVID-19 symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, diarrhea, the new loss of sense of taste or smell, contact with known COVID-19 patients, history of recent travel) in a liver transplant recipient should prompt urgent referral for evaluation along with hepatic symptomatology surveillance and drug compliance assurance
