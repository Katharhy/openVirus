<p>From a methodological point of view, the term “quarantine” has a remarkable wealth of meanings, and different parameters are traceable in the original use of the term itself, including “pathology”, “setting”, “time”, “separation” and “restraint” (
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Pathology refers to the variety of diseases which, in the course of Western history, have been subjected to quarantine, ranging from cholera to yellow fever, from plague to coronavirus disease. Setting refers to the context in which quarantine has been applied, ranging from specific geographical areas to whole nations. Time refers to the temporal period of implementation of this preventive measure, classically of forty days for plague, but with changing lengths according to the (known or presumed) incubation period of different infectious diseases. Separation and restraint are relative on the one hand to the variety of subjects involved in quarantine (classically people and means of transportation, but also animals and goods) and on the other to the degree of the necessary limitation of individual autonomy weighed against the public health risk. These parameters have undergone profound changes through time, but all retain their intrinsic value and relevance. Not by chance, for the current COVID-19 pandemic, has the World Health Organization issued overall indications relative to the global containment strategy, that can be comprised under the preceding parameters. In fact, the current approach for coronavirus disease includes the timely identification of laboratory-confirmed cases and their consequent isolation and management at home or in a medical facility. It should also be remembered that quarantine is formally included in the legal framework of the 2005 International Health Regulations, and exactly in articles 30, 31 and 32 (
