<p>From the coining of the term “quarantine” onwards, Italy has always played a major role in defining and developing preventive health measures in the history of Western world. Not by chance, the word “lazzaretto” too, the place where quarantine was materially performed, comes from Italy; in the fourteenth century the Republic of Venice again disposed that the quarantine of clearly infected or just suspected persons with plague should be performed on the island of the Venetian lagoon where the monastery of Santa Maria of Nazareth was, and whose health personnel came from the hospital of Saint Lazzaro (1423). It was in 1486, in another Venetian island, that the so-called “lazzaretto novo” for the quarantine of persons and goods was established. In the late Middle-Ages the foundation of lazzarettos was crucial; since the physicians of the time, due to the absence of effective therapeutic agents, were not able to cure individual patients, health authorities intervened with regard to the care, in a preventive perspective, of the health of entire communities, thus giving rise in Italy to public health interventions and initial sanitary administration (

Quarantine was the cornerstone of preventive measures for Medieval times, and its linguistic Italian origin is worth remembering; for example, the word quarantine made its appearance in the English language only centuries later, in the sixteen hundreds.
