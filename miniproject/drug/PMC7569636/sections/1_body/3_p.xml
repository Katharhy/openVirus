<p>From a linguistic point of view, the word quarantine derives from the Italian term “quaranta”, meaning forty. Forty days was in effect the time period, already identified by the Hippocratic School in the fifth century B.C., within which “acute” transmissible diseases, such as plague, manifested themselves. In the Hippocratic conceptual framework, pathologies becoming clinically evident after forty days could not be acute, and therefore plague could be indirectly ruled out. Consequently, the pathological paradigm of plague set a standard of forty days for the fixed length of preventive measures, and its reference standard was quarantine (
