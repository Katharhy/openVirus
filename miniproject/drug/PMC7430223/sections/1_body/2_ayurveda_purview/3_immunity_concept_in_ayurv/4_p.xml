 <italic>Rasayana</italic> (
 <italic>Rasa + ayana</italic>)’ refers to nutrition and its transportation in the body for attaining excellent Rasadi 
 <italic>Dhatu</italic>s; which leads to gain longevity, freedom from disorders, optimum strength of physique and sense organs [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, C.S.Chi. 1:1/4-8]. 
 <italic>Rasayana</italic> promotes nutrition by explicitly enriching the nutritional value of 
 <italic>Rasa</italic> by enhancing 
 <italic>Agni</italic>, i.e. digestion, metabolism, and absorption (by 
 <italic>Srotashodhana</italic>). Consequently, any medication that improves Rasa’s consistency would enhance the health of all body tissues.
