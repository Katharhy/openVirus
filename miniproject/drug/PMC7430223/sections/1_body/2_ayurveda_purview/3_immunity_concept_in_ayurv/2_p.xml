 <italic>Vyadhikshamatwa</italic> and states that during certain conditions, or due to certain factors, even unwholesome (unhealthy) food does not produce disease immediately; all unwholesome diet are not equally harmful, all dosha are not equally powerful, all persons are not capable of resisting diseases [

 <italic>Dhatu</italic> is called 
 <italic>Swasthya</italic> [

 <italic>Vyadhikshamatwa</italic> and
