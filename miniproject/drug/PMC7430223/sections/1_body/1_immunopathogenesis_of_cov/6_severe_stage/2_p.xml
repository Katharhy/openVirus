<p id="p0045">Once the immune system is breached, the virus propagates and reaches the lower respiratory tract and alveoli. Then the virus can penetrate alveoli and reaches systemic circulation causing viremia [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The virus binds to multiple organs having ACE2 receptor protein. During this stage, cell-mediated immunity becomes robust and starts releasing various pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-1B, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, IL-33, TNF-α, etc.) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, etc.) causing damage to multiple organs known as Cytokine storm [
