<p id="p0035">The virus fuses with the host cell membrane and enters inside the host cell through airway epithelium [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The virus propagates and multiplies inside the host cell and can reach lower airway and alveoli. In adults with good innate cellular and humoral immunity propagation of virus can be limited and viral load reaching alveoli can be reduced thus recovery can take place within 2â€“3 weeks with mild symptoms [
