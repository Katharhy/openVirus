The bioactive compounds of ginger such as nevirapine, β-sitosterol, 6-gingediol, germacrene, methyl-6-shogaol, 6-gingerol, α-linalool, 6-shogaol, gingerdion, zingiberene, etc., are known to inhibit viral replication; among these the most potent inhibitors of reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme is β-sitosterol, which is predicted to be used as non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTIs) HIV-1 inhibitors [

 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The rhizome of Ginger and its main components like gingerols, shogaols, etc inhibit prostaglandin and leukotriene biosynthesis, inhibit cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase activities, inhibits the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-α, and IL-8 without any significant effect in IL-6 levels; inhibit the excessive production of NO, PGE (2), TNF-α, and IL-1beta, reduce the elevated expression of NFκB and TNF-α, down-regulate inflammatory iNOS and COX-2 gene expression, inhibit thromboxane synthetase, raise levels of prostacyclin without a concomitant rise in PGE 2 or PGE 2 alpha, inhibit platelet aggregation, decrease age-related oxidative stress markers and enhance fibrinolysis [
