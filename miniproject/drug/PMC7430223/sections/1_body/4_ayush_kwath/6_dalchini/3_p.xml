<p id="p0125">Cinnamon bark decrease systemic levels of IFN-γ without altering the levels of IL-4 or IL-2, inhibit anti-CD3 Ab-stimulated IFN-γ and IL-4 at the mRNA and secreted protein levels, enhance IL-2 protein secretion at the cellular level which helps to decrease cell death, inhibit IL-2mRNA expression, inhibit anti-CD3-induced p38, JNK, ERK1/2, and STAT4 activation, but not IκBα degradation or STAT6 and ultimately alter the inflammatory responses in T cells. This shows the immune-modulatory effect of cinnamon on cytokine secretion and the involvement of intracellular signaling molecules in activated T cells. It also causes a reduction in the sub-G1 phase, accompanied by an increased ratio of apoptotic cells to necrotic cells [
