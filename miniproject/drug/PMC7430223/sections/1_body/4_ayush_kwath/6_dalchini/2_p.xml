 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In one study, cinnamon at high dose (100 mg/kg) showed immune-stimulant activity as it significantly increased the phagocytic index, serum immunoglobulin levels and antibody titer and decreased the percentage reductions in neutrophil count. Cinnamon low dose (10 mg/kg) increased serum immunoglobulin levels only. This showed that high dose increases both cell mediated and humoral immunity whereas low dose showed effect only on humoral immunity [

The studies also suggest that cinnamaldehyde can act as a strong regulator of monocyte/macrophage-mediated immune responses by inhibition of PI3K, PDK1 and NF-κB activation of signaling components. In addition to this, by the activation of CD29 and CD43, it blocked cell migration cell–cell adhesion induced but not cell-fibronectin adhesion and it was able to suppress both the production of nitric oxide (NO) and up regulation of surface levels of co-stimulatory molecules (CD69 and CD80) and pattern recognition receptors (TLR2 and CR3) [
