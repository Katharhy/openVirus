<p id="p0170">As this disease is considered as 
 <italic>Kapha-Vatolvana Hina Pitta Sannipataja Jwara, the Kapha Vata Shamaka</italic> properties of 
 <italic>Ayush Kwath</italic> can play a significant role in balancing the vitiated doshas. After six days of 
 <italic>Jwara, Charaka</italic> suggests the decoction of 
 <italic>Pachana</italic> drugs in the case of 
 <italic>Amdosha</italic> and 
 <italic>Shamaniya</italic> drugs in 
 <italic>Niramadosha</italic> [

 <italic>Yuktivyapashraya</italic> and 
 <italic>Vyadhiviparita</italic> chikitsa can be done even after the involvement of 
 <italic>Dosha</italic> in later stages. 
 <italic>Ayush Kwath</italic> has potential psycho-neuro-immune mechanisms via evidence of a reduction in depression, anxiety, and stress in controlled trials and shows meaning response as it is a specific remedy for cough and respiratory problems; this shows the role of
