<p id="p0175">Immunity plays a key role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 both during the early non-severe stage and during the severe stage of the disease. The early-stage strong immune response may prevent the propagation and spread of viruses inside the body thus reducing the severity of cases and early termination of infection. While during later stage, strong cell-mediated immunity of the body against the virus itself can be a factor responsible for grave consequences due to cytokine storm. The target during the early stage should be to reduce viral propagation, while at a later stage should be to reduce the inflammatory response of the immune system. Medicinal herbs with immune booster property can be an option during the early non-severe stage while herbs with anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties can be an option during a later or severe stage. Cytokine storm that is believed as a major factor responsible for complications and death of COVID-19 patients has been found to be reduced with anti-inflammatory drugs like steroids and IL-6 receptor antagonists, Anti-inflammatory interleukins (IL-10) in modern medicine [

Like anti-inflammatory interleukins and IL-6 receptor antagonist (Tocilizumab); IL 10 that are proposed in modern medicine to have a therapeutic role in the reduction of severity and mortality of COVID-19. Cinnamon bark that is found to decrease INF-Î³ and IL-4, Its anti-atherosclerotic, anti-coagulative and anti-platelet activity can be a topic of research to reduce inflammatory and thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients.
