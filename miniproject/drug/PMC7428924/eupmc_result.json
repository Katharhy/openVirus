    "Introduction:COVID-19 is the disease caused by an infection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, previously known as 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) respiratory disease. World Health Organization (WHO) declared the official name as COVID-19 in February 2020 and in 11th March 2020 declared COVID-19 as Global Pandemic. In June 6th 2020, over 7 million cases registered in the world, recovered 3.4 million and death over 402.000. Aim:The aim of this study is to retreive published papers about COVID-19 infection deposited in PubMed data base and analyzed current results of investigations regarding morbidity and mortality rates as consequences of COVID-19 infection and opinions of experts about treatment of afected patients with COVID-19 who have Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Methods:It's used method of descriptive analysis of the published papers with described studies about Corona virus connected with CVDs. Results:After searching current scientific literature (on PubMed till today is deposited more than 1.000 papers about COVID-19 with consequences in almost every medical disciplines), we have acknowledged that till today not any Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) study in the world. Also, there are no unique proposed ways of treatments and drugs to protect patients, especially people over 65 years old, who are very risk group to be affected with COVID-19, including patients with CVDs. Vaccine against COVID-19 is already produced and being in phases of testing in praxis in treatment of COVID-19 at affected patients, but the opinions of experts and common people whole over the world about vaccination are full of controversis. Conclusion:Frequent hand washing, avoiding crowds and contact with sick people, and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces can help prevent coronavirus infections are the main proposal of WHO experts in current Guidelines, artefacts stored on a web site. Those preventive measures at least can help to everybody, including also the patients who have evidenced CVDs in their histories of illness. Authors analyzed most important dilemmas about all aspects of CVDs, including etipathogenesis, treatment with current drugs and use of potential discovered vaccines against COVID-19 infection, described in scientific papers deposited in PubMed data base."
