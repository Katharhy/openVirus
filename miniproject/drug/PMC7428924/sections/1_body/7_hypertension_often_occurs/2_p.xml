<p>According to reports from China, the most common comorbidity in COVID-19 was hypertension, and patients with hypertension required ventilatory support due to severe respiratory complications (

 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). At the same time, these patients had increased mortality. The mechanism that connects hypertension and COVID-19 is the immune system. Immune system dysregulation occurred in patients with hypertension and COVID-19. Poor blood pressure control in these patients leads to further dysregulation of the immune system in these patients. Hypertension is associated with lymphocytes and CD8 + T cell dysfunction. Immune aging of CD8 + T cells prevents them from effectively resisting viral infection. This contributes to pathological cytokine overproduction. Probably all this could explain the connection between hypertension and COVID-19. It could be assumed that ACE inhibitors and ARBs, leading to better control of hypertension, could, at least in part, establish better function of the immune system, whose function is compromised (
