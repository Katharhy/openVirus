<p>Remdesivir is the focus of clinical trials. A study done with Remdevisir was published in the Lancet (
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). It is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study showing that patients receiving Remdesivir recovered more quickly if Remdesivir therapy was started a maximum of ten days after the onset of symptoms. Mortality was 8% in the Remdesivir group and 11% in the placebo group. In short, it is important that Remdesivir is superior to placebo and that it reduces recovery time in patients with COVID-19. At the present time, we need prospective, randomized, and placebo-controlled studies, which will provide us an answer - what is the real role and importance of Remdesivir is in the treatment of COVID-19. There are currently 5 other studies with Remdesivir underway. The EMA in its latest release recommends that Remdesivir can be used as a compassionate use in very severe patients (

The term compassionate use refers to the use of a drug that has not yet been approved and which is used outside clinical studies under very strictly controlled conditions. This allows the patient to access a drug that is still in the developmental stage. However, Remdesivir is not yet registered in European Union countries (
