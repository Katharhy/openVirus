<p>COVID-19 infection is caused by a new beta-coronavirus, which the WHO has called (SARS-CoV-2) - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. Coronavirus 2 is a disease that appeared in December 2019 in the Chinese city Wuhan and began to spread very quickly beyond the borders of China. In a short period of time, it took on all the characteristics of a pandemic and spread exponentially to almost all countries of the world. Early COVID-19 case reports suggest that patients with underlying conditions are at higher risk for complications or mortality - up to 50% of hospitalized patients have a chronic medical illness (40% cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease). In the largest published clinical cohort of COVID-19 to date, acute cardiac injury, shock and arrhythmia were presented in 7.2%, 8.7%, and 16.7% of patients, respectively (

Initially, the main complications of COVID-19 were thought to be lung-related, then it was quickly observed that COVID-19 is attacking many organs, including the heart muscle, vascular endothelium and the cardiovascular system in general, increasing morbidity and mortality, especially in patients with other cardiovascular risk factors presented (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cerebrovascular and renal disease). In these patients, the morbidity is 10%. In a significant number of infected patients, severe myocardial damage, malignant arrhythmias and cardiac arrest occurred. Itâ€™s interesting, SARS-CoV-2 can also lead to neurological symptoms, such as dysgeusia or ageusia, or to the appearance of hyposmia or anosmia (

Therefore, the virus is neurotropic and can spread along the nerves and then damage them. It happens that the peripheral nerves are also affected, which manifests itself in the form of quadriplegia, and also causes cerebrovascular diseases. So, SARS-CoV-2 is neuroinvasive and can penetrate the brain and lead to neuronal death (

It is interesting to mention that in 20% of patients, only gastrointestinal symptoms occur in the form of loss of appetite, abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhea. Cardiovascular complications of influenza infection, including myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction and exacerbation of heart failure have been well-recognized during previous historical epidemics and make a significant contribution to mortality. Also, previous coronavirus outbreaks have been associated with a significant burden of cardiovascular comorbidities and complications.
