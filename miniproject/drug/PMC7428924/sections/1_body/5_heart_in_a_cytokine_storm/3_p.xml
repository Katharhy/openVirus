<p>Cytotoxic cells are such cells that kill infected cells. Cytotoxic cells are chemically oriented to kill and they are ideally to stop the proliferation of viruses such as SARS-CoV2. Cytotoxic T cells only attack infected cells and kill them. The immune response has a chemical indicator that tells a strong immune response to stop in certain moment when the danger is neutralized. At that moment, the cytokine storm is very active and then the system is overloaded and functions no longer properly. The immune system is so irritated that it stops making a difference between an infected cell and a healthy cell and then attacks everything which found in its path. This is a very bad situation for the patient, because, not only does SARS-CoV-2 kill the cells in our body, but so our immune system (
