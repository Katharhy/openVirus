<p>Cytokine storm syndrome is a dysregulation of the immune system, and the appearance of severe symptoms that directly endanger the patientâ€™s life. When the SARS-CoV-2 virus enters our body, it first seeks protection, then it will reproduce and then spread further. Our cells in the body provide the virus with extraordinary conditions to do all this. As SARS-CoV-2 infiltrates the cells of the respiratory system, it can thus hide better from our immune system and then multiply further. There are special cells in our body called T cells, and they fight infection. When T cells are activated they release cytokines, which further stimulate T cells to form, and then release even more cytokines. A type of T cells - called cytotoxic T cells - are formed. </p>
