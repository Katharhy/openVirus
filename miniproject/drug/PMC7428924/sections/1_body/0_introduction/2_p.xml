<p>COVID-19 is the disease caused by an infection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, first identified in the city of Wuhan, in Chinaâ€™s Hubei province in December 2019. COVID-19 was previously known as 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), respiratory disease before the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the official name as COVID-19 in February 2020 (

Respiratory virus infection is a major source of global pandemics as a consequence of swift human-to-human respiratory tract transmission. Within the past two decades, coronaviruses and influenza viruses have hit the world several times, causing significant mortality, economic loss and global panic. The SARS outbreak in 2002 triggered 916 deaths among more than 8.000 patients in 29 countries, followed by the emergence of MERS in 2012, which resulted in 800 deaths at least, among 2.254 patients in 27 countries (

Although COVID-19 appears to have greater infectivity and lower mortality than SARS and MERS, many uncertainties (including route of infection, viral evolution, epidemic dynamics, appropriate anti-viral treatment and strategies for disease control) remain. Since there is no cure for this viral disease and a long wait is needed to find a vaccine, a rigorous epidemiological measure was first taken. The largest quarantine in history was made, between 50 and 60 million people in several Chinese cities were quarantined; that included necessary hygiene measures such as: group meetings were canceled, schools closed and travel banned. Some people believe that a later evaluation of all the more modern epidemiological measures will show whether all of them are justified, as experts point to procedures that curb a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by another type of virus Corona (
