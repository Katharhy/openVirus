<p>Patients who have well controlled hypertension do not require frequent check-ups. Many patients with hypertension due to COVID-19 are in self-isolation in order to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and therefore cannot go for follow-up examinations. These patients need to measure their blood pressure as often as possible at home and continue taking the therapy regularly. In case of an urgent consultation, for example due to an hourly increase in pressure, these patients are recommended a telephone consultation, until they can go to their regular check-ups with the doctor. In addition, hypertension often occurs in the elderly (50% of people over the age of 60 develop hypertension) and at the same time the prevalence of hypertension increases sharply in very old people. The old age of the patient is a very important risk factor for complications in COVID-19 and often with fatal outcome.</p>
