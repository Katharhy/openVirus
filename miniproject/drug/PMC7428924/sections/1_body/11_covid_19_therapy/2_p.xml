<p>The therapy which is currently available in the world, can be divided into supportive, immunosuppressive, antiretroviral and possible new therapies (
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Supportive therapy consists of oxygen administration as well as hemodynamic support. Early intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation are crucial in patients with severe, progressive symptoms and where there is a great need for oxygenation. As heart damage has occurred, as itâ€™s mentioned earlier, it is necessary to include therapy given for cardiac decompensation as well as antiarrhythmics. Due to thromboembolic complications, anticoagulant therapy must be included. Antiviral therapy is also included (

 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). From the range of the drugs, Anakinra (Kineret) can be used, which blocks the activity of the specific cytokine interleukin 1 (IL-1). In addition, Tocilizumab (Actemra) is increasingly being used. Tocilizumab blocks the activity of another cytokine, interleukin 6 (IL-6), which is thought to be a key of biological mediator responsible for the cytokine storm. During a cytokine storm, an increase in IL-6 can have severe consequences for the cardiovascular system. Tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and left ventricular dysfunction may occur with concomitant increase in GNP. In a recently published retrospective multicenter analysis in 150 patients from Wuhan, IL-6 was a clinical predictor of mortality in COVID-19 (

Similar studies with tocilizumab are underway in France, Belgium and Denmark. Other therapeutic options include chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), ribavirin, favipiravir, intravenous immunoglobulin, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibition. Inhibition of JAK can affect inflammation and virus entry into cells (
