  <p>Mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection: (1) activation of S glycoprotein by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2); (2) activated S glycoprotein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor located on human cells surface (target for CQ—chloroquine and HCQ—hydroxychloroquine); (3) internalization and viral membrane fusion; (4) release of the uncoated RNA into the host cell (target for CQ and HCQ); (5) translation into the replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab; (6) formation of replication–transcription complex (RTC) involved in replication and translation of structural proteins and synthesis of subgenomic mRNA, a process that occurs in the cytoplasm of the host cell; (7) assembly of the newly form viral RNA and the structural proteins to form the virion (in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus); (8) transport of the virions via vesicles that fuse with the plasmatic membrane; (9) release of the virus in the extracellular space via exocytosis; and (10) spread of the virus and viral infection.
