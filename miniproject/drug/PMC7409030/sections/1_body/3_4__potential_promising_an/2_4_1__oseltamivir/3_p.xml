<p>According to a recent study, oseltamivir forms ligandâ€“enzyme complexes with the SARS-CoV-2 proteases via hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds, manifesting a synergistic activity with lopinavir and ritonavir. The authors concluded that the effect of the three drugs together (lopinavir, ritonavir, oseltamivir) against the protein is stronger than that of each drug individually, suggesting that this association might be helpful in the COVID-19 treatment [
