<p>Inflammation seems to be the most relevant process that increases virus-related organ damage and, subsequently, the severity of the pathology. Another relevant mechanism is considered the clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The main target is the numb-associated family of enzymes such as AAK1 and GAK because their inhibition reduces viral infection, interrupting the passage of the virus into the host cells [

As an example, baricitinib is a NAK inhibitor with high affinity for AAK1, acting as a strong anti-inflammatory drug in chronic inflammation in interferonopathies with favorable pharmacokinetic properties (low plasma protein binding, minimum interactions with CYP enzymes and, also drug transporters). It stands as an important example of a drug able to be associated with antiviral drugs in order to induce a higher efficacy in COVID-19 treatment. The most potent selective JAK inhibitors are baricitinib, fedratinib, and ruxolitinib; as a main activity, they are effective anti-inflammatory agents in arthritis and myelofibrosis. Their COVID-19 activity is related to the decrease in cytokine levels (including interferon-γ), often elevated in COVID-19 pathology. The most frequently reported side effects were related to upper respiratory tract infections. The only concern about the use of JAK inhibitors in COVID-19 therapy is the fact that they can inhibit a variety of inflammatory cytokines including INF-α, which plays a crucial role in fighting the virus [
