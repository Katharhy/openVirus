<p>Important data from different in silico approaches to find inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 were published in the last months. The “SARS-CoV E” protein sequence from NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) database, Multalin, a web-based tool and PDB (Protein Data Bank), was used in a research based on molecular dynamic simulations (MDS) in its first phase, followed by the preparation of ligands, represented by 4153 phytochemicals from previous studies [

The obtained results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 E is a pentameric protein comprised of 35 α-helices and 40 loops. Another similar study has begun with the RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from NCBI database and uses the swiss model and PHYRE2 Protein Fold Recognition Server to discover the spike glycoprotein [
 <xref rid="B139-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]; it was found that both the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and ACE2-FC region of IgG1 present bonding and docking abilities.
