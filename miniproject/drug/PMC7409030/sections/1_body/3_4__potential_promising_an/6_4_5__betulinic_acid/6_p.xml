<p>Previous investigations focused on testing the antiviral activity of lupane-type triterpenes such as BA on SARS coronaviruses. According to Wen C et al., betulinic acid showed significant antiviral activity when tested in vitro on SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells, inhibiting the replication of the virions at concentrations higher than 10 µM (EC
 <sub>50</sub> value). Moreover, BA manifested no significant cytotoxic effect, only slightly interfering with the growth of the tested cells. Regarding its mechanism of action against SARS-CoVs, the authors noticed that, at the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 10 µM, BA showed inhibitory effects on the main viral protease (3CLpro) [
