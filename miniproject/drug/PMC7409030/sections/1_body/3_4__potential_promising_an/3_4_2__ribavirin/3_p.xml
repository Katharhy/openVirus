<p>Using docking experiments, a research team demonstrated that ribavirin and other FDA-approved antiviral drugs (galidesivir, remdesivir, tenofovir, sofosbuvir) are able to bind to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, with binding energies comparable to those of native nucleotides, suggesting their potential use in COVID-19 therapy [

 <sub>50</sub> value (109.50 Î¼M) of ribavirin was higher than that of other antivirals such as remdesivir [
