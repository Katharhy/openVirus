<p>An example of monoclonal antibody included in the interim guidelines for COVID-19 treatment in critically ill patients is tocilizumab. This agent is a humanized monoclonal antibody that acts as an inhibitor of interleukin-6 and is currently used in cytokine release syndrome. The mechanism of action is related to its capacity to inhibit IL-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, leading to a decrease in intensity of the inflammatory status developed by the critically ill COVID-19 patients. The existent clinical data concerning tocilizumab efficacy report encouraging results, such as a significant decrease of inflammatory markers, radiological improvement, and decreased ventilatory support. In terms of safety profile, even though several adverse reactions were described, the directly-linked effects to tocilizumab use were an increase of hepatic enzymes values and development of opportunistic infections owing to its immunomodulating activity; the other effects were correlated with the drugs coadministered (anemia–ribavirin, QT interval prolongation–hydroxychloroquine) [
