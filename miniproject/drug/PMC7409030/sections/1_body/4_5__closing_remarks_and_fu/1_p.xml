<p>The outbreak determined by the newly emerged coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has initiated a roller effect both at medical and industrial levels, and its consequences are already seen in different areas. It has been more than five months since the first mention of this virus new potential, and if, at the beginning, there were more missing pieces, the latest data managed to almost complete the puzzle, as follows: (i) SARS-CoV-2 has a zoonotic origin (bats are considered the primary source); (ii) the genomic structure of the virus was elucidated, leading to the development of diagnostic tools and of potential novel innovative antivirals; (iii) human infection requires the binding of S spike glycoprotein to the human ACE2 receptor expressed by epithelial respiratory cells, vascular endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, gastrointestinal cells, and hepatocytes, among others; (iv) human-to-human transmission occurs via respiratory droplets, direct contact, fecalâ€“oral route, environmental transmission, and bodily fluids (key data for the infection spread repression); and (v) the clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection (characteristic symptomatology, onset, clinical stages, complications) is mostly described, but the data in this area are constantly being updated.</p>
