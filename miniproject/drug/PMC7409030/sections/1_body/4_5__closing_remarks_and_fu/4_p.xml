<p>Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are recommended for compassionate use in mild-to-moderate (as single treatment option) and in severely and critically ill forms of COVID-19 (as comedication with remdesivir or lopinavir/ritonavir). These drugs present efficient oral absorption and distribution patterns, several drugâ€“drug interactions were described (see detailed list at 
 <uri xlink:href="https://www.covid19-druginteractions.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.covid19-druginteractions.org/</uri>), and a thorough risk/benefit ratio analyze should be conducted before their administration mainly in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir (might increase the risk for prolongation of QT interval). Still, their clinical effectiveness as anti-COVID-19 agents is debatable at this point.
