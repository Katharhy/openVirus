<p>The invasion of CoVs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jcm-09-02084-f003">Figure 3</xref>) into the human cells is a complex process that comprises the following steps: (i) spike S glycoprotein acquires a homotrimer form noticeable from the viral surface; (ii) cleavage of S glycoprotein at the boundary between S1 and S2 subunits by the cell surface-associated transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) [
 <xref rid="B29-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; (iii) stabilization of the prefusion state of the membrane-anchored S2 subunit that possesses the fusion entity by S1 subunit; (iv) activation of protein for membrane fusion with irreversible conformational modifications by the host proteases cleavage at the S2‘ site; and (v) virus–cell fusion and transfer of viral genome into the host cell [

Further, the uncoated RNA translates two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) that encode non-structural proteins and form a replication–transcription complex (RTC). RTC replicates and synthesizes subgenomic RNAs that encode accessory proteins and structural proteins. Finally, the newly formed genomic RNA, nucleocapsid proteins, and envelope glycoproteins assemble to form virion-containing vesicles able to fuse with the plasma membrane and release the new virus [
