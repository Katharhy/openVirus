<p>The symptomatic patients with mild-to-moderate to severe and rapidly progressive disease present a complex symptomatic panel from mild to fatal manifestations (

 <xref rid="B9-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The symptoms usually appear within 2–14 days after viral exposure [
 <xref rid="B35-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], but this onset interval and the symptomatology are highly patient-dependent. This myriad of symptoms could be explained by the broad expression of ACE2 receptors within the body: on alveolar type-1 and type-2 pneumocytes and lung stem/progenitor cells, on vascular endothelial cells [

 <xref rid="B37-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], in terminal ileum intestinal epithelial cells (high expression), in the colon and in the stomach (a lower expression) [
 <xref rid="B29-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], in the bile duct epithelial cells (a 20× higher expression than in hepatocytes) [
 <xref rid="B38-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], in the kidneys and testis (about 100-fold increased expression than in the lungs) [

The mild-to-moderate form of the infection is characterized by the following symptoms: flu-like symptomatology (fever, dry cough, runny nose, and fatigue), dyspnea, expectoration, chest discomfort, respiratory distress, and lymphocytopenia, which are labeled as common symptoms, but some uncommon ones were also described, such as shivering, throat pain, anosmia, headache, joint pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea [

 <xref rid="B17-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. At the time of writing the present review, anosmia was considered an uncommon symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but according to the latest studies, this symptom became a frequently reported symptom of the infection in association with dysgeusia [
