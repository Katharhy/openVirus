<p>Even if the immune response is vital for the control and resolution of CoVs-induced infections, it can also lead to immunopathogenesis [

The antibody-dependent enhancement related to viral infection is a paradoxical process characterized by the presence of virus specific antibodies that augment viral entry within host cells and replication of the pathogen, leading to an exacerbation of the disease [
 <xref rid="B44-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In vivo studies confirmed that the presence of the anti-spike protein antibodies not only induced viral suppression, but also caused severe acute lung injury in the early stages of SARS-CoV infection. It is believed that the antibody-dependent injuries are owing to their ability to enhance inflammatory responses from macrophages. Therefore, considering the mechanisms described above, Fu Y and co-workers presented two inflammatory stages mediated by the SARS-CoVs: (i) the primary stage occurs shortly after the viral infection, but prior to the appearance of neutralizing antibodies when the inflammatory responses are the consequence of the interaction between the spike proteins and the ACE2 receptors; and (ii) the secondary stage, which begins with the appearance of the antibodies and the generation of the adaptive immunity that can diminish viral replication or trigger inflammatory responses and cause severe lung injury [
