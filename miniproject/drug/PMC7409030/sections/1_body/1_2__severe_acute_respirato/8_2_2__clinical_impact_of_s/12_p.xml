<p>An intriguing finding, which still remains unclear, is the decreased susceptibility of children to SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared with the adult population. Even though an age-dependent susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection was established, a valid explanation for these disparities is still lacking [

However, several hypotheses were drawn in this regard, as follows: (i) the mild-to-moderate clinical pattern observed in children could be explained by the immunization schedule, which might confer cross-protection to SARS-CoV-2 owing to the presence of a high titer of antibodies in childrenâ€™s blood; (ii) a lower rate of exposure to infected population; (iii) a small number of tests performed on children owing to their absent or mild symptomatology; and (iv) the expression of ACE2 enzyme is elevated in later childhood, which could be considered a mechanism of protection for the children [
