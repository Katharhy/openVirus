<p>Although its source is not yet confirmed, the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 is considered to originate from the Chinese seafood markets [
 <xref rid="B1-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Detailed comparative genomic sequence analyses were performed between SARS-CoV, SARS-like bat CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, reporting the following findings: SARS-CoV-2 presents a higher homology in terms of the whole genome sequence (encoded proteins of pp1ab, pp1a, envelope, matrix, accessory protein 7a, and nucleocapsid genes) with SARS-like bat CoV when compared with SARS-CoV. These data confirm the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 [

The transmission of the 2002â€“2003 SARS-CoV to humans was reported to occur from market civets, while that of the 2012 MERS-CoV emerged from dromedary camels; however, further investigations associated the pathogenic SARS and MERS viruses with bats [
