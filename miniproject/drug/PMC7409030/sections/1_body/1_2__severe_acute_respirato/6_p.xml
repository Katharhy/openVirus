<p>Nevertheless, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 present similar receptor-binding domain structures [
 <xref rid="B1-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and a 79.5% homology [
 <xref rid="B17-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, the main protease is highly preserved between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with a 96% overall similarity [
 <xref rid="B1-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In contrast, the resemblance rate between the new coronavirus and MERS-CoV was only 50% [
 <xref rid="B15-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Even though the percentage of similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV was quite high in the nucleotide sequence, the novel pathogenic coronavirus displays significant specific features, mainly in the accessory proteins located in the 3â€²-terminus of the genome: absence of the 8a protein, a longer 8b protein consisting of 121 amino acids when compared with 84 in SARS-CoV, and a shorter 3b protein of only 22 amino acids. The new SARS-CoV-2 also differs from the other coronaviruses by encoding an additional hemagglutinin (HE) glycoprotein that possesses acetyl-activity, which might enhance the cell entry and pathogenesis of the virus [

 <xref rid="B16-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The first genome sequence of the new SARS-CoV-2 consisting of 29,903 bp is currently available and has been since January 2020 in the NIH GenBank database, as the reference sequence, under the accession number NC_045512 [
 <xref rid="B18-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The attempt to study significant features/mutations related to genome sequences related to different geo-located SARS-CoV-2 strains is a continuous and imperative work. This ongoing effort is highlighted by the large number of GenBank repository entries (over 8000) available under the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence as of May 2020. This achievement is important and has aided various studies that compare occurring variations in the genomic sequence to detect mutations [
 <xref rid="B19-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which can also impact the sensitivity of some of the widely used diagnostic methods such as RT-PCR [
 <xref rid="B20-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These data shed some light regarding the genome of SARS-CoV-2, but the real impact of these differences in terms of pathogenesis is still under investigation [
