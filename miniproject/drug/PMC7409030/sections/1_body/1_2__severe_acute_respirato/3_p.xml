<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) are known to induce persistent and long-term severe health issues (respiratory, gastrointestinal tract infections, and central nervous system illnesses in humans and animals) owing to their ability to adapt to new environments through mutation and recombination, and to change host domain and tissue tropism [
