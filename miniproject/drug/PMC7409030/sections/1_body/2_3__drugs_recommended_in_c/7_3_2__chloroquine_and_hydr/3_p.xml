<p>Structurally, both compounds are 7-chloro-quinoline derivatives, with a novaldiamine substituent in the fourth position, where HCQ has an additional hydroxyl group grafted at the end of the chain. In terms of bioavailability, the additional hydroxyl group, according to the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) profile of HCQ, leads, as expected, to an improvement in hydrosolubility, flexibility, and polarity, as well as to a decrease in lipophilicity compared with CQ (

These differences in the ADME profiles of the two molecules, owing to the presence of the hydroxyl group, can lead to different pharmacological behaviors, in terms of therapeutic efficacy and outcome, but also in the occurrence of toxic effects. These pharmacokinetic aspects will be further discussed.
