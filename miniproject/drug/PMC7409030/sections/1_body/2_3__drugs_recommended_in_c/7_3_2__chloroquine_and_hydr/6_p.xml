<p>At the same time, regarding the molecular mechanism of action of CQ/HCQ, the possibility to find a potential target, until experimental validation, was the subject of in silico determinations. Wu et al. screened two compound libraries (ZINC and a natural compound library of their own) against 19 SARS-CoV-2 protein targets. Among the results, the authors showed that chloroquine can target nonstructural proteins such as Nsp3b, exhibiting suitable docking scores [
