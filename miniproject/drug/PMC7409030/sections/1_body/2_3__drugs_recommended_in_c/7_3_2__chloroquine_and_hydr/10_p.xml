<p>CQ and HCQ are also evaluated in three ample clinical trials; that is, the SOLIDARITY trial sponsored by WHO that evaluates these compounds as possible therapy against SARS-CoV-2 infection; the HERO-HCQ, a study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that assesses their preventive potential; and the DisCoVeRy trial, launched by INSERM (French Institut National de la Santé Et de la Recherche Médicale) [

 <xref rid="B100-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Even though the two compounds share similar chemical structures, it has been reported that HCQ presents some therapeutic benefits when compared with CQ such as a lower toxicity in animals [
 <xref rid="B83-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. It is important to note that both CQ and HCQ interfere with the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and drug transporters: CYP2C8, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, P-gp being primarily metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, and known inhibitors of the drug transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp), thus explaining the interactions (increasing/decreasing) with associated antiviral drugs. Both CQ and HCQ show favorable pharmacokinetic properties: efficient oral absorption and tissue distribution patterns, leading to high concentrations in the liver, spleen, kidney, and lungs for CQ and the bone marrow, liver, kidneys, lungs, adrenal gland, and pituitary gland for HCQ. It should be noted that melanin-containing cells bind strongly to the chloroquine process, explaining the retinal toxicity of both compounds [
