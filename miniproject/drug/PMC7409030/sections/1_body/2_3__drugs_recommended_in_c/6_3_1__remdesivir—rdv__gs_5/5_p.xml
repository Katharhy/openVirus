<p>In order to investigate whether this mechanism of action is also responsible for the antiviral effect on SARS-CoV-2, a recent study, using computational methods, constructed a homology model of SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 RdRp (nonstructural protein 12 of the RdRp complex) [

On the basis of this model, the authors assessed ATP/RDV binding with SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 by means of molecular docking, using a previous co-crystal structure of the poliovirus RdRp. The study showed that the difference between the calculated binding energy of RDV triphosphate and that of ATP was significantly large, concluding that ATP can be blocked out of the binding site when RDV triphosphate is locally present, deeming that RDV could act as an effective SARS-CoV-2 RNA-chain terminator, stopping its RNA reproduction [
