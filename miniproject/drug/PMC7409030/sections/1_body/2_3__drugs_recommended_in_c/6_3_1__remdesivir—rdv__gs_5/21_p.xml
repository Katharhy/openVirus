<p>One of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre clinical trials developed in China (NCT04257656) in order to verify RDV efficacy as a COVID-19 treatment (the dosage recommended for compassionate use was applied: 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg/daily from day 2 to day 10 co-administered with lopinavir-ritonavir/interferons/corticosteroids) indicated an improved outcome in patients treated with RDV, with a decreased duration of invasive mechanical ventilation; however, these benefits were not statistically significant. Several adverse effects were recorded within the RDV-treated group and were classified as follows: most common—constipation, hypoalbuminemia, hypokalemia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and an augmented total bilirubin; common—increased blood glucose, rash, augmented blood lipids, high white blood cell count, hyperlipidemia, increased neutrophils number, high blood urea nitrogen, augmented aspartate aminotransferase, nausea, diarrhea, reduced sodium level, and increased serum potassium, as well as rare severe adverse events as respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and cardiopulmonary failure. Even though a plethora of side-effects in the RDV-treated group were reported, these reactions could not be directly correlated to RDV, and the conclusion of the authors in terms of RDV safety profile was that this drug “was adequately tolerated and no new safety concerns were identified”. Moreover, the average proportion of severe adverse events was lower in the RDV-treated group compared with the placebo group [
