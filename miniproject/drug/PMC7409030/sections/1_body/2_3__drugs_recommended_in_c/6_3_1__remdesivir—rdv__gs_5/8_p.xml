<p>Considerable proof has been gathered lately supporting the effectiveness of RDV against SARS-CoV-2 virus: (i) in vitro, Wang et al. proved that RDV efficiently inhibited the viral infection at low-micromolar concentrations in two different cell lines (Vero E6 and Huh-7) with a notable half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) value of 0.77 Î¼M [
