<p>The in vitro metabolism studies (for the identification of drug interactions) for RDV revealed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 enzyme; as this enzyme catalyzes multiple drug metabolism pathways, it is important to determine if RDV could interfere with these drugs and initiate different side effects. An ample study in this direction was conducted by the Liverpool Drug Interactions Group (University of Liverpool), and revealed the following findings: (i) co-administration of RDV with drugs from different classes as analgesics (metamizole), antibacterials (rifabutin), anticonvulsants (eslicarbazepine, oxcarbazepine, rufinamide), anti-hypertensives for pulmonary hypertension (bosentan), and steroids (betamethasone, dexamethasone) can lead to potential interaction that might require an adjustment of the RDV dose or a close patient monitoring; and (ii) co-administration of RDV with drugs from the classes of antibacterials (rifampicin, rifapentine), anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone), and antidepressants (St Johnâ€™s wort) is not recommended.</p>
