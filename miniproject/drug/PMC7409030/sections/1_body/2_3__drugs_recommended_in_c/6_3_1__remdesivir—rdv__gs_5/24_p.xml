<p>In view of all the data stated above about RDV, several recommendations and cautions are suggested:
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>The duration of RDV treatment should be settled at 5 days (200 mg day 1 followed by 100 mg/daily for the following 4 days) in severe COVID-19 cases—on the basis of the results obtained within SIMPLE trial 1, this measure represents a major step in reducing the risk of drug–drug interactions/side-effects/complications/aggravation of patient status;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>As the RDV directly-linked adverse effect is hepatic injury, a possible preventive approach would consist of the co-administration of hepatoprotective medication (for example, essentials phospholipids or albumin solution—it should be a patient-dependent decision after analyzing the risk/benefit ratio) during the RDV treatment (in severely ill COVID-19 patients, liver dysfunction was reported, but until now, it is unclear what causes it—the medication administered or the SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus liver protection would do no harm);</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>As RDV is predominantly eliminated through urine (mostly as metabolites), the renal function should be monitored during the treatment and, in the case of renal impairment, the treatment should be stopped</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Co-administration of other anti-COVID-19 drugs (lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, interferon) is possible because no drug–drug interactions were reported; surveillance is recommended</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Co-administration of antidiabetics and cardiovascular medication (anti-hypertensives, anticoagulants, beta blockers, and so on) is possible because no drug–drug interactions were reported; surveillance is recommended</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Co-administration of RDV with other hepatotoxic drugs is not recommended</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>To remedy/to prevent the mild adverse reactions reported in the clinical trials, such as nausea, diarrhea, hyperlipidemia, and so on, symptomatic medication could be administered during RDV treatment because no interactions were described between these classes of drugs and RDV; strict surveillance is recommended</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>To follow the updates on other clinical trials that tested RDV.</p>
