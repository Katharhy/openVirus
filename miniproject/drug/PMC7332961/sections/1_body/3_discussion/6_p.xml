<p>Regarding viral-host interactions, it is clear that plenty of information on cellular processes is still a matter of debate, once depending on the cell type or animal model, some outcomes for the same question/issue can be quite contradictory. The deep comprehension of essential cellular processes that CHIKV can interfere with and alter to its own replication is a crucial task that researchers need to face and investigate. Thereby, results from new researches in the field of host-viral interaction could bring new strategies to combat this threat and to minimize the social, economic, and health burden, improving the life quality from the affected population, alleviating symptoms, avoiding some atypical complications, and interrupting viral persistence establishment.</p>
