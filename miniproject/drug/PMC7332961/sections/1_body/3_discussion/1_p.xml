<p>The introduction of CHIKV within the human population is estimated to have occurred at the beginning of the 20th century; still, the highly epidemic potential of this arbovirus was only truly appreciated after the large epidemics occurring from the first decade of the 21st century in Kenya, La Reunion islands, and the Caribbean. Strikingly, the CHIKV genotype responsible for these large epidemics was the ECSA-derived Indian Ocean Lineage. Mutation within the viral envelope glycoproteins that accounted for virus adaptability to 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> are regarded as an important factor leading to massive virus dissemination in these regions. However, coincident with this unprecedented spread of CHIKV, descriptions of atypical clinical outcomes began to be reported. In Brazil, a CHIKV ECSA genotype, derived from an ancestral ECSA virus from Central Africa, was responsible for the large epidemic that occurred from 2015 to 2018 in several parts of the national territory affecting at least 700,000 individuals. The severity of the symptoms and the morbidity of CHIKF still need to be accounted, but there are reports of atypical cases of meningoencephalitis and other neurological complications in CHIKV-infected patients in Brazil.
