<p>The South-American ECSA genotype, on the other hand, does not harbor the vector-adapting mutations observed for the ECSA-derived IOL, and studies are urgently needed to understand the role of unique mutations observed throughout its genome for mosquito adaptability, virus replication, and pathogenesis. Characterization of viral determinants of disease severity and virus pathogenicity in this emerging ECSA-related genotype will help to predict the impact of future epidemics. As well as the characterization of different genotypes of CHIKV in terms of replication capacity, virus-host interaction, and pathogenesis will be crucial to the development of the best vaccine strategy.</p>
