<p>Although the factors involved in the unprecedented dissemination of ECSA-derived IOL could be due to viral determinants related to adaptability to the arthropod vector, as already demonstrated, other viral determinants such as increased viral replication capacity, modulation of host IFN response, that has the potential to increase virus pathogenicity cannot be excluded. In fact, as reviewed here, several studies conducted with the La Reunion CHIKV isolate CHIKV-LR, demonstrated its higher capacity to induce disease symptoms and establish infection in immunocompetent murine models of infection when compared to other CHIKV genotypes. Although in the immunocompromised murine model these results were not reproducible and the ECSA-derived IOL was not able to induce higher mortality rates when compared to the other CHIKV genotypes. This data reinforces the importance of continuous studying CHIKV replication properties, host-cell interaction, and pathogenesis to comprehensively address the epidemic potential of different emerging and reemerging CHIKV genotypes.</p>
