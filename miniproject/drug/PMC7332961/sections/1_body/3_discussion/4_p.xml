<p>Nonetheless, a comprehensive analysis of the atypical CHIKF symptoms due to the Brazilian outbreak from 2015 to 2019 is still lacking, since clinical data are scarce in the literature. Nevertheless, the impact of CHIKV in the Brazilian population could account for the introduction of a new pathogen into a na√Øve population with a higher probability to spread due to the highly populated urban areas and the high density of the mosquito vectors. However, the number of cases of CHIKV infection in Brazil, which were several orders of magnitude higher than in any other country of South America, was accompanied by the introduction of the ECSA strain, which substituted the Asian strain that was first introduced into the country. While in other regions of South America and in Central America, the Asian strain was responsible for the outbreaks. Thus, one cannot rule out the contribution of specific viral factors that allowed for the behavior of the epidemics in Brazil.</p>
