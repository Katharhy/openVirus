<p>The Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) globally distributed to the tropical areas that has recently spread to subtropical areas and the western hemisphere. CHIKV is an arthritogenic virus belonging to the family 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>, and is the etiological agent of the acute febrile illness Chikungunya fever (CHIKF) that caused millions of human cases since major outbreaks starting in 2004 (

This disease was named after the Makonde (Kimakonde) language from the south of Tanzania, which means “to bend over,” referring to the posture assumed by individuals that display the most severe forms of the disease with extreme and incapacitating joint pain. Although CHIKV infection is associated with low mortality rates, it imposes severe morbidity to the acute-infected individuals. The debilitating joint pain can persist for several months to years as a clinical outcome known as “post-chikungunya chronic polyarthralgia” (pCHIKV-CPA), which deeply affects the patient’s quality of life (

 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. mosquitoes (

This unprecedented spread of CHIKV infections was accompanied by high morbidity, several cases of neuropathies, and atypical disease presentations, making CHIKV a major global health threat. Facing this scenario, the characterization of the infectious and pathogenic potential of the actual circulating virus isolates will help to understand and, more effectively, control the disease.
