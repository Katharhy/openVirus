<p>The first isolation of CHIKV, and the report of an epidemic, occurred in 1952/53 in Tanganyika Province, actual Tanzania, with the infected individual presenting disabling joint pains, severe fever, and eventually rash (

 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">Ross, 1956</xref>). The bite of infected female mosquitoes transmits the virus, and its circulation could be related to two different cycles of transmission: (1) a sylvatic cycle where enzootic transmissions between non-human primates and 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. mosquitoes, such as 
 <italic>Ae.</italic> (Diceromyia) 
 <italic>furcifer</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae.</italic> (Diceromyia) 
 <italic>taylori, Ae</italic>. (Stegomyia) 
 <italic>luteocephalus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae.</italic> (Stegomyia) 
 <italic>africanus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Ae.</italic> (Stegomyia) 
 <italic>neoafricanus</italic>, which occasionally spilled over to humans; (2) an urban cycle where humans and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> are involved. The importance of the sylvatic cycle could be highlighted in a recent study that detected the virus in non-human primates from Malaysia and revealed a high similarity between human and non-human primate sequences of CHIKV. Thus, these monkeys maybe both hosts and reservoirs for CHIKV (

 <italic>Ae. dalzieli</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. argenteopunctatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx. ethiopicus</italic>, and 
 <italic>An. rufipes</italic> suggesting that other species may participate in a secondary sylvatic cycle (
