<p>Phylogenetic studies show that CHIKV originated from Africa, although the specific region where the virus evolved could not be pinpointed, and subsequently spread to Asia. These studies also classify viral isolates into three main lineages: the enzootics East/Central/South African (ECSA), West African, and the endemic/epidemic Asian strains. The Asian lineage could be sub-divided into two clades: the Indian clade, which was extinct, and the Southeast Asian lineage that continues to circulate (
