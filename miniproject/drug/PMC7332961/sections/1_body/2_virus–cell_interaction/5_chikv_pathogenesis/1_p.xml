<p>Dermal fibroblasts are the primary targets and the main sites of CHIKV replication (
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">Sourisseau et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Ekchariyawat et al., 2015</xref>), but other skin cells are also susceptible, like keratinocytes and melanocytes (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Gasque and Jaffar-Bandjee, 2015</xref>). From the skin, the virus migrates via lymphatic circulation, to the nearest lymph node, reaching the bloodstream where it infects mostly monocyte-derived macrophages (
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">Sourisseau et al., 2007</xref>). In a non-human primate (NHP) model, CHIKV migration was demonstrated by the presence of CD68
 <sup>+</sup> macrophages positive for CHIKV antigen trafficking to lymphoid tissue and the spleen from early timepoint up to 3 months after infection (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Labadie et al., 2010</xref>). From the blood, the virus reaches joints, muscles, and bones, which are the sites most linked to the chronic symptoms of the disease. Satellite cells of skeletal muscle are permissible for CHIKV infection and can act as a reservoir of mature skeletal fibers precursors, therefore, they have an active and crucial role in maintaining tissue structure (
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Ozden et al., 2007</xref>) and, when infected, can constitute a site of viral persistence. Mature skeletal muscle fibers and primary myoblasts have also been targeted by CHIKV (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Couderc et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Lohachanakul et al., 2015</xref>). In the joints, viral RNA and proteins were found during the acute and chronic phase of the infection; macrophages, primary human chondroblasts, and fibroblasts from synovial tissues are susceptible to CHIKV infection, with synovial macrophages being the main site of viral persistence linked to CHIKV (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Hoarau et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B189" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). The bones of the regions closest to the joints are also targets of infection since primary human osteoblasts are permissive to CHIKV (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). These are the preferred targets of viruses, which are not coincidentally linked to the most commonly observed clinical manifestations. The appearance of unusual clinical manifestations, affecting central nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, hematopoietic, and renal systems is due to the presence of cells, vital to local homeostasis, that is also susceptible to the CHIKV infection.
