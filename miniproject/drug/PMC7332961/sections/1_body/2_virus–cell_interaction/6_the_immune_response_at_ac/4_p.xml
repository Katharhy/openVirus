<p>Recently, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bae et al. (2019)</xref>, through a gene screening in HEK293T cells, reported that viral protein nsP2 and envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 are strong antagonists of the IFN-Î² signaling pathway. Triggering of IFN response, although a common feature of RNA viruses, can vary in amplitude and intensity depending on the virus species and even different genotypes and/or strains from the same species. The characterization of IFN response during the infection of the CHIKV isolates related to the most recent epidemics in Latin America will allow us to understand the pathogenic potential of these viruses.
