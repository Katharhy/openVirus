<p>The role of IFNs for CHIKV pathogenesis is well known. Viral replication is controlled by IFNs in cells, and mice lacking IFNAR have important viral dissemination, related to high rates of mortality (

In cynomolgus macaques, infection with the isolate CHIKV-LR recapitulates common characteristics of the immune response, such as an increase in plasma levels of IFN-α/β, interleukin 6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, correlating with peak levels of viremia (

Moreover, CHIKV is able to interfere with the nuclear translocation of phosphorylated STAT1, a transcription factor that promotes the expression of several ISGs (
