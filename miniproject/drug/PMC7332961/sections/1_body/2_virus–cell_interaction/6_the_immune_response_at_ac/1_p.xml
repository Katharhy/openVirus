<p>The type I interferon (IFN) response is an early innate immune mechanism that elicits antiviral responses and activates components of the innate and adaptive immune systems. IFNs are quickly induced after recognition of viruses by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), mainly by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), cytosolic receptors as retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I), and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) (

After recognition of their respective ligands (double-stranded [ds] RNA for RIG-I and MDA5), the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) is activated via Card-card interactions, domains presented both in MAVS and cytosolic receptors. Then, TBK1 is activated by MAVs and phosphorylates the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), which dimerizes and translocates into the nucleus. This signaling pathway induces the production of type I IFNs through activation of the IFN-α/β promoter. IFNs are secreted and act in autocrine and paracrine ways, after activation of the interferon-α/β receptor (IFNAR), triggering a signaling cascade of events that culminates in the expression of ISGs that enhance viral recognition and interfere with several steps of the viral cycle (
