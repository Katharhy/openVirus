<p>Antibodies and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells are key players in adaptive immune responses. It has been shown the activation and multiplication of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells during the first days of infection followed by a switch to CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells, but the exact role of T-cells in CHIKV infection remains uncertain. In mice, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were recruited to the musculoskeletal tissue in the first week of infection (

 <sup>+</sup> T cells, which would culminate in apoptosis of infected cells (
