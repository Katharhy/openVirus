In most cases, the lesions follow fever episodes, but they also can occur concomitantly since both depend on viremia. They generally do not produce sequelae, but, in some patients, they induce pigmentary changes, mainly in the malar area of the face, with a predilection for the tip of the nose, but also seen in extremities and trunk, desquamation and xerosis (

There are other less common dermatological manifestations, which includes erythema and swelling of the pinnae, mimicking erysipelasâ€™ Milian ear sign; multiple aphthae, erosions, and cheilitis were also observed in oral mucosa, but they were all no-sequelae self-limited manifestations, except for hyperpigmentation of the hard palate in a few patients; and genital involvement, in the form of ulcers, over the scrotum and base of the penile shaft in men and labia majora in women. The infection can also flare-up of pre-existing psoriasis and lichen planus manifestations.
