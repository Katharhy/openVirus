<p>CHIKV, among other mosquito-transmitted alphaviruses, like RRV, Barmah Forest Virus (BFV), and MAYV, can cause debilitating pain and inflammation of joints in humans (

These joint symptoms are usually polyarticular, bilateral, symmetrical, and can fluctuate, but the anatomical location does not usually change (
