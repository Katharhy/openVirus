<p>CHIKV was recognized as a non-lethal infection, however during the outbreak in Reunion Island in 2005â€“2006, the greater number of patients with atypical manifestations of the infection also contributed to the increase in CHIKV-related deaths, with a mortality rate as high as 48% (

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Economopoulou et al., 2009</xref>), but it also links all deaths to the aforementioned atypical manifestations. The major concern of analysts is that many deaths during epidemic periods were underreported by health professionals, which would make the infection mortality rate higher than that already estimated for the disease.
