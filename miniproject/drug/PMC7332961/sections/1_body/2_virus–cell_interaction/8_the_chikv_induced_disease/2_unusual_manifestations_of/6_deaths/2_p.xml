<p>As described above, several atypical manifestations of CHIKV were reported upon recent reemergence and emergence of CHIKV worldwide. In La Reunion Island, clinical features that had never been associated with CHIKF were reported, such as pneumonia, diabetes, bullous dermatosis, toxic hepatitis, encephalitis or meningoencephalitis, myocarditis, and cardio-respiratory failure (

In French Guiana, the introduction of the CHIKV Asian strain was associated with severe forms of the disease, including cases of sepsis and a Guillian-Barr√® syndrome (

Although it is still early to associate CHIKV infection severity with the introduction of different viral strains in susceptible populations, studies are needed in other to characterize the biological properties of different CHIKV strains.
