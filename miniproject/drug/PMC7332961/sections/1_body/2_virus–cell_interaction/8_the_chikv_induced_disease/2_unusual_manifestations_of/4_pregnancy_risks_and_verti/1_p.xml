Regarding its symptoms, on the other hand, the management of infected pregnant women needs to be delicate, since classic high fever can lead to neural tube defects, congenital heart defects, and oral clefts when it occurs in the first trimester of pregnancy (

When it comes to mother-to-child transmission, there is no evidence to sustain the antepartum or peripartum risk of fetal transplacental infection and infected newborns are linked only to the intrapartum transmission when the parturient has a positive viremia (
