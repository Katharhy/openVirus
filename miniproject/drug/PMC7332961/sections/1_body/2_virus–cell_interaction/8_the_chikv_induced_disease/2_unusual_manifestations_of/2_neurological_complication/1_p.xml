<p>In both adults and children, the most prevalent neurological manifestation is encephalitis, during the acute phase of the infection, usually manifested in less than 24 h after the sudden onset of high fever (

 <xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr">Venkatesan et al., 2013</xref>). Although the manifestation of encephalitis, in general, is not related to the age of the patient, the incidence of CHIKV-associated encephalitis shows that individuals younger than 3 years old or older than 65 are more likely to develop the syndrome. Retrospective studies have made it possible to estimate a frequency of 8.6 per 100,000 CHIKV infection cases (

 <xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr">Venkatesan et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Gérardin et al., 2016</xref>); further studies still need to address whether the unprecedented epidemics of CHIKV infection in the South American continent was in fact accompanied by a higher frequency of higher morbidity and atypical clinical manifestations. Some reports, however, had already associated CHIKV infection with diverse neurological complications (
