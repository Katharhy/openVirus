<p>Heart failure was diagnosed in patients with acute infection during La Réunion (island) outbreak of chikungunya fever, in 2005–2006 (

This scenario allows us to jump to two conclusions: (1) 40% of infected patients had a flaw in one of their most vital systems without first manifesting any symptoms that involved it, which makes CHIKV infection a potential cardiovascular risk factor for healthy patients; and (2) the virus has a potentiating character, that is, it can be an unexpected factor in the prognosis of cardiovascular diseases previously diagnosed. Myocarditis after arboviruses infections has been described since 1972 (
