<p>Moreover, CHIKV modulates protein synthesis by interfering with mTOR activation. 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Joubert et al. (2015)</xref> demonstrated that during the first 24 h of infection, mTOR and S6K phosphorylation is reduced, which directly impacts on host cell protein synthesis. mTORC1 low activity is associated with AMP phosphorylation kinase (p-AMPK), an energy-sensing enzyme, followed by TSC2 activation, which acts as an inhibitor of mTOR phosphorylation (

Inhibition of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) increases CHIKV production and this effect is independent of IFN-I production and autophagy induction. To bypass the deleterious effect of mTORC1 inhibition for cap-dependent mRNA translation, CHIKV protein synthesis is mediated via Mnk/eIF4E pathway (

 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family), suggesting that different viruses developed singular strategies to modulate mTORC1 activity (
