<p>The PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is the major pathway that mTOR is involved in. 
 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr">Thaa et al. (2015)</xref> demonstrated that CHIKV infection induces AKT serine 473 phosphorylation but had no effect on S6 phosphorylation, one of the downstream targets of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. AKT phosphorylation by CHIKV is lower compared with other alphaviruses like SFV. SFV nsP3 triggers strong AKT activation, which is associated with the RC internalization. On the other hand, replication complexes were broadly localized at the cell periphery in CHIKV infection (
 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr">Thaa et al., 2015</xref>). However, it remains to be elucidated how different CHIKV strains will impact on both AKT activation and mTOR modulation. Different alphaviruses modulate the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in specific manners associated with particular virus replication features.
