<p>CHIKV infection also results in the shutoff of host cell protein synthesis, whereas viral proteins continue to be synthesized. The host cell shutoff is a result of Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 2 α (eIF2α) phosphorylation (
 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr">White et al., 2011</xref>). Phosphorylation of eIF2α disables the ternary complex, essential for cap-dependent translation initiation. How CHIKV infection results in eIF2α phosphorylation remain unclear. Although infection increases the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) activation, eIF2α phosphorylation also occurs independently of PKR (
