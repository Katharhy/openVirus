<p>Transcriptional shutoff during CHIKV infection impairs the cellular response to viral replication and avoid the establishment of an antiviral state. The CHIKV nsP2 mediate degradation of RBP1, the catalytic subunit of cellular RNA polymerase II, resulting in transcriptional shutoff, cytopathic effect, and reduced IFN-Î² production. Thus, nsP2 expression is cytotoxic and suppresses both cytokine production and activation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in infected cells (
