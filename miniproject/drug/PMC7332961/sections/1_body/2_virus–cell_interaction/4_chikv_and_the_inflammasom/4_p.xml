<p>More recently, Chen and colleagues showed that NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in humans and mice. Expression of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase 1 was100-fold enhanced in PBMCs from a cohort of CHIKV-infected patients. Also, IL18 and IL1 β mRNA levels were increased in these patients in the acute phase of CHIKF (

In a mouse model of CHIKV-induced inflammation, subcutaneous inoculation of ECSA CHIKV strain isolated from La Réunion (LR2006-OPY1), a microarray gene analysis revealed increased expression of NLRP3, NLRP1, NLRC4, IL-1β - and IL-18-binding protein, caspase-1, IL-18 receptor, and IL-18 receptor accessory protein, with high expression coinciding with the peak of inflammatory arthritic disease symptoms (

Furthermore, using a molecule that inhibits the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, the group observed substantial improvement of arthritic symptoms, with a reduction of inflammation, myositis, and osteoclastic bone loss, although the general replication remained at the same levels. Also, in ASC
 <sup>–/–</sup> mice the foot swelling after CHIKV infection was less severe, compared to wild type mice. Taken together, these studies reveal the relevance of inflammasome on CHIKV infection, highlighting its role in the pathology of arthritic disease and inflammation. Concisely, the compelling data open the possibility for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting the inflammasome pathway to ameliorate arthritic symptoms.
