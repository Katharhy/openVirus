<p>The role of inflammasome on CHIKV replication and pathogenesis has been poorly explored. One study, from 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Ekchariyawat et al. (2015)</xref>, demonstrated that CHIKV infection could generate inflammasome signaling in human dermal fibroblasts cells, culminating in activation of caspase 1 and increase IL1 β expression and maturation, as well as induction of the expression of the inflammasome sensor AIM2, although AIM2 has been implicated in recognition of dsDNA only. In the absence of inflammasome assembly (through caspase 1 silencing), CHIKV replication rates were enhanced (
