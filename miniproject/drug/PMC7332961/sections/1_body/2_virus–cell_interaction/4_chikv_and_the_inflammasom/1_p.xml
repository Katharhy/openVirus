<p>Inflammasomes are cytosolic molecular complexes that initiate inflammatory responses upon the detection of pathogens, cellular damage, or environmental irritants by the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Upon activation, inflammasome is assembled and activates caspase-1, which cleaves proinflammatory cytokines prointerleukin-1β (proIL-1β) and prointerleukin-18 (pro IL-18) resulting in proteolytic maturation and secretion of active forms of these cytokines (IL1- β and IL-18, respectively). All these signaling cascades lead to a type of programmed cell death known as pyroptosis that is inherently inflammatory and characterized by caspase 1-dependent formation of plasma membrane pores leading to ion fluxes, that culminates with the cytoplasmic membrane rupture and subsequent release of intracellular content in order to control microbial infections (
