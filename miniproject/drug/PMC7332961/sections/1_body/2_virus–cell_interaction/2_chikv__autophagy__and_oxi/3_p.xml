<p>First reports showed that CHIKV infection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK-293T) leads to an increased number of the microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light-chain 3 (LC3) puncta and augmentation of membrane-bound vacuoles, suggesting that CHIKV infection triggers an autophagic response (
