<p>Oxidative stress is an important mechanism to fight back pathogens. It occurs due to a dysregulation of redox control, caused by increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and/or a reduction in the antioxidant defense system (

 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Joubert et al. (2015)</xref> assessed CHIKV capacity to induce ROS and RNS. They observed, in murine fibroblast cells (MEF), that CHIKV infection led to increased production of both ROS and NO. In addition, they demonstrated that CHIKV-induced autophagy on these cells was mediated by the independent induction of endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) and oxidative stress pathways, delaying cell death by apoptosis through induction of IRE1a-XBP-1 pathway at the same time as ROS-mediated AMPK activation and mTOR inhibition. Consequently, the treatment with

 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Joubert et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it was demonstrated that CHIKV infection can induce endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress at the early stages of infection to trigger autophagy (
