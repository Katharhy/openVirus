<p>In human epithelial adenocarcinoma cells (HeLa), CHIKV infection can regulate autophagy through the interaction between viral proteins and the autophagic receptors sequestosome 1/p62 (SQSTM1/p62) and calcium-binding and coiled-coil domain-containing protein 2/nuclear dot 10 protein 52, known as NDP52. Both proteins are able to interact with both cargo proteins and LC3, directing autophagy targets to autophagosomes (

Therefore, during CHIKV infection, autophagy can be regulated in different ways playing both pro- or anti-viral roles according to the time of the replication cycle and to the cell type and this can be crucial for the infection progression and virus spread.
