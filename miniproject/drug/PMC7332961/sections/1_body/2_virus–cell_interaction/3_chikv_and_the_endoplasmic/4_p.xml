<p>CHIKV infection results in the activation of the UPR pathway in different cell lines. However, results from different groups are discordant and may reflect the cell-specificity for UPR activation. 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Fros et al. (2015)</xref> showed that in Vero cells, the expression of CHIKV envelope proteins alone can induce UPR by the upregulation of ATF4 and GRP78/Bip. Additionally, CHIKV-infected Vero and an adult WT mouse model of CHIKV arthritis only partially induced by XBP1. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated that individual expression of CHIKV non-structural protein nsP2 protein was sufficient to inhibit the UPR pathway (

In these cells, CHIKV infection blocked eIF2α phosphorylation even in the presence of pharmacological activation of UPR by Thapsigargin and Tunicamycin. The authors demonstrated that nsP4 was sufficient to inhibit phosphorylation of eIF2α (
