<p>The ER is an essential cellular membrane organelle, with a dynamic structure that plays important roles in many cellular processes, including protein synthesis, folding and secretion, calcium homeostasis, lipid production, and the transport of cellular components. ER plays an essential role in the replication process of several viruses, including viral entry, assembly, protein synthesis, and genome replication. The massive viral replication can cause disturbances on the protein folding machinery, disrupting ER homeostasis, which culminates in ER stress (

The ER stress activates an evolutionarily conserved prosurvival pathway, termed the unfolded protein response (UPR), that acts for maintenance of ER homeostasis. UPR has three main mechanisms to restore the adequate ER function: (1) inhibition of protein synthesis, (2) induction of genes of chaperone family, necessary for the folding protein processes, (3) eliminating the amount of misfolded or unfolded proteins by activation of the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway (
