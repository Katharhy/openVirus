<p>Data regarding ER stress and UPR during CHIKV infection, although apparently conflicting, indicate that CHIKV infection can elicit distinct interactions with cell machinery depending on the cell type and possibly the viral strain analyzed. These data raise the necessity to further investigate the role of UPR on cell lines with close similarity to the cells naturally infected by CHIKV, as epithelial cells, skin fibroblasts, muscular, and endothelial cells. Furthermore, the use of mouse models of infection can also contribute to determining the relevance of the UPR signaling to CHIKV replication and pathogenesis.</p>
