<p>ER stress, autophagy, and apoptosis in response to CHIKV infection were also investigated in HeLa and HepG2 cells and showed distinct results. In HeLa cells, CHIKV infection activated the PERK branch of UPR, with consequent eIF2α phosphorylation (

 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Joubert et al. (2012)</xref> observed activation of UPR in HeLa through the splicing of XBP1 by IRE1 during CHIKV infection. The ATF6 branch was also activated in these cells. Whereas in HepG2 IRE1 activation was strong, the activation of PERK and ATF6 was less pronounced and only a low level of eIF2α phosphorylation was observed. For both cells, the downstream protein CHOP, which is involved in apoptosis signaling, was also upregulated (
