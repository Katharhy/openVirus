<p>Moreover, the silencing of IRE1 during CHIKV infection of HeLa leads to fewer CHIKV-induced autophagosomes. Apparently, CHIKV-induced autophagy is dependent on both triggering of oxidative stress and UPR pathways. These data reinforce the idea that the ER could serve as a subcellular platform for autophagy initiation. Signaling of UPR and autophagy are interconnected, and these two pathways crosstalk to modulate the cell survival or dead by apoptosis (
