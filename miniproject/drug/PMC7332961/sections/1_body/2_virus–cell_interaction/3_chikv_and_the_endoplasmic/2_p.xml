<p>In mammalian cells, the three main branches of the UPR are the protein kinase-like ER-resident kinase (PERK), the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1). These proteins are associated with the ER chaperone BiP/Grp78. When unproperly folded proteins accumulate in the ER lumen, BiP/Grp78 dissociates from these three transmembrane signaling proteins, resulting in activation and initiation of the UPR pathway. Then, activated PERK phosphorylates eIF2Î± at Ser51, decreasing the load of proteins entering into the ER lumen by blocking general protein translation. Activated ATF6 is a transcription factor that increases the transcription of a number of ER chaperones, the X box-binding protein 1 (XBP1), and other transcription factors. Activation of IRE1 results in the IRE1 mediated splicing of the XBP1 mRNA, which activates the expression of downstream genes like chaperones and other proteins involved in protein degradation (
