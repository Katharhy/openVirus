<p>CHIKV ECSA also reached the southeast region of Brazil, causing large outbreaks. Increasing evidence indicates that the ECSA genotype has predominated in the Southern region, especially in Rio de Janeiro. 
 <xref rid="B186" ref-type="bibr">Xavier et al. (2019)</xref> sequenced 11 near-complete CHIKV genomes from clinical samples of patients from Rio de Janeiro, and together with the whole sequencing of 2 CHIKV genomes from positive individuals by 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Cunha et al. (2017)</xref>, during the 2016 outbreak, and 10 partially sequenced samples (CHIKV E1 gene) by 
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">Souza et al. (2017)</xref>, the phylogenetic reconstructions confirmed that in Rio de Janeiro the ECSA strain is the driving force of the epidemics (
