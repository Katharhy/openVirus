<p>CHIKV autochthonous cases were confirmed in Colombia in September 2014, and during the epidemics (2014–2015) more than 460,000 cases diagnosed of CHIKF by clinical features were reported, with the majority of them occurring in women, with 12 fatal cases reported. The rate of new infections is decreasing over time, although Colombia is the country with the third-highest number of infections, according to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). The characterization of Colombian CHIKV genomes determined that it belongs to the Asian strain and clustered with three distinct Asian strain branches: Panama (Caribbean Colombia, Huila); Nicaragua (Cauca and Risaralda); and St. Barts (Bogotá, D.C), which may be the result of three independent introductions. Each subclade showed non-synonymous mutations (nsP2-A153V, Y543H, G720A; nsP3-L458P; and Capsid R78Q), and that may impact on CHIKV fitness and pathogenesis (
