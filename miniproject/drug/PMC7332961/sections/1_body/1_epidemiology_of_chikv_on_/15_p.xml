<p>The dynamics of CHIKV disease in South America, its spread, and the outcome expected can be influenced by several complex factors. The climate patterns, like pluviosity, humidity, ocean-atmosphere climate phenomenon, such as El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), as well as other parameters, as vector habitat availability, adaptability of the virus into a new vector species, cocirculation of other arboviruses, heterogeneity of health systems in each country, country’s economy and the Human Development Index, mobility of individuals (by traveling, exodus, among other reasons), the efficiency in combating disease vectors, the capacity of surveillance and epidemiological vigilance, with the proper actions to stop the outbreaks. All the previous parameters are related to viral vector biology and adaptability. In any case, the biological behavior of each CHIKV strain cannot be ruled out and the characterization of different CHIKV strains in terms of replication, virus-cell interaction, and pathogenesis urge to be determined.</p>
