<p>Phylogenetic analysis also demonstrated that the origin of ECSA strain in Rio de Janeiro was from the north-eastern region of Brazil. 
 <xref rid="B186" ref-type="bibr">Xavier et al. (2019)</xref> also showed that there is high human mobility between the two regions and the epidemic waves from the north-eastern region and Rio de Janeiro state had synchronicity during late 2015 to the early months of 2016. Moreover, they estimated that CHIKV was circulating unnoticed for at least 5 months before the first reports of autochthonous transmissions in Rio de Janeiro (
