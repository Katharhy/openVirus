<p>Even though several studies pointed out that E2 acts on CHIKV binding to surface cell receptors, while E1 is the main protein factor involved in the intracellular process of virus entry, there is evidence that points to shared participation of the two proteins at the viral entry and its subsequent events. First, like other alphaviruses, CHIKV can use endocytosis to enter a cell, in a pH-dependent process in clathrin-coated vesicles via receptor-mediated interaction (

In this scenario, after CHIKV enter cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis, the acidic endosomal environment results in glycoproteins irreversible conformational changes followed by E2-E1 heterodimers dissociation and E1 rearrangement into fusogenic homotrimers that induce fusion of viral and endosomal membrane, allowing the release of the nucleocapsid into the cytosol (

 <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr">Weaver et al., 1994</xref>) makes something very clear about CHIKV: the virus, its vectors, and its final hosts have been coevolving for a long time. Therefore, other pathways did not take long to be elucidated, like the clathrin-independent, epidermal growth factor receptor substrate15 (Eps15)-dependent pathway (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Bernard et al., 2010</xref>), which also takes the virus particle into the endosome. A third pathway exploited by the virus to get into an acidic cell compartment is the macropinocytosis, recently attributed to CHIKV (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2019</xref>), but an already well-established mechanism for other enveloped viruses, such as Ebola virus (EBOV), and non-enveloped viruses, such as adenoviruses; the Rab GTPases- and phosphoinositide-dependent maturation of the macropinosome induces its fusion to endosomal compartments (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Egami et al., 2014</xref>). The low pH of acid milieu creates the proper microenvironment required to induce conformational changes in the viral envelope, dissociating E1-E2 heterodimers and forming E1 homotrimers, allowing CHIKV fusion to the endosome membrane and the release of the nucleocapsid into the target cellâ€™s cytosol where, as it was demonstrated to the Sindbis Virus (SINV), the uncoating of the viral genomic RNA is carried out by the association of the CP and the ribosomes (
