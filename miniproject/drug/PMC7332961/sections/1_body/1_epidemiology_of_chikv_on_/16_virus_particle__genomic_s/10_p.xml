<p>More recently, two other cellular factors binding to the HVD of nsP3 were implicated in promoting virus replication and permissiveness of CHIKV infection. The host DHX9 DEXH-box helicase is a DNA/RNA helicase that has been demonstrated to participate in the replication of diverse RNA positive viruses (
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Arteriviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> – Pestivirus genus, and 
 <italic>Retroviridae</italic> – HIV-1). 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Matkovic et al. (2019)</xref> showed that the nsP3 HVD binds DHX9, redirects this protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm at discrete puncta structures to increase CHIKV genomic RNA translation early at the viral infectious cycle. Further, they demonstrated that CHIKV nsP2 also binds to DHX9 and targets it to the proteasomal for its degradation. This step is critical to the switch of genomic RNA translation to replication (
