<p>The glycoprotein E3 is translated right after the capsid protein; it aids with cellular chaperones in the proper folding of E2 and E1, and has a specified signal sequence that addresses the remainder of the polyprotein to the ER membranes. It remains associated with E2, which is why both are called pE2 at this stage, until the moment it reaches the 
 <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi, where the cellular Furin protease is responsible for the cleavage of pE2 in E2 and E3, making the “spike” now functional.
