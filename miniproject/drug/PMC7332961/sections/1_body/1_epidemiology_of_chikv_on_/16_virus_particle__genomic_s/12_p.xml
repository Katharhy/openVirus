<p>Collectively, these new findings help to expand the model of CHIKV replication: after the release of viral capsid in the target cell cytoplasm, uncoating of genomic RNA is followed by the translation of P123 and P1234 non-structural precursors, facilitated by the host DHX9 helicase. The initial RC complex formed by P123 and nsP4 then associates with the incoming genomic RNA and the complex is targeted to the plasma membrane by the nsP1 portion of P123. G3BP and FXR factors associates with the RC complex at this very early stage to avoid genomic RNA degradation. DHX9 degradation by the viral nsP2 is critical to the switch from translation to viral replication. Once the first double-stranded RNA replication intermediates are synthesized, they are isolated into the membrane spherule leading to the amplification of these processes. The new synthesized positive-stranded genomic RNAs exit the membrane spherules and are translated in close proximity of the plasma membrane, forming new RC complexes, which by binding of G3BP, FXR, and possibly FHL1, oligomerize and increase the formation of new RCs to amplify the amount of viral genomic RNA within the infected cell early on the infection. Studies from SINV and SFV suggest a high dynamics of spherule internalization through a Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) activated endocytosis, actin and myosin-dependent transport, and fusion with late endosomes (
