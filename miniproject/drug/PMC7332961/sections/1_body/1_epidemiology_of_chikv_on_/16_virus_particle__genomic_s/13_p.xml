<p>Subgenomic viral RNAs exiting from CPV-1 are immediately translated in close proximity to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) to produce the viral structural polyprotein. At the C-terminal of the CP, a peptide signal leads to the translocation of the polyprotein across the ER membrane. Whereas, through proteolytic processing, it will give rise to intermediate proteins CP, p62, 6K or 6k/TF and E1. From a new stage of proteolysis, hijacking cellular proteases, the final structural proteins will appear: CP, E2, E3, 6K, or 6K/TF and E1 (

Thus, CP is autocleaved out of the structural precursor protein by its Serine-protease activity. In CHIKV the CP N-terminal is unstructured and has the RNA-binding domain, whereas the C-terminal globular domain harbor the Serine-Histidine-Aspartic acid protease domain. CP will remain in the cytosol for the formation of the viral nucleocapsid.
