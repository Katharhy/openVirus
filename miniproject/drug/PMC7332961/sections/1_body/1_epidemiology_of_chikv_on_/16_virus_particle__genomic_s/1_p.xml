<p>The CHIKV viral particle carries the 11.8 Kb, single-stranded positive genomic RNA, which is arranged in two modules: the 5′ two-thirds codes for the non-structural protein (nsPs1-4) and the 3′ one-third codes for the structural proteins (CP, E3, E2, 6K, E1) (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Knipe et al., 2001</xref>); additionally the 3′ one-third can be translated as a truncated polyprotein composed of CP, E3, E2, C-terminal 6K fused with a Transframe or TF peptide (

 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">Snyder et al., 2013</xref>). The 5′ terminus is capped with a 7-methylguanosine and the 3′ terminus is polyadenylated. The genomic RNA is enclosed by a capsid formed by 240 copies of a single Capsid (CP) protein arranged as icosahedrons with T4 symmetry. This nucleocapsid is delimited by the external phospholipid envelope formed essentially by cholesterol and sphingolipid derived from the host cell plasma membrane containing the virus glycoproteins E1 and E2. Each CP interacts with the cytosolic domain of E2. The glycoproteins are arranged as trimeric spikes composed of heterodimers of E1 and E2, and each viral particle contains 80 spikes which lead to the incorporation of 240 copies of E1 and E2 (reviewed in

 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Jin and Simmons, 2019</xref>). Glycoproteins E1 and E2 mediate CHIKV infection of susceptible cells, where E2 is responsible for receptor binding while E1 plays a role in viral-host membranes fusion.
