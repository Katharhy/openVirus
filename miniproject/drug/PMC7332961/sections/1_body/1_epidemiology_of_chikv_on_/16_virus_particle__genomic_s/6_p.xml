<p>The full-length P1234 is autocatalytically cleaved into nsP4 and P123, the premature cleavage of nsP4 has a simple biological explanation: the cycle’s continuity depends on fast replication of the viral genetic material. The nsP1-4 are part of the replication complex (RC), which will determine the replication of the viral genomic RNA and the transcription of the genomic and the subgenomic (26S RNA) viral RNAs. The initial RC complex is formed by the uncleaved P123 plus nsP4 (P123-nsP4), which is targeted and anchored to the plasma membrane by the association of the nsP1alpha-helical peptide and palmitoylated amino acids within the P123. The association of the nsP1 membrane-binding domain with the plasma membrane will induce bulb-shaped invaginations, called spherule, where viral RNA synthesis takes place (

The negative-strand RNA bears the subgenomic promoter, a sequence of 21 nucleotides, complementary to the nucleotides of the junction region, 19 of the upstream and two downstream of the replication’s initiation point. The subgenomic 26S RNA is identical in sequence to the one-third of the genomic RNA 3′ terminus and serves as a template to structural proteins synthesis. Like genomic RNA, the subgenomic RNA is also capped and polyadenylated (
