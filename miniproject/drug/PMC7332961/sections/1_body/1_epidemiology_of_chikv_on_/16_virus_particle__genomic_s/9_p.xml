<p>The nsP3 acts as a replicase unit and also as an accessory protein involved in RNA synthesis by recruiting several host-cell factors that participate and optimize viral replication. The nsP3 hypervariable domain (HVD), at the C-terminus, binds the Ras-GHP SH3 domain (G3BP) protein family to promote replication for several alphaviruses. This biding is particularly critical for CHIKV and is, in part, related to the capacity of the virus to inhibit stress granule formation (

Beyond a role in avoiding the formation of stress granules, binding of nsP3 to these proteins is also important to promote viral RNA synthesis by facilitating the assembly of the RC complexes. Different studies have shown that for several alphaviruses the nsP3 binding to these family members is virus-specific and also cell type-specific, presenting a high level of redundancy. However, for CHIKV the binding of host factors from different families is not redundant (
