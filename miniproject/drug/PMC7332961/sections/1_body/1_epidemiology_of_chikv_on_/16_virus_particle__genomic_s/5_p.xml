<p>Interestingly, some isolates of alphaviruses code an amino acid residue at the place of the opal stop codon. For instance, a SINV isolate presenting severe morbidity and mortality in mice codes for cysteine at the opal stop codon position (

 <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> mosquito vector is related to the presence of the opal stop codon (

Analyses by deep-sequencing of a Caribbean isolate of CHIKV (ECSA-derived IOL linage) demonstrated the presence of both the opal stop codon and arginine at the end of nsP3 coding region. The moderate disease was observed in mice infected with a Sri Lanka CHIKV isolate harboring an opal stop codon to arginine change. Sri Lanka isolate shares high similarity with the Caribbean isolate, and the opal stop codon to arginine change did not alter viral replication kinetics (
