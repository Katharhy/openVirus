<p>Four and a half highly conserved LIM1 domain (FHL1) is a cellular protein that recently has been implicated as a cellular factor promoting CHIKV tropism. This protein has three distinct spliced isoforms in human cells (1A, 1B, and 1C). 1A is abundantly expressed in skeletal muscles and fibroblasts, while 1B and 1C are present in muscle, brain, and testis. 
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">Meertens et al. (2019)</xref> demonstrated that FHL1 binds to the nsP3 HVD and promotes CHIKV replication. This host factor was also important to the ONNV Old World alphavirus, while it had no impact on the replication of the New World alphaviruses MAYV, SINV, and Semliki Forest Virus (SFV). Primary cells from patients with FHL1 deficiency were resistant to CHIKV infection, highlighting the importance of this cellular factor in promoting skeletal muscle and fibroblast tropism of CHIKV and viral pathogenesis. Strikingly, the dependence of this factor was demonstrated for all CHIKV strains, except the Western African linage, reinforcing the hypothesis that the success of emergent and re-emergent CHIKV strains to spread and establish in the human population and on mosquito vectors will be determined by the interaction of different host factors and the viral proteins.
