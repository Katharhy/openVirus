<p>Until recently, the cellular receptor used by CHIKV, and other arthritogenic alphaviruses, was not known, but several pieces of evidence pointed out to CHIKV use of glycosaminoglycans (

 <xref rid="B189" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2018)</xref> demonstrated that CHIKV and other arthritogenic alphaviruses, such as Ross River Virus (RRV) and Mayaro Virus (MAYV), use Mxra8 (also known as DICAM, ASP, or Limitrin) as a cell receptor for virus entry. Mxra8 is an adhesion molecule of epithelial, myeloid, and mesenchymal cells with homology to the junctional adhesion molecule that serves as the receptor for reoviruses. The immunoglobulin domains A and B of CHIKV E2 bind to Mxra8 and this binding was necessary for CHIKV mouse infection. Interestingly, infection with the CHIKV ECSA strain La RÃ©union did not show any requirement to use Mxra8 for viral entry, which indicates that other unknown molecules can function as CHIKV receptors. In addition, this observation demonstrates that different genotypes of CHIKV can adapt differently to the host, thus possibly indicating divergent outcomes of CHIKV disease.
