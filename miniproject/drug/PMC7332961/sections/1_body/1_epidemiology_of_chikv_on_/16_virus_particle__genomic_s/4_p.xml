<p>Like other togaviruses and due to the particular arrangement of alphavirus genomic RNA, following uncoating, the CHIKV non-structural (ns) proteins are translated as polyproteins P123 and P1234, with 1,857 amino acids and 2,475 amino acids, respectively. A well-conserved opal (UGA) stop codon is present at the C-terminus of nsP3 and determines the translation of P123, which contains the nsP1, nsP2 and, nsP3 proteins. The readthrough of the opal stop codon leads to the translation of the full-length P1234, that contains the nsP4 protein, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), in addition to the nsP1-nsP3 proteins. The readthrough frequency of the opal stop codon, determined for the SINV, is about 5â€“20% of the genomic mRNA translation. Therefore, the stoichiometric concentration of nsP4 is 1/20 to 1/5 of the other non-structural proteins (
