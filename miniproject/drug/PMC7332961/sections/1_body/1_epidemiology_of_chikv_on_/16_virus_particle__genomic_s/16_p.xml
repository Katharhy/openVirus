<p>The 6K protein is a hydrophobic small protein that joins the E2 and E1 parts of the polyprotein, allowing for proper envelope processing. It also participates in membrane permeabilization, virus assembly, and budding. An additional protein, which is an extension of the 6K N-terminus, is also synthesized during alphavirus infection. This protein results from a −1 frameshift event 40 nucleotides before the beginning of E1 glycoprotein and leads to the formation of a truncated structural precursor, as described above (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Firth et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">Snyder et al., 2013</xref>). This frameshift occurs in a 10–18% frequency during the subgenomic RNA translation. The resulting protein is an 8 kDa TF that is incorporated into viral particles and probably participates in viral assembly.
