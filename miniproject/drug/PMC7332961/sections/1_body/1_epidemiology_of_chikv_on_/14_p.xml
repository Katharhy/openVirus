<p>Although the Brazilian ECSA CHIKV did not harbor the E1-A226V and E2-(L210Q, V264A), which were also related to CHIKV-vector adaptability (
 <xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr">Tsetsarkin and Weaver, 2011</xref>), unique mutations such as E1-K211T, E1-N335D, E1-A377V, and E1-M407L are present together with E2-A103T (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Cunha et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">Souza et al., 2017</xref>). The impact of these mutations on CHIKV adaptability to 
 <italic>Aedes ssp.</italic> vectors still needs to be addressed, but as for the polymorphic E1-211K, the E1-K211E mutation has been implicated in better viral transmission for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> but not for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, the unprecedented spread of the ECSA strain in Brazil, which substituted the Asian strain in the north part of the country, suggests a greater potential of transmission of this strain.
