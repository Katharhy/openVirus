<p>Corroborating data from 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Cunha et al. (2017)</xref>, the genomes of the CHIVK circulating ECSA strain did not carry the E1-A226V and E2-L210Q 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> adaptive changes. In fact, in Brazil, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is the main circulating mosquito strain (

 <xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">Souza et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B186" ref-type="bibr">Xavier et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, it is expected that mutations that confer high viral fitness in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> have not been fixed at these locals.
