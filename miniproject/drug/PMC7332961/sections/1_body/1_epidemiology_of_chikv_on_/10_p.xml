<p>The first local transmission of the CHIKV in Brazil that occurred in September 2014, at the city of Oiapoque, state of Amapá, localized in the Northern region of Brazil was related to the Asian lineage. Soon after this first autochthonous detection, CHIKV infections from the ECSA genotype were notified in the city of Feira de Santana, Bahia state, the north-eastern region of Brazil. Asian and ECSA genotypes co-circulate in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil (

In 2017 this strain reached the Amazon region. Interestingly, while the north and southeast regions of Brazil had the majority of CHIKV cases in 2016, Roraima, for instance, the northernmost state of Brazil located in the Amazon basin, only had its exponential increase of cases in 2017. All strains analyzed from this outbreak in Roraima were of the ESCA strain. An extended analysis demonstrated that most cases circulating in Roraima and Amapa since 2015 were of the CHIKV ECSA origin (

The CHIKV Asian strain was first identified in Roraima in 2014, representing people returning from Venezuela, but the infection did not spread from these two cases. This data demonstrates the high potential of CHIKV ECSA spread in the Brazilian territory.
