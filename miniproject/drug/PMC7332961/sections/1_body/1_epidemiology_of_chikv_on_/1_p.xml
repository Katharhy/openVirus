<p>In 2013, the American continent reported the first cases of autochthonous transmission of CHIKV on the island of Saint Martin and Martinique Islands. In January 2014, CHIKV transmissions occurred in several Caribbean islands, including Dominica, Anguilla, British Virgin Islands, Saint Barthelemy, Guadeloupe, the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis, Dominican Republic; and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The number of infected people overcame 30,000 cases in 4 months. It is interesting to note that at these sites, only 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes were the circulating vectors (

 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Leparc-Goffart et al., 2014</xref>), indicating that different from the explosion of CHIKV infections in La Reunion related to viral adaptation to another mosquitoes vector, other factors contributed to the introduction and spread of CHIKV in the American continent. Lanciotti and Valadere demonstrated that the strain of CHIKV circulating in the Caribbean Islands belongs to Asian genotype and is closely related to strains circulating in Indonesia (2007), China (2012), Yap Islands (2013), and Philippines (2013) (
