<p>Ecuador was another country that early confirmed community transmission of CHIKV. 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al. (2020)</xref> showed that CHIKV was introduced into Ecuador at multiple time points in 2013â€“2014, and these introductions were all associated with the Caribbean islands, despite the increasing influx of Venezuelan citizens. From 2014 to 2017, Ecuador reported 35,714 CHIKF cases. The transmission for two or more years after the 2015 epidemic peak suggests that CHIKV has become endemic in this country. The CHIKF outbreaks in Ecuador were associated with the Asian strain which harbors the E1:A98T and E1:K211E amino acid changes. Since 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is the main mosquito vector in Ecuador this data indicates that CHIKV had not acquired all the adaptative substitutions necessary to increase viral fitness within this vector (
