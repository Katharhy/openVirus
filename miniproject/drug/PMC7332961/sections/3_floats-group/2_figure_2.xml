  <p>CHIKV life cycle in mammalian infected cells. 
   <bold>(1)</bold> CHIKV cell binding occurs through the interaction of virus E2 protein and a still unknown cellular receptor. Like other alphaviruses, it can enter the cell by clathrin-dependent and independent endocytosis. 
   <bold>(2)</bold> Once inside the endosome, the acidic environment leads to conformational rearrangement of glycoproteins followed by dissociation of E2-E1 heterodimers and E1 rearrangement into fusogenic homotrimers that induce fusion of viral and endosomal membrane, allowing the release of nucleocapsid into the cytosol. 
   <bold>(3)</bold> Following uncoating and genomic RNA release, the non-structural proteins are translated as polyproteins denominated P123 and P1234. 
   <bold>(4)</bold> A replicative complex (RC) formed by uncleaved P123 plus nsP4, the genomic RNA, and several host factors is targeted and anchored at the plasma membrane inducing bulb-shaped invaginations, known as spherules, where RNA synthesis will occur. dsRNA indicates the viral replicative intermediate. nsP1-3 associates with nsP4 in a specific quaternary structure converts the RC into a positive-strand RNA replicase, which synthesizes the viral genomic and subgenomic RNAs. Spherules are internalizate and shape functional large cytopathic vacuoles that bear multiple spherules. 
   <bold>(5)</bold> Subgenomic RNA (26S) is translated, producing the structural polyprotein 
   <bold>(6)</bold> E1and E2-E3 (pE2) are translocated into the ER and go through the post-translational process of maturation and glycosylation. 
   <bold>(7)</bold> Capsid autoproteolysis releases free capsid into the cytoplasm that interacts with genomic RNA, giving origin to the nucleocapsid. 
   <bold>(8)</bold> The viruses bud out of infected cells through the cell membrane in a pH and temperature-dependent process. 
   <bold>(9)</bold> CHIKV replication induces ER stress and activates the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). By non-elucidated mechanisms CHIKV infection also results in oxidative stress, generating Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and Reactive Nitrogen Species (NRS). 
   <bold>(10)</bold> Both ER and oxidative stress can trigger autophagy, a pro-survival signal, in an attempt to preserve cell viability. When CHIKV capsid is produced in the cytoplasm, it can be ubiquitinated and sequestered by adaptor protein SQMT1/p62 into the autophagosomes, leading to capsid degradation in the autophagolisosome. 
   <bold>(11)</bold> CHIKV is able to trigger NLRP3 inflammasome, starting a signaling cascade that culminates in the activation of the caspase 1, that turns able to cleaves of pro IL-1Î² and pro IL-18, generating mature cytokines, that will elicit adaptive responses, but also can contribute to pathological inflammatory events such as edema and arthritic disease symptoms.
