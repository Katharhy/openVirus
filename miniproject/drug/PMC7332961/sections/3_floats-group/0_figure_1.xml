   <bold>(A)</bold> Global distribution of CHIKV lineages. CHIKV infections are more likely to occur in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the globe, highlighted in red on the map. The geometric forms represent the different lineages of CHIKV that are currently in circulation. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The number of confirmed cases is shown for each country individually. There is not autochthonous transmission reported in Chile and Uruguay, only imported cases. The Asian strain first reached South America by French Guyana, but ECSA strain has arrived by northeast Brazil and got predominated in Brazil. The colors represent the circulation of Aedes aegypti and albopictus in each country, as indicated in the subtitle.
