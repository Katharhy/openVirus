<p id="Par29">SeveralÂ randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of IVIG therapy in severe COVID-19 are underway (NCT04350580, NCT04381858, NCT04261426). Both the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID19 subcommittee do not recommend the use of commercially available IVIG (i.e. non-SARS-CoV-2-specific IVIG) for the treatment of COVID-19, in part because the current IVIG preparations are not likely to contain SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [
