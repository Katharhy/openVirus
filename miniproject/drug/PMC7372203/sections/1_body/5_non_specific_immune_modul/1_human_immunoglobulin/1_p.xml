<p id="Par27">Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) contains immunoglobulin G of all subclasses obtained from pooled human plasma [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. IVIG has been used to provide immunity to viral infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], including SARS, although the benefits of the treatment were inconclusive and some cases of thromboembolic complications were reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. IVIG is different from hyperimmune globulin from convalescent plasma, wherein the plasma is prepared from the plasma of donors with high antibody titers to specific pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. The mechanisms of action of IVIG are complex, and several mechanisms might account for its therapeutic benefit [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. IVIG can inhibit the activation and functions of various innate immune cells, and can neutralize activated complement components. It also impacts the adaptive immune system by modulating B-cell functions and plasma cells, regulating regulatory T cells and effector T cells such as T-helper (Th) 1 and Th17 subsets, and inhibiting inflammatory cytokines. It has also been proposed that IVIG can exert anti-inflammatory action by saturating Fcγ receptor binding, and binding to antiviral antibodies and proinflammatory cytokines [
