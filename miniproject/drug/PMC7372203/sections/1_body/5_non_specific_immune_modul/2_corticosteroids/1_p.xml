<p id="Par30">Corticosteroids have potent anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties, which theoretically could have a role in suppressing lung inflammation, particularly in the advanced stages of the disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. The debate regarding the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients is far from conclusive. Low doses of corticosteroids downregulate proinflammatory cytokine transcription, consequently preventing an extended cytokine response and accelerating the resolution of pulmonary and systemic inflammation in pneumonia [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>], a possible complication of COVID-19, and can increase blood pressure in hypotensive patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. However, the use of corticosteroids can inhibit immune response, reduce pathogen clearance, and provoke viral replication [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Thus, it might be reasonable to use corticosteroids in severe cases of COVID-19 with ARDS, providing that a low dose (≤ 0.5–1 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone or equivalent) and short duration (≤ 7 days) are used [
