<p id="Par31">Earlier studies have shown that corticosteroid use in patients with SARS, MERS, and influenza was associated with no survival benefit and possible harm. Patients with SARS receiving corticosteroids reported adverse events such as avascular necrosis, psychosis, diabetes, and delayed viral clearance [
