<p id="Par33">The use of methylprednisolone in severe COVID-19 patients was evaluated in several retrospective, observational studies. Wang et al. showed that in 46 patients with confirmed severe COVID-19 pneumonia that progressed to acute respiratory failure, the use of methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg daily intravenously for 5–7 days in 26 patients was associated with a shorter average number of days to fever resolution (2.06 ± 0.28 vs. 5.29 ± 0.70;

 <sub>2</sub>, and lower number of days on supplemental oxygen therapy [8.2 days (IQR 7.0–10.3) vs. 13.5 days (IQR 10.3–16);

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003) among patients with ARDS [
