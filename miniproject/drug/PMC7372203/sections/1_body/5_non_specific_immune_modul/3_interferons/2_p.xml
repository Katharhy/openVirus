<p id="Par35">A 2003 open-label, uncontrolled study of 22 SARS patients, 9 of whom received corticosteroids in combination with INF alfacon-1, showed that patients who received this combination were less likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (11.1% vs. 38.5%), had a shorter time to 50% resolution of lung radiographic abnormalities (4 days vs. 9 days; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001), and had better oxygen saturation (10 days vs. 16 days; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02) compared with SARS patients who received corticosteroids alone [

Another retrospective cohort study of 44 patients investigated the use of ribavirin and INFα-2a compared with ribavirin alone for the management of severe MERS. The study reported both a 14-day and 28-day survival advantage in favor of the combination (70% vs. 29%,
