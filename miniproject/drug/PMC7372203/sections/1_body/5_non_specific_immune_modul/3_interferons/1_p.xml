<p id="Par34">IFNs are cytokines that play a key factor in reducing viral multiplication and modulating host immune response against viral infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. They consist of the ubiquitous α and β subtypes. IFNs are released by plasmacytoid dendritic cells during a viral infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. IFN treatment has been studied against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Due to their nonspecific antiviral effects, IFNs are mainly tested in combination with other agents, such lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, remdesivir, corticosteroids, or IFNγ [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. When IFNs bind to their receptors, they activate IFN-stimulated genes, which play an important role in inflammation, signaling, and immunomodulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. IFNs also sensitize human cells to viral proteins to prevent viral fusion or egress [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. In vitro studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be more sensitive to IFN than other coronaviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. While INFs were shown to be efficient in in vitro and animal models, they did not demonstrate a beneficial effect in patients with SARS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>].
