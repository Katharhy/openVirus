<p id="Par36">INFs are being investigated for use in nebulized form (IFNα-2b) or as subcutaneous injections (INFβ-1b) for the management of COVID-19 (NCT04293887, NCT04350281). Clinical trials evaluating subcutaneous peginterferon lambda-1a for treatment (e.g. NCT04354259, NCT04388709) and postexposure prophylaxis (e.g. NCT04344600) of SARS-CoV-2 infection are also underway. A multicenter, randomized, prospective study on pediatric patients with respiratory syncytial virus investigated the use of nebulized INFα-1b compared with the subcutaneous injection. The study revealed that the nebulized form has a faster onset of action, a direct action on the mucosal epithelial cells in the lungs, less systemic adverse effects, and is less invasive to the pediatric population compared with the subcutaneous form [
