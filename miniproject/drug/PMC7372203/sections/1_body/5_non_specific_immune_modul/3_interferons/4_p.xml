<p id="Par37">Recently, a multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized, phase II trial included 127 adult patients with COVID-19 who received triple antiviral therapy of lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, and nebulized IFNβ-1b [

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and a SOFA score of 0 (3.0 days vs. 8.0 days; HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.03–3.49;

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.016). In addition, the combination group had a significantly shorter median time from treatment initiation to negative nasopharyngeal swab (7 days vs. 12 days; HR 4.37, 95% CI 1.86–10.24; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0010), suggesting that the triple antiviral therapy could shorten the duration of viral shedding. Additionally, in a retrospective study of 77 hospitalized adults with moderate COVID-19 disease who received aerosolized IFNα-2b (5 million units twice daily; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 7), umifenovir (
 <italic>n</italic> = 24), or both drugs (
 <italic>n</italic> = 46), the time from symptom onset to negative RT-PCR result in the throat swab was shorter in the arm receiving IFNα-2b alone or in combination with umifenovir compared with those receiving umifenovir alone [
