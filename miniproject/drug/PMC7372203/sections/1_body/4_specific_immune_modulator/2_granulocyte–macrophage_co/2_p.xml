<p id="Par21">Given their effects in driving immune functions, GM-CSFs may confer benefit to COVID-19 patients by providing the stimulus to restore pulmonary hemostasis and repair [

 <sup>®</sup>), the only FDA-approved GM-CSF, is a yeast-derived recombinant humanized GM-CSF (rhuGM-CSF) that is currently being investigated as an adjuvant therapy for the management of COVID-19 associated with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS (NCT04326920). Patients will be randomized to receive nebulized sargramostim 125 μg twice daily for 5 days in addition to standard of care, or standard-of-care treatment alone. Patients in the experimental arm who progress to ARDS requiring initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation within the 5-day period will be switched to intravenous sargramostim 125 μg/m
