 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Since GM-CSF functions upstream of other proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, GM-CSF-targeted immunomodulation may be a viable therapy for this stage of the disease. One potential agent is gimsilumab, a clinical stage, fully human monoclonal antibody targeting GM-CSF. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter pivotal trial evaluating the role of intravenous gimsilumab in the prevention and treatment of ARDS and mortality in COVID-19 is underway (NCT04351243). A single-arm, open-label pilot study will study the role of TJM2, a monoclonal antibody capable of neutralizing GM-CSF, in decreasing cytokine levels in severe SARS-CoV-2 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Other anti-GM-CSF agents, including lenzilumab (NCT04351152) and namilumab [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], are also being evaluated.
