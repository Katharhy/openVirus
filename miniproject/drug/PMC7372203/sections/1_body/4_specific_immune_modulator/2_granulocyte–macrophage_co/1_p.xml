<p id="Par20">GM-CSF is a pleiotropic growth factor and proinflammatory cytokine that is released from alveolar epithelial cells and has been shown to drive pulmonary host defense function against pathogens, including the influenza virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Besides their role in inducing proliferation and differentiation of macrophages and dendritic cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], GM-CSF stimulates epithelial repair, including epithelial proliferation and barrier restoration, through direct interaction with the alveolar epithelial cells, thereby providing a lung-protective effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In patients with ARDS, elevated GM-CSF levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) are associated with antiapoptotic effects and improved epithelial barrier integrity and survival [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Studies have shown that GM-CSF can have a dual role as a proinflammatory and regulatory cytokine, depending on the dose and presence of other relevant cytokines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The proinflammatory signal of GM-CSF can induce macrophages to elicit an immune response via a positive feedback mechanism that can ultimately result in tissue damage. Recent studies on COVID-19 patients show that increased levels of GM-CSF contribute to the immunopathology of ARDS [
