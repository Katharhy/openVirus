<p id="Par25">Shen et al. reported the first study of five critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation who received two consecutive convalescent plasma transfusions containing high-titer neutralizing antibodies (NAT of 80–480) in conjunction with continued methylprednisolone and antiviral treatment [

Plasma transfusion was administered 10–22 days after admission. All patients eventually improved clinically: in four patients, ARDS resolved 12 days following transfusion, three patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks, the body temperature of four patients normalized within 3 days, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score decreased, P
 <sub>AO2</sub>/F
 <sub>IO2</sub> increased within 12 days, viral loads decreased and became negative within 12 days after transfusion, and SARS-CoV-2-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and NATs increased. In another pilot study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], 10 adults with severe COVID-19 received a single transfusion of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (NAT of 1:640 or greater) in addition to standard care, all patients received monotherapy or combination antiviral therapy, and six patients also received methylprednisolone. The mean time from onset of illness to transfusion was 16.5 days (interquartile range [IQR] 11.0–19.3). COVID-19 symptoms, such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain improved in all patients within 1–3 days following transfusion. Patients showed variable degrees of improvement on chest CT, where those transfused before 14 days post onset of illness showed better improvement. NAT increased in five patients after the transfusion, but remained the same in four patients. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 RNA were positive in seven patients before transfusion. After transfusion, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was undetectable in three patients on day 2, three patients on day 3, and one patient on day 6. More recently, an FDA-initiated, national, multicenter, open-label EAP study (NCT04338360) in 5000 hospitalized adults who were at high risk of progressing to severe or life-threatening COVID-19, showed that transfusion of ABO-compatible COVID-19 convalescent plasma (200–500 mL) was well-tolerated [

Fewer than 1% of patients manifested major adverse events such as transfusion-associated circulatory overload, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), and severe allergic transfusion reaction, and only two of these events were clinically judged as certainly associated with the transfusion.
