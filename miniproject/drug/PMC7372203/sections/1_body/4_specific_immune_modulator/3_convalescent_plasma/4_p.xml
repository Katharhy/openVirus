<p id="Par26">On the other hand, a Chinese open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma therapy on 103 COVID-19 patients with severe or life-threatening disease found no significant difference in time to clinical improvement within 28 days, mortality, or time to hospital discharge [

However, most patients received convalescent plasma treatment at least 14 days after symptom onset, further suggesting that convalescent plasma therapy should be initiated earlier. Major adverse events were not observed, except for two patients who experienced adverse events within hours following transfusion that were managed with supportive care.
