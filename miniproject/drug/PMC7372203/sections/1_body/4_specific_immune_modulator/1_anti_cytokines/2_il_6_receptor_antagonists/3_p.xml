<p id="Par12">There are multiple clinical trials planned or initiated using tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients in the US, China, and Europe. Interim results from CORIMUNO-TOCI (NCT04331808), an open-label, phase II, randomized clinical trial, showed that a significantly lower number of the patients in the tocilizumab arm achieved the primary outcome of need for ventilation, or death, at day 14. In China, a multicenter, randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in 188 COVID-19 patients is ongoing [

The 94 patients in the experimental arm will receive conventional therapy with tocilizumab, while the remaining 94 patients in the control arm will receive conventional therapy alone. Another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial is taking place at a global level in the US, Canada, UK, and Europe (NCT04320615). The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab in combination with standard of care compared with placebo in approximately 330 patients.
