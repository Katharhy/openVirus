<p id="Par11">A single-arm Chinese investigation by Xu et al. included 21 severe or critical COVID-19 patients and showed that all patients who received tocilizumab demonstrated remarkable fever reduction within days following therapy, and a reduced need for supplemental oxygen was observed in 15 (75%) patients [

Tocilizumab was administered as a single dose of 400 mg by intravenous infusion, with only three (14.2%) patients requiring an additional dose within 12 h of the first dose because of persistent fever. This dosing regimen was in agreement with the National Health Commission and State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which recommends a dose of 400 mg (4–8 mg/kg), and one additional administration after 12 h if ineffective, and a maximum single dose of 800 mg [

Another Chinese retrospective, observational study by Luo et al. included 15 moderately to critically ill COVID-19 patients who received tocilizumab (80–600 mg per dose) in combination with methylprednisolone in 8 of the patients. Five patients received two or more doses of tocilizumab. Elevated CRP levels rapidly decreased in all patients following administration, and a gradual decrease in IL-6 levels was observed in patients who stabilized following tocilizumab administration. Three of the four critically ill patients who received a single dose died, suggesting that a repeated dose of tocilizumab may improve clinical outcomes [

Furthermore, a single-center, retrospective, observational Italian study of 20 renal transplant recipients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia included six patients who received tocilizumab. Three (50%) of the patients experienced reduced oxygen requirements and two (33%) showed improved radiologic findings following administration, whereas two (33%) of the six tocilizumab-treated patients died [

At day 14 after hospital admission, 22.6% (95% CI 16.2–29.0) of the patients who received tocilizumab had the primary outcome, compared with 36.5% (95% CI 30.7–42.2) in those who received standard of care. Similar results were reported regardless of the route of tocilizumab administration.
