<p id="Par13">Another IL-6 receptor antagonist that may potentially combat CRS and pulmonary symptoms in severely ill patients is sarilumab (Kefzara
 <sup>®</sup>), which is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs [

Although there are no known published clinical trials supporting the use of sarilumab in COVID-19 patients, it may have a similar effect to tocilizumab on the inflammatory response in severely ill COVID-19 patients. A US-based, phase II/III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of high- and low-dose intravenous sarilumab in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 is currently under way (NCT04315298). A preliminary analysis of the trial demonstrated that sarilumab was effective in critically ill (i.e. requiring mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygenation, or required treatment in an intensive care unit) COVID-19 patients, but not in severely ill (i.e. did not require mechanical or high-flow oxygenation) patients. Accordingly, the phase III portion of the trial was narrowed to include only critically ill patients [
