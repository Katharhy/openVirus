<p id="Par8">Anakinra is a recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist indicated for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It works by inhibiting the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1α and IL-1β [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This may suggest a role for anakinra in combating CRS symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Re-analysis of data from a phase III randomized controlled trial revealed that IL-1 receptor blockade with anakinra was associated with significant improvement in survival of patients with sepsis [

In a small case-series of nine patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia, the use of anakinra was well-tolerated and effective in improving clinical and biological markers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In a different cohort study on patients with severe COVID-19, anakinra decreased both the need for invasive mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit, and mortality [25% vs. 73%, hazard ratio (HR) 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11–0.41,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The mortality was lower than previous series of patients with sHLH in sepsis, although three patients died. The use of anakinra was associated with less need for vasopressors, significantly improved pulmonary function, and lower HScore.
