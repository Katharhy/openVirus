<p id="Par17">TNFα plays a key role in almost all acute inflammatory reactions by inducing oxidative stress and inflammation. TNFα is mainly produced by macrophages, although it can also be produced by monocytes, B cells, and other tissues. Activating TNFα also results in the production of IL-1 and IL-6 [

It has been reported that the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 induces TNFα-converting enzyme (TACE)-dependent shedding of the ACE2 ectodomain, which facilitates viral entry and causes tissue damage through TNFα production [
