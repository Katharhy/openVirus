<p id="Par15">There are currently no published clinical trials to support the use of ruxolitinib or other JAK inhibitors in COVID-19. Two ongoing phase III randomized clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib plus standard of care, compared with standard-of-care therapy alone, in adult patients with COVID-19-associated cytokine storm (NCT04362137; RUXOCOVID), and in adults with COVID19-associated ARDS who require mechanical ventilation (NCT04377620; RUXCOVID-DEVENT). Additionally, open-label emergency Expanded Access Programs (EAP) for patients diagnosed with severe or very severe COVID-19 illness (NCT04337359) and patients with COVID-19-associated cytokine storm (NCT04355793) are underway.</p>
