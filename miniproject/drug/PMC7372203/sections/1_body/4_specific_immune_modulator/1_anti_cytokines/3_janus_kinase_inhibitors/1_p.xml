<p id="Par14">By inhibiting the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway, JAK inhibitors are hypothesized to play a role in the management of CRS in severely ill COVID-19 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Ruxolitinib (Jakafi
 <sup>®</sup>) is a potent and selective oral inhibitor of both JAK1 and JAK2 protein kinases. It is indicated for intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Ruxolitinib interrupts signaling downstream of multiple proinflammatory cytokines, which constitute the cytokine storm and increased activation of the JAK-STAT pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, one concern about the use of these agents is the blockade of IFNα, a cytokine critical in defense against viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In addition, severe reactions after initiation of ruxolitinib were reported in two COVID-19 patients, and required drug discontinuation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Both patients developed cutaneous reactions with purpuras and a progressive decrease in hematocrit values, and one patient also developed thrombocytopenia and a deep-tissue infection. These adverse events may be due to the concomitant use of ritonavir, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, leading to an increase in ruxolitinib plasma concentrations. Thus, the role and safety of this type of JAK inhibitor in the management of inflammatory cytokine storm caused by COVID-19 is questionable.
