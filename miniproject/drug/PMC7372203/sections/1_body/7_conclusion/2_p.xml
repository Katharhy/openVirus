<p id="Par52">With such novel targeted therapies in the pipeline, more options may become available for the treatment of COVID-19. Recent studies have demonstrated that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine may not be effective in treating COVID-19, and the known and potential benefits of these drugs do not outweigh their known and potential risks. However, low-dose dexamethasone (6 mg once daily, orally or intravenously, for 10 days) has been shown to be effective in reducing deaths by one-third in patients on mechanical ventilation and by one-fifth in patients receiving oxygen only. Future research efforts should focus not only on the most relevant immunomodulatory strategies but also the optimal timing of such immunomodulatory interventions to maximize therapeutic effect.</p>
