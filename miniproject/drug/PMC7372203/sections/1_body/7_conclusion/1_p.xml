<p id="Par51">COVID-19 is increasingly being recognized as a syndrome of viral replication and host inflammatory response. Effective pharmaco-immunomodulating strategies may help alleviate syndrome progression, especially in the more advanced stages of COVID-19. Considering the immune dysfunction and lymphopenia in COVID-19, several immunomodulators are under development or are being repurposed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>]. One plausible target is prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), which is normally upregulated in the airways of the elderly population, and is further augmented by SARS-CoV RNA, which stimulates the promoter of the cyclooxygenase (COX) genes. PGD2 is likely to play an important role in suppressing the host immune response to the virus by acting through the DP2 (CRTH2) receptor. In SARS-CoV-infected mice, PGD2 is reported to increase by two- to fivefold in the airways, and gradually increases with age [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>]. PGD2 signaling through DP2 stimulates group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) to secrete IL-13, which in return activates monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSC) to suppress the adaptive immune system [

 <sup>®</sup>) is a potent, reversible, and selective antagonist of PGD2/DP2 receptors that has been shown to inhibit PGD2-stimulated IL-13 secretion, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 118 nM [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>]. It has a well-established safety profile and has been used orally as a treatment for allergic rhinitis in Japan for the past 20 years. Hence, clinical trials investigating the role of ramatroban as a therapeutic agent in the context of COVID-19 are warranted.
