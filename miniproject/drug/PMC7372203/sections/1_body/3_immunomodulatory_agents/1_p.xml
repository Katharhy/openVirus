<p id="Par7">Once a pathogen enters the body, it is addressed by two lines of defense: innate immunity and adaptive immunity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Innate immunity encompasses a number of soluble and cell-based antimicrobial factors and is triggered very early after infection. Adaptive immunity, which consists of pathogen-specific antibody and T cells, develops later and contributes to both clearing of infection and immunity against subsequent infection. Innate and adaptive immunity work together to detect and eliminate pathogens. Immunomodulatory drugs can stimulate (immunostimulants), suppress (immunosuppressants) or modulate various aspects of the immune system, including both adaptive and innate immune systems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Immunostimulators are often prescribed to enhance the immune response against infectious diseases, however, morbidity and mortality in severe COVID-19 is associated with hyperinflammation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and interfering with cytokine signaling using immunomodulatory strategies may significantly reduce hyperinflammation in these patients. The action of immunomodulators can be specific or non-specific [
