The trial aims to enroll 6000 newly diagnosed patients and will assess the impact of colchicine treatment on rates of hospitalization or death from the syndrome 30 days after enrollment. Patients will receive colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily for the first 3 days and then once daily for the remaining 27 days. Other trials are underway or planned (NCT04350320, NCT04326790, NCT04322565).</p>
