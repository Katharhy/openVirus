<p id="Par48">Colchicine is a potent oral anti-inflammatory medication that is indicated for the treatment of gout, familial Mediterranean fever, and pericarditis (off-label) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">151</xref>]. Colchicine exhibits anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting the polymerization of microtubes, and possibly through effects on cellular adhesion molecules and inflammatory chemokines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">152</xref>]. Additionally, colchicine displays direct anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects by inhibiting the NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and proinflammatory cytokines [

Given the important role of inflammation in severe COVID-19, colchicine may play a role in mitigating the cytokine storm and limiting multiorgan damage. However, a retrospective study of 14,520 patients based on a large healthcare computerized database found no significant difference in the rates of colchicine use between patients with a positive RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 and those with a negative result (0.53% vs. 0.48%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">153</xref>]. This suggests that colchicine may not have a protective role against a SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has also been hypothesized that colchicine may be harmful in COVID-19 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>]. At therapeutic doses, colchicine may decrease the release of surfactants by affecting alveolar type II pneumocytes. At toxic doses, colchicine may further inhibit surfactantÂ secretion, worsen ARDS, and cause multiorgan failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
