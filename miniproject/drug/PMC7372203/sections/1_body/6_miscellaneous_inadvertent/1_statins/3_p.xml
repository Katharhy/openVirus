<p id="Par40">In a multihospital retrospective cohort study of 2746 patients describing the prevalence of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients, Lala et al. reported that statins have a protective effect and were associated with improved survival (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.47–0.69) [

While statins have a firmly established benefit in the context of myocardial injury, clinical trials demonstrating whether statins confer an anti-inflammatory effect or allow for improvement of endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 are warranted. The beneficial effects of statins on COVID-19-related clinical symptoms were also described in a different retrospective multicenter cohort study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>]. The study reported a statistically significant association between statin use and asymptomatic status, defined as having no disease symptoms in the entire study duration while testing positive on PCR (unadjusted odds ratio 2.91, 95% CI 1.27–6.71, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.011). Serious COVID-19 symptoms were observed in 19% (6/31) of patients taking a statin compared with 25% (31/123) in those not taking a statin, although this finding was not statistically significant. Although not statistically significant, six of eight patients (75%) taking an ACE inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and statin concomitantly remained asymptomatic throughout the duration of the study, which may suggest that this combination may have an additive beneficial effect on symptoms and clinical outcomes. Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 who have an appropriate indication for statin use should continue or initiate therapy. However, if a COVID-19 patient does not have a cardiovascular indication for a statin, it might not be reasonable to commence therapy unless it is part of a clinical trial.
