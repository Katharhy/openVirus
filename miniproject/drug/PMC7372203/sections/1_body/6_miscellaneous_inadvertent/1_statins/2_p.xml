<p id="Par39">Infection with SARS-CoV results in increased induction of the myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) gene, which activates the nuclear factor (NF)-kB pathway and induces inflammation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. Consequently, IFN-I is also reduced [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. In mice, inhibition of NF-kB is associated with a reduction in inflammation and lung pathology and increased mouse survival after SARS-CoV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. Overexpression or underexpression of the MyD888 gene can increase the vulnerability to infection and mortality from SARS-like coronaviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>]. While statins do inhibit the MyD88 pathway, they tend to preserve MyD88 levels during hypoxia and under stress, which may confer a protective effect in COVID-19 patients [
