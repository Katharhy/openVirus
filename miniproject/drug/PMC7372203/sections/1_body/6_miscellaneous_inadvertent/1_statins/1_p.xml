<p id="Par38">Besides their role in cardiovascular risk reduction, statins are reported to play a role in protecting the innate immune response to COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]. The Massachusetts General Hospital guide for critically ill patients with COVID-19 advocates for the consideration of using statins, particularly in patients who are admitted to the intensive care unit [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]. Since inflammation plays an important role in more severe manifestations of COVID-19, the anti-inflammatory properties of statins might potentially be useful [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. In experimental studies, statins have been shown to decrease inflammation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>] and blunt the production of proinflammatory cytokines, including CRP and IL-6 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. In addition, statins have direct beneficial effects that lead to decreased pulmonary vascular injury and ultimately decreased lung injury [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. However, these findings were reported in in vitro and animal studies that are generally performed in response to bacterial infections, and these effects have not been validated in humans.
