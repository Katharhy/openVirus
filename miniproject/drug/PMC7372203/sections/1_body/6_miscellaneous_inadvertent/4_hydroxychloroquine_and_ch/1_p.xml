<p id="Par45">It has been postulated that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine exhibit immunomodulatory effects that theoretically may confer an anti-inflammatory response in patients with viral infections [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">140</xref>]. These drugs can reduce cytokine production, especially IL-1 and IL-6, and inhibit toll-like receptor signaling [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">143</xref>]. While adding hydroxychloroquine to the standard of care did not increase virus response, it did accelerate the alleviation of clinical symptoms, conceivably by reducing inflammation and recovery of lymphopenia. Symptomatic patients with elevated CRP and/or lymphopenia are the most likely COVID-19 patients to benefit from hydroxychloroquine. If these findings are confirmed in larger studies, hydroxychloroquine may be indicated to decrease the risk of progressive COVID-19 illness in patients, although this must await properly performed trials. However, as with azithromycin, this agent also prolongs the QT interval, and the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin could produce additive and potentially dangerous QT prolongation [
