<p id="Par46">More recently, an observational study by Geleris et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">145</xref>] analyzed data of 1376 patients who received hydroxychloroquine, 811 (58.9%) received hydroxychloroquine and 565 (41.1%) did not. The primary endpoint was the time from study baseline to intubation or death. The primary endpoint developed in 346 patients (25.1%), and there was no significant association between hydroxychloroquine use and the composite primary endpoint (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.82–1.32). A multicentered, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial by Boulware et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">146</xref>] evaluated the use of hydroxychloroquine as a potential agent for post-exposure prophylaxis in 821 asymptomatic adults with occupational or household exposure, 66% were healthcare workers. The primary outcome was to identify new COVID-19 infections between patients who received hydroxychloroquine or placebo. Within 4 days of exposure, patients were randomized to either a 5-day regimen of hydroxychloroquine or placebo. While there were slightly fewer infections in the hydroxychloroquine arm (11.8% vs. 14.3%), the difference was not statistically significant (95% CI − 7.0 to 2.2;
