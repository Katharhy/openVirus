<p id="Par47">The FDA decided to retract emergency use authorization of these drugs on 15 June 2020. The basis of this decision is that hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine are unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19, above and beyond the serious cardiac adverse events and several newly reported cases of methemoglobinemia associated with the use of these drugs in COVID-19 patients [

Preliminary results from the RECOVERY trial reported that hydroxychloroquine did not provide a significant difference in the primary endpoint of 28-day mortality—25.7% in the hydroxychloroquine arm and 23.5% in the usual-care arm (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.98–1.26,

Similarly, the ORCHID study, which evaluated the safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults, was halted by the NIH due to the lack of evidence of efficacy [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">150</xref>]. The 81 enrolled patients were randomized to receive either high-dose chloroquine (i.e. 600 mg twice daily for 10 days) or low-dose chloroquine (i.e. 450 mg twice daily on day 1 and once daily for 4 days). All patients received azithromycin, and some received oseltamivir. Interim analysis of the study revealed that the high-dose regimen was associated with more cardiac toxic effects (QTc &gt; 500 ms, 18.9% vs. 11.1%) and death (39% vs. 15%), although the high-dose arm included more patients susceptible to cardiac complications. Thus, the high-dose regimen should not be recommended for the treatment of severe COVID-19, particularly in patients also receiving azithromycin and oseltamivir. The study continues to evaluate the low-dose regimen.
