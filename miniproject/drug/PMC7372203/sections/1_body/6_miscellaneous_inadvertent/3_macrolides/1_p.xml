<p id="Par44">Macrolides, such as azithromycin and clarithromycin, are antibiotics with immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>]. It was demonstrated that macrolides downregulate proinflammatory cytokines, although the exact mechanisms of these effects are not fully illuminated. Azithromycin has been used as an adjunctive therapy to provide antibacterial and potential immunomodulatory effects in the treatment of viral respiratory tract infections, including influenza [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>], and other respiratory conditions, such as ARDS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>]. In a retrospective cohort study by Kawamura et al., patients with moderate or severe ARDS who received adjunctive azithromycin manifested a significant improvement in 90-day survival [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>]. In contrast, another retrospective cohort study in critically ill MERS patients indicated that macrolide therapy is not associated with a reduction in 90-day mortality rates or MERS-CoV RNA clearance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>]. Thus, current data are insufficient to draw any firm conclusions about the benefits of adjunctive azithromycin in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, this antibiotic is known to prolong the QT interval and potentially increase the risk of sudden cardiac death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>], which is more of a concern for non-monitored outpatients receiving this therapy in combination with other QT-prolonging therapies.
