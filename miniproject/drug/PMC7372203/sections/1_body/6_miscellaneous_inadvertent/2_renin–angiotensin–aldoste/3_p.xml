<p id="Par43">A large, observational study analyzed the electronic health records of 12,594 patients in New York City who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>], 5894 of these patients tested positive for the virus. A history of hypertension was described in 4357 patients (34.6%), of whom 2573 (59.1%) had a positive test, and 634 (24.6%) COVID-19-positive patients had severe illness. There was no difference in the likelihood of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 between patients treated with an antihypertensive agent, including an ACEi or ARB, and matched untreated patients. There was also no difference in the likelihood of severe COVID-19 disease between patients treated with an antihypertensive agent and untreated patients. In line with these findings, a large Italian population-based caseâ€“control study of 6272 patients with confirmed SAR-CoV-2 infection revealed that there is no evidence that the use an ACEi or ARB affected the risk of COVID-19, severity of the clinical manifestations, or the course of infection [

While the use of an ACEi or ARB was more commonly used in patients with COVID-19 than in controls, this was due to the higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease in these patients. Both of these large studies demonstrated that the use of an ACEi and ARB is not associated with an increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Thus, these agents should not be discontinued, unless the drugs cannot be tolerated due to hemodynamic instability [
