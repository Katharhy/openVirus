<p id="Par42">There is opposing evidence that being placed on an RAAS inhibitor could reduce the severity of lung injury in some viral pneumonias [

Additionally, ACEi and ARB have a secondary effect of increasing ACE2 expression. ACE2 catalyzes the conversion of Ang II to Ang 1â€“7, which binds to the Mas receptor (MasR), leading to vasodilation and anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects [
