<p id="Par3">Although the pathogenesis of COVID-19, the result of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is still not completely understood, a proposed four-stage classification system of escalating phases represents a useful construct for a structured approach to clinical phenotyping, choice of therapy, and clinical outcome [

Patients may or may not manifest non-specific symptoms (i.e. malaise, fever, sore throat, dry cough), and treatment is often symptomatic. Stage II is characterized by hyperresponsiveness of the immune system. Patients develop viral pneumonia and possibly hypoxia, and markers of systemic inflammation are elevated. The third stage is characterized by a hypercoagulable state. Patients with hypoxia are likely to progress to stage IV, the most severe stage, where multiorgan failure occurs. Most patients also develop lymphopenia and pneumonia with bilateral infiltrations on chest computed tomography (CT) scan [

Systemic proinflammatory cytokines and biomarkers such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-7, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, and D-dimer are significantly high in this stage [
