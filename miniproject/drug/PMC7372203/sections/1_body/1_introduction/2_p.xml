<p id="Par4">The presence of elevated proinflammatory cytokines in advanced stages of disease was also observed in prior epidemics, such as those caused by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, suggesting a cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or ‘cytokine storm’-mediated immunopathology [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The cytokine dysregulation and influx of inflammatory myeloid cells can lead to lung infiltration and critical symptoms, including sepsis, shock, respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan system dysfunction, and death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Since lymphopenia is often observed in early and late stages of COVID-19 patients, the CRS may likely be mediated by leukocytes other than T cells [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)-like pulmonary immunopathology characteristic of COVID-19, above and beyond the direct endothelial damage from SARS-CoV-2, may explain the high degree of micro- and macrothrombotic findings in this patient population [
