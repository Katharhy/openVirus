<p>The ongoing Covid‐19 pandemic has already caused at least 4 million confirmed cases and more than 250 000 deaths. In response to this global health emergency, public health measures to control the virus spread have been put in place and efforts to identify potential antiviral molecules and to develop a vaccine have been intensified. The explored antiviral strategies are mainly based on existing drugs that were developed to treat viral infection or other diseases. Moreover, the many different clinical trials currently in progress (more than 2400) are testing a limited set of drugs, alone or in combination.

 </xref> Although the drugs used in these therapeutic assays have shown some inhibitory effect in SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected cells in vitro, the molecular bases of their antiviral activity are often poorly understood, except for nucleoside analogs (eg, favipiravir for influenza virus) and fusion inhibitors (eg, arbidol). In addition, while waiting for the final results of these clinical studies, important concerns have arisen, such as the risk of inappropriate self‐treatment, the potential toxicity or adverse effects of some of these compounds, and the risk of depletion of pharmacy stocks needed for the treatment of other pathologies. On the other hand, the emergence of SARS‐CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) has led to a growing number of publications that describe new CoV inhibitors and precisely characterize their mode of action (MoA). In this review, we summarize promising candidate molecules that could be repurposed and anti‐CoV‐specific drugs derived from ongoing research on CoVs, for which we provide additional information on their potential MoA based on the current knowledge on SARS‐COV‐2 life cycle. In this review, we do not describe vaccine strategies, and supporting treatments, although they are also important for Covid‐19 management.
