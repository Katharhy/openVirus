<p>Coronaviruses belong to the 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic> order, a group of enveloped viruses with genomic RNA of positive polarity. Their 27 to 34 kb genome encodes 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) and 4 structural proteins (spike protein [S], envelope protein [E], membrane protein [M], and nucleoprotein [N]).

 </xref> The virus life cycle, described in Figure 
 <xref rid="rmv2143-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, begins by the attachment of the viral particle to the angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell surface receptor, mediated by the S protein.

 </xref> Virus entry is achieved by endocytosis and/or direct fusion of the cell and viral membranes. This step requires S protein activation. The S protein is synthesized as an inactive precursor that is inserted in the viral membrane, and requires two subsequent cleavages by cellular proteases to become functionally active. Different cellular proteases, such as furin‐like enzymes and the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), may cleave the S protein in two subunits, S1 and S2, in a process called “priming.”

 </xref> The viral genome is then released into the cytoplasm of the infected cells. This allows the translation of the viral mRNA into two polyprotein precursors, pp1a and pp1ab, controlled by a −1 ribosomal frameshift. These polyprotein precursors are then cleaved by two viral proteases, chymotrypsin‐like 3 (3CLpro) and papain‐like (PLpro), to generate the 16 nsps (nsp1 to 16). Many of these proteins participate in the formation of the replication and transcription complex that orchestrates genome replication, mRNA synthesis and capping. At the final stage of viral infection, the N protein assembles with the neo‐synthesized viral genome to form the nucleocapsid that associates with the viral structural proteins to generate new virions released by exocytosis.
