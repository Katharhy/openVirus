<p>A useful therapeutic strategy consists in interfering with the first step of the viral cycle by targeting the interaction of the viral S protein with the cell surface receptors. It was recently demonstrated that sera from patients with Covid‐19 contain neutralizing antibodies (Abs) that can limit SARS‐CoV‐2 viral infection in vitro.

 </xref> Moreover, administration of plasma from convalescent patients has shown some efficacy in patients with respiratory distress, suggesting that passive immunity might help limit SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

 </xref> This strategy seems to limit SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in cell culture, but the stability of the soluble receptor in the serum of infected patients and the potential adverse effects in patients remain to be determined. Notably, it has also been shown that ACE2 therapy protects mice from lung injury that can be observed during SARS‐CoV infection.

 </xref> Interestingly, mAbs against other cellular receptors, such as CD147, also can block viral infection in cell culture, and the direct interaction between CD147 and the S protein has been demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation.

  <sup>36</sup>
 </xref> These first results need be confirmed, but they suggest that SARS‐CoV‐2 could use an alternative entry receptor in some cell types. A clinical trial using an anti‐CD147 antibody (meplazumab) is currently ongoing in China
