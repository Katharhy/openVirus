 <p>We give our deepest thanks to the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) staff in over 150 projects around the world whose dedicated efforts make it possible to provide contraception and/or safe abortion care (SAC), as well as other SRH services, via the models of care discussed in this paper. We would like to thank the MSF Reproductive Health and Sexual Violence Care Working Group for its work and support on this topic. We also give thanks to Patricia Kahn (MSF-USA) for medical editing support and input to the manuscript and to Michelle Bosché (MSF-USA) for editorial assistance.</p>
