<p>While engaging with communities about stigmatised topics like abortion may seem daunting, especially in contexts where abortion is restricted, MSFâ€™s experience in recent years has shown that these conversations can be immensely informative and productive if: (1) they are approached from the perspective of discussing a common goal to reduce maternal death and suffering caused by unwanted pregnancy and unsafe abortion and (2) they are broadly inclusive and framed in a way that helps everyone feel comfortable sharing their experiences and opinions. The extent to which MSF and other health actors are willing to be flexible and truly listen to women and their communities throughout this crisis will ultimately determine health outcomes for the most vulnerable populations.</p>
