<p>In responding to COVID-19, global health actors, including MSF, need to build on this experience and engage further with women and their communities to develop more locally driven and locally tailored responses. For example, existing collaborations with traditional birth attendants, community health workers or womenâ€™s groups could be expanded to facilitate distribution of contraceptives and abortion medications in the community. In settings with mobile services, hotlines and SMS systems could be used to disseminate information, respond to questions and provide remote support regarding contraception and abortion care.</p>
