<p>While the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented in many ways, experience from previous humanitarian emergencies shows that when routine healthcare services are disrupted, the consequences can be catastrophic, especially for women and children who are disproportionately affected by crisis.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> For example, reports from the 2014â€“2015 Ebola epidemic suggest that the shutdown of routine services resulted in more maternal and child mortality and morbidity than the outbreak itself.
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Here we argue that despite this compelling evidence on the indirect but devastating impact of epidemics, the global health community is dangerously close to repeating similar mistakes with regard to an often-neglected aspect of sexual and reproductive health (SRH): access to safe abortion and contraceptive services that reduce numbers of potentially fatal or debilitating pregnancy-related complications.
