<p>Faced with COVID-19, some health systems have adapted abortion services towards more self-managed strategies. For example, the UKâ€™s Department of Health and Social Care has modified its regulations to allow women to obtain abortion drugs via mail after phone or telehealth consultation with either a doctor or a nurse.
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> We applaud these efforts to increase access to abortion services by deinstitutionalising and task-shifting, and we call on the global health community to find similar yet adapted approaches in humanitarian and fragile settings.
