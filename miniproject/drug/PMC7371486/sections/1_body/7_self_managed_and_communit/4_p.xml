<p>At MSF, we have experience with simplifying protocols and moving towards more self-managed models of care in poor and crisis settings. In alignment with WHO guidelines,
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> since 2017, most medication abortions in our projects are provided by midwives or nurses, without routine blood tests or ultrasound. Women typically self-administer the drugs and manage the abortion process at home, returning to the clinic only if they have questions or concerns. Some MSF projects have also started to explore partnerships with local health promoters, peer educators and hotlines to support medication abortion in the community. Preliminary findings are encouraging, with high success and low complication rates that are comparable with global averages, which supports the concept that the only necessary elements for safe and effective medication abortion are accurate information, quality medications and mutual trust.
