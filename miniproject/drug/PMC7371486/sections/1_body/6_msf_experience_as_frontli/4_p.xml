<p>How can this feasibly be done? As an emergency medical organisation, at MSF, we know that effectively responding to crisis often calls for innovation. We cannot continue to provide services the same way we did before. We must adapt and provide care in new ways that meet the evolving needs of our beneficiaries. MSF teams are already modifying protocols for a variety of services to minimise direct contact between patient and provider and to reduce time patients must spend in a healthcare facility. As movement restrictions increase and brick-and-mortar facilities become less accessible, maintaining access to care will require us to shift our focus from standard facility-based approaches to community-based activities, remote support of services and self-care models.</p>
