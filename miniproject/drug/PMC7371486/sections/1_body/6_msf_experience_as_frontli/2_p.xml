<p>Despite this experience, while MSF has always been committed to reducing maternal deaths and alleviating distress, we have not always prioritised contraception and SAC. In recent years, we have therefore invested in overcoming barriers and strengthening these services. As a result, from 2016 to 2018, the number of MSF projects providing SAC increased 400%, and the number of projects providing contraception increased 50%. In 2018, we conducted over 338 500 consultations for contraception and provided over 11 000 safe abortions.
