<p>As a medical humanitarian organisation, MSF witnesses first-hand the death and suffering due to unwanted pregnancy and unsafe abortion. In 2018, our teams around the world treated over 24â€‰400 women with abortion-related complications, including haemorrhage, infection and traumatic injuries, some of which were fatal.
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This experience has shown us the drastic measures women may turn to when they lack access to SAC. We have treated women who resorted to relatively common, less safe methods of abortion, such as taking various ineffective or potentially harmful medications without access to proper information, as well as more desperate, least safe examples, such as drinking poisons made from the phosphorous in match heads, chlorine or battery acid, inserting ink cartridges from pens or metal fishing hooks into the uterus and self-inflicted repeated blunt trauma to the abdomen.
