<p id="p0060">DENV viremia occurs for up to 12 days following the onset of fever, and anti-DENV IgMs begin to appear around 3 days after fever onset. Detection of DENV nucleic acid by RT-PCR is the most sensitive and specific means to confirm acute infection, but it may not necessarily reflect infectious virus as it only detects viral RNA, which may persist in biologic fluids after infectious virus is cleared. Immunoassays to detect DENV NS1 antigen also provide acceptable levels of sensitivity and specificity. Both these diagnostic approaches are instrument-dependent and require appropriate facilities to perform complex diagnostic tests.</p>
