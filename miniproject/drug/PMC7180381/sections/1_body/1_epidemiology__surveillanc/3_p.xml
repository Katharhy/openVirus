<p id="p0020">As an illustration, DENVs were found in the 1960′s in less than 10 endemic countries and only a few thousand cases were reported each year. In contrast, in 2017 the virus had become endemic in 124 countries, causing an estimated 400 million yearly infections and 100 million symptomatic cases
