<p id="p0065">Recently, it was found that Apoprotein H (Apo H) can be efficiently used to detect bacteria and viruses in blood samples. As described by Dr Francisco Veas (French Institute for Dvelopment (IRD), Montpellier, France), beads coated with Apo H can readily capture viruses with a glycoprotein-rich envelope such as influenza virus, Ebola virus, DENV and other arboviruses, or even HCV. The beads are easy to use, the process is very fast and shows high sensitivity: one can readily detect 1 PFU of virus in 5Â mL of whole blood.</p>
