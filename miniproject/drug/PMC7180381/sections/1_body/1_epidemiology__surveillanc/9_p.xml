<p id="p0050">However, as discussed by Dr Elizabeth Hunsperger (CDC, Atlanta, USA), differential diagnosis in the clinical setting may be difficult, especially outside of seasonal disease, as mild and asymptomatic infections are common. As an example, laboratory testing for dengue is important in order to distinguish the disease from other febrile illnesses such as malaria, leptospirosis or influenza, other arbovirus diseases such as Chikungunya, Zika, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis or yellow fever, and even from typhoid/paratyphoid (
