<p id="p0045">Dr Duane Gubler also noted that since arboviral diseases represent a major threat to urban populations, it is necessary to reassess surveillance strategies. Currently, surveillance systems are based on passive reporting of loosely defined clinical syndromes with infrequent laboratory confirmation. He suggested that all at-risk countries should have an enhanced passive disease surveillance system based on well-defined case definitions supported by serological and virological laboratory testing. Three major arbovirus pathologies should be monitored: systemic febrile syndrome, haemorrhagic disease syndrome, and meningo-encephalitis syndrome. An active laboratory-based syndromic surveillance network is also badly needed. Weekly reports by local physicians, as done in Brazil, where they have turned out to be most useful, should also be encouraged.</p>
