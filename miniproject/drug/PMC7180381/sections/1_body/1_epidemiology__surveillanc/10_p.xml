<p id="p0055">Each of theses objectives requires different test characteristics. Standard dengue diagnostics assays include RT-PCR, virus neutralization assays, immunoassays to detect DENV NS1 antigen, and assays to detect anti-DENV IgMs [ref]. The most sensitive and specific assays are RT-PCR and the NS1 ELISA assay. Low-cost point-of-care (POC) rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are currently not adequate for the clinical and vaccination settings, while ELISA, RT-PCR and other strategies with much higher levels of performance are are too slow and costly. The latter tests are needed in public health surveillance and research settings. These diagnostic approaches are instrument-dependent and require appropriate facilities and highly trained technical staff to perform complex diagnostic tests, unfortunately none of which are available in resource-limited areas. Dengue diagnostics will greatly benefit from a Dengue POC test that meets the WHO ASSURED criteria (Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, Rapid, User-friendly and Delivered to those in need) 
 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Note that laboratory diagnosis of dengue can be achieved with a single serum specimen obtained during the febrile phase of the illness by testing for DENV nucleic acid, non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and anti-DENV IgMs. The current POC RDTs detect both anti-DENV IgMs and IgGs as well as the NS1 antigen. This has the potential to change the current situation in resource-limited areas and improve dengue clinical management.
