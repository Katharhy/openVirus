<p id="p0035">As outlined by Dr Duane Gubler, the new and worrisome aspect of emerging arbovirus epidemics is that they can occur in urban centers, as was observed with dengue fever, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever. The urban vectors are 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, primarily 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, which has spread around the world in past centuries, and secondarily 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, whose spread began in the 1980s 
 <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The emergence and spread of dengue, Chikungunya and Zika infections actually reflect the growing geographical spread of 
 <italic>Aedes spp</italic> across all continents.
