<p id="p0040">The fact that arboviral diseases have become a major threat to urban populations is the result of: 1) population growth and urbanization, which results in crowding of humans, inadequate housing, waste management and accumulation of trash, including used automobile tires, plastics, tins, etc, creating ideal ecological conditions for urban 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> populations to thrive; 2) the spread of 
 <italic>Aedes spp</italic> mosquitoes around the world and throughout the tropics and subtropics; 3) the lack of effective vector control and infectious disease prevention; and 4) the globalization of air transport, which facilitates the rapid spread of pathogens and the diseases they cause (more than 3 billion passengers have travelled on air lines in the year 2018)

As these trends will continue, epidemic arboviral diseases will increasingly threaten global, national and local political and economic security and could create a global public health emergency, similar to or even greater than the current SAR-CoV-2 pandemic. One should not forget that over 3.6 billion people live in areas exposed to urban 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes.
