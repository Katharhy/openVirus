<p id="p0085">The first association between ZIKV infection and microcephaly was reported in 2015 in Recife, Brazil where three women infected with ZIKV during their pregnancy delivered babies with microcephaly. It was retrospectively discovered that neurological diseases, including microcephaly, in babies born to ZIKV-infected mothers, had been observed in French Polynesia as early as 2014. As reported by Dr Patricia Brasil (Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio do Janeiro), a prospective cohort study for ZIKV infection in pregnant women and infants was initiated in Rio de Janeiro in early 2016. ZIKV was recovered from the amniotic fluid and placenta of the pregnant women, and also from the cerebral spinal fluid of their babies. Microcephaly was observed in 4%-6% of the newborns, while structural birth defects such as hypertonicity, cardiac defects, ophtalmic abnormalities, elbow abnormality, and seizures were observed in up to 11.9% of the newborns. A follow-up of Brazilian babies born to mothers infected by ZIKV during pregnancy showed that up to 25% had abnormal hearing or other manifestations, and 47% showed signs of abnormal behavior. At 18Â months of age, only 21% of the babies displayed normal neurodevelopment.</p>
