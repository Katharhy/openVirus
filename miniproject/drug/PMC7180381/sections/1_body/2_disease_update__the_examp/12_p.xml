<p id="p0120">Dr Annelies Wilder-Smith (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine) reviewed the EU research program on ZIKV (the ‘ZikaPLAN’), which oversees 25 institutional global partners with plans to set up a sustainable Latin American research preparedness network for emerging diseases. A longitudinal cohort study of 17,000 subjects aged 2–59 is being followed for three years in 14 different locations in Brazil, to further refine the full spectrum and risk factors of congenital Zika syndrome, including neurodevelopment milestones, mental retardation, etc, during the first 4 years of life. Also to be addressed is whether neurological problems associated with ZIKV infection, such as meningoencephalitis or acute Zika myelitis, are the direct consequence of ZIKV infection, or are mediated by immune responses. Novel ZIKV diagnostic tests will also be developed.</p>
