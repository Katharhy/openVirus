<p id="p0105">As discussed by Dr Nikos Vasilakis, the most convincing explanation for the sudden aggressivity of ZIKV lies in the discovery by Yuan et al

The mutation was also found in ZIKV strains from French Polynesia, where numerous cases of microcephaly have been recorded, but not in virus strains from Africa, where microcephaly has never been observed.
