<p id="p0095">To answer the question, a cohort of healthy volunteers in Vila Toninho, Brazil, was followed up from 2015 to 2018, looking for evidence for a possible ADE phenomenom. In spite of the fact that 74% of the cohort had DENV Ab at the start of the study, no significant clinical difference could be observed in ZIKV infections between DENV Ab positive and DENV Ab negative persons. Thus, the epidemiological evidence in Brazil did not support the hypothesis that previous exposure to DENV infection could enhance ZIKV pathogenicity. By contrast, it has been reported that DENV-1 and DENV-2 Ab might be protective against ZIKV infection. Similarly, the presence of YFV Ab has recently been associated with a better prognosis of ZIKV infection in pregnant women.</p>
