 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes in the country were found to be ZIKV positive, but other routes of transmission included blood transfusion and sexual intercourse. ZIKV RNA could readily be detected from plasma, saliva and urine of infected patients. Sexual transmission of ZIKV has been documented to occur up to three weeks after onset of illness in the male partner. Shedding of the viral RNA in semen has been well documented, but only 4% of semen samples that were PCR positive could be shown to contain infectious virus by cell culture.
