<p id="p0110">Dr Marc Lecuit (Pasteur Institute, Paris), addressing the question of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of microcephaly, reminded the audience that, in contrast with CHIKV, which does not cross the placental barrier, ZIKV can readily penetrate and infect placental cells. Inoculation of ZIKV in the brain of mouse embryos triggers an endoplasmic reticulum stress which perturbs the physiological unfolded protein response (UPR) within apical cortical progenitor cells that control neurogenesis. Sustained endoplasmic reticulum stress leads to apoptosis. Thus, it is likely that, in pregnant women, ZIKV crosses the placental barrier, gets to the brain of the fœtus and crosses the blood–brain barrier, then targets apical cortical progenitor cells, which leads to the blockade of UPR and the arrest of neurogenesis, and, as an obvious consequence, to microcephaly. Microcephaly has not been observed in Africa; it appears to be a specific property of the Brasilian ZIKV strain, and is most likely related to the prM mutation identified by Yuan et al
