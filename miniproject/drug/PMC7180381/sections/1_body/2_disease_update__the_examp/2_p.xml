<p id="p0070">Dr Rome Buathong (Bureau of Epidemiology, Dept of Disease Contrtol, Thailand Ministry of Public Health) reminded the audience that until the Brazilian outbreak in 2015–16, ZIKV was a little known arbovirus presenting with a mild dengue-like illness without any major complications 
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. It initially spread from sub-Saharan Africa to Asia without detection. Thus, although the virus was present in Thailand, it was not detected until May 2013, when a Canadian traveler returning from Thailand was diagnosed with the disease. A ZIKV surveillance program was launched in the country (from January 2016 to December 2018) revealing a yearly peak of ZIKV infection during the rainy season, occurring 6–8 weeks after the peak of dengue disease. A total of 1698 confirmed cases of ZIKV infection was recorded in Thailand during this two year period. The age groups most affected were the 11–20 followed by the 21–30 year groups. A total of 121 cases of ZIKV infection was recorded in pregnant women, leading to 4 miscarriages and 4 birth abnormalities, including 3 cases of microcephaly.
