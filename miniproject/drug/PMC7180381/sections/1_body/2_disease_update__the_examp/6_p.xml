<p id="p0090">Dr Mauricio Lacerda Nogueira (Faculty of Medicine, Sao Jose do Rio Preto Brazil) talked of the interplay between various flaviviruses. Given that Brazil is hyperendemic for arboviruses, there was concern that previous heterotypic flavivirus (e.g. dengue) exposure could exacerbate Zika disease pathogenicity. DENV antibodies (Ab) bind to ZIKV. Could they drive greater ZIKV replication through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)? The phenomenom was initially described for DENV, but it has also been found to exist for rabies virus, coxsackievirus B3, coronaviruses, and even HIV.</p>
