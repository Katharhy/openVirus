<p id="p0140">Dr Joao Bosco Siqueira reported that Brazil had suffered from a shortage of yellow fever vaccine. Fortunately, the usual dose of the Brazilian vaccine contains 40,000 pfu of attenuated YFV (strain 17D), when only 5,000 pfu is a sufficient protective dose 
 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. It has therefore, been possible to use fractional doses of vaccine with evidence of protection and relatively no difference in reported adverse events. Faced with the spread of yellow fever throughout the country, the Brazilian Government has updated its vaccination policy and now recommends that the entire population should be vaccinated. As part of this effort, a change in schedule for children was implemented from a single dose at 5 years of age to a 2 dose schedule with the first dose administered at 9 months and a second dose at 4 years. This effort is complicated by inadequate vaccine supply and also false rumors that the vaccine would not be protective. Fake news is unfortunately powerful and, as a result, vaccine refusal has been rising in the population!
