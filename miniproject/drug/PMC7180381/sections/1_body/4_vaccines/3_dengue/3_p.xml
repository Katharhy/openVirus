<p id="p0150">CYD-TDV is a tetravalent live attenuated chimeric vaccine consisting of a 17D YFV genome with the pre-membrane (pre-M) and envelope (E) genes from each of the four antigenically distinct DENV serotypes. The vaccine has undergone large-scale Phase 3 clinical trials in Asia and Latin America 
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, demonstrating increasing efficacy with age and higher efficacy in baseline seropositives. Efficacy was highest at preventing severe dengue and hospitalization, and moderate for overall dengue. It also varied with serotype, being higher (75–84%) for DENV-3 and -4 infection, and lower for DENV-1 and -2. Notably, during the third year of the Asian Phase 3 trial, an increased risk of dengue hospitalization was seen in children aged 2–5 years. Efficacy of the vaccine was only 5% or less in 2–6 years old and 65% in 6–8 years old. The vaccine was licensed in 2015 with an age indication of 9–45 years (up to 60 years of age in some countries). The CYD-TDV vaccine is now licensed in 20 countries, and has been introduced into public immunization programs in endemic areas of the Philippines and Brazil.
