<p id="p0175">Three other DENV vaccines are in less advanced development. They are an inactivated vaccine, a DNA vaccine, and a subunit (the E glycoprotein) vaccine. But the difficulties of developing effective and safe dengue vaccines are multiple, as seen in the CYD-TDV experience, and many issues still remain, including: 1. The vaccine should elicit equal protection against the four DENV serotypes, which has been extremely difficult to achieve, in view of competition between strains and/or ADE of some strains: the question has been raised of whether it really is a must to develop tetravalent vaccines? 2. Whether antibodies are associated with protection or risk (ADE) seems to depend on titer, homotypy versus heterotypy, etc. How can that be understood and controlled? 3. Why does severity of the disease, especially that of the post-vaccination adverse events, vary with age? And 4. What is the feasibility and what will be the cost of a necessary pre-vaccination screening?</p>
