<p id="p0165">Two other dengue vaccine candidates are currently in Phase 3 clinical trials: TDV, developed by the US CDC and manufactured by Takeda, and TV003/005, developed by the US NIH. TDV is a tetravalent live attenuated chimeric vaccine that uses an attenuated DENV-2 backbone with the pre-M and E genes from each of the other three DENV serotypes. The TDV vaccine is undergoing Phase 3 trials in Brazil, Columbia, Nicaragua, Panama, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Preliminary phase 3 data show the vaccine is safe and has good efficacy against DENV-1 and-2, but the results for DENV-3 and -4 are uncertain because there were only a small number of cases of these serotypes
