<p id="p0155">The vaccine showed high efficacy and good safety in seropositive persons in the 9–45 years age group, but a risk of severe dengue was observed in individuals who were naive for DENV infection at the time they were vaccinated. It was hypothesized that CYD-TDV mimics primary infection among individuals with no prior dengue infection (previously dengue-unexposed, seronegatives) and a secondary-like infection among those with prior dengue infection (previously dengue-exposed, seropositives)

This work used anti-NS1 results from month 13 of follow-up that were obtained using an anti-NS1 IgG ELISA developed for this purpose. The data confirmed the substantial benefit of CYD-TDV vaccination in those who are dengue seropositive and aged 9 years or older, reducing symptomatic dengue, hospitalized dengue and severe dengue by ~80%. However, in individuals of any age without evidence of prior dengue infection, the vaccine elicited an increased risk of severe dengue, as announced by Sanofi Pasteur in November 2017. The vaccine should therefore be administered only to dengue seropositive persons, which obviously implies the need for a pre-vaccination screening strategy
