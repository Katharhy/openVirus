<p id="p0185">A large number of Zika vaccine candidates are under development and have entered clinical trials, including: a mRNA vaccine; a DNA vaccine that encodes the ZIKV prM and E genes and is presently entering Phase IIb trials in the USA, Brazil, and several countries in Latin America (Puerto Rico, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Columbia..); a purified inactivated vaccine adjuvanted with alum, which was shown to be immunogenic after two doses by the IM route in a Phase 1 clinical trial; and a chimeric measles virus vaccine that expresses the prM and E genes of ZIKV. As outlined by Dr Anna Durbin (John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health) many hurdles still remain before licensure of a safe and effective ZIKV vaccine can occur. The transmission of ZIKV has declined so much that it will be difficult to perform a Phase 3 efficacy study. In addition, clinical trial efficacy endpoints for a ZIKV vaccine are not well established: one can wonder if a vaccine will not have to fully prevent infection in order to prevent microcephaly, a very high bar for any vaccine indeed!</p>
