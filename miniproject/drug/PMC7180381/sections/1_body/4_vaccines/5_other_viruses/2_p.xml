<p id="p0190">Dr Georges Thiry (SAS Senergues, France) reported the creation of the 'Coalition for Epidemic Preparadness Innovations' (CEPI), which was launched in January 2017 in Oslo, London and Washington with the aim to prevent future epidemics by the development of new vaccines. Three major targets have been selected for the manufacturing and testing of candidate vaccines: MERS-CoV, Lassa Fever virus and Nipah virus. CEPI is responsible for vaccine development from preclinical to Phase 2a trial. Several vaccines are being followed up: a Lassa-VSV vaccine, developed by IAVI; a Lassa-DNA vaccine; a Lassa-measles (MV) vaccine, developed by Themis; a MERS-CoV-MV vaccine, also developed by Themis; and a Nipah glycoprotein subunit vaccine with adjuvant. Most Phase 1 studies have taken place in 2018–19 and Phase 2a trials are expected to follow in 2020–22.</p>
