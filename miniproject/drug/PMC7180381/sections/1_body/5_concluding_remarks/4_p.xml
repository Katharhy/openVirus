<p id="p0205">The dramatic emergence and spread of epidemic arboviral diseases has made it necessary to reassess surveillance strategies. All at-risk countries should have an enhanced passive disease surveillance system based on well-defined case definitions and supported by serological and virological laboratory testing. An active laboratory syndromic surveillance system, such as was developed in the past by WHO for influenza or for poliomyelitis, is badly needed. It is hoped that such a system will be set up rapidly. But we also need more effective mosquito control tools to use in conjunction with vaccines, timely access to clinical serices and appropriate care. Only by using an integrated approach to prevention and control will we be able to successfully reverse the trend of emergent epidemic arboviral diseases.</p>
