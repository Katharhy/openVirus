<p id="p0200">The development of vaccines and vector control tools to prevent arbovirus diseases is actively being pursued 
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, and the possibility of developing a trivalent vaccine against ZIKV, CHIKV and WNV is even being entertained. Many hurdles however, remain before licensure of a safe and effective ZIKV vaccine can occur, as outlined above. Similarly, the difficulties at developing an effective and safe DENV vaccine are multiple, and many questions still arise. What will be the cost of implementing pre-vaccination screening? Whom to vaccinate in places where DENV seropositivity in 9Â years of age turns out to be very low (only 10% in Singapore for example)?
