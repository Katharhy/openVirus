<p id="p0130">As reported by Dr Scott Ritchie (James Cook University, Cairns, Australia), the use of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes has great potential to control the spread of the arboviruses they transmit. 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected male 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes become sterile and, if sterile males are repeatedly introduced in a given area, the resident 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> populations can be suppressed. Alternatively, 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected male and female mosquitoes can be introduced together, which leads to a progressive replacement of the resident 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> population, which could then show a much reduced capacity at transmitting DENV, ZIKV, CHIKV, YFV and possibly other viruses
