<p id="p0125">Dr Louis Lambrechts (Pasteur Institute, Paris) reminded the audience that 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti,</italic> which is distributed throughout the tropical and sub-tropical world on all continents, serves as the major vector to transmit urban arboviruses, including the 4 DENVs, ZIKV, YFV, CHIKV, etc. Whereas most female mosquitoes take only one blood meal a day, 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> females need multiple blood feedings every day, which makes them more efficient at transmitting epidemic disease. The comparison between 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae albopictus</italic> also shows that, although 
 <italic>Ae albopictus</italic> is often more susceptible to infection by DENV than 
 <italic>Ae aegypti</italic>, it appears to be significantly less efficient at transmitting the virus. In addition, factors such as the mosquito genotype, its geographical location, and the strain of arbovirus, influence the transmission dynamics of the disease. For example, ZIKV infection of 
 <italic>Ae aegypti</italic> mosquitoes seems to be influenced by the sequence of the NS1 protein of the virus.
