<p id="p0135">The use of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is recommended by the World Mosquito Program to eliminate dengue. A trial in Australia has demonstrated that, shortly after release of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, over 90% of the mosquitoes population at the site became 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected, and the transmission of DENV was stopped 
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Similar trials are being conducted in Viet Nam, Indonesia and Brazil. The fear that 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection of 
 <italic>Ae aegypti</italic> would lead to its replacement by 
 <italic>Ae albopictus</italic> seems unwarranted so far, but it requires further studies.
