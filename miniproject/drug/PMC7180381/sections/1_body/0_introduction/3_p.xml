<p id="p0010">These epidemics underscore the urgency and need for integrated control and prevention of arboviral diseases, especially those transmitted by

 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Prevention and control strategies currently focused on vector control, including insecticide treatment, environmental management and social mobilization have not been effective in practice. It is widely recognized that no strategy alone can fully address the problem. However, some intervention tools have helped reduce the disease burden. For example, timely access to clinical services and appropriate care can reduce mortality dramatically 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, indoor residual spraying (IRS) and indoor space spraying (ISS) may be effective in reducing mosquito populations and exposure to arboviruses 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In addition, personal protection, clinical diagnosis and management, laboratory-based surveillance and vaccination, can be effective 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Vaccines are available to protect against Japanese encephalitis and yellow fever 
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and the first dengue vaccine, even though limited in its applications, was licensed in 2015
