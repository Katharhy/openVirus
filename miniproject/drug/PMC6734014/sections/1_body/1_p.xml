<p id="p0010">In their work Zhu J 
 <italic>et al</italic> have formalized a model assessing the potential impact of integrase strand-transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-containing regimens in reducing onward HIV transmissions in British Columbia 
 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. By applying two previously described models of HIV transmission 
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, which are based on HIV-RNA viral load and the natural history of HIV infection (early 
 <italic>vs</italic> chronic 
 <italic>vs</italic> late), the authors demonstrated how the use of INSTI-based regimens in naïve patients could potentially reduce the risk of HIV transmission when compared to non INSTI-based regimens in their cohort. In particular, a HIV transmission risk reduction of 25%, according to the model by Fraser C 
 <italic>et al</italic>, has been estimated for gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM) starting an INSTI-based regimen with a viral load ≥ 5log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL irrespectively of HIV stage 
 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Authors concluded that INSTI-based regimens have the potential to avert onward HIV transmission by achieving a fast virologic suppression, in particular among gbMSM with pre-treatment high viral load.
