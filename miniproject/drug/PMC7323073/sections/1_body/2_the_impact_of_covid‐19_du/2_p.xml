<p>Studies have also documented serious consequences for the fetus and newborn. One study reported that multiple pregnant Covid patients required early delivery due to maternal decompensation, leading to complicated neonatal courses and multiple neonatal deaths.

 </xref> Three of the cohort experienced intrauterine fetal demises during the time of clinical decompensation. In addition, there is little data that speaks to the rate and timing of vertical transmission of the virus during pregnancy or delivery.

 </xref> It is well known that some viruses (such as Zika, HIV, cytomegalovirus, and rubella) cross the placenta and cause serious complications for the fetus and neonate.

 </xref> Emerging data suggest that SARS‐CoV‐2 may cross and infect the placenta, increasing concerns about vertical transmission.

 </xref> Zeng et al. followed six newborns of mothers with mild cases of Covid‐19.

 </xref> All were delivered by cesarean in negative‐pressure operating rooms and were isolated from their mothers after birth. While none of the neonates tested positive for Covid‐19 (using the laboratory technique reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), all six had viral antibodies detected serologically, suggesting in utero exposure to the virus, though none of the neonates were symptomatic for Covid‐19. These studies demonstrate the need for larger studies and detailed methodologies to unravel questions about the impact of Covid‐19 during pregnancy.
