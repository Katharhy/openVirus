 <bold>R</bold>esearch studies are needed to develop novel approaches to control this pandemic, and that research must address the needs of pregnant women as a population affected by SARS‐CoV‐2. Significantly, only a few observational case studies and retrospective reviews are available from which to garner information about Covid‐19 among pregnant women. Yet from the data that are available, it is evident that much more research is needed to clarify the impact of viral infection on pregnant women and their fetuses.
