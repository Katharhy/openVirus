<p>Thus, research involving pregnant women during the Covid‐19 pandemic must involve a scientifically and ethically justified methodological design. Meticulous attention is required in defining study outcomes, endpoints, and adverse events, as those variables define risks and benefits to the maternal‐fetal dyad. Clinical trial design must also incorporate the newest data, and real‐time monitoring must be implemented to efficiently identify if the risk‐to‐benefit ratio shifts as a result of new understandings or emerging biomedical interventions. Oversight mechanisms must be not only robust enough to address the specific complexities of research involving pregnant women but also responsive enough to react to new data. For instance, if evidence emerges that women with Covid‐19 in early pregnancy may be at increased risk of pregnancy loss and preterm labor, then clinical trials involving an experimental vaccine using live virus should be halted and reevaluated.

 </xref> Oversight processes should concern both biological outcomes and important psychosocial and ethical issues emerging in conjunction with scientific understanding of the pandemic. Clinical trials involving pregnant women must also entail rigorous human subjects protections to minimize risks to the maternal‐fetal dyad. These include a process of ensuring that regulations hold fast to policies for maternal consent and resist motions toward paternal consent.
