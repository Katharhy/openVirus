<p>The recommendations of the Second Wave are all grounded in the “presumptive inclusion” of pregnant women in development and deployment of vaccines, emphasizing that “pregnant women should have opportunities to enroll in vaccine studies conducted during outbreaks and epidemics whenever the prospect of benefit outweighs the risks to pregnant women, their offspring, or both.”

 </xref> Such opportunities, the group notes, should allow a pregnant woman to join or continue participation in a trial based on her informed consent alone, not requiring the additional consent of her partner or another actor. To support this presumptive inclusion, the guidance also urges vaccine researchers to prioritize preclinical data that will be needed for inclusion of pregnant women in future trials, and research funders to prioritize the development of vaccines that are promising for use during pregnancy over those that are likely contraindicated during pregnancy.
