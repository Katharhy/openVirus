<p>Following the uncoating step, the replicase gene of the viral genome encodes two processed polyproteins (pp) named pp1a and pp1ab (Chan et al., 
 <xref rid="tbed13734-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Then, viral proteinases perform post‐translational modification on the polyproteins yielding proteins that mediate the formation of viral replication complexes. The protease activities of all coronaviruses include both papain‐like proteinase (PLpro) and coronavirus 3C‐like protease which are encoded within the replicase polyproteins and mediate cleavage events. Due to their unrivalled and essential function in processing the viral polyprotein, these enzymes are appropriate targets for SARS‐CoV‐2 drug development.
