<p>3CLprotease (also called the major protease (Mpro) or nsp5 directly mediates the polyprotein processing and maturation of viral non‐structural proteins (nsps), which is the indispensable part of the viral life cycle. Initiation of viral RNA synthesis and switching translation to RNA replication are other functions of this protein. 3CLpro is among the most attractive target for anti‐coronavirus drug development. Based on a recent computational drug repositioning research, five drugs, namely eravacycline, valrubicin, carfilzomib, lopinavir and elbasvir, have speculated to exhibit blocking activities on 3Cl pro of SARS‐CoV‐2 (Wang,
