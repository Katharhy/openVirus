<p>The trimeric S glycoprotein responsible for the coronaviruses crown‐like appearance mediates attachment to the host receptor (Ou et al.,

Despite the over 72% spike protein sequence similarity with SARS‐CoV, a peculiar furin‐like cleavage site at the S1/S2 position in the S protein sequence of the SARS‐CoV‐2 was identified, missing in the other SARS‐like CoVs (Coutard et al., 
 <xref rid="tbed13734-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Following the host cell binding, cell penetration is facilitated by S protein priming using the cellular protease. Considering the S protein cleavage by furin‐like protease in the host cell, blocking S protein attachment or furin‐like cleavage sites are promising targets in drug discovery. Recently, Xia et al introduced a lipopeptide named EK1C4 that effectively block the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in in vitro experiments with IC50 of 36.5 nM (Xia et al., 
 <xref rid="tbed13734-bib-0093" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) by blockage of membrane fusion mediated by S proteins. The presence of three vaccine candidates in clinical phases accentuates the importance of this protein in the process of drug development (Thanh et al.,
