<p>The growth factor receptors of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are autophosphorylated after ligand binding being involved in mediating cell‐to‐cell communication and controlling a vast range of complicated biological processes like cell growth, motility and differentiation (Lemmon &amp; Schlessinger, 
 <xref rid="tbed13734-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). The sequel of ligand binding is conformational changes of RTKs enabling its autophosphorylation and therefore activation of a wide variety of downstream cellular signalling pathways. RTKs also play a critical role in signalling pathways, such as the Ras/mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK), PI3K/Akt and JAK/STAT pathways. The particular RTK blockers, known as AG879 and tyrphostin A9 (A9), are also reported as strong anti‐viral activity against the influenza A virus (Kumar, Liang, Parslow, &amp; Liang, 
 <xref rid="tbed13734-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). It was shown that the approved blockers can impair the infection of major HCV variants in in vitro and in vivo models (Jilg &amp; Chung, 
 <xref rid="tbed13734-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). The tyrosine kinase inhibitor such as genistein can also block the replication of arenavirus, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV‐1) and HIV‐1 (Vela, Bowick, Herzog, &amp; Aronson, 
 <xref rid="tbed13734-bib-0084" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Dong et al introduced an RTK inhibitor named (A9) as a competent blocker of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection belong to 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> genera as a successor model for CoV in cell‐based assays (Dong et al., 
 <xref rid="tbed13734-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). The inhibitors of RTK suppress the viral replication through different mechanisms like interferon signalling, Raf/MEK/Erk pathway and the p38 signalling pathway. These achievements represent the RTKs as a probable host‐centred approach to treat the SARS‐CoV‐2.
