<p>Remdesivir, (adenosine analogue) as a potent phosphoramidate prodrug, is effective against filoviruses, pneumoviruses and paramyxoviruses with two suggested mechanisms of action (Lo et al., 
 <xref rid="tbed13734-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). One is being as nucleoside analogue and the second is acting on viral RdRp. Accordingly, Peters et al evaluated the efficiency of some nucleoside analogues suggesting that compound 2 with EC50 &lt; 10 μM was promising against HCoV‐NL63 (Peters et al., 
 <xref rid="tbed13734-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). The combinations of nucleotide analogues can mitigate the resistance mediated by mutations in the viral RdRp, perhaps by additive or synergistic interactions effect (Pruijssers &amp; Denison, 
 <xref rid="tbed13734-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Despite the proofreading activity, identifying nucleoside analogue inhibitors hold promise for the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2.
