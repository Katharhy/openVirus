<p>Nucleoside analogues (dNTPs or rNTPs without 3′‐OH group resulting in chain termination) are extensively applied for the hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), HIV‐1 and HSV therapy. Compared to the other RNA viruses, the proofreading activity of RdRp by the capability of 3′ to 5′ exoribonuclease (nsp14) leads up to 20‐fold enhancement in the accuracy of replication. Thus, the enzyme of coronavirus is rather resistant to many nucleoside analogues including favipiravir (guanine analogue), ribavirin (guanosine analogue) and 5‐fluorouracil (pyrimidine analogue) (Harrison,
