<p>After cell entry, remdesivir is metabolized into nucleoside triphosphate analogue via competing for ATP. Its incorporation by RdRp inhibits viral replication through pre‐mature termination of RNA synthesis. Importantly, remdesivir inhibits the viral replication in RNA viruses including positive and negative senses like NiV, EBOV, SARS, MERS, HCoV‐OC43, HCoV‐229E and SARS‐CoV‐2 in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Although delayed chain termination is a possible mechanism of remdesivir against EBOV with negative senses RNA, the action mechanism remains to be fully explicated (Gordon, Tchesnokov, Feng, Porter, &amp; Götte,

 <sup>4</sup>‐hydroxycytidine, with broad‐spectrum anti‐viral activity against SARS‐CoV‐2 and other coronaviruses with mutations in RdRp conferring increased resistance to remdesivir, indicating the risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 becoming clinically drug resistant (Sheahan et al.,
