<p>A 1,2,4‐triazole derivative, SSYA10‐001, has shown an inhibitory effect on both helicases of SARS‐ and MERS‐CoVs with 25 and 7 μM of the EC50 values, respectively (Adedeji et al., 
 <xref rid="tbed13734-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). In another research, Yu et al concluded that myricetin and scutellarein can suppress the helicase of SARS‐CoV (Yu et al., 
 <xref rid="tbed13734-bib-0098" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). The potent inhibition of SARS coronavirus replication and the helicase activity with EC50 of less than 10 μM is also reported by the Adamantane‐derived Bananins (Tanner et al.,
