<p>The potential molecular targets in anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 drug discovery are surveyed in this paper that can be employed in HTS programmes for systematic drug discovery for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Negligible knowledge is still available on the biology of SARS‐CoV‐2 specially, viral protein synthesis and assembly and most of what we know have been for the last 7 months. Due to the high virus transmission and the global spread of coronavirus, the foremost controversial issue is the mitigation of its pathogenicity using the existing anti‐viral compounds. Therefore, in silico or practical screening of molecular targets is being conducted on structural information obtained from all major variants of the virus. Although the ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the potential treatments of more than 31 drugs, there are currently no specifically certified drugs or vaccines for SARS‐CoV‐2.and the single drug in the frontline may/may not potentially be recognized effective after the completion of the clinical trials. In addition to the above approach, the detailed study of the viral life cycle can lead to assigning some even more effective drug targets. In this direction, some drug targets based on bioinformatics analysis and relative similarities of this new virus with other members of its family like host cell receptors, spike glycoproteins, papain‐like and 3C‐like protease, RdRp have been documented so far. However, an approximately half of the potent drug candidates and nearly one‐third of the drugs registered on the
