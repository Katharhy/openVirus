<p>There are three lines of drug discovery approach to develop the novel drug for SARS‐CoV‐2. These three approaches lead to the potential treatment options including the drug repurposing, screening molecular databases using drug design tools and screening the compound libraries in anti‐viral assays. By the time demanded to randomly screen the natural or chemical compound libraries, the third option is not compatible with the rapid rate of SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission in the community. Therefore, drug repurposing and computational docking analysis are the two main current approaches to find potential agents for SARS‐CoV‐2 therapy.</p>
