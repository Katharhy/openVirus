<p>Structurally, the ~30,000 nucleotide viral genomes also express four basic structural proteins of nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelope (E) and spike (S), encoding from the 3′ end of the viral genome (Figure 
 <xref rid="tbed13734-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The spike is a ~150 kDa homotrimer glycoprotein conferring crown‐like shape on the outer surface. The attachment of SARS‐CoV‐2 via the interplay of its S protein with the receptor on the host cell and angiotensin‐converting enzyme is the primary stage in its life cycle which is followed by proteolytic cleavage of S protein into 2 subunits namely S1 and S2 and virus enters the cytosol (S1 mediates attachment and S2 mediates virus fusion). N protein is structurally bound to the genome of the virus and is necessary for viral RNA transcription and replication. The other critical structural protein is M protein that is involved in shaping the viral envelope. By binding to the other proteins, this protein helps to stabilize N proteins and promotes the ending of viral assembly. Finally, the E protein plays a role in the production and maturation of SARS‐CoV‐2.
