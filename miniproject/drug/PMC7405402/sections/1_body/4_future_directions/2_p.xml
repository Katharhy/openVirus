<p>As we proceed with the current molecular docking studies and presuming the effectiveness of the existing anti‐viral compounds, the de novo drug discovery will join to evaluate the modulation of the new molecular targets of SARS‐CoV‐2 in bioassay platforms which were discussed above. To accelerate the long, costly and rigorous process of drug discovery, high‐throughput methods and high‐content screening methods can be employed. However, by the immediate global need for drugs to control the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection drug search is currently pursued by the repurposing approach. Accordingly, the critical viral life cycle steps like entry, genome and protein synthesis reflect the multiple drug target groups not limited to 3cl pro and RdRp that can be addressed by the conventional de novo strategy of drug discovery. Assembly and release inhibitors are less considered steps in SARS‐CoV‐2 life cycle for its drug discovery. While most of the drug cases for SARS‐CoV‐2 are registered for the control purpose rather than prophylaxis; S protein, integrins and ACE2 targets are of value for drug repurposing or discovery programmes to hinder the viral entry and fusion process. Considering the fact that the primary goal of all viruses is to deliver and replicate their genome to the competent host cells, blocking angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), cathepsin L, 3Cl protease and RdRp are suggested to be promising targets for anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 drug discovery.</p>
