<p>Resolution of inflammation, in a simplified way, is defined as the period between the peak of granulocyte accumulation in the tissue and the complete clearance of recruited inflammatory cells (Sugimoto, Vago, Perretti, &amp; Teixeira, 
 <xref rid="bph15164-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) (see Figure 
 <xref rid="bph15164-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Fundamentally, resolution of inflammation will contribute to the reversal of the accumulation of granulocytes in the inflammatory site and reprogramme the cellular and molecular response within the tissue, leading to tissue regeneration and repair. However, tissues tend not to return completely to their pre‐inflamed state, in terms of cellular composition and phenotype, as previously thought, but to a state of “adapted homoeostasis,” which modifies the severity of subsequent inflammatory responses (Feehan &amp; Gilroy, 
 <xref rid="bph15164-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Resolution of inflammation is mediated by the endogenous mediators of resolution. These are molecules with very diverse chemical structures that by acting on their corresponding receptors induce a cascade of events (pathways) that lead to the resolution of inflammation and the adapted homoeostasis of tissues (Sugimoto et al.,
