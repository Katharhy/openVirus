<p>A relatively few studies have examined the effects of the administration of mediators of pro‐resolution or their genetic absence, in the context of bacterial infection in the lung. For example, administration of the

There were also decreased levels of cytokines in the airways, but bacterial burden was not reduced (Tavares et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15164-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Noteworthy, the combined administration of rolipram and the antibiotic,

The effects of rolipram appeared to be due to the increase in local levels of ANXA1 (Tavares et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15164-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). This is in agreement with our studies suggesting that ANXA1 mediated the pro‐resolution properties of

 <xref rid="bph15164-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Interestingly, AnxA1 and Fpr2 KO mice were highly susceptible to pneumococcal pneumonia, displaying uncontrolled inflammation, increased bacterial dissemination, loss of lung barrier integrity, and pulmonary dysfunction. Moreover, treatment with the ANXA1 peptidomimetic,

 <xref rid="bph15164-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Similarly, the absence of

 <xref rid="bph15164-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Early treatment with the aspirin‐induced resolvin,

 </styled-content> in vivo. This was associated with enhanced phagocytosis of bacterial particles and accelerated neutrophil clearance during pneumonia in vivo (Abdulnour et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15164-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Therefore, it seems that treatment with pro‐resolution molecules or strategies that promote their increase (such as cAMP elevating agents) tend to decrease inflammation and lung injury and facilitate microbial control following bacterial infection. It remains to be determined whether this is valid for all pro‐resolution molecules, their comparative efficacies, and whether there is synergy when more than one agent is used.
