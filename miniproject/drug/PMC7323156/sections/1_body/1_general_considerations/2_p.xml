<p>Inflammation is generally accepted as a protective response in the context of infectious diseases (Tavares, Teixeira, &amp; Garcia, 
 <xref rid="bph15164-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Indeed, inflammatory responses are necessary to contain microorganisms and to provide the adequate co‐stimulatory stimuli to adaptive immune responses. Clear examples of these roles are seen in neutropenic individuals who usually die of disseminated bacterial infections (Gustinetti &amp; Mikulska, 
 <xref rid="bph15164-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Individuals unable to mount an adequate inflammatory response, such as elderly individuals and those undergoing cancer treatment, frequently fail to respond to vaccines. However, it is also clear that an altered(decreased, misplaced, excessive, systemic, or modified) inflammatory response can contribute to disease in infected individuals (Tavares et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15164-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Thus, absent or decreased inflammatory responses may lead to microbial spread and death. Bacterial sepsis is a good example of a syndrome where misplaced (systemic rather than at the site of infection), excessive (large amounts of mediators in the circulation), and altered (mediators found in severe disease may be different from those found in less severely affected patients) inflammatory responses occur. We have argued previously that taming this altered inflammatory response may be beneficial in individuals with severe infections (Costa, Fagundes, Souza, &amp; Teixeira, 
 <xref rid="bph15164-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Garcia, Guabiraba, Soriani, &amp; Teixeira, 
 <xref rid="bph15164-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). In this review, we will argue for the potential of utilizing the pathways and mediators of resolution of inflammation, as a means of providing adjunct treatment (to antimicrobial drugs) for severe infectious diseases.
