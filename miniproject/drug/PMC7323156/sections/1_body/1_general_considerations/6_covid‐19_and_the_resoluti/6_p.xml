<p>An excessive coagulation response, which is also observed in patients with sepsis, shown by enhanced clot formation and suppression or consumption of fibrinolytic factors is an important characteristic of COVID‐19 patients (Moore et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15164-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). In this regard, we have shown that plasmin, a fibrinolytic protein, can promote resolution of inflammation (Sugimoto et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15164-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). SARS‐CoV‐2 induces the macrophage activation syndrome that can be targeted by the cell reprogramming actions of

 <xref rid="bph15164-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Indeed, patients with severe COVID‐19, treated with inhalation of atomized, freeze‐dried plasminogen demonstrated improved lung lesions and hypoxia (Wu et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15164-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). During physiological coagulation, there is up‐regulation of a group of lipid mediators of resolution that enhanced leukocyte antimicrobial responses (Norris, Libreros, Chiang, &amp; Serhan, 
 <xref rid="bph15164-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Administration of one of these mediators, the resolvin, RvD4, attenuated the severity of pathological thrombosis (Cherpokova et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15164-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Therefore, by exploring the properties of pro‐resolution mediators, such as plasmin, we may in the future provide better control of several crucial features of COVID‐19, such as the hyperinflammatory response, coagulation and tissue damage.
