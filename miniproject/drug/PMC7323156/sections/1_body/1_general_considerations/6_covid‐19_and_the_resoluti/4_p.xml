<p>Three molecules with demonstrated pro‐resolving activity may be especially useful in the context of COVID‐19—ANXA1, angiotensin‐(1–7), and plasmin – and these are now discussed in greater detail. For the first, expression of the 
 <italic>AnxA1</italic> gene was increased in mice recovering from pneumococcal infection (Tavares et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15164-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) and administration of the ANXA1 peptidomimetic improved severe pneumococcal pneumonia (Machado et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15164-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) and severe influenza. Together with data showing increased expression in recovered COVID‐19 patients, these data suggest that restoration of ANXA1 levels may be useful to treat severe COVID‐19 patients.
