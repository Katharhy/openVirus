<p>Since the end of 2019, the world has been swept by the pandemic caused by SARS‐CoV‐2, a new coronavirus first detected in China. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection causes a disease named COVID‐19, whose major clinical presentation is pulmonary inflammation and injury. As with most viral infections, the disease is characterized by an initial phase with significant viral replication that is followed by an inflammatory phase. In contrast to many other viral infections of the lung, COVID‐19 is characterized by significant systemic inflammation (cytokine storm) and damage to organs other than the lung, including the heart and kidney. There is also a significant coagulopathy (Moore et al.,

While targeting the virus directly is the rational approach during the first stage of COVID‐19, regulating the host response during the phase of over‐exuberant inflammation and excessive coagulation may offer new therapeutic opportunities. Because of their known protective roles in the context of other pulmonary infections, we argue that harnessing pro‐resolution‐based therapies may provide unique new treatment strategies in the context of COVID‐19.
