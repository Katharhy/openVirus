<p>As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="bph15164-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, there are many demonstrated effects of mediators of pro‐resolution that may be useful in the context of COVID‐19, including the decrease of neutrophil recruitment and activation, enhancement of pathogen clearance and prevention of excessive coagulation. Patients who recovered from disease had up‐regulation of ANXA1 in peripheral blood monocytes (Wen et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15164-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), suggesting a counter‐regulation of the inflammatory response in those patients who survived and could be considered as “well‐responders”. Although these data remain to be validated in bigger cohorts by measuring the ANXA1 levels in those patients, these initial data suggest that decreased expression of ANXA1 and, potentially, of other pro‐resolution molecules, may have contributed to worse outcomes in patients with severe COVID‐19.
