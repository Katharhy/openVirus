<p>The development of drugs targeting viral replication and entry is the rational therapy for the early stages of COVID‐19disease but may not be as useful at the advanced stages of the infection. Recently, the term resolution pharmacology (Perretti et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15164-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) was proposed to describe therapeutic strategies that explore the activation of endogenous pathways of resolution, through novel resolution‐based therapeutic agents. Pharmacological induction of resolution of inflammation, rather than anti‐inflammation therapies, do not cause immunosuppression and are a promising tool to treat the consequences of infectious diseases (Figure 
 <xref rid="bph15164-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), at least, as adjunct therapy. As discussed here, several pro‐resolution molecules exhibit a marked capacity to clear viral or bacterial infections and cellular debris, adding to their anti‐inflammatory and pro‐resolution abilities. The future of this expanding field shows great promise and requires further validation to prove the concept that pro‐resolution‐based therapies are a more effective approach than anti‐inflammatory therapies, to treat over‐exuberant inflammation arising from infectious diseases, including COVID‐19.
