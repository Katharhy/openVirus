  <title>A balanced immune system is one that is both efficient against pathogens and safe to the host.</title>
  <p>An underactive or weakened immune system increases susceptibility to infectious diseases with the human body unable to fend off pathogenic microorganisms. An overactive or hyperresponsive immune system may react to normally harmless substances in the environment, such as with allergies. Even worse, an overactive immune system may recognise host tissue as foreign and begin to attack the body, such is the case with MS. Whereas exposure to too many pathogens may overwhelm the human body, accumulation and maintenance of a sufficiently diverse microbiota throughout life ensures that the immune system is ‘trained’ to respond appropriately, able to tolerate self- and non-harmful antigens. IBD, inflammatory bowel disease; MS, multiple sclerosis.</p>
