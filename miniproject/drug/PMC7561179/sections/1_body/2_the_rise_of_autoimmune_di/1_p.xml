<p>Whilst there are clearly perceived benefits in using antimicrobial surfaces, questions remain about whether reducing exposure to certain microbes may be detrimental to the development and proper function of the human immune system. Over the last century, the rates of immune-related diseases have risen sharply in developed countries [

Interestingly, the trends in developed countries have been mirrored by a simultaneous decline in the prevalence of some infectious diseases, such as hepatitis A, measles, mumps, and tuberculosis. The ‘hygiene hypothesis’, first proposed in 1989, provided a tentative explanation for the shift from infectious diseases to allergies [

The idea of being ‘too clean’ was quickly accepted by many and considered to be the underlying cause for the rise in both allergies and immune-mediated diseases. Despite this theory remaining popular with some, subsequent studies have cast a shadow over the original hypothesis.
