<p>The discovery and improved understanding of T cell subpopulations, such as regulatory T (T
 <sub>reg</sub>) cells, in addition to a better knowledge of other immune system components, have led to a greater insight into how the immune system is regulated and how it ‘learns’ to respond appropriately to pathogenic and nonpathogenic microbes and self-antigens [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008880.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The ‘old friends’ and the ‘disappearing microbes’ hypotheses have superseded the hygiene hypothesis as an explanation for the apparent rise in immune disorders [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008880.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Although providing different perspectives, both theories describe how the human immune system has coevolved with microorganisms, regardless of whether they are commensal, symbiotic, or pathogenic. Loss of these organisms, rather than levels of hygiene, is thought to result in immune system dysfunction, leading to a range of human conditions including immune-mediated diseases, allergy, and even forms of cancer.
