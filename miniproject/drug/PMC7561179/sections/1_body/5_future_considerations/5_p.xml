<p>In conclusion, the authors call upon industry, national and international policy makers, healthcare professionals, and healthcare agencies (including those responsible for commissioning services and estates management) to recognise that (1) early phase research must address the potential impact of antimicrobial surfaces on AMR before they are widely employed; (2) there is a need for stewardship of antimicrobial surfaces intended for the healthcare setting; and (3) the broader exploitation of antimicrobial surfaces in domestic, industrial, commercial, and transport settings must not be undertaken lightly and requires oversight. With strict regulation and sensible governance, antimicrobial surfaces should become an important and long-lasting addition to the public health armamentarium currently available to control the transmission of infection.</p>
