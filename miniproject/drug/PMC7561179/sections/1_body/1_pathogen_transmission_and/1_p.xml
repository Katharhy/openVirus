<p>Whilst direct person-to-person contact is clearly important in pathogen transmission, the spread of pathogens via contaminated surfaces is also significant [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008880.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Touch surfaces may permit the survival and multiplication of bacterial pathogens and the transmission of both bacterial and viral pathogens between hosts [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008880.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Whilst thorough cleaning can help reduce the pathogen load on surfaces, cleaning protocols often fail to completely decontaminate surfaces [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008880.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1008880.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. One study done across 27 intensive care units using a fluorescent tracer found that a basic cleaning protocol resulted in disinfection of only 48.1% of all surfaces, with common touch surfaces, such as room doorknobs (25%) and bathroom light switches (26%), even less clean [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008880.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thus, even after cleaning, there remains a risk of transmission particularly for pathogens with a low infective dose. Tables 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008880.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008880.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref> show survival times of pathogens on various surfaces [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008880.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is worth noting here that pathogen detectability does not necessarily equate to infection risk since there is likely to be a gradual decline in pathogen numbers over time on most surfaces, and the numbers ‘detectable’ at these time points may not constitute an infective dose. These data could be significant for some pathogens; however, if we consider that, for example, London is served by 6 international airports, and pre-crisis, handled a total of 485,000 passengers daily [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008880.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The majority of these passengers will go on to interact, directly or through contaminated surfaces, with some of the capital’s commuters who together complete 10.9 million journeys daily [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008880.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Whilst reducing the frequency of direct interaction between people is a strategy being employed in the current pandemic, the use of antimicrobial surfaces is also likely to impact transmission rates by reducing these indirect interactions.
