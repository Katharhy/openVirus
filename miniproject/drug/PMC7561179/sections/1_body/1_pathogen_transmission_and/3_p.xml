<p>In a similar manner to solar cells, semiconducting nanocomposites can use light-driven reactions to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, due to the material band gaps, many antimicrobial semiconducting nanocomposites require UV light or high-intensity white light to reach the excited state needed to produce the ROS required for antimicrobial properties. Recently, a polymer containing crystal violet dye and gold nanoclusters was shown to produce ROS at low flux levels of white light [

Through the production of hydrogen peroxide, the surface was bactericidal for both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (approximately 5-log reduction in bacterial numbers). Although still under investigation, as hydrogen peroxide is known to be highly effective against both viruses and fungi, this surface is expected to show efficacy against all the major classes of pathogen. Whilst the use of gold and a vivid dye may limit the commercial applications of this product, dye-sensitised nanocomposites offer promise as a persistent antimicrobial surface.
