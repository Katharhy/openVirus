<p>There are two broadly different, but not mutually exclusive, strategies used in developing antimicrobial surfaces: biocidal surfaces that kill microbes, and anti-biofouling surfaces that reduce microbial adhesion and prevent subsequent biofilm formation (

Many commercial antimicrobial surfaces are nanocomposites (bulk materials that incorporate nanomaterials), such as polymers that incorporate silver nanoparticles to confer antimicrobial properties. These nanocomposites are currently being marketed as capable of killing both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, as well as inhibiting the H1N1 influenza (swine flu) virus [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008880.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, silver is an expensive raw material, and the antimicrobial properties of these nanocomposites are largely due to the release of silver ions, meaning that the antimicrobial activity is finite. More recently, nanocomposites are being produced that use the catalytic properties of nanomaterials to drive chemical reactions that produce antimicrobial reagents and are therefore, in theory, self-regenerating [
