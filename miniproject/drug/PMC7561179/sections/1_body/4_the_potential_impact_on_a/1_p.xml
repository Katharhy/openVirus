<p>In addition to a potential impact of antimicrobial surfaces on immune function and microbiome development, another consideration is the risk that selection pressure exerted by antimicrobial surfaces may drive the evolution and spread of AMR. AMR can be intrinsic (for example, in biofilm formed on a surface), or it can be acquired by two principal genetic mechanisms: random mutation or horizontal gene transfer that confer resistance by reducing either the intracellular concentration of the antimicrobial agent, alteration or protection of the molecular target of the antimicrobial or enzymatic inactivation of the antimicrobial agent. Irrespective of mechanism, the end result is that in the sustained presence of an antimicrobial, the resistant subpopulation outcompetes the susceptible population and thus predominates. With regard to antimicrobial surfaces, the risk is not simply that resistance might develop to the specific antimicrobial present in the material but that cross-resistance or co-resistance could occur. Cross-resistance is where one molecular mechanism mediates resistance to more than one antimicrobialâ€”that is, a resistance mechanism induced by the presence of an antimicrobial surface coincidentally imparts resistance to another antimicrobial agent. Co-resistance is a second phenomenon in which the genetic determinants of different resistance mechanisms reside on the same genetic element, thus the selective pressure conferred by the presence of one antimicrobial co-selects for the other. If a determinant for copper resistance, for example, was carried on a plasmid carrying multiple resistance genes specific for different classes of drug, a copper-containing antimicrobial surface has potential to drive the plasmid (and hence multidrug resistance) through a population. A recent article by Pietsch and colleagues [
