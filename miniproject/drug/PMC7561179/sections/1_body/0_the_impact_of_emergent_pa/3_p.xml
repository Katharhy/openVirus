<p>It is widely accepted that new or repurposed antivirals are needed to treat COVID-19 disease and that a safe and effective vaccine is essential for mitigating disease severity and controlling the spread of infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008880.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, both these processes are lengthy and complex and can require years of research to ensure quality, safety, and efficacy. In stark contrast, antimicrobial surfaces are already available and offer a nonspecific and therefore broad spectrum intervention targeting all pathogens, irrespective of type, through multiple pathways [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008880.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For these reasons, antimicrobial surfaces may contribute to outbreak control, whilst other interventions, including social distancing measures, pathogen-specific drugs, and vaccines, are established. As most of the world prepares to move out of COVID-19 lockdown, the deployment of antimicrobial surfaces as a precautionary public health measure against future outbreaks is attractive and warrants serious consideration. However, we will argue in this article that indiscriminate use of such surfaces is not without risk and potentially counterproductive. To ensure that antimicrobial surfaces are purely advantageous, we argue that they must undergo a thorough investigation of their potential to induce AMR, that the application of antimicrobial surfaces in the home should be carefully considered, and that a system of ‘stewardship’ is a prerequisite for application in healthcare.
