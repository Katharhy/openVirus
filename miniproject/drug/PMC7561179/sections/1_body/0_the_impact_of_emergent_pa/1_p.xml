<p>Since the 1970s, more than 1,500 new pathogens have been discovered, and many of these have had major impacts on public health [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008880.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) account for 37,000 deaths in Europe and 99,000 deaths in the United States of America annually and are associated with a financial loss of €7 billion in the EU and US$ 6.5 billion in the US [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008880.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Many of these deaths are attributed to multiple drug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, which evolved due to the overuse of antimicrobial drugs. Consequently, MDR pathogens are now considered a global threat to public health [
