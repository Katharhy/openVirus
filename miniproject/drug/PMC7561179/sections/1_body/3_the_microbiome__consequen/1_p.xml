<p>The human microbiome, which comprises all of the bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa that live on and within the human body, plays an important role in human health, starting prior to birth and continuing throughout life. Beginning in utero, humans accumulate microbiota as they interact with the world around them, developing an immune system that takes cues from each encounter [

 <sub>reg</sub> cells suppress the induction of other immune cells, ensuring tolerance to self-, food-, and microbial-antigens, preventing the development of autoimmunity, allergies, and immune-mediated diseases [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008880.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Lack of exposure to a diverse set of microbes can result in a naïve underdeveloped immune system [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008880.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Radical changes in hygiene, sanitation, diet, and habitat over the last century are thought to be responsible for impaired immune development. The use of antibiotics, despite their critical role in the fight against pathogenic bacteria, is known to result in long-term disruption to the microbiome [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008880.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Consequently, this reduction in microbiota diversity, especially early on in life, has been linked to a rapid rise in allergies and immune-mediated diseases [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008880.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Studies have demonstrated that both the gut and oral microbiomes of individuals are strongly influenced by cohabitation with genetic ancestry playing no identifiable role [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008880.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The way we live and how we manage our environment through the indiscriminate use of antimicrobial surfaces and reagents could directly impact on our microbiome composition and immune development and inadvertently result in an elevation in the incidence of immune-mediated diseases [
