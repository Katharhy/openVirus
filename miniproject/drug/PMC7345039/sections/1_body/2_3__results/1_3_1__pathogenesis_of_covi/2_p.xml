<p>A recent study showed that CoVID-19 is able to utilize the same membrane-bound ACE2 as an entry receptor in ACE2-expressing cells with higher affinity than SARS-CoV and does not use other coronavirus receptors [

ACE2 is highly expressed in the mouth and tongue, facilitating viral entry in the host, and in lungs it is expressed in lower lungs on type I and II alveolar epithelial cells. After infection, SARS-CoV-2 entry starts with the binding of the spike glycoprotein expressed on the viral envelope to ACE2 on the alveolar surface. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 stimulates the clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the whole SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 complex, inducing fusion at the cell membrane [

As the infection progresses, it deleteriously affects the normal activity of most of the ciliated cells in the alveoli that clear the airways, with a consequent progressive accumulation of debris and fluids in the lungs and eventually leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In addition to the alveolar cells in the lungs, ACE2 expression has been reported in other organs, including the kidney, the heart, and the gut [
