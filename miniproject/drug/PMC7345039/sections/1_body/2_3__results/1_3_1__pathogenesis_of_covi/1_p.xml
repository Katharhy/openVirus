<p>CoVs normally cause enteric diseases in several animal species and affect the respiratory tract of mammals, including humans, and lead to mild-to-severe respiratory tract infections [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Studies report five major protein regions for HCoVs, such as replicase complex, spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins, that function in viral structure assembly and replications [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) of replicase complex, 
 <italic>ORF1a</italic> and 
 <italic>ORF1b</italic>, encode 16 non-structural proteins (nsp) of viral RNA synthesis complex through proteolytic processing [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The 
 <italic>nsp12</italic> is a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, together with co-factors 
 <italic>nsp7</italic> and 
 <italic>nsp8</italic> possessing high polymerase activity. A recent study showed 94.4% similarity in the amino acid sequences of the seven conserved replicase domains in ORF1ab of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The spike (S) is a transmembrane glycoprotein, that comprises two domains: S1 and S2, which play a pivotal role in mediating viral infection through binding the host receptor [

 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The interaction between the S1 domain and its cognate receptor triggers a conformational change in the S protein, which then promotes membrane fusion between the viral and cell membrane through the S2 domain [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The three short insertions in the N-terminal domain as well as changes in four out of five of the key residues in the receptor-binding motif compared with the sequence of SARS-CoV are the key differences recently found by scientists in the 
 <italic>S</italic> gene of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The major host cell receptors utilized by all HCoVs are aminopeptidase N by HCoV-229E [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) by SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and HCoV-NL63 [

 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) by MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid by HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 [
