<p>The effectiveness of CoVID-19 pandemic mitigation primarily requires a high level of participation from each individual, such as having adequate knowledge of the viral transmission, engaging in appropriate self-care, following self-hygiene guidelines and social distancing, which are fundamental in avoiding preventable hospitalizations [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, due to lower socioeconomic resources in a rural setting, there is limited literacy, specially health literacy, among the rural population, which may exacerbate the impact of CoVID-19 in rural areas [

The cumulative line of evidence have demonstrated that poor adult literacy is strongly correlated with reduced health knowledge and self-management skills, reduced physical and mental health, higher rates of hospitalizations and increased morbidity and mortality [

Hence, the consequences of CoVID-19 pandemic for the rural population will depend partly on the health risk communication and viral awareness. Pandemic communication gaps may increase vulnerability among rural populations, which may trigger disease misconceptions, uninformed policies, insufficient planning, and fostering non-resilience, predisposing the population to communicable viral risks [
