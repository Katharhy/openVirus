<p>Among the earlier studies, CoVID-19 was reported to have a mean serial interval of 7.5 days, which is defined as the delay between disease onset dates in successive cases in chains of transmission [

The identification of these characteristics is important as the study extensively inferred the doubling of CoVID-19 every seven days since each patient transmitted the infection to an additional 2.2 individuals. Similarly, other modeling studies estimated the basic case reproduction rate ranging from 2 to 6.47, while WHO published their early estimation to be ranging from 1.4 to 2.5 [
