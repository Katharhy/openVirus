<p>In addition to these overt symptoms, there has been a growing concern for asymptomatic cases [
 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. These immunocompetent viral carriers present asymptomatic infections, not manifesting any symptoms, which unanimously pose an imminent danger and may have grave outcomes. Recent studies have signified the emergence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections as a potential portal of viral transmission that needs vigilant control to detect and mitigate these community-acquired infections [

 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Individuals with viral tolerance present a potential challenge in the annihilation of this infection, especially in rural America, with inadequate health care infrastructure and high rates of chronic clinical issues [
 <xref rid="B53-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Consistent with recent studies, the majority of critically ill CoVID-19 patients are known to have some underlying chronic medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic respiratory disease [

 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These clinical conditions are also a significant health issue in the rural population; therefore, such patients are more vulnerable to developing severe CoVID-19 symptoms [
