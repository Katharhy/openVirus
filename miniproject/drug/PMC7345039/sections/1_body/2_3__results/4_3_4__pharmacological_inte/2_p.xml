<p>As discussed earlier in the light of recently published reports, 2019-nCoV can utilize ACE2 as an entry receptor in ACE2-expressing cells with higher affinity than SARS-CoV, suggesting potential drug targets for therapeutic development [

ACE2 also plays an important role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and the imbalance between ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang (1â€“7)/Mas receptor pathway in the RAS will lead to multisystem inflammation, and studies have shown that RAS inhibitors could effectively relieve symptoms of acute severe pneumonia and respiratory failure [

 <xref rid="B71-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The findings showed that 20-HETE-induced hypertension in CYP4A2-transduced rats is associated with RAS upregulation and can be abrogated by ACE inhibition or angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) blockade. The study evaluates the effect of lisinopril, losartan, 20-HEDE (20-HETE antagonist 20-hydroxyeicosa-6(Z), 15(Z)-dienoic acid), and HET0016, an inhibitor of 20-HETE, in modulating RAS, ACE, and various downstream signaling molecules involved in the pathway. Hence, our findings will also provide some valuable lead for the ongoing and future investigations on therapeutic interventions against CoVID-19. As the pandemic continues to affect increasing an number of people, scientists around the world are actively exploring the efficacy and safety of the drugs in the treatment of CoVID-19 and the findings need to be validated in further preclinical and clinical trials.
