<p>As there are no specific antiviral drugs or vaccine recommended specifically for SARS-CoV-2 infection for potential therapy of humans till date, scientists are endeavoring to find drugs to treat this disease. Currently, the treatment is symptomatic and oxygen therapy is considered as the major treatment intervention for patients with severe infection [
 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Pharmacological interventions that can prevent a mild state from progressing to the severe or critical state will significantly improve the overall prognosis of the disease. In order to reduce disease worsening and the mortality rate, developing an effective approach to modulate the immune system or suppress reactive cytokine production is of crucial importance. Studies are currently testing the efficacy of existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication. The major drugs that exhibited promising inhibitory effects are remdesivir and chloroquine. Remdesivir is an adenosine analogue that cause premature termination of viral replication and has been recently recognized as a promising antiviral drug against a wide array of RNA virus (including SARS/MERS-CoV5) infections in various experimental models [

 <xref rid="B61-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Reports show that remdesivir can inhibit CoVID-19 infection efficiently in a human cell line (human liver cancer Huh-7 cells), which is sensitive to CoVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Recent studies have also reported that remdesivir yielded promising results in the treatment of a patient with CoVID-19 in the U.S. [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and further studies are currently under progress to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drug. Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug, known to exert a potent antiviral effect by virtue of its ability to increase the endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion and interfere with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B62-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. A study demonstrated that chloroquine could function at both, entry and at post-entry stages of the CoVID-19 infection in Vero E6 cells and has an immune-modulating activity, which may synergistically enhance its antiviral effect in vivo [
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Hydroxychloroquine is an antirheumatic drug with a similar chemical structure to chloroquine and exhibits a strong immunomodulatory capacity, which prevents inflammation flare-ups and organ damage [
 <xref rid="B63-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. It can also increase the intracellular pH, interrupt toll-like receptor (
 <italic>TLR</italic>) signaling and subsequent attenuation of proinflammatory signaling activation and production of cytokines, such as type I interferons, interleukin-1 (
 <italic>IL-1</italic>), and tumor necrosis factor-α (
 <italic>TNF-α</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B64-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. As severe CoVID-19 can be due to the overactivation of the immune system triggered by CoVID-19 infection, hydroxychloroquine can be suggested to attenuate the progression of the disease from mild to severe. IFN-α is a broad-spectrum antiviral used to treat hepatitis and is reported to inhibit SARS-CoV reproduction in vitro [
 <xref rid="B65-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Lopinavir/ritonavir, a medication used to treat the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is also found to exhibit anti-SARS-CoV activity in vitro and in clinical studies [
 <xref rid="B66-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue with a broad-spectrum of antiviral effects, exhibited lower risk of ARDS and death when used in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir [
 <xref rid="B65-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Favipiravir is a new type of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor reported to possess anti-influenza virus activity and is capable of blocking the replication of flavi-, alpha-, filo-, bunya-, arena-, noro-, and other RNA viruses [
 <xref rid="B67-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. So clinical trials of favipiravir on CoVID-19 infection have now been initiated by the Clinical Medical Research Center of the National Infectious Diseases and the Third People’s Hospital of Shenzhen. Other potential drugs include type II transmembrane serine protease (TMSPSS2) inhibitors and BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib. The ability of these drugs to block the entry and inhibit the fusion of virions with the endosomal membrane may provide anti-coronal activity [
