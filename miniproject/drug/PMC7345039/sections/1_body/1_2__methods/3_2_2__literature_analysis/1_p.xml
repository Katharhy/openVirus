<p>The research articles chosen were reviewed for government guidelines, mitigation strategies, persisting symptoms, CoVID-19 morbidity and mortality, and U.S. rural healthcare. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were set to only evaluate articles and data published from 2003 to 2020 in order to limit this search. Furthermore, this search was restricted to all the articles available as full text and published in the English language. Any relevancy or information deemed important was also included from articles published outside U.S. A total of 181 articles was assessed by three reviewers for relevancy, out of which 96 references and citations were utilized.</p>
