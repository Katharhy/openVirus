<p>Given their high pathogenicity in humans and the extent of global impact caused by the HCoV outbreaks in the past two decades, it has been a topic of great interest; hence, the mechanistic action of this virus is being thoroughly investigated by researchers. The causative agent of the current pandemic presenting as a viral pneumonia, SARS-CoV-2 is a group of large, enveloped RNA viruses under the Coronaviridae family, classified specifically under the Nidovirales order [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The cumulative line of evidence demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 shares 79.6% of sequence identity to the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003, at a genomic level, while the genomic sequence is almost 96% identical to the bat coronavirus [

While understanding the origin and the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is imminent, the clinical manifestation of this virus in humans and the increasing number of symptomatic and asymptomatic “carriers” every day, presents growing concern for public health.
