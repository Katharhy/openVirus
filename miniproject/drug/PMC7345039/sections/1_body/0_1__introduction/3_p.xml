<p>The aggressive growth in numbers of emerging cases suggests the rapid spread of the virus in naïve population and improvement in diagnostic capability during this CoVID-19 outbreak, however, there is an increasing evidence of epidemiological disparity in disease burden between urban and rural areas [

 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The differences in the urban and rural areas can highly determine the influence of a viral pandemic, in terms of viral transmission, diagnostics, morbidity, and mortality [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These differences mainly arise from the socioeconomic factors, access to healthcare, and pandemic preparedness. Given the higher percentage of U.S. rural population being old (age ≥ 60), individuals with obesity (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30) and associated co-morbidities along with their smoking status; these factors puts them at higher risk of infection and severe complications arising from CoVID-19. Hence, this review aims to provide an insight on the modality and transmission dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 clinical characteristics persistent with the virus and further discuss efforts toward the development of pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies to combat its progression in humans. This review also aims to assess the challenges of the CoVID-19 pandemic in rural settings based on the past pandemic experiences and the overall effect on rural population.
