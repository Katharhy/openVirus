  <p>Schematic representation for pathogenicity of novel coronavirus disease (CoVID-19) in humans. The viral transmission through human-to-human induces systemic effects and targets lungs causing clinical manifestation of symptoms associated with the virus that have been persistent in patients affected with CoVID-19. The pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention strategies may mitigate these effects and assist in viral containment.</p>
