  <p>SARS-CoV2 replication and inhibition by trehalose. SARS-CoV-2 gains entry via membrane fusion by binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the target cell. The virus is then internalized and transported through endosomal compartments. The viral genome is released and used by the host ribosome to synthesize viral RNA polymerase, thus replicating the viral RNA subgenomes. Viral structural proteins are synthesized and anchored into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Once the virion is assembled in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and transferred to the autophagosome, it may be released by exocytosis from the amphisome. Coronavirus nonstructural protein 6 (nsp6) and nsp3 promote autophagosome formation but prevent autophagosome-lysosome fusion. (1) Trehalose may promote amphisome-lysosome fusion for virion degradation after the trafficking of viral double-membrane vesicles. (2) Trehalose can also activate transcription factor EB (TFEB) and promote lysosome biogenesis.</p>
