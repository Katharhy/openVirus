<p>It is important to understand that while there is considerable research on trehalose administration in adults, there is still not sufficient data on its safety in children, adults with health-related issues, and the elderly. We have previously reported that trehalose exacerbated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) “two-hit” murine model (induced by LPS and mechanical ventilation), while other autophagy activations inhibited ARDS (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>). Therefore, trehalose treatment would be inappropriate to treat intensive care patients with severe COVID-19, especially those presenting cytokine storm syndrome or ARDS. For inflammatory cytokines, trehalose has been shown to suppress LPS-induced IL-1β and TNF-α secretion in mouse peritoneal macrophages (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>). Our experimental 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> data shows that trehalose pretreatment inhibited LPS induced IL-6 production in macrophages (unpublished). As in the clinical practice guidelines by the infectious diseases society of America on the management of influenza, early treatment with antiviral medications attenuates symptoms and risk complications. In the same way, trehalose could have a more significant benefit as an anti-inflammatory in the initial phase of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Treating severe COVID-19 patients in the late stage of the disease would not be sufficient. Instead, other emergency FDA approved pharmaceutical interventions would be more effective. While trehalose could provide significant benefits as an antiviral treatment, studies have shown that dietary trehalose may enhance the virulence of

 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies on the effects of trehalose on SARS-CoV-2 infection still need to be investigated since some type of viruses can highjack the autophagy system and enhance their replication with trehalose treatment (e.g., HRV) (

Once confirming the effectivity of trehalose, tests in the rhesus macaque model would be ideal for establishing an appropriate starting dose for human clinical trials. The majority of trehalose administration in adults ranges from 4.8 to 10 g/day. Lung alteration of autophagy has been confirmed with the use of 1 g/kg trehalose to mice, which is equivalent to 4.8 g/day for every 60 kgs in humans (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>). A diabetes study used 10 g/day (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), while an acute coronary artery clinical trial used 2.1 g/day (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). An effective dosage of trehalose per body weight for targeting SARS-CoV-2 and pharmacokinetics of trehalose in human blood remains to be determined. Of note, fasting between 16 and 18 h is also known to activate autophagy; however, it is not a good strategy for viral infection as previously reported (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>). Thus, we do not recommend fasting as a prophylactic treatment for COVID-19. Rapamycin, a representative mTOR-dependent autophagy activator, has an immunosuppressive adverse effect that may make it inadequate as a prophylactic treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (
