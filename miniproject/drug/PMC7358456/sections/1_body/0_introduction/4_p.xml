<p>In maternal diabetes, repressed autophagy in developing neuroepithelium cells leads to neural tube defects (NTDs) in the developing fetus (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Trehalose administration restored this autophagy defect and prevented the hyperglycemia-induced NTDs (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In another 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study, trehalose promoted LC3 autophagosome formation in high glucose cultured cells, higher clearance of ubiquitin-binding protein p62, neural stem cell differentiation, mitophagy, and reticulophagy (

A mouse model of MSP III, treated with trehalose, showed neurological improvements associated with the clearance of autophagic vacuoles in neuronal and glial cells, as well as the activation of the TFEB transcription network (

Mashhad University of Medical Sciences is now sponsoring an interventional clinical trial to test the beneficial effects of intravenous administration of trehalose (15 g per week for 12 weeks) as an anti-inflammatory agent against vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis (

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients are associated with vascular complications and increased platelet activation. Reduced glucose oxidation, oxidative stress, and autophagy are factors that contribute to reduced blood flow in PAD patients (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). A clinical trial approaching the effects of trehalose on endothelial function, oxidative stress, platelet function, and autophagy in PAD patients is currently active (
