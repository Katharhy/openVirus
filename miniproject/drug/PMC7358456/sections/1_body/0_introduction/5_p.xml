<p>In the context of infectious diseases, autophagy induction is critical for both innate and adaptative immune response development. Although some microorganisms can evade autophagy and even use it as a survival and propagation strategy, autophagy is an effective way to control most of intracellular infections (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the pathogen well-known for evading immune responses, is also known for its effects in the autophagy flux (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). HIV increases the number of autophagosomes and impairs autophagosome maturation, thus blocking autophagosome-lysosome fusion (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Despite the fact that CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes are the predominant target for HIV infection, it is the HIV-infected innate immune cells that make organisms highly susceptible to opportunistic microorganisms, such as non-pathogenic mycobacteria (

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In addition, trehalose post-treatment reduced HIV load in PBMCs from HIV infected patients (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Antiviral effects of trehalose on other disease-related viruses, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), have been demonstrated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Its mechanism of action lies in its ability to induce autophagy significantly. Trehalose inhibited HCMV viral gene expression and viral spread in multiple cell types (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Both pre- and post-treatments with trehalose reduced HCMV and VZV replication (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Interestingly, Clark et al. (2018) reported in HCMV infected cells that trehalose alters the intra-multivesicular bodies (MVBs) virion morphology and redirects the trafficking of viral vacuole maturation through downregulation of Ras-like GTPase 11 (Rab11), a protein involved in the control of endosomal trafficking (

In primary mouse cortical cultures infected with the West Nile virus (WNV), trehalose induced robust activation of autophagy indicated by an increase in protein expression of LC3-II; however, activation of autophagy had no significant effect on WNV growth (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Similar autophagy activation was observed in human primary airway epithelial cells treated with trehalose, but autophagy induction impaired antiviral function against human rhinovirus (HRV) infection (
