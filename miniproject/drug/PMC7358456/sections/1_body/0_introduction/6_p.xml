<p>The beta-coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), encode viral proteins that impair autophagosome-lysosome fusion, such as the membrane-associated papain-like protease (PLp-TM) (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Also, coronaviruses replicate in LC3-mediated autophagosome-like double-membrane vesicles in an ATG7-independent manner (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Since various viruses hijack the autophagic machinery to the benefit of viral replication and virion maturation, regulating cellular autophagy with autophagy modulators such as chloroquine (CQ) or trehalose is of great importance in the treatment of viral diseases (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). In regard to this, coronaviruses express non-structural protein 6 (nsp6) and nsp3 that promote autophagosome formation but prevent autophagosome-lysosome fusion, indicating that autophagy flux induction by trehalose could be beneficial for potential COVID-19 containment (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Of note, the recently described LC3-associated endocytosis (LANDO), that occurs with the conjugation of LC3 to Rab5
 <sup>+</sup> clathrin
 <sup>+</sup> endosomes containing Î²-amyloid, is another newly reported important mechanism to clear the exogenous antigens in microglial cells (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). LANDO may be another underestimated LC3-vesicle with the potential for coronaviral replication, which can explain the LC3-dependent and ATG7-independent coronaviral replication observed previously. However, the dichotomy lies in that both LC3-phagosome and LC3-endosome are single-membrane vesicles, while coronaviral replication would occur in double-membrane vesicles (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). So far, there is no known effect of trehalose on LANDO, yet it is clear that trehalose displays autophagy-dependent antiviral activities against different types of viruses.
