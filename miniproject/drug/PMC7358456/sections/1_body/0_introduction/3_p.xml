<p>Since 1925, several studies aimed to understand the chemical and biological properties of trehalose. Trehalose has received attention for its protective properties in neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The protective effects of trehalose were considered to be due to its chemical chaperone properties (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, in 2007, trehalose was identified as an autophagy inducer (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Autophagy, a highly conserved intracellular degradation process, is regulated by the major control complex mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Interestingly, trehalose induces autophagy independent of mTOR (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In mammalian cell cultures, trehalose treatment can enhance the clearance of denatured huntingtin and denatured α-synuclein, both autophagy substrates associated with Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases, respectively (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The trehalose effects are dependent on the accumulation of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) II, which is essential for the formation of autophagosomes from autophagy-related 5 (ATG5) protein complex anchored phagophores (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, these are independent of mTOR inhibition, since trehalose does not reduce the phosphorylation levels at specific sites on mTOR substrates, which are reduced by the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Later, the transcription factor EB (TFEB) was identified to be the primary lysosomal biogenesis regulator, as it induces the expression of several essential genes for this phenomenon (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). When trehalose emerged as an autophagy inducer, some research groups were compelled to use trehalose to demonstrate the role of TFEB. It was observed that trehalose reduced the activity of AKT (protein kinase B), which phosphorylates TFEB (S467A), thus enabling the translocation of TFEB to the nucleus independently of the TFEB inhibitor, mTOR (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Furthermore, trehalose can activate TFEB and could subsequently promote cross-presentation (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).
