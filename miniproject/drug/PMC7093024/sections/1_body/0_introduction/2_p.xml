<p>Natural products contain structurally diversified bioactive chemicals, which are valuable sources for new drug discovery. Among the new medicines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 1981 and 2010, natural products or their direct derivatives account for 34% (

 <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> Retz. display potent anti-IAV activity. Further, two constitutes of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic>, chebulagic acid (CHLA) and chebulinic acid (CHLI), were identified as novel antivirals against IAV. Detailed studies revealed that both compounds specifically block progeny virus release by inhibiting IAV NA activity. Moreover, CHLA and CHLI showed highly inhibitory efficacy against an oseltamivir-resistant IAV strain, suggesting their potential as novel cost-effective NA inhibitors for controlling influenza virus infections.
