<p>In this study, a phenotypic screening approach was initially used to evaluate 352 natural product samples for activity against IAV infection, and 12 natural product samples were identified as putative hits with high anti-IAV potency. Among these hit natural product samples, unripe and ripe pods of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> displayed the most potent anti-IAV activity.
