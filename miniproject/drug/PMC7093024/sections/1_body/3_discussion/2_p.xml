<p>Unripe and ripe pods of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> are two different medical materials usually prescribed in Traditional Chinese Medicine formula. However, the compositions of unripe pods and ripe pods of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> are highly overlapping, and our study showed that CHLA and CHLI, two overlapped tannin constituents of the two samples, exhibit highly inhibitory effects against IAV replication, with IC
 <sub>50</sub>s of 1.36 and 1.86 Î¼M, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, the SIs of CHLA and CHLI against IAV replication in MDCK cells are &gt; 74 and &gt; 54, respectively, suggesting that the two compounds are good candidates for novel antivirals against IAV (
