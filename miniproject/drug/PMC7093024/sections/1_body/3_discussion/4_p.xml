<p>Neuraminidase is a major surface glycoprotein with a sialidase activity, which contributes to the release of newly formed virions from infected cells and facilitates propagation of the virus (

However, resistance to oseltamivir has constantly been reported due to its wide use in clinic, and various mutants with resistance to the other NA inhibitors have also appeared (
