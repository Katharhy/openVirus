<p>High-performance liquid chromatography was performed to further demonstrate that unripe and ripe pods of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> share the constituents of CHLA and CHLI (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>), of which the dose–response effects against IAV replication were subsequently determined. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2B,C</xref>, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values against IAV replication of CHLA and CHLI were 1.36 ± 0.36 and 1.86 ± 0.98 μM, respectively, while the CC
 <sub>50</sub> values of both compounds were greater than 100 μM. These results show that CHLA and CHLI are potent anti-IAV inhibitors.
