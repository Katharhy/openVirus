<p>To determine whether the hit natural product samples or its derivatives were target to viral entry or genome replication steps, a one-cycle infection inhibition assay was carried out using the reporter virus PR8-PB2-Gluc. Briefly, MDCK cells growing in a 96-well plate were infected with PR8-PB2-Gluc at an MOI of 0.1 in the presence of various concentrations of test samples/compounds. After 1 h of incubation, unabsorbed viruses were removed, and the cells were treated with the tested samples. In order to prevent the second round of infection, DMEM containing 10% FBS, instead of Opti-MEM containing 2 μg/mL of TPCK–trypsin, was used during infection to avoid HA cleavage and infectious virus production. After 24 h, infections were quantified by measuring the luciferase activity with PierceTM Gaussia Luciferase Glow Assay kit (Thermo Fisher, Hillsboro, OR, United States). Meanwhile, in the presence of the reporter virus PR8-PB2-Gluc, cell cytotoxicity for the test compounds was determined.</p>
