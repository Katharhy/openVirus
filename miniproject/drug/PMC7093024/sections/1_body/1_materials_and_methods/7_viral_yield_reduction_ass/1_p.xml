<p>Viral yield reduction assay was performed as previously described (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, MDCK cells growing in 24-well plates were infected with A/H1N1/PR8, A/H3N2/NY, oseltamivir-resistant influenza A/H1N1/pdm(09), A/H3N2/Brisbane, B-Yamagata-like, and B-Victoria-like strains at an MOI of 0.01 with or without various concentrations of test samples/compounds. The culture supernatants were harvested at 24 h p.i., and virus titers (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL) in the culture supernatants were determined using MDCK cells.
