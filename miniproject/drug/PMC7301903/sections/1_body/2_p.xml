<p>The viral genome of SARS-Cov-2 showed approximately 80% similarity with SARS-CoV. However, it was nearly 95% identical with seven conserved replicase domains, indicating that both viruses belong to the same species. However, phylogenetic analysis showed that RaTG13 and the spike gene (S) in bats are the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2, thus forming a distinct lineage from other SARS-CoVs.
