<p>The COVID-19 virus outbreak in late 2019, which spread from China, led to a pandemic infection. So far, current approaches have not yet proven to be efficient. Many alternatives are proposed nowadays, and antiviral peptides are among them. This article may reveal more facts about the feasibility of using the AMPs in general and LF in particular, as an antiviral treatment. As a result, it can be a corner stone for more future research on the LFs as antiviral therapy in general and against COVID-19 in particular. The affordability, environmental safety, and efficiency of LFs will make them superior to all other control strategies, especially since LF is a safe natural protein that is a commercially already produced drug at an affordable price. Therefore, the objectives of this article are short-term and long-term objectives. For the short-term objectives, the first is to ensure efficient and instant treatment and protection of humans from the viral infections such as that caused by COVID-19 and as a result, decrease the humansâ€™ mortality rate that has been rising at an exponential rate since the abrupt appearance of this viral infection. The second is to prevent the transmission of this disease among humans by increasing their immunity. A long-term objective is protection of humans from this viral infection, which will bring back normal life and which will have a huge impact on the economy worldwide after the huge financial loss that was caused due to the spread of that infection. The second-long-term objective is to ensure the healthiness of people and to protect them not only against COVID-19 but also against any emerging viral infection, and accordingly, this will maximize the social welfare of humans.</p>
