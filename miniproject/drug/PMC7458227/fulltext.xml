On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the Chinese outbreak of COVID-19 to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup></p><p>So far, there has been no effective treatment of COVID-19. Several potential drug candidates, including lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), nucleoside analogs, neuraminidase inhibitors, remdesivir, umifenovir (arbidol), DNA synthesis inhibitors (such as tenofovir disoproxil, and lamivudine), chloroquine, and Chinese traditional medicine (such as ShuFengJieDu or Lianhuaqingwen capsules), have been proposed.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup></p><p>It is perhaps clear that quarantine alone may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and the global impact of this viral infection is 1 of heightening concern.</p><p>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which originated in China, is used to maintain health and treat diseases.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> It includes medicinal herbs, prescriptions, Traditional Chinese medicine, tai chi and other contents. Chinese herbs have been used to treat human diseases in China for thousands of years.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> The awarding of part of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for Tu Youyou s discovery and development of artemisinin, a potent antimalarial derived from the herbal Artemisia annua, is a clear example and reminder of the potential held by herbal medicine.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup></p><p>According to incomplete statistics, there have been more than 300 epidemics recorded in China's history.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> In the struggles against epidemics over thousands of years, many methods have been proved effective in practice.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Traditional Chinese medicine plays an extremely important role in the processes. Studies have shown that Artemisiae Argyi Folium, Atractylodis Rhizoma and Radix Angelicae Dahuricae were used for prevention of plagues by Chinese ancients.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Peking University Shenzhen Hospital utilized an air disinfection technique combined atractylodus fumigate with chemical and physical disinfectants, leading to a no nosocomial infection report in the fight against SARS in 2003.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Existing studies applaud the application of Chinese herbal medicine fumigation in clinical practices, and there are pharmacological studies confirmed its active ingredients.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Chinese herbal medicine provides a new way for the combat to current severe COVID-19.</p><p>In China, Chinese medicine (CM) is proposed as a treatment option by national and provincial guidelines with substantial utilization.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> During the outbreak of SARS, CM was introduced as a treatment option since the early situation of epidemic in China. There are 3 clinical trials have proved the effectiveness of CM in the treatment of SARS.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> The sixth version of China national clinical guideline on COVID-19 associated pneumonia was published on February 18, 2020, the national guideline divided COVID-19 into medical observation period and treatment period. The recommended formulation during medical observation period involved huo-xiang-zheng-qi capsule and jin-hua-qing-gan granules, lian-hua-qing-wen capsule or shu-feng-jie-du capsule. The treatment period is divided into 4</p><p>clinical stages with the corresponding recommended prescription.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> Over 85% of confirmed cases involved CM use nationally (Wuhan over 67%)<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> and the first CM-oriented designated Module Hospital in Wuhan operated since 14 February 2020.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> The clinical evidence of CM on COVID-19 is far from conclusive, but may be a good additional candidate at least for trial treatment considering the limited options available for COVID-19.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> Early reported benefits of CM included symptomatic relief, shortening fever duration, reverting radiological changes, and shortening hospital stay.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup></p><p>Although there are lots of encouraged outcomes of TCM in the fights against COVID-19 in China. It still needs a systematic assessment to provide a convincing results for the application of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19 due to the incomplete evidences of present studies.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study registration</title><p>The systematic review protocol has been registered in PROSPERO.
