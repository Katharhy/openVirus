<p>This review is divided into 4 parts: identification, literature inclusion, data extraction, and data synthesis. It will systematically review the RCT literature, this review will evaluate the effectiveness of Traditional Chinese medicine in treating COVID-19 convalescent patients. There are also limitations in our research and the language bias here is that we only search for Chinese and English documents.
