Through the analysis of the article, we know participantsâ€™ characteristics (height, weight, sex), interventions, outcomes, the study characteristics (press, nationality, journals, research design), adverse reactions, etc. If there is any disagreement between the 2 authors in the literature data extraction, a third article participant will discuss the decision together. If there is a lack of data in the literature, we will contact the author or publisher as much as possible.</p>
