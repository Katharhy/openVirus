<p>For the detection of heterogeneity, the 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> test will be used to detect the heterogeneity among trials. When the 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> test value is &lt; 50% and 
 <italic>P</italic> value &gt; 1, we think there is no heterogeneity between these trials, and when the 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> test value is &gt; 50% and the 
 <italic>P</italic> value is &lt; 1, there is significant heterogeneity between these included trials. If significant differences are detected, we will analyze the possible causes of heterogeneity, and then we can use the random effects model.
