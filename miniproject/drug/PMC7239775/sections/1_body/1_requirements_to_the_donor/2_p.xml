<p id="par0020">The attention for a possible source of immune plasma is focused, at present, on patients with a very recent documented infection by SARS-CoV-2 who volunteer, upon informed consent, to undergo apheresis procedures to collect plasma specifically intended for therapy of severe infections by SARS-CoV-2. This target population requires some caution because of some exceptions with respect to the standards defined by the selection criteria defined by Italian legislation enforcing European directives [
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; this derogation refers to the age of the donor and to the deferral period after clinical recovery (probably less than twice the incubation period, as suggested by the “Guide for preparation, use and quality assurance of blood components”, published by the EDQM - Council of Europe [
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]); finally, we must be aware of the fact that we will collect plasma for clinical use from patients that, in the majority of cases, have not been previously regular blood donors, thus lacking a previous safety profile. All the remaining selection criteria must be applied, first of all the exclusion of donors with a previous history of pregnancy and/or blood transfusion.
