<p id="par0055">When dealing with convalescent patients, not previously blood donors, collected units should be initially tested as required by the Italian legislation for plasma intended for clinical transfusion (HIV, HCV, HBV NAT and serology testing, syphilis). Convalescent patients, from both first-time donors and regular donors, should be tested as required by the Italian legislation [

This would probably not be necessary when collecting plasma from regular donors. A negative result of NAT testing for SARS-CoV-2 is also clearly expected in both cases.
