<p id="par0075">The use of hyperimmune immunoglobulin concentrates (derived from plasma of immunised donors), is likely to be an even more effective method for administering specific antibodies and this is, at present, a field of research for pharmaceutical companies; however, in the medium term period, the availability of immune plasma from regular fully recovered donors could allow the preparation of units of human plasma pooled and treated for virus inactivation, with the standard described by the European Pharmacopoeia. This would allow production of hyperimmune plasma with a known and standardized antibody titre. A preliminary discussion with pharmaceutical companies and with the National Competent Authority (AIFA, in Italy) is clearly necessary.</p>
