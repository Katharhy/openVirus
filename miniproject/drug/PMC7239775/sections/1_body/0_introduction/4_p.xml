<p id="par0015">This “position paper” is not a protocol for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 by means of convalescent plasma: clinical protocols and trials require, in almost all jurisdictions, an approval by local or national ethical committees and sometimes also by national Competent Authorities on blood or drugs. In the present phase of this pandemic, we are aware that in Italy (as well as in the rest of the world) Transfusion Services have been urged by clinicians in hospitals to provide immune plasma for a possible utilisation in the therapy of COVID-19 patients. We need to support the possibility of evaluating this therapeutic approach in more rigorous investigations. To this purpose, these recommendations on biological characteristics of a plasma preparation from convalescent donors can be helpful, to make future comparison among studies easier.</p>
