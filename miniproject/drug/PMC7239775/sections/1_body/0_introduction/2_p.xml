<p id="par0005">Passive immunotherapy with plasma derived from patients that have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection can be a promising approach in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, as suggested by recent experiences [
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>] and discussed in two very recent relevant editorials [
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The use of convalescent plasma has a high level of safety, as documented in any previous situation of its use during the last years [
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, collection of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19 patients has started in different countries (among which are the USA [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], Italy [
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and the Netherlands [
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]) and others will follow in the very next days. Due to this, many clinical trials are ongoing, as regularly updated by the WHO [
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and also by the NIH [
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These protocols are expected to clarify the effective role (if any) of immune plasma in improving the prognosis of patients affected by severe forms of the disease and we cannot exclude a rapid and sustained increase in the request for this product, if clinical trials would demonstrate its therapeutic efficacy; the increase could be even more pronounced in case of a limited access to other therapeutic options due to the possible shortage of some drugs (as recently highlighted by some regional health authorities [
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]).
