<p>Google Trends can provide insight into the relative search volumes of search terms on Google on a daily basis [
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Depending on the source of the search, Google Trends can be further divided into web search trends and Google Shopping trends, and these trends were highly correlated (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="app1">Multimedia Appendix 1</xref>). The Google Trends index (web search) on the topic of 
 <italic>coronavirus</italic> was used to assess the awareness of COVID-19 among the general public, whereas the Google Shopping indices on two topics, 
 <italic>mask</italic> and 
 <italic>hand sanitizer</italic>, were used to assess the adoption of personal protection measures. In countries where Google Shopping data were limited for assessing public purchasing behavior (including Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Italy, and Spain), Google web search data were used as an alternative. Google Trends presents relative search volumes ranging from 0 to 100 (the maximum daily search volume on specific terms is standardized as 100%).
