 <xref rid="figure4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> shows the trends in the Baidu indices on rumors, indicating intended behavior. The Baidu Index of 
 <italic>radix isatidis</italic>, a traditional Chinese medicine used to treat fever, started to increase when the outbreak was first announced. It further increased sharply on January 20, 2020, when human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 and 291 cases were confirmed, and it reached a peak on January 21. The index started to decline from January 21 to 24, during which the newspaper 
 <italic>People's Daily</italic> issued three reports in an attempt to refute rumors of the effectiveness of radix isatidis against COVID-19. On January 31, 
 <italic>People's Daily</italic> reported that Shuanghuanglian, a Chinese medicine, could inhibit COVID-19, and the Baidu indices of both 
 <italic>Shuanghuanglian</italic> and 
 <italic>radix isatidis</italic> rapidly reached their peaks. Both indices decreased rapidly on February 2, when 
 <italic>People's Daily</italic> clarified that Shuanghuanglian cannot prevent COVID-19. A rumor that garlic could prevent COVID-19 started to spread on January 21, and the Baidu Index of 
 <italic>garlic</italic> increased accordingly. This index reached a peak on January 27 and declined after January 28, when 
 <italic>People's Daily</italic> first refuted rumors about the protective function of garlic. Representing the baseline, these indices remained steadily low during the same period in the previous year.
