 <xref rid="figure5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> shows the Google Trends data for the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine worldwide. Public searches for 
 <italic>chloroquine</italic> started to increase and reached a small peak in late February, when COVID-19 started to spread in Italy. The increase in searches for 
 <italic>chloroquine</italic> was observed during this time only in Asian and European countries (Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Italy, France, Spain, and the United Kingdom); it was not found in the United States, India, Brazil, or South Africa. Public searches on both drugs increased after mid-March and quickly peaked on March 20 after US President Donald Trumpâ€™s initial public remarks on the drugs at a briefing on March 19; this increase was observed in all countries.
