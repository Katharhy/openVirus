<p>Cardiovascular complications of influenza infection, including myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, and exacerbation of heart failure have been well-recognized during previous historical epidemics and make a significant contribution to mortality (
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Likewise, previous corona-virus outbreaks have been associated with a significant burden of cardiovascular comorbidities and complications. Furthermore, the severity of the primary respiratory syndrome and risk of adverse outcomes is increased in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (

Electrocardiographic changes and troponin elevation may signal underlying myocarditis, and echocardiography frequently demonstrates subclinical left ventricular diastolic impairment (with a higher likelihood of the need for mechanical ventilation in those with systolic impairment and reduced ejection fraction) (
