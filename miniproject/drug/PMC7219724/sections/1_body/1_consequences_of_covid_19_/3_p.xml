<p>Early COVID-19 case reports suggest that patients with underlying conditions are at higher risk for complications or mortality - up to 50% of hospitalized patients have a chronic medical illness (40% cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease). In the largest published clinical cohort of COVID-19 to date, acute cardiac injury, shock, and arrhythmia were present in 7.2%, 8.7%, and 16.7% of patients, respectively (

CVDs may become unstable in the setting of viral infection as a consequence of imbalance between infection-induced increase in metabolic demand and reduced cardiac reserve. Patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure may be at particular risk as a result of coronary plaque rupture secondary to virally induced systemic inflammation, and rigorous use of plaque stabilizing agents (aspirin, statins, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) has been suggested as a possible therapeutic strategy. Pro-coagulant effects of systemic inflammation (
