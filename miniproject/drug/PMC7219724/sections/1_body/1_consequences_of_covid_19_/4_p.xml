<p>The clinical effects of pneumonia have been linked to increased risk of CVD up to 10-year follow-up (

Therapeutic use of corticosteroids further augments the possibility of adverse cardiovascular events. However, long-term follow-up data concerning the survivors of respiratory virus epidemics are scarce. Lipid metabolism remained disrupted 12 years after clinical recovery in a metabolomic study amongst 25 SARS survivors (

Whilst viral phenotype, baseline clinical characteristics, initial disease severity, and immediate management impact on short-term survival, long-term prognosis following outbreaks of respiratory virus infection may equally depend upon the extra-pulmonary manifestations. Serial follow-up studies amongst the survivors of acute infection are surely needed.
