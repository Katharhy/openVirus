<p>The current COVID-19 pandemic, also, caused by the Corona virus SARS COV-2, has clinical manifestations as in previous outbreaks, and the virus itself has great genetic similarity to the previous SARS COV-1. The current pandemic, however, has led to dramatic changes in the lives of every inhabitant of this planet, and the greatest challenges for each country public health and health care systems. Despite the genetic similarity, the new virus has other modes of transmission, and appears to have a greater ability to block an adequate immune response, leading to more severe forms of ARDS. After it causes respiratory symptoms, the virus infects all other organ systems (cardiovascular, hematopoietic, digestive, then the kidney, skin, CNS) through the blood (viremia) and can lead to multiorgan failure. The ACE 2 receptors, which are used by the virus to enter the cells of the respiratory system for reproduction, also have other organs, which can be affected at the very beginning of the disease. Such a condition can lead to an overreaction of the immune system with the production of a number of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, and cause “cytokine storm” (
