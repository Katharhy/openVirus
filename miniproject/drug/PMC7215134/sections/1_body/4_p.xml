<p id="Par6">In the specific case of SARS-CoV-2, and in general in the case of RNA viruses, the most specific target is represented by the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) which is specific to each RNA virus, regardless the polarity of the viral RNA genome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Nevertheless, significant differences are identified between RdRp from positive-sense and negative-sense RNA viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The latter observation strongly suggests that repositioning of antiviral drugs should take into consideration the molecular basis of the genomic viral RNA.
