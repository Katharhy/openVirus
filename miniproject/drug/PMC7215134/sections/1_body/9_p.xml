<p id="Par11">Moreover, Sofosbuvir is a prodrug of the protide type and is metabolized to the active antiviral agent GS-461203 (2′-deoxy-2′-α-fluoro-β-C-methyluridine-5′-triphosphate) in the liver. The enzymes involved in such activation are cathepsin A and the histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1), and subsequent repeated phosphorylation. All these enzymes have RNA and protein expression in the lung cells comparable to liver cells, ensuring the appropriate activation of the Sofosbuvir to become an effective substrate of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in the target cells of the respiratory tract.</p>
