<p id="Par9">The structure modeling shows that RdRp of positive-sense (HCV and SARS-CoV-2) and negative-sense (i.e. Influenza) RNA viruses are significantly different, but they all show the formation of the Motif C β-strand-loop-β-strand structure. However, only the alignment of RdRp structures from the two positive-sense RNA viruses shows a superimposition of the two Motifs C [
