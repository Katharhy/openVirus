<p id="par0030">To identify anti-SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors, confluent VeroE6 cells in 96-well culture plates (4 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) in triplicates were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at 0.004 MOI. One hour after virus adsorption, the inoculum was removed and then drug-containing medium (10μM) was added. Next, after 72 h, 20 μL of cell culture supernatant was diluted into 80 μL of PBS before adding to the antibody-coated ELISA plate for SARS-CoV-2-N detection, while another 20 μL/well of CellTiterGlo® substrate was added to the original cell culture plates for cell viability evaluation by CPE inhibition assay.
