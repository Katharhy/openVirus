<p id="par0035">Viral load reduction assay was performed on VeroE6 and Caco2 cells, as described previously with modifications [
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Supernatant samples from the infected cells were harvested at different time-points for qRT-PCR analysis of virus replication. Briefly, 100 μl of viral supernatant was lyzed with 400 μl of AVL buffer and then extracted for total RNA with the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Real-time one-step qRT-PCR was used for quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV viral load using the QuantiNova Probe RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) with a LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche) as previously described [
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Each 20 μl reaction mixture contained 10 μl of 2×QuantiNova Probe RT-PCR Master Mix, 1.2 μl of RNase-free water, 0.2 μl of QuantiNova Probe RT-Mix, 1.6 μl each of 10 μM forward and reverse primer, 0.4 μl of 10 μM probe, and 5 μl of extracted RNA as the template. Reactions were incubated at 45 °C for 10 min for reverse transcription, 95 °C for 5 min for denaturation, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 55 °C for 30 s. Signal detection and measurement were taken in each cycle after the annealing step. The cycling profile ended with a cooling step at 40 °C for 30 s. The primers and probe sequences were against the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase/Helicase (RdRP/Hel) gene region of SARS-CoV-2: Forward primer: 5′ CGCATACAGTCTTRCAGGCT-3′; Reverse primer: 5′-GTGTGATGTTGAWATGACATGGTC-3′; specific probe: 5′-FAM TTAAGATGTGGTGCTTGCATACGTAGAC-IABkFQ-3′ [
