<p id="par0085">Both abiraterone acetate and bexarotene are non-chemotherapeutic antineoplastic drugs with limited immunosuppressive effects. Abiraterone acetate is used in combination with corticosteroid to treat refractory prostate cancer through androgen deprivation by inhibition of the androgen synthesizing enzyme CYP17A1 [

 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Bexarotene is a third-generation retinoid used in the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and breast cancer [

 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>]. We showed that abiraterone acetate and bexarotene potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> with EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.94 μM and 2.01 μM, respectively. Of particular interest is bexarotene which has a peak serum concentration (Cmax) of 3.39 μM after an oral dose of 300 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> [
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The Cmax to EC
 <sub>50</sub> ratio of bexarotene for SARS-CoV-2 (1.69) is higher than those achieved with standard dosing of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and ivermectin (0.02–1.04). Moreover, the time required to achieve Cmax (Tmax) with standard oral dosing of bexarotene is short (2.5 h), which is important especially in COVID-19 patients who are acutely ill with rapid clinical deterioration [
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We have previously shown that AM580 and tamibarotene, which belong to the same drug class as bexarotene, exhibited broad-spectrum antiviral activities against coronaviruses (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV), influenza viruses, enterovirus A71, Zika virus, and adenovirus [
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We therefore additionally tested the antiviral activity of bexarotene against the highly virulent MERS-CoV, and showed that it indeed also inhibited MERS-CoV with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2.12 μM. The potential of bexarotene and its related analogue compounds as “pan-coronavirus” agents should be further evaluated in suitable animal models for COVID-19 and other human-pathogenic coronaviruses.
