<p id="par0080">The newly established two-tier screening system in this study was robust and able to identify other drug compounds that were shown to exhibit anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and nafamostat. This allowed us to rapidly and systematically screen a drug library consisting 1528 FDA-approved drug compounds and identify four drug compounds that showed anit-SARS-CoV-2 activities at low micromolar concentrations (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.13–2.01). Cetilistat is a pancreatic lipase inhibitor that blocks fat digestion and absorption used in the treatment of obesity [

 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In a SARS-CoV-2-infected hamster model, it was found that the animals’ intestines exhibited severe inflammation with detectable viral RNA and abundant viral nucleocapsid protein expression [
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These findings showed that like in SARS, feces might also be a potential source of infection in COVID-19 [

 <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Thus, besides being administered by inhalation, oral cetilisat and diiodohydroxylquinoline might have a role as topical luminal antivirals to reduce viral shedding in the gastrointestinal tract.
