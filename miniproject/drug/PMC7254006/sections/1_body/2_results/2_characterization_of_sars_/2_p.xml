<p id="par0055">To develop a drug screening system for SARS-CoV-2, we first characterized the viral replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in VeroE6 cells and compared the signal dynamic range utilizing three approaches. These approaches included luminescent cell viability assay with CellTiterGlo® for evaluation of virus induced-cytopathic effects (CPE), viral load quantitation assay with quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) targeting the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)/ helicase (Hel) genes, and viral nucleocapsid (N) protein expression with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). VeroE6 cells were used because they robustly support SARS-CoV-2 replication [

SARS-CoV-2 infection (MOI = 1.000) caused significant CPE in VeroE6 cells as early as 48 h post-infection (hpi) (

At 72 hpi, prominent CPE were detected in the virus-infected VeroE6 cells even with the lowest MOI of 0.004, while the morphology of the non-infected VeroE6 cells remained intact. This observation was in line with the cell viability determined by using the CellTiter-Glo® substrate, which is a reagent that generates a luminescent signal directly proportional to the amount of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) present and is proportional to the number of metabolically active cells. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B, there was approximately 75 % reduction in cell viability at 48 hpi with MOI of 1.000, 0.250, or 0.063 and at 72 hpi with MOI of 0.016 or 0.004. In the qRT-PCR assay, viral RNA load in the culture supernatant markedly increased by ≥2 logs gene copies per reaction within 24 hpi (∼2 logs for 0.004 MOI, ∼3 logs for 0.016 MOI, and ∼3.5 logs for 0.063, 0.250, and 1.000 MOI) (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C). Regardless of the MOI, the viral RNA load plateaued at 48 hpi. The viral N protein expression followed a delayed but similar pattern as that of the viral RNA load, with the peak viral antigen expression being observed at 72 hpi (
