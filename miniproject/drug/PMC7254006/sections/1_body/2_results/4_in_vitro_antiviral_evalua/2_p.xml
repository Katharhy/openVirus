<p id="par0065">Next, these 19 primary hit drug compounds were subjected to viral load reduction assay for prioritization based on their dose-dependent anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects. Four drug compounds, namely, cetilistat, diiodohydroxyquinoline, abiraterone acetate, and bexarotene were identified as the most potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug compounds using the cut-off of 90 % effective concentrations (EC
 <sub>90</sub>) &lt;10 μM after treating VeroE6 cells with 0.01 MOI of SARS-CoV-2 for 48 h. Using plaque reduction assay, the EC
 <sub>50</sub> of the drug compounds were determined to be 1.13 μM (cetilistat), 1.38μM (diiodohydroxyquinoline), 1.94 μM (abiraterone acetate), and 2.01 μM (bexarotene) (

 <sub>50</sub>) of cetilistat, diiodohydroxyquinoline, abiraterone acetate, and bexarotene were &gt;100 μM, &gt;100 μM, 92.35 μM, and 38.21 μM, respectively (
