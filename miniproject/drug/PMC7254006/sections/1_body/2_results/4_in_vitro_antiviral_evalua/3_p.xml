<p id="par0070">To more clearly demonstrate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of these four identified drug compounds, we included remdesivir as a comparator drug. Similar to remdesivir, treatment with any one of the four drug compounds below the non-toxic drug concentration of 10μM, markedly suppressed SARS-CoV-2-N protein expression (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> ). As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A, all four drug compounds exhibited dose-dependent viral load reduction with magnitudes of 1 log to 3 logs. At 10μM of drug concentration, treatment with cetilistat exhibited about 3 logs reduction at 48 hpi, as comparable level achieved by remdesivir which demonstrated an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.04μM in our study. Similar levels of dose-dependent viral load reduction were observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected Caco2 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma) cell culture supernatants and cell lysates (
 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). In addition to viral load reduction, treatment with any one of these four drug compounds provided cell protection effects. In the CPE inhibition assay, treatment with 10μM of cetilistat completely inhibited CPE development in VeroE6 cells at 72 hpi, while diiodohydroxyquinoline, abiraterone acetate, and bexarotene achieved up to ∼70 % CPE inhibition (
 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C). Overall, these results demonstrated that cetilistat, diiodohydroxyquinoline, abiraterone acetate, and bexarotene inhibited the viral load, viral antigen expression, and infectious viral particle production of SARS-CoV-2, and protected SARS-CoV-2-induced cell damages at comparable levels of remdesivir.
