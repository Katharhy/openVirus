<p id="par0075">To investigate which steps of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle were interrupted by the selected drug compounds, we performed a time-of-drug-addition assay by treating virus-infected VeroE6 cells to each drug compound at different time points, followed by viral titer measurements at 9 hpi, when the first round of progeny virions were detectable in the cell culture supernatant. VeroE6 cells were infected by 0.500 MOI of SARS-CoV-2, before and after which four different treatments were carried out (

Addition of cetilistat, diiodohydroxyquinoline, or abiraterone acetate at 0 hpi and 3 hpi, but not pre-treatment with host cells or during virus adsorption (co-infection) significantly reduced viral replication, suggesting that these three drug compounds disrupted the post-entry events of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle (
 <xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B). In contrast, bexarotene was only effective when co-infected with cells, suggesting that it interfered with virus entry either by blocking the host ACE2 receptor or the viral components required for cell attachment and entry. To further delineate the step of SARS-CoV-2 entry that is affected by bexarotene, VeroE6 cells were placed at 4 °C for 2 h which only permitted virus attachment to the cell surface and then at 37 °C for 1 h which enabled virus internalization (

 <xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>D, bexarotene did not block virus-host receptor binding, but significantly reduced viral load during virus internationalization. These results suggested that bexarotene interfered with SARS-CoV-2 internalization without blocking its binding to the host cell surface. Interestingly, bexarotene also demonstrated antiviral activity against the highly virulent MERS-CoV (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2.12 μM), suggesting that it has the potential of being a “pan-coronavirus” antiviral (
