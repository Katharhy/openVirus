 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the past two decades, three novel human-pathogenic coronaviruses have emerged to cause epidemics of severe respiratory infection among human, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) since 2012, and most recently SARS-CoV-2 since December 2019 [

 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>]. Within just 4 months, the number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, or Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has exceeded the total number of cases of SARS and MERS by nearly 100 times, with more than 1.2 million confirmed cases and over 60,000 deaths globally [
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The clinical severity of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic infection to fatal disease. The disease is usually mild in children, but severe infection in immunocompromised and elderly patients may be associated with a crude case fatality rate of about 15 % [

 <sc>d</sc>-dimer, fibrinogen, lactate dehydrogenase, and inflammatory marker levels [
