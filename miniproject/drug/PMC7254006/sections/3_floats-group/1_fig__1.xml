   <bold>Development of a two-tier system for anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug compound screening.</bold> VeroE6 cells seeded in a 96-well plate were infected with SARS-CoV-2 of various multiplicities of infection (MOIs)) as indicated, followed by phosphate buffered saline (PBS) wash and replacement of fresh Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM). Various time points of data collection were performed for (A) Cytopathic effects (CPE) observed by a bright-field at 20× magnification. (B) Cell viability of each treatment group normalized with that of the mock-infected cells. (C) Cell culture supernatant was collected at the indicated time points with viral copy number determined by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). (D) The supernatant was concomitantly applied for ELISA to measure the SARS-CoV-2-nucleoprotein (NP) protein amount. The experiments were carried out in triplicate. The results are shown as mean ± standard deviation.
