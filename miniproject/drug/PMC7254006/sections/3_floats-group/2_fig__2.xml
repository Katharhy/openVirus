   <bold>Schematic representation of the study design.</bold> Using the newly established two-tier drug compound screening system, an FDA-approved drug compound library consisting 1528 drug compounds was screened for potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. Primary screening by ELISA identified 34 drug compounds with 4-fold reduction in the detection signal. Secondary screening by cell viability assay further selected 19 of the 34 drug compounds that exhibited â‰¥90 % cell viability. Four drug compounds were then prioritized for cytotoxicity and antiviral activity evaluation by plaque reduction and viral load reduction assays.
