   <bold>Anti-SARS-CoV-2 modes of action of the four selected drug compounds.</bold> (A) Time-of-drug-addition assay was performed to determine the steps of the viral replication cycle targeted by each of the four identified drug compounds. The assay was conducted at 37 °C. (B) Viral load in the treated VeroE6 cell culture supernatants normalized by DMSO as control. (C) Virus entry assay with or without bexarotene addition. Viral attachment was performed at 4℃ and then shifted to 37℃ to enable virus internalization. (D) Intracellular viral load in the treated VeroE6 cells normalized by DMSO as control. (E) Viral load reduction assay showing the dose-dependent anti-MERS-CoV activity of bexarotene (10μM). VeroE6 cells were infected with MERS-CoV (MOI = 0.01) and treated with bexarotene, and the culture supernatant was then collected at 48 h post-inoculation for viral load quantitation by qRT-PCR. *P indicates &lt; 0.05 and ** indicates P &lt; 0.01 (Student’s t-test). All the experiments were performed in triplicate and replicated twice. The results are shown as mean ± standard deviations.
