<p id="Par39">One reviewer extracted data from the included studies using standardised forms including information on (1) study characteristics and setting, (2) participants, (3) intervention, (4) type of outcome measures and (5) PEARLES challenges and solutions. A second reviewer checked the extracted data. At the first analysis stage, we coded challenges and solutions according to the PEARLES categories. This showed that although the PEARLES categories were useful for the initial categorisation, there were overlap and interdependencies identified between these categories, especially between political and economic factors and regulatory, logistic and administrative factors and between ethical and social factors. Thus, at the second stage of the analysis, two reviewers identified the sub-themes and actions that emerged under these categories. A risk of bias assessment was not carried out since none of the studies formally evaluated the solutions identified during an epidemic or pandemic. Most of the studies presented challenges encountered while delivering clinical research responses during emerging epidemics and solutions implemented reactively, or solutions identified to address these, without formal evaluation. Lower evidence articles, including opinion pieces, were included to enable capturing the breadth and width of experiences from different settings, to give a voice to research teams delivering clinical research responses in difficult circumstances. Studies covering PEARLES challenges and solutions identified are summarised in the following sections under the interdependent themes that emerged.</p>
