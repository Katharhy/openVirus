<p id="Par56">Our findings highlight the many challenges experienced in the planning, conduct and dissemination of clinical research responses during epidemic and pandemic emergencies and the gap in data on our collective capability to respond globally. Although a range of solutions to address these challenges were identified, we did not identify any studies that formally evaluated these during emergencies. We note the consistency with which key recommendations for change have been made across different outbreak experiences. Recommendations made to mitigate challenges experienced during the response to the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 were not globally implemented, and the same issues were documented again during the Ebola response in 2014 to 2016. Most challenges experienced were similar across outbreaks and settings, with additional challenges due to limited healthcare systems and infrastructure encountered in LMICs, and when initiating multi-site responses. The limited data on our capability to respond to a pandemic in LMICs is another area of concern. These hard-learned lessons need firm commitment and action to build clinical research preparedness for future scenarios [
