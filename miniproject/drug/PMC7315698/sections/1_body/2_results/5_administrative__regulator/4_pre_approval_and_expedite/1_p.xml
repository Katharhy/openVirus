 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] was suggested to address delays in gaining insurance cover for all at-risk populations. An article by Lim et al. presented a trial in ‘hibernation’, with full regulatory approvals in place set up in the UK ready to be activated during a future pandemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Since not all eventualities can be predicted, there is also a need for expedited approval processes for emergencies [

 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). A study by Annane et al. concluded that parallel rather than sequential scientific, financial, regulatory and ethics approval, and preparation of study drugs by local pharmacists would have enabled a multi-centre RCT of corticosteroids in ICU patients with H1N1 influenza pneumonia in France to start 1 month earlier, before the peak ‘flu’ wave [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Expedited reviews need to be balanced against risk for patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. One article found that double ethical review improved the quality of an Ebola protocol and led to better protection of patients due to the complementarity of the reviews [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Ethics committee staff with experience from epidemic research and joint research ethics committees (RECs) with representatives from all affected countries was recommended to facilitate approvals [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. RECs should ensure that protocols are consistent with community values [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], are collaborative and include capacity building [
