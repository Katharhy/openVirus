 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], including refined definitions of what constitutes research under these circumstances [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], acceptable study designs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and simplified consent methods [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] and/or proxy consent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. However, gaining proxy consent was also found to be challenging during emergencies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A qualitative study set in Europe found public support for consent waiver for publicly funded, low-risk studies and routinely collected anonymised biological samples for research, and for advanced or verbal consent models for pandemics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. An interventional Ebola study set in Guinea reported patient preference for verbal consent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. One article highlighted the risks of using non-documented verbal consent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Some, but not all countries, allow research without consent under emergency conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Cook et al. argued that a priori and surrogate consent models may be contrary to the public good for research involving critically ill patients during an emerging pandemic and presented a contextually dependent consent model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There was a consensus on recommendations for equitable access to the best available standard of care regardless of consent to participate [
