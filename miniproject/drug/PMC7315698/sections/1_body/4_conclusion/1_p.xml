<p id="Par60">This systematic scoping review shows that potentially effective measures are not being universally implemented despite a good degree of expert consensus on their likely utility. Clinical research communities globally need to evaluate activities, implement solutions identified during previous emergency responses and rehearse and refine outbreak response plans in inter-epidemic times, in collaboration with other organisations involved in outbreak response. Although there may be examples of additional solutions identified in other regions of the world that were not included in this review, we have shown that there is already a substantial body of literature containing valuable experiences and important recommendations. However, without concerted, global action to act and to evaluate those actions in integrated outbreak response plans globally, we may be destined to encounter the same challenges and read about the same suggested solutions in the future. This would mean missed opportunities to forward knowledge into the clinical management of emerging infectious diseases, improve outcomes and strengthen global health security.</p>
