<p>Phage display has emerged as a very powerful, robust, and effective molecular technique to generate vast libraries containing millions or even billions of different peptides or proteins. It includes batch cloning of DNA encoding for millions of variants of certain ligands (e.g., peptides and proteins or fragments thereof) into the phage genome as part of one of the phage coat proteins (p Ⅲ, p Ⅵ, or p Ⅷ). Exposition of proteins or polypeptides on the surface of phage is achieved by fusion of the coding sequence of one of the coat proteins to the gene of interest, which helps in isolating the specific binding ligands by a series of recursive cycles of selection on antigen or ligand with each cycle comprising of binding, washing, elution, and amplification. Generally, proteins are displayed on phage particle tethered to either minor coat proteins like p Ⅲ or the major coat proteins like p Ⅷ, yet retaining its structure/function. Based on the direct linkage between phenotype and genotype, phage display technology (PDT) provides an expedient approach to study the genetics and functionality of the interacting proteins and peptides [

Following the initial demonstration of peptide display, antibodies were the first functional proteins to be successfully displayed on the phage surface. In a humoral immune response, antibodies serve as antigen-targeting effector molecules. Their unique tetrameric structure consists of two identical light and two identical heavy chains joined together by disulfide bridges and non-covalent interactions. Each chain is comprised of a series of discreet repeats, forming a compactly folded regions of proteins called “antibody domains” (

Antibodies are modular protein defense systems possessing a paratope (variable domain), an antigen-binding site located at the upper tips of the “Y”-shaped structure. These paratopes identify the specific epitope displayed by the antigen and tag the microbe as well as the infected cell to be recognized by the immune system for neutralization. Therefore, these variable domains serve as paradigmatic proteinaceous scaffolds to be expressed on the phage surface for the isolation of novel binders against a myriad of antigens. Phage display of combinatorial antibody libraries is an efficient technique by which monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of a desired specificity can be selected without the use of conventional hybridoma technology [

Their unique maturation process helps them to evolve to be highly specific to viral antigens, opening new horizons in viral disease diagnosis and therapeutics. In the last few decades, the prime focus of the developed recombinant antibodies was targeted towards human medicine, but now the shift in trends towards veterinary medicine seems promising. In spite of skewed research trends towards economically important livestock species such as cows, poultry, sheep, goats, and pigs, there is a vast field of veterinary medicine waiting for the application of mAbs developed through antibody phage display. Furthermore, efficient techniques have been established and optimized to design, build, and manipulate the vast antibody fragment-based libraries in order to derive the antibodies of desired characteristics and affinity. Here, we encompass the progress in this rapidly growing field and discuss its application in finding new diagnostics and therapeutic viral targets in veterinary medicine in association with other complementary technologies.
