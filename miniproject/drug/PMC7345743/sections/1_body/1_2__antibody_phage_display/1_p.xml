<p>An antibody phage library is the collection of antibody variable domains displaying phages with library size 10
 <sup>6</sup>–10
 <sup>11</sup>, depending on the library type, fused to their coat proteins as a result of antibody-variable fragment (gene) cloning. Here, we shall briefly describe the construction of a phagemid-based antibody (scFv and Fab) phage display library from immunized or naïve sources. The basic methodology to build APD library from the V-gene repertoire (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibodies-09-00021-f002">Figure 2</xref>) is almost the same, starting with the extraction of mRNA from B-cells isolated from blood, spleen, tonsils, and tumor tissue samples. Using oligo (dt) primers or random primers, cDNA is synthesized from mRNA through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Defined PCR primer sets, designed on the basis of species consensus sequence and anneal to the conserved region of V-gene families or constant domain, are used to amplify the heavy chain and light chain corresponding region (V

 <sub>L</sub>; V
 <sub>H</sub>, C
 <sub>H</sub>, V
 <sub>L</sub> and C
 <sub>L</sub>, respectively) genes within a given immunoglobulin repertoire from cDNA pools, thus revealing the all antibody specificities in a particular individual [

 <sub>L</sub> and V
 <sub>H</sub>-C
 <sub>H</sub> and V
 <sub>L</sub>-C
 <sub>L</sub> gene fragments are ligated in a suitable phagemid for single-chain variable fragment (scFv) and Fab library generation, respectively. In the case of synthetic antibody phage libraries, the initial few steps are not needed, and library diversity is increased through the precise introduction of degenerate DNA into CDR encoding regions, thus rivaling or exceeding than that of natural immune repertoire [
