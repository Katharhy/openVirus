<p>Now, this antibody phage library is ready to pan against the antigen of choice. By using this methodology, antibody phage libraries of different antibody formats have been successfully constructed, such as Fab (antigen-binding fragment), Fv (variable fragment), scFv (single-chain variable fragment), and its modifications [

 <xref rid="B10-antibodies-09-00021" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] diabodies, and other oligomers [

 <xref rid="B12-antibodies-09-00021" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The science of selection of high-affinity clones is as important as the generation of large, diverse, and more rational antibody libraries. Antigen-specific clones, phages displaying antibody fragments, are screened and enriched from antibody libraries through an iterative process based on interaction affinity, avidity, and binding kinetics between the expressed antibody fragment and the antigen of interest called biopanning. It includes recursive cycles of pooling of antibody displaying phages, incubation with antigen, removal of unbound phages (washing), elution of bound phages, re-amplification in F

 <sup>11</sup> variants and also isolation and characterization of high-affinity binders with a frequency as low as 1 in 10
 <sup>6</sup> by mimicking the same process by which immune system selects antibodies against a specific antigen through affinity maturation. A strong combination of interactive affinity selection and biological amplification controls the overall strength of the biopanning procedure. There are various types of biopanning strategies in practice, but selecting only one is very much dependent on the nature, functionality, and native environment of the antigen. The choice of screening method can directly influence the antibody phage output number and diversity among selected clones. Therefore, it should be adapted to fit the respective class of antigen [

On the other hand, membrane-associated proteins, possessing hydrophobic domains, account for 20%–30% of all protein in living entities, thus presenting themselves as desirable targets for APD in order to obtain novel mAbs for research, diagnostic, and therapeutic purposes [
 <xref rid="B21-antibodies-09-00021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Direct panning on whole cells, displaying the complex target antigen on their surface, alongside existing ligand guided “pathfinder” biopanning strategy, has proven to be a reasonable modality in selecting high-affinity antibody clones against membrane proteins [

 <xref rid="B23-antibodies-09-00021" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Alternatively, detergent micelles and nanodiscs have evolved as an interesting substitute for membrane protein expression for the isolation of novel antibody binders [

 <xref rid="B27-antibodies-09-00021" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In recent times, virus-like particles (VLPs) have emerged as an interesting platform allowing multivalent display of membrane proteins and are yet to be explored for the screening of novel binders against membrane target proteins [
 <xref rid="B28-antibodies-09-00021" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In spite of this progress in membrane protein expression for the pursuit of new antiviral targets, mechanistic linkages between a protein’s conformational transitions and its function pose a significant challenge.
