<p>The performance of an antibody library is directly linked to its quality. The salient features governing the library quality control include (a) the number of clones with phagemids harboring the insert, i.e., scFv or Fab, (b) the number of clones expressing phages carrying inserts, and (c) the number of clones capable of soluble expression of inserts. The key parameter of an antibody libraryâ€™s quality is its complexity, also called diversity. It is an estimate of distinct elements in that collection. It directly reflects the probability of screening an antibody clone from the library against a given antigen, of sufficiently higher affinity. Theoretically, the probability of finding a functional antibody against a given antigen is higher in large complex or more diverse libraries than in a less complex or diverse library. It is approximated by the transformation efficiency of the bacteria used to amplify the library. Despite the simplicity and significance of this concept, the accurate and reliable quantification of this prime feature was not possible and is still lacking [

PCR screening of individual clones to determine the presence of insert, dot plot analysis to detect both antibody fragment displaying phages, and soluble antibody fragment synthesized by the screened clones, and further characterization of the few hundred positive clones through DNA fingerprinting and sequencing are still considered standard practices [
