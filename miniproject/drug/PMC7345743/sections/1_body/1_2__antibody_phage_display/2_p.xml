<p>The engineered phagemids are transformed into suitable bacteria (e.g., XL1-Blue, TG1, and ER2537), providing a suitable environment for recombination of antibody fragments [
 <xref rid="B6-antibodies-09-00021" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For rescuing the recombinant phagemid harboring the gene of inserts like Fab or scFv, the transformed bacteria are infected with helper phages like VCSM13 or M13KO7. These phages belong to the M13 class of bacteriophages and are well-adapted for the exposition of antibody-variable scaffolds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibodies-09-00021-f003">Figure 3</xref>). This results in a library of phages, where each phage is expressing a unique antibody fragment on its surface as a phenotype while possessing the vector with specific nucleotide sequences within as respective genotypes [
