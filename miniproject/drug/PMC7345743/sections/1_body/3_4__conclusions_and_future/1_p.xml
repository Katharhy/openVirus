<p>The inherent potential of combinatorial libraries gives researchers unprecedented control over the expression of the acquired immune system. To date, the prime focus of rAbs has been in veterinary diagnostic applications, ignoring the utilization of their immense therapeutic and immunoprophylactic potential. The diagnostic potential of these monoclonal antibodies is well appreciated, but their therapeutic application against infectious diseases is still a challenge. Although the evolution of antibody engineering has led to highly tailored antibodies with improved pharmacokinetic properties, yet experimental therapeutics remains challenging. For example, the advantages associated with scFv account are a curse in disguise rather than a blessing and render it undesirable for therapeutic application. Small size, low in vivo half-life, rapid clearance, and low stability are the hurdles in the therapeutic avenue. Nevertheless, PEGylation and conjugation of scFv with certain drugs and toxins have circumvented some of the issues for their therapeutic application, but a lot still has to be done. Furthermore, only a few rAb forms have been elucidated in veterinary medicine such as scFv and VHH, while the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of other forms is yet to be explored. In vaccinology, vectored-based scFv delivery for in vivo expression has come out as an effective strategy to sustain the level of antibody fragments in the body. Furthermore, broadly neutralizing antibodies against viral diseases alongside in vivo scFv delivery systems have paved a new avenue of functional reagents, making them more relevant in therapeutics [

Additionally, advancements in the targeted delivery of rAbs to various novel compartments of the animal body such as the gut, brain, or to the intracellular cytosolic compartment could certainly have a huge impact on the efficacy of antibody therapeutics [

In the veterinary field, these are just a few examples of implementation of APD, while the vast diagnostic and therapeutic potential of diverse antibody repertoire amongst different species is yet to be explored in relation to the animal diseases. Furthermore, the vast scope of APD technology also encompasses the other areas of immunovirology, such as understanding the pathogenesis of viral infections and their contributing factors. With every passing day, the implementation of this incredible technique is opening new dimensions in immunovirology in terms of pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapeutics.
