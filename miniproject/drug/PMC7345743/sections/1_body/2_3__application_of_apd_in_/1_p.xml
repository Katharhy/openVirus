<p>Immunovirology, also called viral immunology, encompasses the evolution of the immune system as a result of its interaction with viruses. In 1996, Zinkernagel published an article titled “Immunology taught by viruses”, explaining this incredible interaction between viruses and the immune system [

Despite the fact that previously, human medicine was the focal point of recombinant antibodies development through antibody phage display, recent advancements in veterinary medicine are promising. In the field of veterinary medicine, the impact of viral infections on animal welfare and health cannot be neglected. Major strides have been taken in veterinary diagnostics. Here, we review the application of phage-display-derived antibodies in veterinary viral diagnosis, therapeutics, and immunoprophylaxis. These antibodies are also described in
