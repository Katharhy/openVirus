<p>In pig farming, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is considered a highly dangerous infectious agent that causes watery diarrhea, vomiting, and ultimately dehydration in pigs. Notably, in piglets, a 100% mortality rate has been observed post-TGEV infection. Recently, a porcine scFv antibody has been identified and characterized, having in vitro TGEV neutralizing ability. The therapeutic potential of this novel binder is promising in the control of porcine viral gastroenteritis [
