<p>Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a significant cattle pathogen, inflicting huge economic losses to the livestock industry worldwide. It causes a complex syndrome involving multiple body organs. The sign and symptoms include diarrhea, pneumo-gastroenteritis, abortion, stillbirth, and births of persistently infected calves. To combat this infectious virus, it is imperative to establish novel antivirals to mitigate the devastating economic impinge of this disease in the cattle industry. In this scenario, BVDB NS5B-specific nanobody was obtained through phage display, which is capable of significantly suppressing in vitro BVDV replication. It has demonstrated a promising potential to be an effective anti-BVDV agent [

Furthermore, in a separate study, a specific nanobody was developed against the E2 protein of BDVD, a protein involved in viral pathogenesis and capable of producing neutralizing antibodies. The efficient binding alongside in vitro neutralization ability makes this anti-E2 nanobody a promising therapeutic candidate in controlling BVDV infection worldwide [
