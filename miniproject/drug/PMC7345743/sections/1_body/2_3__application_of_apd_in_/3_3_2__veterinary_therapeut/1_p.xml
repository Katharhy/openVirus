<p>The role of rAbs in veterinary therapeutics is very limited, indicating the need for its expansion by finding new clones capable of targeting viral disease. Mostly in the poultry sector, the therapeutic application of rAbs is considered economically impractical. A prevention strategy against influenza viral infection has been tested by using recombinant adenovirus expressing neutralizing VHH in mice models. An initial study has shown promising results, with a 90%â€“100% survival rate in lethally challenged mice [

Recently, anti-DHAV-1 scFv has been obtained from a murine antibody repertoire, which harbors the ability to neutralize DHAV-1 by targeting its VP3 protein. The scFv has shown promising therapeutic effects against duck viral hepatitis, a highly infectious disease of ducks with a mortality rate of up to 100% [
