<p>In horses, the western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) and the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) are zoonotic viruses, constantly posing a threat of widespread equine and human epidemics. In early infection of VEEV and WEEV, viral detection is considered as an indicator for the implementation of appropriate prophylaxis such as vaccination to decrease the severity and rapid transmission of the disease. In the pursuit of the ideal detection tools, excavation of murine antibody repertoire has resulted in the isolation of novel scFv, having extensive applications in immunoassays, immunohistochemistry, and radio-immunodiagnostics [
