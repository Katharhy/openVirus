<p>In sheep, the Maedi-visna virus (MVV), an enveloped non-oncogenic RNA virus, causes a complex syndrome characterized by encephalomyelitis, arthritis, and pneumonitis. Antibody phage display was applied to the synthetic human scFv Griffin.1 library for the isolation of a high-affinity scFv antibody against capsid protein and conserved principal immunodominant domain of transmembrane protein gp46 protein in two separate studies. These scFvs have been proven to be efficient research and diagnostic tools in MVV control programs [
