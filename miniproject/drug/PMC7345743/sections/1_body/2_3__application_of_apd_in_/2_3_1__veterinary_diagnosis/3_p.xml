<p>In pigs, the initial pursuit for new diagnostic tools using recombinant Abs (rAbs) has focused on porcine circovirus type II (PVC2) and classical swine fever. A nanobody (VHH) was obtained from camel immunized with a commercial PVC2 vaccine through APD. The fusion of this VHH with alkaline phosphatase has proved to be an added value in PVC2 diagnosis without any cross-reactivity to PVC1 and porcine reproductive and sensitivity virus (PRRSV) [

Recently, the swine influenza virus (SIV) and PEDV have gained a lot of attention for generating novel binders of diagnostic value through phage display. SIV is a significant pathogen posing serious challenges to swine production. Due to the limitations associated with previous diagnostics tools of SIV infection such as subjectivity, high cost, and lack of suitability on a large scale, VHH was developed through phage display against the conserved nucleoprotein of SIV offering applications in a wide range of immunoassays for SIV diagnosis [

Similarly, in two separate studies, VHHs were isolated against different target antigens of PEDV, enabling its rapid and sensitive clinical detection. These antibodies are of great added value in the success of the ongoing PEDV control program. PEDV causes huge production losses to the pork industry through a fatal diarrheal disease infecting mainly neonatal and post-weaning piglets [
