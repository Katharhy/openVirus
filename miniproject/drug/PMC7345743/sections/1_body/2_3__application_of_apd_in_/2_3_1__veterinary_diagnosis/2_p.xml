<p>In the dairy and beef industry, foot and mouth disease (FMD) is considered the most devastating viral disease caused by foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), inflicting huge economic losses. There are seven serotypes of FMDV, including O, A, C, Asia 1, SAT 1, SAT 2, and SAT 3. New control programs have adopted a combined strategy of exclusion, slaughter, and vaccination. However, the success rate depends upon accurate and reliable differentiation between vaccinated and infected animals. Previously through phage display, murine scFv was isolated against FMDV type O, but it lacked the diagnostics potential in differentiating infected from vaccinated animals [

In the case of the bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV), murine recombinant antibody in scFv format was generated and showed potential as a detection tool in competitive inhibition ELISA for serological detection of BIV infection in bovines [
