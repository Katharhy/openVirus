<p>By using the inherent selection potential of antibody phage display, murine scFv capable of recognizing the avian influenza virus (AIV) was isolated and evaluated through ELISA. It showed higher sensitivity and specificity as compared to the previously established protocols [
 <xref rid="B35-antibodies-09-00021" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. An antibody repertoire of llamas immunized with purified nucleoprotein (AIV-NP) of AIV yielded a novel nanobody (VHH). This VHH led to the development of a lateral flow assay for the rapid detection of AIV [

Mining of the rabbit antibody repertoire through antibody phage display yielded a novel scFv capable of targeting a conserved motif in the C-terminal of the F2 protein of Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV). This scFv has exceptional diagnostic applications, ensuring rapid pathotyping of NDV isolates [

This protein is involved in viral RNA replication and transcription, thus presents itself as a potential diagnostic target in control of NDV. An isolated scFv showed higher specificity for NDV-P by ELISA and Western blot [

Due to a variety of IBDV strains, it was always difficult to distinguish between very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV), classical, variant, and vaccine strains. Sapats and colleagues (2006) isolated a single-chain variable fragment, which efficiently recognizes a highly conformational epitope of VP2 protein of vvIBDV. The efficacy of this mAb in distinguishing vvIBDV from other strains makes it ideal for diagnostic tests like ELISA [

One of the biggest challenges faced by this industry is duck viral hepatitis (DVH) caused by duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV). It is characterized into three serotypes, namely, DHAV-1, DHAV-2, and DHAV-3. Out of these serotypes, DHAV-1 is the most virulent, causing significant widespread losses to this growing industry. Through phage display, a novel nanobody has been isolated after the screening of the camelids antibody repertoire, targeting the VP1 protein of DHAV-1. This nanobody has wide applications in the development of immunoassays for the DHAV-1 diagnosis, such as ELISA [
