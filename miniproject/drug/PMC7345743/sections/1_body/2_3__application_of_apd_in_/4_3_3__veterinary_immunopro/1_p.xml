<p>In terms of FMDV prophylactic measure, initial clinical trials of the in vivo application of nanobody-based drugs have shown promising results in guinea pigs, providing them with partial protection against FMDV type O [

Passive immunization of pigs with a mixture of two novel nanobodies provided them with complete rapid protection from a FMDV challenge, thus improving the FMD immunoprophylactic program [
 <xref rid="B69-antibodies-09-00021" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Until now, the high level of serotype specificity of these nanobodies renders them exclusive to pigs, thus limiting their application to other species. Furthermore, passive immunization of piglets with anti-PEDV scFv screened from a porcine antibody repertoire has demonstrated encouraging results by providing them complete protection form PEDV infection [
