  <p>Synthesis and cloning of scFv and Fab fragments in a phagemid vector. It starts with the preparation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using density gradient from whole blood. Following RNA extraction from PBMCs, cDNA is synthesized through reverse transcription. From cDNA, the variable region of heavy (VH) and light chain (VL) is amplified through PCR using specific primers. scFv and Fab are constructed through splicing by overlap extension PCR(SOE-PCR). The amplified scFv and Fab are ligated into the phagemid vector following restriction digestion of both.</p>
