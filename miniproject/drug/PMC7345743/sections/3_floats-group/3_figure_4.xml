  <p>Panning of an antibody phage display library for the generation of high-affinity antibodies. The antigen is presented in its native form either immobilized on a plastic surface or expressed on the cell surface. For membrane protein targets, nanodisc provides a membrane-like environment. Antibody library displaying phages are incubated with antigen, and non-bound or weakly bound phages are removed by washing. The tightly bound phages are recovered by elution via trypsin or pH shift for the re-infection of 
   <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. Following the coinfection with helper phages, new phage particles are produced for usage in subsequent rounds of panning. This cycle continues for 3â€“4 rounds, leading to enrichment of binders.
