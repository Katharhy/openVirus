<p id="p0045">Etoposide is a topoisomerase II inhibitor. It has been shown, in a murine model of HLH, that its therapeutic mechanism involved potent deletion of activated T cells and efficient suppression of inflammatory cytokine production. This was a remarkably selective effect; no direct anti-inflammatory effect on macrophages or dendritic cells was observed and no deletion of quiescent naive or memory T cells
