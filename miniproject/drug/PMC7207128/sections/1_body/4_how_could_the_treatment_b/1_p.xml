<p id="p0050">The HLH Steering Committee of the Histiocyte Society recommends the HLH-94 protocol as standard of care for infection-Associated HLH 
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The suggested therapy for patients with viral infections and severe sHLH is the use of the combination of etoposide and dexamethasone for eight weeks. Age-adjusted doses of Etoposide are administered once a week with weekly decisions on whether to continue etoposide treatment or not, following the clinical and laboratory response of the patient. Dexamethasone is administered daily starting with 10Â mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> during the first week then the dose will half decrease every week. It is important to keep antivirals and to provide supportive care: broad-spectrum antibiotics, antimycotic and gastric protection
