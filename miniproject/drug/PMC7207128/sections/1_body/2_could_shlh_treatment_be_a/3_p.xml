<p id="p0040">Etoposide is an ancient cytotoxic agent with predictable side effects that can be symptomatically treated. It may also induce secondary malignancies especially acute myeloid leukaemia. This risk is estimated at 0.3â€“0.4% 
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However, we think that it can be balanced by the risk of mortality and of neurological sequelae in severe forms of COVID-19. It would be possible also to propose this treatment to COVID-19 patients who are already suffering from a cancer. This may at least reduce the mortality in this fragile sub-group. Additionally, it should be noticed that Etoposide is a widely used and a relatively cheap medication. Hence, we think that it should be tested in moderately severe to severe cases of COVID-19 especially since the pandemic is rapidly progressing with a non-neglectable mortality.
