<p id="p0015">The development of ARDS in COVID-19 is associated to the upregulation of many pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines: interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), inducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α, and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This up-regulation is the main characteristic of Cytokines Storm Syndromes (CSS). The CSSs are associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) which can be primary or familial (pHLH) or secondary, acquired or reactive (sHLH) 
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The sHLH, occurring frequently after an infection, are life-threatening syndromes of extreme immune activation leading to a multiorgan failure and a severe hypercytokinaemia 
 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The revised criteria for HLH diagnosis include fever, splenomegaly, bicytopenia, hypertriglyceridaemia or hypofibrinogenaemia (or both), haemophagocytosis, ferritin ≥500 µg/L, low NK cell activity, and soluble IL-2 receptor ≥2400 U/mL). Five of the eight criteria in total are needed to make a diagnosis of HLH (

 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The latter cells may be haemophagocytes.
