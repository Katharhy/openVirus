<p id="p0025">Clinical and laboratory findings in HLH can be explained by the rise of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the organ infiltration by activated lymphocytes and histiocytes, and the hypofibrinogenemia resulting from increased plasminogen activator expressed by activated macrophages 
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. We can notice that many of these findings have been described in patients with severe COVID-19 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Besides, it was described that the median time from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to ARDS is 9.0 days (8.0â€“14.0) 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This is consistent with observations made in the context of HLH development during H1N1 infection 
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Hence, there are accumulating elements suggesting that moderately severe to severe COVID-19 might be a form of sHLH.
