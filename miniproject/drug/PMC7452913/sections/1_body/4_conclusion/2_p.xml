<p id="p0145">The 
 <italic>in silico</italic> models of Nsp13 helicase and Nsp14 protein were deciphered using comparative homology approach and were further used for structure-based identification of inhibitors from a set of FDA approved antiviral drugs. Three potential inhibitors- Simeprevir (SMV), Paritaprevir (PTV) and Grazoprevir (GZR) were identified which show dual inhibition potential against NTPase function of Nsp13 helicase enzyme and N7-MTase activity of Nsp14 protein.
