 <italic>in silico</italic> model structures was optimized using GROMOS96 43 B1 force field and the energy of the final Nsp13 helicase and Nsp14 model structure was found to be −23,828.428 kJ/mol and −19,511.188 kJ/mol respectively. The structures of the models were validated using different parameters such as Ramachandran plot, ERRAT values, Verify_3D scores, knowledge-based energy and 
 <italic>Z</italic>-scores with their respective target proteins. The Ramachandran plot which evaluates the stereochemistry of the protein by analysing the distribution of backbone dihedral angles (phi and psi) of each amino acid residues (
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Gurung and Bhattacharjee, 2017</xref>) shows that the total number of residues in most favoured regions for Nsp13 helicase and its template was 450 (83.8%) and 398 (75.0%) respectively and the corresponding number of residues in disallowed regions were 6 (1.1%) and 7 (1.3%) respectively (Suppl. Fig. 4A–B, Suppl. Table 3). In case of Nsp14 and its template, the total number of residues in most favoured regions were 422 (90%) and 421 (92.5%) respectively and no residues were found in disallowed regions (Suppl. Fig. 4C–D, Suppl. Table 4). The ERRAT (overall quality factor) values which give statistics of non-bonded interactions between different atom types were found to be 68.2968 and 69.3333 for Nsp13 helicase and its template respectively (Suppl. Fig. 5A–B). In the case of Nsp14 and its template, the ERRAT scores were found to be 63.1068 and 64.3021 respectively (Suppl. Fig. 5C–D). The Verify_3D scores which determine the compatibility of 3D structure with its amino acid sequence were 89.52% and 81.49% of the residues with averaged 3D-1D score ≥ 0 for Nsp13 helicase and its template respectively (Suppl. Fig. 6A–B) whereas Nsp14 and its template have Verify_3D scores of 88.24% and 77.24% respectively (Suppl. Fig. 6C–D). The conformational knowledge-based energy was found to be negative for Nsp13 helicase and template structure across the sequence length except for a small region near the C terminal region where slightly higher energy for the template was observed as compared to the model structure (Suppl. Fig. 7A–B). Similarly, the knowledge-based energy for Nsp14 and template structure was found to be negative throughout the sequence except for a slightly higher energy peak at the N terminal and near the C-terminal region of the template structure (Suppl. Fig. 7C–D). The 
 <italic>Z</italic>-score measures the deviation of the total energy of the protein structure concerning an energy distribution of their random conformation and is an indicator of the overall quality of a model structure (

 <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Sippl, 1993</xref>). The Z-score values for Nsp13 helicase and its template were calculated to be −8.78 and −8.33 respectively (Suppl. Fig. 8A–B) and in case of Nsp14 and its template, the Z-score values were − 8.85 and −8.82 respectively which are within the optimum range of native proteins (Suppl. Fig. 8C–D).
