<p id="p0105">The number of predicted transmembrane helices (TMHs) in Nsp13 helicase and Nsp14 was found to be none and the expected number of amino acids in TMHs were found to be 0.0107 and 0.79382 for Nsp13 helicase and Nsp14 respectively (Suppl. Fig. 2Aâ€“B, Suppl. Table 2). The expected number of amino acids in TMHs in the first 60 amino acids were 0.00055 and 0.00095 for Nsp13 helicase and nsp14 respectively. The total probability that the N-terminus is on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane was found to be 0.00101 and 0.00313 for Nsp13 helicase and Nsp14 respectively. The topology of both the proteins was predicted to be outside which indicates that there are no transmembrane helices in both the target proteins.</p>
