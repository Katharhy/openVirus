<p id="p0125">The 
 <italic>in silico</italic> model of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 helicase obtained in this study has a three-dimensional structure similar to that of MERS- and SARS-CoV with a typical triangular pyramidal geometry with five domains-ZBD, stalk, 1B, 1A and 2A domain (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). The structural superposition between Nsp13 helicase and template yields an RMSD value of 0.259 Å and structure-based sequence percent identity of 99.83 between 594 pruned atom pairs with alignment showing (

 <italic>in silico</italic> model structure of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14 with the two domains-ExoN and N7-MTase domain along with the ligand-binding pocket is shown in 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A. An RMSD value of 0.380 Å and structure-based sequence percent identity of 94.94 between 513 pruned atom pairs was obtained when Nsp14 is superimposed on the template structure (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B–C). The low RMSD values of the model structures indicate that they are very similar to the template proteins.
