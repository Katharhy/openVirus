<p id="p0130">A set of 54 FDA approved antiviral drugs were used for virtual screening in the present study (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Four standard inhibitors of Nsp13 helicase enzyme was also docked with the target enzyme to benchmark the binding energy scores of other compounds. The NTPase binding pocket of Nsp13 helicase was used for docking the antiviral drugs. The standard inhibitors-SSYA10-001, SSYA10-002, Myricetin and Scutellarin scored binding energies of −7.44 kcal/mol, −8.16 kcal/mol, −6.91 kcal/mol and −7.05 kcal/mol respectively and their corresponding inhibition constants values were found to be 3.50 μM, 1.05 μM, 8.56 μM and 6.84 μM (
 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> ). SSYA10-001, SSYA10-002, Myricetin and Scutellarin are potent inhibitors with previously reported to inhibit SARS-CoV Nsp13 helicase activity with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values of 6 μM, 20 μM, 2.71 μM and 0.86 μM respectively (

 <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). Three lead molecules-Simeprevir (SMV), Paritaprevir (PTV) and Grazoprevir (GZR) for SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 helicase enzyme were identified by screening of FDA approved antiviral drugs. The binding modes of the lead molecules and control inhibitors within the active site pocket of Nsp13 helicase enzyme are represented in 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> . SMV was found to be the best-docked molecule with a binding energy of −10.42 kcal/mol and inhibition constant of 23.0 nM. The SMV-helicase enzyme complex was stabilized by five hydrogen bonds with residues-Ser310, Arg443, Asp534, Gly538 and Arg567 and hydrophobic interactions with Arg178, Pro284, Gly285, Thr286, Lys288, Ser289, Ala312, Ala313, Ala316, Glu375, Met378, Gln404, Ser535, Gln537 and Ser539 (Suppl. Fig. 9A). PTV is the second-best lead molecule which binds with Nsp13 helicase with a binding energy of −9.70 kcal/mol and exhibited inhibition constant of 78.25 nM. The molecular interaction between PTV and the target enzyme include two hydrogen bonds with Thr286, Gly287 and Ser289 and hydrophobic interactions with Gly285, Lys288, His290, Ala312, Ala313, Ala316, Leu317, Lys320, Asp374, Arg442, Gln537, Gly538, Ser539 and Glu540 (Suppl. Fig. 9B). The third best lead molecule for Nsp13 helicase enzyme was identified to be GZR which interacts with the target with a binding energy of −9.15 kcal/mol and exhibits inhibition constant value of 172.33 nM. GZR is bound within the enzyme pocket using five hydrogen bonds with Thr286, Lys288, Gln404, Gly538 and Glu540 and the complex is further stabilized by hydrophobic interactions contributed by residues such as Pro284, Gly285, Gly287, Ser289, His290, Ala313, Ala316, Asp374, Arg443, Arg442, Gln537, Ser539 and Arg567 (Suppl. Fig. 9C). The binding mode of the most potent inhibitor, Scutellarin reveals eight hydrogen bonds with residues-Gly285, Lys288, Gln404, Gln537, Arg553 and Arg567 and seven residues- Pro284, Thr286, Ser289, Ala316, Arg442, Gly538 and Glu540 contributes towards hydrophobic interactions (Suppl. Fig. 9D).
