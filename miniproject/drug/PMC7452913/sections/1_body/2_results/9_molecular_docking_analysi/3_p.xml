<p id="p0135">Similarly, 54 approved drugs along with the control inhibitor were docked within the N7-MTase domain ligand binding sites of Nsp14 protein and the docking results of the top 3 leads and control are summarized in 
 <xref rid="t0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> . The top-ranked lead compounds identified through virtual screening of FDA approved drugs were PTV, SMV and GZR which binds to the target protein with binding energy of −13.29 kcal/mol, −13.26 kcal/mol and −12.16 kcal/mol. The inhibition constants of PTV, SMV and GZR were 181.23 pM, 190.01 pM and 1.22 nM respectively. The binding conformations of the lead molecules along with the control inhibitor within the active site pocket of Nsp14 protein are illustrated through 
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> . The complex between PTV and Nsp14 is stabilized by three hydrogen bonds with residues Arg289 and His427 and hydrophobic interactions 
 <italic>via</italic> residues- Tyr260, Val287, Gly333, Pro335, Asp352, Ala353, Leu366, Phe367, Tyr368, Asn386, Cys387, Asn388, Val389, Phe401, Tyr420, Phe426, Thr428, Pro429 and Phe506 (Suppl. Fig. 10A). SMV interacts with its target protein through only hydrophobic interactions with residues Arg289, Val290, Trp292, Ile305, Asn306, Cys309, Arg310, Gln313, Gly333, Pro335, Asp352, Ala353, Gln354, Trp385, Asn386, Cys387, Asn388, Tyr420, Asn422, Phe426, His427, Thr428 and Phe506 (Suppl. Fig. 10B). The third lead compound-GZR establishes one hydrogen bond with Asn388 and the interaction with the protein is further stabilized through hydrophobic interactions with residues- Arg289, Val290, Trp292, Arg310, Ile332, Gly333, Lys336, Asp352, Ala353, Gln354, Leu366, Tyr368, Asn386, Cys387, Ile338, Phe401, Tyr420, Phe426, His427 and Thr428 (Suppl. Fig. 10C). The control, Sinefungin (SF) binds to Nsp14 protein with a binding energy of −6.73 kcal/mol and exhibits inhibition constant of 11.72 μM. The molecular binding is mediated through six hydrogen bonds with residues- Asp352, Ala353, Asn388, and His427 and hydrophobic interactions with residues-Val290, Asn386, Tyr420, Phe426, Thr428, Pro429 and Phe506 (Suppl. Fig. 10D). It is to be noted that SF has been previously reported to inhibit SARS-CoV N7-MTase activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 500 nM (
