<p id="p0095">The sequences of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 helicase and Nsp14 protein were evaluated for homology against human proteome. No significant-high similar hit was obtained for Nsp13 helicase and the nearest homologous protein was found to be Zinc Finger GRF-Type Containing 1 (ZGRF1) isoform X10 which shows low identity (22.41%) in the DNA2 superfamily domain and low query coverage (34%) with the query protein (Suppl. Fig. 1A). The blast results of Nsp14 did not show any significant hits (Suppl. Fig. 1B). Thus, both Nsp13 helicase and Nsp14 protein can be targeted with small-molecule inhibitors which are highly likely to show minimum cross-reactivity with the human proteins.</p>
