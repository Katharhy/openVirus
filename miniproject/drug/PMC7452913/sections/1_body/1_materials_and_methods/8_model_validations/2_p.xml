<p id="p0070">The quality of the model structures was evaluated by comparing Ramachandran plot (checks the stereochemical quality of a protein structure), ERRAT score (evaluates the statistics of non-bonded interactions between different atom types), Verify 3D score (analyses the compatibility of an atomic 3D model with its own amino acid sequence) and ProSA knowledge-based energy plot (the plot evaluates model quality by plotting energies as a function of amino acid sequence position) and 
 <italic>Z</italic>-score (indicates the overall model quality) with their respective template structures. The first three parameters were calculated using Structure Analysis and Verification Server (SAVES) version 5.0 (
