<p id="p0045">The sequences of the target proteins were analysed for homology against the human proteome using standard protein basic local alignment search tool (BLASTp) (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi" id="ir0010" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi</ext-link>). The BLAST parameters include- maximum target sequences of 100, word size of 6, expect (E) threshold value of 10 and BLOSUM62 as a substitution scoring matrix. The database was set as “non-redundant protein sequence (nr)” and the organism as “
