<p id="p0065">Due to the absence of the three-dimensional structure of SARS-CoV-2 helicase and Nsp14 in protein data bank (PDB), their structure models were deciphered using a comparative homology modelling approach. Suitable template structures were identified by performing protein BLAST using the SARS-CoV-2 as query protein against PDB database. The template showing ≥95% of similarity to the query protein with 100% query coverage was selected for homology modelling studies. The structure of the template was extracted from protein data bank. The 
 <italic>in silico</italic> model structures of Nsp13 helicase and Nsp14 were generated using MODELLER 9.22 program (

 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Fiser and Šali, 2003</xref>). A total of five 
 <italic>in silico</italic> models for each target was build and the structures were saved in PDB format. The conformations of loop regions in model structures were predicted using an 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> method implemented in MODELLER program. The predicted structures were ranked according to MOLPDF value, DOPE score and GA341 score. The best structure was selected having both the lowest MOLPDF and DOPE scores and GA341 score close to 1. The structure was optimized further by energy minimization
