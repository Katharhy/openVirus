  <p>(A) 
   <italic>In silico</italic> model structure of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 helicase enzyme showing five domains in ribbons - ZBD: 1–99 residues (turquoise), Stalk: 100–149 residues (yellow), 1B: 150–260 residues (orchid), 1A: 261–441 residues (light green) and 2A: 442–596 residues (light blue). The NTPase active site (grey spheres) is composed of six residues-Lys288, Ser289, Asp374, Glu375, Gln404 and Arg567. (B) Superposition of the silico model structure of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 helicase enzyme (cyan) with the template (tan) (C) pairwise sequence alignment between SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 and the template protein with identical residues represented by white characters inside the red box. The secondary elements such as α-helices and 3
   <sub>10</sub>-helices (η) are rendered as coils whereas β-strands, strict β-turns and strict α-turns are represented by arrows, TT letters and TTT letters respectively. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
