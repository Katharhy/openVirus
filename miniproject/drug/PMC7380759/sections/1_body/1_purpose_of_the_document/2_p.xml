<p>Governments across the world have surveillance programs in place, although their strengths, usefulness and relevance in the current crisis may be debatable. The Government of India also runs an Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP), a disease surveillance scheme under the Ministry of Health and Family Affairs in India, to strengthen disease surveillance for infectious diseases and to detect and respond to outbreaks quickly.[
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The scheme, at present, is being run through a Central Disease Surveillance Unit and State Surveillance Units where data are collected and analyzed. A large amount of data collected on disease reports can identify the outbreak of a disease, identify its causes and take corresponding preventive and responsive measures. However, like surveillance programs running in other countries, IDSP has been found wanting on many occasions primarily for its lack of being an intensely monitored program and its inability to detect cases at a time when the disease would not have already caused sufficient damage to the health of people and before any control measure could be initiated.
