<p>The committee understood that the development of some core domains fulfilling the objectives outlined is mandated to help plan better. Therefore, the implementation of the policy will be structured around four core domains, which are both complementary and mutually reinforcing. Implementation of strategies broadly to attain the objectives outlined may take the form of multiple capacity development actions. All of these can be taken at one point in time or by adopting a more incremental approach that includes a mix of technical and cross-cutting measures that may be both short- and long-term in nature.</p>
