<p>In this type of crisis (Covid-19), we will need our experts to speak to us continuously, almost every day to keep us well informed and to allay fear and panic. Similarly the political class, like they are doing in the current crisis, must continue to take a hard look at the costs and benefits of various interventions being tested and advocated.

The most obvious role of financial interest has been seen to be in selecting outflow of information regarding the epidemics. As also, financial interests exert a powerful influence on laws and policies that address the risk factors governing epidemics.</p>
