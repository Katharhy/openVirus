<p id="p0065">At first, the Mpro from COVID-19 was compared with SARS and MERS CoVs (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). Comparing COVID-19 Mpro with SARS Mpro (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A) and MERS CoV Mpro (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B) revealed high degree of conservation between COVID-19 and SARS CoV Mpros and little number of different residues. However, MERS CoV Mpro showed large number of differences and low conservation with COVID-19 Mpro. This was evidenced by the phylogenetic relations (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C), which showed close relation of SARS and COVID-19 Mpros and distant relation to MERS CoV.
