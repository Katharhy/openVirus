<p id="p0110">In conclusion, molecular modeling tools were used to compare the Mpro of the recently evolved COVID-19 and the previous two coronavirus epidemics SARS and MERS CoV. COVID-19 Mpro was more phylogenetically related to SARS Mpro. After a virtual screening capmain against COVID-19 Mpro, a set of antivirals, vitamins, antimicrobials, and other systemically acting drugs were more potent binding with COVID-19 Mpro, compared with curcumin (known Mpro inhibitor). The repurposing of ribavirin, telbivudine, vitamin B12 and nicotinamide is suggested.</p>
