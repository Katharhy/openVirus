<p id="p0085">To evaluate the association between anti-HDV prevalence and selected population groups, odds ratios (ORs) were pooled using a random effects model. For studies that did not report a comparable control population, the comparator was drawn from the highest quality available dataset that had been obtained from either the general population or asymptomatic HBsAg-positive people in the same geographic region. Asymptomatic HBsAg-positive people were defined as patients who had been clinically evaluated and found not to have evidence of active chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis or HCC. In the analysis of HIV-positive people, comparator populations were HIV-negative populations or general populations from the same geographic region. Subgroup estimates, stratified by the type of control population used, were produced to examine for potential sources of heterogeneity. We calculated I
 <sup>2</sup> and τ
 <sup>2</sup> to estimate heterogeneity where I
 <sup>2</sup> represents the proportion of variability that could be attributed to heterogeneity and not sampling error and τ
 <sup>2</sup> represents an estimate of between-study variance, for each group.
