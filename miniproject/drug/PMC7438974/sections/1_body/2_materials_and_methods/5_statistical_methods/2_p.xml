<p id="p0080">Anti-HDV prevalence among HBsAg-positive people within general populations and hepatology clinic populations was modelled using a binomial mixed model (detailed in 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">supplementary appendix 8</xref>). The estimates were weighted by the data quality score described above (
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">supplementary appendix 7</xref>) and the size of the represented population. For each population, the size of the catchment area was estimated from the latest available census data (detailed in 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">supplementary appendix 9</xref>).

 </xref> To predict anti-HDV prevalence in the overall population (without conditioning on HBsAg status), we used WHO HBsAg prevalence estimates for general populations.

 </xref> The 95% CIs for the number of people with anti-HDV and HDV RNA was estimated using a parametric bootstrap procedure (
