<p id="p0090">We estimated prevalence of HDV RNA among people with anti-HDV using a random effects model and analysed associations between study characteristics and rates of HDV RNA detection using random effects residual maximum likelihood aggregate level meta-regression with Knapp and Hartung adjustment, using the package 
 <italic>metareg</italic> in Stata. Coefficients were calculated to indicate the change in proportion of HDV RNA per unit change in explanatory variable, where for example, a coefficient of 0.1 indicates a 10% increase in HDV RNA detection per unit increase in the explanatory variable.
