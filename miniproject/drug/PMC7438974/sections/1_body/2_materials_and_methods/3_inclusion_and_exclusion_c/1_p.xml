<p id="p0065">We included studies that described the geographic and clinical setting of participants with HBsAg and applied a systematic selection method to anti-HDV testing, whereby all eligible consenting participants, or a randomly selected representative sample were tested. Duplicate data, studies that commenced before 1988, and studies with evidence of selective or non-systematic testing were excluded. Studies were also excluded if they used anti-HDV IgM, hepatitis D antigen (HDAg) or HDV RNA as an initial test as these are inconsistently expressed markers of HDV infection.
