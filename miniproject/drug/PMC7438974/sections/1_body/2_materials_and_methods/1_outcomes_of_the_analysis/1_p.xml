<p id="p0055">We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of HDV prevalence in the 6 World Health Organisation (WHO) regions. The primary outcome was the prevalence of total or IgG anti-HDV among HBsAg-positive people. The prevalence of HDV RNA detection was estimated among individuals positive for HBsAg and anti-HDV based on assays employing PCR. The secondary outcome was the estimation of the population attributable fraction (PAF) of HDV among HBsAg-positive persons with cirrhosis and HCC. We conducted the study in accordance with the principles of the PRISMA and GATHER statements, and registered it with PROSPERO (CRD42018113039).</p>
