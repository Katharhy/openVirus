<p id="p0070">Following removal of duplicate articles, 2 authors (AJS and BK) independently screened potentially relevant articles to determine suitability for inclusion. We extracted data comprising year of sampling, geographic representation of the sample (for example, a catchment area of a clinic or the geographic boundaries of a community study), population type, clinical setting, testing method and assay manufacturer, anti-HDV and HDV RNA prevalence, and HDV genotype data. We derived a data quality score from an appraisal checklist (detailed in

 </xref> The assessment was based on 3 main criteria relating to i) adequacy of description of inclusion and exclusion criteria; ii) recruitment methodology; and iii) assessment of risk of bias. Determination of eligibility for inclusion, data extraction and risk of bias were assessed independently (by AJS and BK) with disagreement resolved by consensus.
