<p id="p0040">HDV is a satellite RNA virus that depends on HBV for propagation.

 </xref> It uses the HBsAg as a viral envelope and shares the same hepatocyte receptor for viral entry.

 </xref> HDV is among the smallest of viruses capable of causing human disease, yet HBV co-infection with HDV is the most severe form of viral hepatitis.

 </xref> HDV transmission follows 2 patterns. Infection occurring simultaneously with HBV can cause extensive hepatic necrosis and manifest as a severe or even fulminant hepatitis with a high case fatality rate.

 </xref> With recovery, simultaneous infection in adults usually results in clearance of both viruses.

 </xref> Super-infection of persons with chronic HBV infection typically results in HDV persistence, leading to accelerated progression to cirrhosis and an increased risk of HCC relative to chronic HBV infection alone.

 </xref> HDV ascertainment has been suboptimal, even in high-income settings. HDV may therefore have an under-recognised role in the causation of liver disease and liver-related deaths.
