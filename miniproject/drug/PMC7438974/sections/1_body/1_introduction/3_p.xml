<p id="p0045">Estimating HDV prevalence and the relative contribution of HDV towards liver disease, including among general populations and specific population groups, is critical to guide clinical care and policy formulation and inform effective public health interventions and development of new medicines. Yet, obtaining accurate estimates of HDV epidemiology is challenging for several reasons. Firstly, at the population level, large sample sizes are required to identify HBsAg-positive individuals prior to testing for HDV. In settings with low prevalence of HBV infection, sufficiently large surveys may not be feasible. Secondly, heterogeneity in HDV estimates might be expected because of variable and potentially evolving epidemic patterns, as well as variations in methodology. Thirdly, the selection criteria for HBsAg and subsequent HDV testing may lead to non-representative sampling. Therefore, careful assessment of potential biases and assessment of representativeness is required to synthesise epidemiological estimates of HDV prevalence.</p>
