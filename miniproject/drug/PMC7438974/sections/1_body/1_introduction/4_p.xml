 </xref> This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify and collate all globally available epidemiological data on HDV infection from January 1998 to January 2019. We aimed to describe the geographic distribution of HDV infection and to produce regional estimates of HDV infection among general populations, individuals attending hepatology clinics, and selected population groups, being mindful of potential sources of error. We further aimed to estimate the proportion of HBV-associated cirrhosis and HCC attributable to HDV.
