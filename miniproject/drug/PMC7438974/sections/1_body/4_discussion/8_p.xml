<p id="p0180">In summary, the data indicate that HDV infection is common among HBsAg-positive people in the general population worldwide, albeit with significant geographic heterogeneity. The data also indicate that PWID, haemodialysis recipients, CSWs and MSM, as well as people with HIV and HCV, are at increased odds of HDV seropositivity, and that HDV is responsible for a substantial proportion of cirrhosis and HCC among HBsAg-positive people. HDV infection should be considered in all patients with chronic HBV infection. Routine HDV ascertainment in clinical settings is of particular importance in view of the suppressive effect of HDV co-infection on HBV DNA levels,

 </xref> which may lead to misclassification of HBV status. Furthermore, novel therapeutics that target HDV entry, prenylation and nucleic acid replication offer promise for the treatment of HDV infection.

Public health agencies may want to report on HDV infection and implement activities to mitigate the risk of HDV acquisition according to their local epidemic. In addition to the adoption of routine testing for all HBsAg-positive people, the addition of anti-HDV/HDV RNA testing (including the use of dry blood spots) as part of representative population surveys such as demographic health surveys, would be useful in areas with sparse data.
