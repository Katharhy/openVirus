<p id="p0150">There remain limitations to the epidemiological data available to inform this analysis. There are significant data gaps, most strikingly in North America and Latin America, Southern Africa and most of Asia, where more data are required to obtain accurate estimates of anti-HDV prevalence. These gaps should be addressed through future representative epidemiological studies with efforts to elucidate population groups at increased prevalence of infection. There was heterogeneity in anti-HDV prevalence estimates even within closely related geographic areas, which is reflected in the confidence intervals for the estimates. Heterogeneity suggested likely variation in local risk factors and the occurrence of localised, geographically defined foci of transmission. Sources of heterogeneity also included methodological issues, such as variation in study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria and sampling frameworks. It should be noted that estimates in our study consider individuals living in regions with limited or no data for anti-HDV prevalence. To do so we calculated the number of people with anti-HDV in each WHO region, by multiplying the anti-HDV prevalence estimates for each region (based on available data) with the number of people in the general population estimated to be HBsAg positive (based on WHO HBsAg regional estimates). Collection of additional data to inform epidemiological estimates for regions with limited data represents a research priority.</p>
