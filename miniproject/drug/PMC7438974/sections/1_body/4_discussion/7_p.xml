 </xref> We estimated that, globally, between 1 in 5, to 1 in 6 cases of cirrhosis or HCC among people with hepatitis B are attributable to HDV infection, indicating that hepatitis D may be an important contributor to liver disease. It should be noted that there was a paucity of studies reporting anti-HDV prevalence among people with cirrhosis and HCC from some regions (including the South-East Asia region and the Western Pacific region), and therefore we estimated global PAFs and did not estimate regional PAFs. Our global PAF estimates should be considered preliminary until more data are made available to resolve sources of heterogeneity and obtain more globally representative estimates. Further, our estimates of attributable fraction are based on ascertainment of anti-HDV prevalence among individuals diagnosed with cirrhosis and HCC from cross-sectional studies. These may include individuals with early compensated cirrhosis. Since HDV accelerates disease progression, HDV may have an even greater attributable fraction of HBV-associated mortality from cirrhosis and HCC. As to the long-term impact of HDV RNA positivity on the risk of cirrhosis and HCC, we are limited by the available data, which very rarely include longitudinal follow-up to ascertain clinical outcomes. Ascertainment of the contribution of HDV to mortality is also not currently possible due to the lack of data.
