<p id="p0160">This study did not aim to address temporal trends in anti-HDV prevalence, as only a small number of studies reported repeated longitudinal data. We also found very few studies including children. It is anticipated anti-HDV prevalence may be low in children, due to the absence of specific risk factors and a short duration of risk exposure. Global estimates for HBV prevalence are significantly lower among children, largely as a result of HBV vaccination, estimated at 1.3% in children under 5 years, relative to 3.5% among the general population globally.

 </xref> Accordingly, HDV infection is expected to be uncommon in children and to decline over time due to increasing implementation of HBV vaccination.
