<p id="p0145">There has been uncertainty about the epidemic patterns of HDV infection, at least partly reflecting the challenges in obtaining representative estimates of anti-HDV prevalence.

 </xref> To address the issue, in this systematic review, we took into account population sizes and representativeness and considered the risk of bias of prevalence studies. Globally, we estimate an anti-HDV prevalence of 4.5% among HBsAg-positive people, which translates into an estimated prevalence of 0.16% in the total population. This represents an estimated 12 million people with serological evidence of HDV infection globally. The geographic distribution of HDV infection is heterogeneous, with particularly high prevalence reported in Mongolia, the Republic of Moldova, and countries in Western and Middle Africa. We also identified an epidemiological association between anti-HDV prevalence and several population groups including PWID, recipients of haemodialysis, CSWs and MSM, and between anti-HDV prevalence and HCV or HIV infection, which may be secondary to shared transmission routes. These data are useful to set priorities about HDV testing. Interventions that prevent HBV and HCV infection should also be effective in preventing HDV, including immunization against hepatitis B and harm reduction strategies in PWID.
