<p id="p0170">Furthermore, anti-HDV assays used in the included studies were from a diverse range of manufacturers. Comparative data on the diagnostic performance characteristics of anti-HDV tests are lacking and would be informative. Limited data suggests a potential for false negative anti-HDV ELISA test results, at least when comparing one commercial anti-HDV assay with a novel anti-HDV microarray test in a hyperendemic setting in Mongolia.

 </xref> This initial finding requires verification in other regions and populations, with diverse HDV genotypes, and across the different anti-HDV assays available commercially to determine whether anti-HDV underestimation is a broader problem.
