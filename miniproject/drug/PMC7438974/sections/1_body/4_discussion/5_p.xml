 </xref> prevalence estimates in this study were based primarily on detection of anti-HDV. We also provided a provisional estimate of viraemic, HDV RNA-positive individuals. A limited number of studies used HDV RNA detection for confirmation of a current infection in participants with anti-HDV; in these studies, the pooled estimate for HDV RNA positivity was 58.5%. It is important to note that relative to the data available to inform anti-HDV estimates, the data for HDV RNA represent a significantly smaller sample size with limited representation from some regions and the estimate of viraemic infections should therefore be considered provisional. HDV RNA detection was lower in general populations relative to hepatology clinic populations, and positively correlated with anti-HDV prevalence. This may reflect the higher pre-test probability of a current HDV infection in HBsAg-positive people who underwent HDV testing in hepatology clinics relative to general populations. HDV RNA detection was also less common in the Africa region relative to other regions, but this observation should be interpreted with caution: HDV RNA assays have had historical performance issues and particular difficulties with the detection of African genotypes 5â€“8.

 </xref> With concerted efforts to improve and standardise HDV RNA detection methods, epidemiological data based on HDV RNA detection may become more informative in the future and also help to ascertain the relationship between viraemia and clinical outcomes.
