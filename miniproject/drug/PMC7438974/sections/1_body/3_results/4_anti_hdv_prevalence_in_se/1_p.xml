<p id="p0125">The odds of anti-HDV detection were analysed in 6 selected populations relative to general populations or asymptomatic HBsAg-positive people from the same geographic region (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">supplementary appendices 14–20</xref>). Anti-HDV prevalence was higher in PWID (pooled OR 19.0) and in haemodialysis recipients (pooled OR 3.4). Five studies from China and Vietnam indicated that CSWs also had higher prevalence (pooled OR 18.7). Three studies from Italy, Burkina Faso and Indonesia investigated anti-HDV prevalence among MSM. No cases were reported in the Burkina Faso study, whereas data from the other 2 studies indicated that anti-HDV prevalence was higher among MSM (pooled OR 16.0). The odds of anti-HDV detection were also higher among anti-HCV positive people (pooled OR 10.0) and among HIV-positive people in countries without generalised HIV epidemics (pooled OR 6.6). In countries with generalised HIV epidemics, the odds of anti-HDV detection were similar in HIV-positive and HIV-negative people (pooled OR 0.8).
