<p id="p0120">In the general population, the global estimated anti-HDV prevalence was 4.5% (95% CI 3.6–5.7) among HBsAg-positive people and 0.16% (95% CI 0.11–0.25) overall, with regional estimates for HBsAg-positive people ranging from 3.0% in Europe to 6.0% in Africa (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This represents an estimated 12.0 million HDV seropositive individuals globally (95% CI 8.7–18.7). In hepatology clinic populations, the global estimated anti-HDV prevalence was 16.4% (95% CI 14.6–18.6) among HBsAg-positive people, with estimates ranging from 3.3% in the Americas to 19.5% in Europe (

 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and are detailed in 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">supplementary appendix 13</xref>. Among HBsAg-positive people, Mongolia had the highest national anti-HDV prevalence (36.9%); prevalence rates &gt;10% were also estimated for the Republic of Moldova and countries in Western and Middle Africa. Several isolated communities were noted to have high HDV anti-prevalence, including indigenous Amazonian Amerindian tribes in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela, indigenous tribes in the Uttar Pradesh region of India, and selected populations in Greenland and Rhodes (Greece) (

Only limited data were available for North America, Latin America and Southern Africa and, particularly in view of the size of the populations represented, there were small samples available for the Western Pacific and South-East Asia regions relative to other WHO regions (
