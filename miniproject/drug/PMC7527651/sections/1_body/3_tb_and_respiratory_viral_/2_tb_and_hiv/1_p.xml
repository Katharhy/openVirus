<p>The interaction between TB and HIV is well known. Without antiretroviral treatment, the risk of LTBI progressing to active TB disease in people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) is greater than in immunocompetent hosts. In PLWHA, the risk of developing TB is of the order of 10% per year [

 <xref rid="C118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. This elevated risk is behind the WHO recommendation of TB screening and/or preventive treatment for all PLWHA [

 <xref rid="C120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. New regimens as short as 1 month (daily rifapentine plus isoniazid) to 3 months (weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid) were recently recommended by the WHO, and are well tolerated and effective [

 <xref rid="C120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Important programmatic implications for collaboration between TB and HIV/AIDS services exist: TB services should test for HIV (allowing treatment of TB patients with antiretrovirals and cotrimoxazole preventive therapy in patients with HIV/TB co-infection) and HIV/AIDS services should screen for LTBI, using the tuberculin skin test (TST) or IFN-γ release assay (IGRA), and initiate prompt treatment of TB or LTBI in PLWHA [
 <xref rid="C119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Based on this rationale (two diseases, one patient), WHO promotes TB/HIV collaborative activities focused on three main pillars [
 <xref rid="C121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]: 1) establish TB/HIV collaborative mechanisms, 2) decrease the burden of TB among PLWHA and 3) decrease the burden of HIV among TB patients. Moreover, testing for other infections in addition to HIV in TB clinics may be indicated during epidemics and pandemics.
