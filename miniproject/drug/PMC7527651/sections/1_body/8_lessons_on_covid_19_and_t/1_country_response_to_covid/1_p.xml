<p>The response of European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) countries and the UK to the COVID-19 epidemic is provided in 
 <xref rid="TB3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref> [
 <xref rid="C215" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>]. By April 3, 2020, 25 out of 31 (81%) countries had closed all educational institutions, higher education and secondary schools, primary schools, and day care/nurseries; in some countries primary schools (two out of 31 (6%)) and/or day care/nurseries (six out of 31 (19%)) remained open. Public spaces were closed in 30 out of 31 (97%) countries, including closure of museums, theatres, cafes and restaurants, and gyms and sport facilities. Mass gatherings had been cancelled in all 31 countries. In some countries this meant that indoor and outdoor gatherings of more than five persons were forbidden and in others only larger gatherings of more than 1000 persons were banned. Finally, more than half of EU/EEA countries and the UK (18 out of 31 (58%)) implemented a full national lockdown, 
 <italic>i.e.</italic> stay-at-home orders for regions or entire countries. Of the 13 countries without national lockdown, one country issued stay-at-home recommendations to the general population and nine countries issued stay-at-home recommendations for risk groups. The assessment of the response shows that there has been a lack of uniformity in the implementation of different measures. An analysis of the efficacy of the different measures at the end of the emergency should guide future policies.
