<p>Breaking the transmission link is the main method for containing an infectious disease in the absence of an effective vaccine. Controlling a respiratory infection at source is often more cost-effective than targeting multiple intervention points downstream for environmental control or personal protection [
 <xref rid="C223" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>]. For TB, wearing a surgical mask can reduce the transmission by 56% [
 <xref rid="C224" ref-type="bibr">224</xref>]. The evidence for the protective effect of cloth masks is limited and contradictory [

 <xref rid="C225" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>]. For both diseases, early case detection is important for source control, but case finding may be delayed by inconspicuous or nonspecific symptoms [
 <xref rid="C135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. TB can be stopped at source by effective treatment. Isolation for the whole infectious period is needed to contain the spread of COVID-19. Like TB, contact tracing may only pick up a small portion of COVID-19 cases when widespread local transmission occurs with unclear transmission links [
 <xref rid="C226" ref-type="bibr">226</xref>]. Physical distancing [
 <xref rid="C227" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>] and adjunctive use of face masks for unavoidable person-to-person contact are then the only effective measures to slow the otherwise exponential growth of the COVID-19 epidemic [
 <xref rid="C193" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>]. The current physical distancing and stay-at-home measures imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic will pose challenges to TB programmes to provide the necessary diagnosis, treatment and care for the people and communities affected by TB. To avoid disruption of TB services, innovative approaches (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> virtual care, digital health, community monitoring solutions, 
 <italic>etc.</italic>) will be necessary [
