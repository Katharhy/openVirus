<p>Diagnosis of active TB relies on direct detection of 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, most often in respiratory specimens. Although culture remains the “gold standard” in terms of sensitivity and specificity, effective molecular assays to detect 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> DNA are also used on platforms and in point-of-care tests [
 <xref rid="C158" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. Moreover, these 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> molecular assays can detect mutations associated with resistance, rapidly detecting multidrug-resistant TB strains resistant to rifampin and isoniazid, allowing appropriate therapies and curbing transmission of these strains [
 <xref rid="C159" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. Testing immune memory to a previous TB exposure (
 <italic>i.e.</italic> LTBI), performed with TSTs and IGRAs, cannot be used as a surrogate for protection, but identifies persons who have been previously infected and can be useful to guide the TB diagnostic algorithm [
