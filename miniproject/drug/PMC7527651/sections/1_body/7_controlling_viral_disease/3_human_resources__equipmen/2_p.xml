<p>To mitigate the consequences of this or future pandemics it is important countries develop specific plans with adequate human and financial resources [
 <xref rid="C209" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>]. This will prevent or limit resources currently reserved for other purposes (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> for TB programmes) becoming diverted to the emergency [
 <xref rid="C210" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>], including the shortage of PCR reagents being used for COVID-19 diagnosis which may impact on molecular TB diagnosis. Moreover, the emergency plan should be able to ensure rapid procurement and distribution of diagnostics, drugs, ventilators, masks, personal protective equipment and respirators needed to ensure an adequate response and adequate human resources [

 <xref rid="C211" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>]. Telemedicine would be an important approach to deliver care, especially as a means to reduce the risk of cross-contamination caused by close contact [
 <xref rid="C212" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>]. To be effective, as part of an emergency response, telehealth would need to be routinely used in the health system. This would imply a change in the management and the redesign of existing models of care. Moreover, a central system of controlling the pandemic is needed (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> in Italy, the Italian Civil Protection Dept [
 <xref rid="C213" ref-type="bibr">213</xref>], which is normally dedicated to seismic hazard or natural disaster assessment and intervention). A central system will ensure prompt coordination of the emergency response and implementation of the emergency plan [
