<p>While N95/N99 and FFP2/FFP3 respirators or higher-level respirators including disposable filtering face piece respirators, powered air purifying respirators, elastomeric respirators (defined as per USA and European standards) and eye protection are recommended to protect healthcare staff and other exposed individuals at the workplace level (after adequate training), the use of surgical masks is debated [
 <xref rid="C193" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C194" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>]. Although there is agreement on the use of surgical masks to limit the spread of droplet nuclei for isolated symptomatic patients, the potential mass use of surgical masks to limit the community spread of COVID-19 during the early stages of infection and from asymptomatic individuals is strongly discussed [

 <xref rid="C193" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C194" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>]. Arguments against their wide use are based on the false sense of protection (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> the individual feels the surgical mask protects him/her from acquiring infection) as well as the potential risks of moisture retention, long mask re-use and limited filtration capacity [
 <xref rid="C195" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>]. While the WHO is revising its recommendations, the use of masks among community members has been re-evaluated [

 <xref rid="C196" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C197" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>]. Recent ECDC guidance states that face masks used by the general population may reduce the spread of the infection in the community by minimising the excretion of respiratory droplets from infected individuals who have not yet developed symptoms or who remain asymptomatic [
