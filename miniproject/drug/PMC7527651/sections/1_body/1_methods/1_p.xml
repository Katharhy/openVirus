<p>We performed a rapid and nonsystematic search of the literature using the key words “COVID-19”, “tuberculosis”, “viral infection”, “HIV infection”, “SARS”, “lung”, “immunology”, “diagnosis”, “prevention”, “infection control” and “workplace” to identify a minimum set of references from an electronic database (PubMed), existing guidelines on TB, viral diseases and airborne diseases, and grey literature from their inception until April 29, 2020.
