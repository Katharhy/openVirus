<p>Lopinavir/ritonavir is a widely studied treatment for COVID-19, although evidence of efficacy is still limited [
 <xref rid="C164" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. In non-TB patients, the combination, studied in an open-label RCT, did not show any virological or clinical response compared with standard of care [
 <xref rid="C165" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. For the treatment of TB/HIV co-infected patients, lopinavir/ritonavir is not recommended in combination with rifampicin due to cytochrome P450 (CYP) induction. Superboosting of lopinavir/ritonavir by additional ritonavir in children on rifampicin-based TB treatment could be attempted as comparable drug exposure was achieved in situations without rifampicin [
