<p>Potential drugâ€“drug interactions (DDI) are presented in 
 <xref rid="TB2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>. The summary of interactions is largely based on evaluations made from pharmacokinetics and toxicity profiles of drugs given alone and comparatively, when co-administered with other drugs in a separate study, in the absence of real dedicated DDI studies. The summary includes effects on drug exposure, monitoring/action and potential mechanisms.
