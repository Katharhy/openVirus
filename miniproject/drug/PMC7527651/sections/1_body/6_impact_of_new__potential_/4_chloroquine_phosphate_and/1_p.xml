<p>Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are being evaluated in several clinical trials for therapy and prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 following promising 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> results [
 <xref rid="C162" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C168" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>]. In the absence of results from well-designed clinical studies, clinical benefit is currently unknown [
 <xref rid="C169" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C170" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. Both drugs have immunomodulatory properties [
 <xref rid="C171" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C172" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. Chloroquine has been shown to reduce tumour necrosis factor-Î± production and receptor-mediated signalling in monocytes, which could prevent SARS-CoV-2-induced severe inflammatory response [
 <xref rid="C173" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. TB physicians should be careful when combining these drugs with TB drugs such as moxifloxacin, bedaquiline, delamanid and clofazimine due to the risk of increased QTc prolongation. An ongoing trial was halted due to irregular heart rates and increased risk of fatal heart arrhythmia [
 <xref rid="C174" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also issued a warning on these two drugs [
 <xref rid="C175" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. In addition, rifampicin increases chloroquine CYP3A4- and CYP2D6-mediated metabolism to desethylchloroquine and bisdesethylchloroquine [
 <xref rid="C176" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. It is unclear whether these metabolites are active against SARS-CoV-2.
