<p>Primary viral pneumonia is characterised by rapid onset of nonproductive cough, headache, myalgias, dyspnoea, tachypnoea, hypoxia and ground-glass opacities on computed tomography (CT) scans. Secondary bacterial pneumonia, which may occur concurrently or following the development of viral pneumonia, is a frequent complication. Bacterial superinfection occurs through direct damage of the respiratory epithelium with modification of local and systemic immune defence. Bacterial superinfection, mainly due to

 <xref rid="C65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], is reported in 20–47% of influenza patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). Its global prevalence varies between 0.1% and 10% according to historical surveys, and 1.59% according to a recent Korean survey during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1)pdm/09 pandemic [

 <sc>orens</sc> and F
 <sc>auci</sc> [
 <xref rid="C67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. ARDS was responsible for 10–15% of the fatal cases, while bacterial superinfection, with poorer prognosis with 85–90% fatal cases, manifests as acute bronchopneumonia, with pathogenic bacteria cultured on autopsy [
