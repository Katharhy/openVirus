<p>The first line of defence against respiratory viral infections includes intrinsic defences such as mucus and antiviral peptides. When these are circumvented, viruses enter the epithelial cells by recognising viral components

All these cells promote an antiviral response and are important for the establishment of adaptive responses. Concurrently, these inflammatory cells may be important in driving innate immune-mediated tissue damage, a process which also occurs in TB [
