<p>According to a recent report from China, COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, is characterised by three clinical patterns: absence or paucity of symptoms, mild-to-moderate disease and severe pneumonia requiring admission to the ICU [
 <xref rid="C82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Dyspnoea develops after a median time of 8 days from illness onset, with a median time to ICU admission of 5 days. Up to 20% of patients require transfer to the ICU [

 <xref rid="C84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], with consequent overwhelming of healthcare capacity. The evidence suggests that while 25% of COVID-19 patients have comorbidities including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and malignancies, the proportion is more than 90% among those who die [

 <xref rid="C93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Besides virological diagnosis, imaging by chest radiography, ultrasound and CT are important for diagnosis and management. Main CT abnormalities include ground-glass opacity and consolidation [

The combination of CT scan findings, respiratory parameters (peripheral capillary oxygen saturation and arterial oxygen tension/inspiratory oxygen fraction ratio) and blood tests (C-reactive proteins, lymphocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase, triglycerides, ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer and interleukin (IL)-6) [
 <xref rid="C84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] are important features to identify those at highest risk for ICU transfer. Lungs of dead COVID-19 patients showed oedema, proteinaceous exudate, focal reactive hyperplasia of pneumocytes with patchy inflammatory cellular infiltration and multinucleated giant cells with fibroblastic plugs in airspaces [
 <xref rid="C96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. A recent study reported autopsy cases contained diffuse alveolar damage with mononuclear response (CD4
 <sup>+</sup> aggregates) surrounding thrombosed vessels, in the presence of associated haemorrhages [
