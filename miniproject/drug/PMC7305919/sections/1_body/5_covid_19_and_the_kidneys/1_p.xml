<p id="p0080">Renal damage may result from direct infection of kidney cells by SARS-CoV-2 or indirect harm secondary to intensive care interventions required to manage failure of other organs. Like endothelial cells, proximal renal tubular cells have ACE2 receptors, and in the kidney, both may be infected by SARS-CoV-2, creating direct and indirect mechanisms of nephron injury.

 </xref> As elsewhere in the body, endothelial injury is implicated in formation of microvascular thromboses. Importantly, renal injury may also be a consequence of several critical care interventions,

 </xref> for example, where reduced oral or i.v. fluid administration intended to minimise pulmonary vascular congestion results in inadequate renal perfusion. Elevated PEEP and high driving pressures (peakâ€“mean pressure) can impair renal function as a result of reduced renal blood flow caused by increased pressure in the renal veins. Similarly, reduced cardiac output and blood pressure reduce renal blood flow, an effect compounded by the cardiovascular depressant effects of sedation/analgesia.
