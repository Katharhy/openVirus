<p id="p0075">Pulmonary embolus in COVID-19 is relatively frequent and can cause catastrophic cardiovascular collapse. Patients with ARDS are vulnerable to pulmonary oedema, but in COVID-19, maintaining a negative fluid balance increases thrombogenicity and exacerbates the cardiovascular collapse associated with pulmonary hypertension. As the right heart begins to fail in the face of high pulmonary vascular resistance, high venous filling pressures are necessary to maintain cardiac output. Adequate hydration/fluid therapy may also mitigate risk of renal failure, which results in 20â€“30% of these patients needing renal replacement therapy.</p>
