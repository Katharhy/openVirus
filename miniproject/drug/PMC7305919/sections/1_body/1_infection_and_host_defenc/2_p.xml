<p id="p0020">In the most severely affected patients, an exaggerated immune response occurs as a cytokine ‘storm’, characterised by extreme concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukins), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and several chemokines.

 </xref> This pattern mimics secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, an under-recognised hyperinflammatory syndrome characterised by fulminant hypercytokinaemia and multiorgan failure. It also resembles the cytokine release syndrome that is seen as a complication of chimaeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy for lymphoproliferative malignancies and other forms of cancer. Because of the prominent role of the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in these processes, treatment of severe COVID-19 with monoclonal anti-soluble IL-6 receptor antibody (tocilizumab) has been proposed.
