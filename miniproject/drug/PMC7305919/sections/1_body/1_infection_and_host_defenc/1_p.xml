<p id="p0015">COVID-19 starts when SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from one human to another via inhalation or oral ingestion of virus-containing droplets. The virus likely enters epithelial cells in the nasal or oral cavity through SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> ). Virus–receptor binding results in fusion of the viral envelope and cell membranes with entry of the viral nucleocapsid into the cell enabling viral mRNA to hijack host cell ribosomes to translate viral code, thereby leading to generation of viral proteins and ultimately virus replication.

 </xref> Initially, there is local propagation of the virus and a limited innate immune response, but at this stage, infected individuals can already infect others. Viral load is highest around the time of symptom onset and decreases over the following 5–7 days, with viable virus no longer cultivable beyond 10 days from symptom onset.

 </xref> These features likely account for the high transmissibility of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 propagates and travels down the respiratory tract, and a more robust innate immune response is triggered, characterised by the occurrence of systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines and activated immune cells. By then, COVID-19 may clinically manifest with, in most cases, self-limiting mild-to-moderate symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection and general symptoms, such as myalgia and fatigue. In about 20% of patients, the virus will infect alveolar cells, once again via the ACE2 receptor.
