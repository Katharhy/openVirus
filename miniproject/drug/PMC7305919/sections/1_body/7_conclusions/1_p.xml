<p id="p0100">Early reports described COVID-19 as a respiratory illness, but we now know that it is a much more complex multisystem disorder. There is still a great deal to learn about why it affects people in different ways, although by combining epidemiology and basic science, some clues are emerging. Growing understanding points to potential therapeutic approaches. Interventions are likely to include some combination of antiviral treatment, drugs to protect tissues targeted by the virus (such as those that stabilise endothelium), drugs to manage abnormal physiological states (such as hypercoagulability), and drugs that treat the dysfunctional immune response that is often the terminal event. Survival rates for those needing ICU care are reported at about 50%, and UK Intensive Care National Audit &amp; Research Centre data for those needing combined advanced respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal support are a shocking 19%. There is still a great deal to learn.</p>
