<p id="p0050">These different lung injuries warrant different management strategies. Patients with viral pneumonia may tolerate higher tidal volumes (7–9 ml kg
 <sup>−1</sup>) than recommended for ARDS (6 ml kg
 <sup>−1</sup>) along with lower than recommended levels of PEEP.

 </xref> In contrast, the ARDS-like clinical picture should be managed with classical ARDS Network ventilation strategies, including tidal volumes of 6 ml kg
 <sup>−1</sup>, higher levels of PEEP, and trials of prone positioning.

 </xref> Considerable controversy exists as to whether noninvasive ventilatory support, such as CPAP, can enable some patients with viral pneumonia and relatively normal lung compliance to avoid invasive mechanical ventilation with some centres claiming considerable success with this approach. Prone positioning is widely practised and has been shown to improve oxygenation, but impact on clinical outcomes is uncertain.

 </xref> An unconventional approach that has achieved widespread adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic is ‘self-proning’: the voluntary adoption of the prone position, according to medical advice, in conscious patients receiving noninvasive respiratory support.
