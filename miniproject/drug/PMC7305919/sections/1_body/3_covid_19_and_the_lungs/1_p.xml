<p id="p0040">SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with three main types of lung damage. The typical clinical manifestation is viral pneumonia, seen in the early stages on CT imaging as small focal areas of ground-glass opacity (GGO). These changes are typically prominent in the peripheral lung bases and are bilateral in 75% of patients. Lymphadenopathy, pleural effusions, and lung nodules are uncommon (&lt;5%).

 </xref> Patients can exhibit significant hypoxaemia but with preserved lung compliance, a low ventilation-to-perfusion ratio, and low lung recruitability.

 </xref> Dual-energy CT findings of preferentially increased perfusion surrounding areas of lung opacification support the notion that loss of regional pulmonary vasoconstriction contributes to these pathophysiological changes, but the mechanism is still unclear. Clinically, ‘tachypnoea without dyspnoea’ is observed, a feature also described in other severe viral pneumonias, including pandemic influenza (H1N1) in 1918.
