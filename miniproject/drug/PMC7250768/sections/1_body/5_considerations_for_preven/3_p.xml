<p id="p0120">The use of ACE-I/ARB in patients with COVID-19 remains controversial. It is concerning because SARS-CoV-2 enters the human cells by binding to ACE-2 receptors, and the increased ACE-2 expression induced by therapy with ACE-I or ARB would aggravate the infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, the available data does not show any difference in outcome among patients treated with or without ACE-I/ARB. On the other hand, a prior study showed a beneficial effect of ACE-I/ARB therapy in patients hospitalized with viral pneumonia.

 </xref> The mechanism responsible for this beneficial effect was a reduction in the viral infectionâ€“induced pulmonary inflammatory response and cytokine release. Some have attributed this beneficial effect to a compensatory increase in ACE-2.

 </xref> Until data from more extensive clinical studies becomes available, it is recommended to continue using ACE-I/ARBs in patients who are at risk for, are being evaluated for, or have COVID-19, a position supported by multiple society guidelines.
