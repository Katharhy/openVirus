<p id="p0110">India, as on 25th April 2020, is witnessing a sharp rise in the cases of COVID-19. In the coming days, we are likely to see an increase in the number of hospitalized patients and, as aforementioned, a high burden of cardiovascular complications. The hospital systems need to ensure preparedness for dealing with a large volume of such patients, many of whom would need ICU care and/or acute cardiac care. Unfortunately, no specific antiviral therapy or vaccines are available for COVID-19. Preventive measures, along with symptomatic supportive treatment, are the best strategies for COVID-19 and its complications at this time. It is crucial to triage the patients according to the status of underlying CVD as the patients with prior CVD, or its risk factors are more prone to develop cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Hence, appropriate protocols for rapid diagnosis, triaging, isolation, and treatment of patients with COVID-19 with cardiovascular complications should be prepared and well-rehearsed by the hospital administration. As a cardiovascular physician, it is imperative to encourage the use of telemedicine/telehealth for triage and patient management, wherever it is feasible. In-person visits and consultations should be avoided. It is important to cancel elective procedures, i.e., echocardiography, and cardiac catheterization unless they likely to affect outcome meaningfully. Adherence to national/international guidelines for optimal use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended.</p>
