<p id="p0125">The care of ACS in patients with COVID-19 is challenging. Ideally, all patients with ACS should be managed as per the standard guidelines, but new protocols have to be set for new challenges. Every institution or health-care facility needs to develop its own protocol for the management of patients with ACS during the COVID-19 crisis based on the clinical profile of patients, and the availability of workforce, adequate PPE, and a COVID-19 dedicated cardiac catheterization laboratory with preferably negative pressure ventilation.
