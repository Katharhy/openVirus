<p id="p0115">American College of Cardiology, in a recent statement, has recommended not to measure troponin levels or natriuretic peptides in patients with COVID-19 unless the diagnosis of acute MI or heart failure is suspected on clinical grounds.

 </xref> However, there is evidence that there is a progressive serial increase in both troponin and NT-pro BNP levels during hospitalization in patients who follow a deteriorating clinical course toward death. In contrast, the levels of these biomarkers remain stable and low in those with less severe disease and a more favorable clinical course toward successful treatment and discharge.

 </xref> Therefore, frequent and periodic estimation of cardiac biomarkers such as troponin, and NT-pro BNP is warranted in hospitalized patients who have prior CVD or its risk factors, and in those who show early evidence of cardiac injury. Worsening in any of these during serial recording should be regarded as a warning sign for poor outcome, and early and appropriate intervention should be initiated.
