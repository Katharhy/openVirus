<p id="p0030">Because SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE-2 receptor, it, therefore, attenuates the residual ACE-2 activity, thus leading to a state of inappropriately increased Ang-II activity.

 </xref> Importantly, Ang-II has a lot of adverse effects. Besides inducing local, as well as systemic HTN and vasoconstriction, Ang-II is proatherosclerotic and causes inflammatory and oxidative organ damage. Locally increased Ang-II also triggers an increase in vascular permeability resulting in pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)–like picture.

 </xref> Thus, by an effect on ACE-2 receptors, SARS-CoV-2 predisposes to acute lung injury, myocardial damage, inflammatory organ damage, and a prothrombotic state, responsible for its varied systemic complications and multiorgan dysfunction. Direct invasion of myocyte by the virus might also result in myocyte necrosis and, eventually, myocardial damage.
