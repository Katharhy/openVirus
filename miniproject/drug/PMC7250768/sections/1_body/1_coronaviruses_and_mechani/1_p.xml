 </xref> There are seven known human coronaviruses. Four of these seven coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1) are benign and cause only self-resolving infections and account for 15–30% of common colds. However, the remaining three have been associated with epidemics of the SARS in 2002 by SARS-CoV, in 2012 by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS)-CoV, and now COVID-19, a global pandemic in 2019–2020 by SARS-CoV-2.
