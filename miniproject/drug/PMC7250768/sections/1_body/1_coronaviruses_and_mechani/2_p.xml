<p id="p0025">SARS-coronaviruses contain glycosylated spike proteins that bind to the cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors, after activation by transmembrane protease serine 2.

 </xref> Alveolar epithelial cells appear to be the primary portal of entry for SARS-CoV-2, explaining its predominantly respiratory symptoms. ACE-2 is expressed mainly by the epithelial cells of the lungs, heart, intestine, kidney, and blood vessels.

 </xref> ACE-2 is physiologically distinct from the ACE-1 enzyme. ACE-1 converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which then binds to the type 1 angiotensin II receptors. On the other hand, the principal function of ACE-2 is the degradation of angiotensin-II (Ang-II) into angiotensin 1–7 (Ang 1–7), which counteracts the actions of Ang-II.
