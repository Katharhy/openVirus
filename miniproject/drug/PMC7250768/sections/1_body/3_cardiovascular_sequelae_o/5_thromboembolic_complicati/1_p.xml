<p id="p0090">Patients with COVID-19 appear to have an increased risk of arterial and VTE because of a state of vascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and hypercoagulability associated with COVID-19 infection.

 </xref> Immobilization in severe/critical COVID-19 further adds to the risk of developing VTE. Studies have shown elevated D-dimer and fibrin degradation products levels, and a higher incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, among non-surviving patients, compared with survivors.

 </xref> A small observational study involving 184 patients of COVID-19, admitted in ICU, revealed a 31% incidence of radiologically confirmed thrombotic complications (27% venous and 4% arterial) despite receiving standard doses of thromboprophylaxis.

 </xref> Thromboprophylaxis is thus recommended in all patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICUs.

 </xref> There is no validated regimen for prophylaxis against VTE in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Standard society guidelines, as for patients with non-COVID, should thus be followed.
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>32</sup>
 </xref> Nevertheless, if a hospitalized patient with COVID-19 demonstrates sudden clinical deterioration as evidenced by hypoxia or hemodynamic instability, the thromboembolic disease should always be considered in the differential diagnosis with a low threshold for using the appropriate diagnostic tests.
