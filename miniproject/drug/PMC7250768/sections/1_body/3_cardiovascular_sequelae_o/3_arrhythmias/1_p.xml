<p id="p0080">Cardiac arrhythmias are a common manifestation in patients with COVID-19. Among 137 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 7.3% of patients reported having nonspecific palpitations.

 </xref> In another retrospective analysis of 138 hospitalized patients, 23 (17%) had cardiac arrhythmias, which were significantly higher among those requiring ICU care (44.4% versus 6.9%, p &lt; 0.001), compared with those who did not.

 </xref> The type of arrhythmia, whether atrial or ventricular, was not specified. The possible mechanisms behind the higher prevalence of arrhythmia among patients with COVID-19 include myocardial ischemia/injury, viral infection–induced state of hypoxia, fever, metabolic disarray, neurohormonal dysregulation, and inflammatory stress.

  <sup>28</sup>
 </xref> The use of drugs causing QT prolongation such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, which have been repurposed for use in COVID-19, has also been implicated as a possible cause of ventricular arrhythmias in COVID-19.

 </xref> The risk of arrhythmias is more in patients with severe/critical disease and pre-existing CVD/inherited arrhythmia syndromes.
