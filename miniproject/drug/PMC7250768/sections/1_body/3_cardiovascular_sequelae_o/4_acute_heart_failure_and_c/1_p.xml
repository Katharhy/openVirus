<p id="p0085">In a series of 191 patients with COVID-19, acute heart failure occurred in 44 patients (23%). The incidence was significantly higher among non-survivors compared with those who survived (52% versus 21%, p &lt; 0.0001).

 </xref> Acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock in COVID-19 cases can occur secondary to exacerbation of pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction, and/or due to new onset myocarditis, ACS, cardiac arrhythmias, and stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Possibility of right heart failure and associated pulmonary HTN should always be kept in view of severe parenchymal lung disease and ARDS. Coronary CT angiogram and echocardiography are valuable non-invasive diagnostic modalities to guide further management.
