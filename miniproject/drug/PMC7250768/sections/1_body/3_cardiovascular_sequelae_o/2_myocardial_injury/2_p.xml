 </xref>, the incidence of elevation in hs-cTnI (&gt;28 pg/mL) was 17%, and it was significantly higher among non-survivors (46% versus 1%, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, the elevation of this biomarker was noted to be a predictor of in-hospital death (univariable odds ratio: 80.07, 95% CI: [10.34–620.36], p &lt; 0.0001). Interestingly, it was demonstrated that four days after onset of symptom, median hs-cTnI levels were 8.8 pg/mL in non-survivors vs. 2.5 pg/mL in survivors. During follow-up, the median hs-cTnI among survivors did not change significantly (2.5–4.4 pg/mL). In contrast, it kept on increasing among non-survivors with the most abrupt increase noted beyond Day 16 after disease onset and reached up to 290.6 pg/mL on Day 22. Notably, the median time to death from symptom onset was 18.5 days (interquartile range = 15–20 days).

 </xref> The trends in the rise of hs-cTnI were parallel to the increase of inflammatory biomarkers (interleukin-6, D-dimer, ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase). These results led us to believe that cardiac insult occurs secondary to the cytokine storm or secondary hemophagocytic lympho-histiocytosis rather than an isolated primary myocardial injury.

 </xref> Another implication of this study is that we should repeat troponin estimation frequently during hospitalization. Besides initial triaging, it provides useful prognostic information and also helps to decide which patient requires more intensive care.
