<p id="p0075">The other pattern of myocardial injury involves the primary myocardial damage, in which the patients present predominantly with cardiac complaints instead of respiratory symptoms. It can occur secondary to acute myocardial infarction (type 1) in a patient with COVID-19. However, it can also occur as a result of either viral myocarditis or stress-induced cardiomyopathy. The possibility of the latter two entities finds support from a few case reports where patients with COVID-19 have presented primarily with chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes, and left ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography, along with ST-T changes on electrocardiogram, but with normal coronary angiograms.

Interestingly she did not show any respiratory involvement during the clinical course.

 </xref> This case confirmed the direct role of viral myocarditis in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 associated myocardial injury. It also described the pericardial involvement with COVID-19 for the first time. Sporadic autopsy reports in patients with COVID-19 with high viral load have suggested infiltration of myocardium by interstitial mononuclear inflammatory cells.

 </xref> However, currently, we do not have enough data to define the role of endomyocardial biopsy and non-invasive imaging modalities such as cardiac PET to aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19â€“induced myocarditis. Until further data are available, one should have a high index of suspicion for acute myocarditis if a patient with COVID-19 presents with raised cardiac enzymes, new onset or worsening cardiac arrhythmias, and heart failure.
