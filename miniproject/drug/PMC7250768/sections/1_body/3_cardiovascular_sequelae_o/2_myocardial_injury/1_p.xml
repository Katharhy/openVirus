<p id="p0065">Myocardial injury, as defined by an increased troponin level, can occur due to myocardial ischemia/infarction or non-ischemic myocardial injury (myocarditis). In a study involving 416 hospitalized Chinese patients with COVID-19, approximately 20% of patients had cardiac injury defined as high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-TNI) higher than the 99% percentile upper reference limit. Patients with elevated hs-TNI were elderly, had more comorbidities, and also had higher levels of leukocytes, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptides, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin, compared with those without elevated hs-TNI.

A meta-analysis of 4 studies involving 341 patients, showed significantly higher cardiac troponin I levels in those with severe COVID-19 infection compared with those without (standardized mean difference: 25.6 ng/L; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.8–44.5 ng/L).
