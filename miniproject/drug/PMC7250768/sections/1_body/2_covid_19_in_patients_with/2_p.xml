<p id="p0045">Similar trends of an increased presence of cardiovascular comorbidities have been observed in patients with COVID-19. In one of the largest Chinese cohort of 1099 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients (outpatient and inpatient), the prevalence of patients having pre-existing HTN, DM, coronary artery disease (CAD), and cerebrovascular disease was 15%, 7.4%, 2.5%, and 1.4%, respectively.

 </xref> Among patients who were intubated or died, the prevalence of these comorbidities increased to 36%, 27%, 9%, and 6%, respectively.

 </xref> In another study involving 416 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from Wuhan, HTN (30.5%), DM (14.4%), and CAD (10.6%) were the three most common comorbidities, followed by cerebrovascular disease (5.3%) and chronic heart failure (4.1%).

 </xref> Similarly, in a systemic meta-analysis of 6 Chinese studies, involving 1527 patients, the proportions of HTN, cardiovascular disease and DM in patients with COVID-19 were 17.1%, 16.4%, and 9.7%, respectively. These proportions increased to about two-folds, three-folds, and two-folds, respectively, higher in severe/intensive care unit (ICU) cases than in their non-severe/non-ICU counterparts.

 </xref> Interestingly, the CVDs report of the year 2018 from China reveals the prevalence of HTN and DM to be 23.2% and 10.9%, respectively, among the general population.

 </xref> Therefore, the prevalence of HTN and diabetes in people infected with the virus was not higher compared with the general population.
