<p id="p0130">COVID-19 pandemic has posed a severe health threat on an international scale. Cardiovascular comorbidities are common in patients with severe COVID-19 and are associated with increased mortality. Elevation of cardiac enzymes, suggesting acute cardiac injury, can occur in up to one-fourth of patients with COVID-19 and worsens its outcome. It is crucial to measure cardiac biomarkers such as Troponins and NT-pro BNP serially in hospitalized patients to triage the patients, monitor treatment, and to predict prognosis. Our understanding of this novel coronavirus and its cardiovascular implications is still evolving. Researchers around the world need to share the data continuously at a rapid pace so that we can have a detailed understanding of this novel coronavirus and curb the menace it has caused.</p>
