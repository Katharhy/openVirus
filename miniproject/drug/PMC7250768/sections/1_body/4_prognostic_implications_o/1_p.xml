<p id="p0105">Acute myocardial injury (reflected by elevated cardiac enzymes secondary to ischemic/non-ischemic etiology, and also the electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities), is highly prevalent in patients with COVID-19 and is associated with more severe disease and worse prognosis.

 </xref> In a study involving 416 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, patients with myocardial injury (20%) were more prone to develop ARDS (58.5% vs. 14.7%; P &lt; 0.001) and a higher mortality rate (51.2% vs. 4.5%; P &lt; 0.001) than those without myocardial injury.

 </xref> On multivariate analysis, the presence of myocardial injury was the second most robust independent variable associated with mortality, preceded by ARDS, with hazard ratios of 4.26 and 7.89, respectively.

 </xref> revealed significantly higher mortality in individuals with myocardial injury (elevated troponin T) compared with those without myocardial injury (normal levels of troponin T) (59.6% vs. 8.9%, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, patients with elevated troponin levels showed a higher incidence of complications such as ARDS, malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias, acute renal injury, and acute coagulopathy. Interestingly, the mortality was highest in those with myocardial injury and underlying CVD (69.4%); however, the mortality was also considerably high in those with myocardial injury but without prior CVD (37.5%). On the contrary, patients with prior CVD without acute myocardial injury had a relatively favorable prognosis (mortality of 13.3%).

 </xref> Thus, all these evidence reaffirm that patients with COVID-19 who develop acute myocardial injury have a high risk of major complications and mortality, and the risk is more in patients with prior CVD.
