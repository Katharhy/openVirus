In the coming days, we are likely to see an increase in the number of hospitalized patients and, as aforementioned, a high burden of cardiovascular complications. The hospital systems need to ensure preparedness for dealing with a large volume of such patients, many of whom would need ICU care and/or acute cardiac care. Unfortunately, no specific antiviral therapy or vaccines are available for COVID-19. Preventive measures, along with symptomatic supportive treatment, are the best strategies for COVID-19 and its complications at this time. It is crucial to triage the patients according to the status of underlying CVD as the patients with prior CVD, or its risk factors are more prone to develop cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Hence, appropriate protocols for rapid diagnosis, triaging, isolation, and treatment of patients with COVID-19 with cardiovascular complications should be prepared and well-rehearsed by the hospital administration. As a cardiovascular physician, it is imperative to encourage the use of telemedicine/telehealth for triage and patient management, wherever it is feasible. In-person visits and consultations should be avoided. It is important to cancel elective procedures, i.e., echocardiography, and cardiac catheterization unless they likely to affect outcome meaningfully. Adherence to national/international guidelines for optimal use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended.</p><p id="p0115">American College of Cardiology, in a recent statement, has recommended not to measure troponin levels or natriuretic peptides in patients with COVID-19 unless the diagnosis of acute MI or heart failure is suspected on clinical grounds.<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> However, there is evidence that there is a progressive serial increase in both troponin and NT-pro BNP levels during hospitalization in patients who follow a deteriorating clinical course toward&#x000a0;death. In contrast, the levels of these biomarkers remain stable and low in those with less severe disease and a more favorable clinical course toward&#x000a0;successful treatment and discharge.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Therefore, frequent and periodic estimation of cardiac biomarkers such as troponin, and NT-pro BNP is warranted in hospitalized patients who have prior CVD or its risk factors, and in those who show early evidence of cardiac injury. Worsening in any of these during serial recording should be regarded as a warning sign for poor outcome, and early and appropriate intervention should be initiated.</p><p id="p0120">The use of ACE-I/ARB in patients with COVID-19 remains controversial. It is concerning because SARS-CoV-2 enters the human cells by binding to ACE-2 receptors, and the increased ACE-2 expression induced by therapy with ACE-I or ARB would aggravate the infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, the available data does not show any difference in outcome among patients treated with or without ACE-I/ARB. On the other hand, a prior study showed a beneficial effect of ACE-I/ARB therapy in patients hospitalized with viral pneumonia.<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> The mechanism responsible for this beneficial effect was a reduction in the viral infection&#x02013;induced pulmonary inflammatory response and cytokine release. Some have attributed this beneficial effect to a compensatory increase in ACE-2.<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> Until data from more extensive clinical studies becomes available, it is recommended to continue using ACE-I/ARBs in patients who are at risk for, are being evaluated for, or have COVID-19, a position supported by multiple society guidelines.<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref></p><p id="p0125">The care of ACS in patients with COVID-19 is challenging. Ideally, all patients with ACS should be managed as per the standard guidelines, but new protocols have to be set for new challenges. Every institution or health-care facility needs to develop its own protocol for the management of patients with ACS during the COVID-19 crisis based on the clinical profile of patients, and the availability of workforce, adequate PPE, and a COVID-19 dedicated cardiac catheterization laboratory with preferably negative pressure ventilation.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0130">COVID-19 pandemic has posed a severe health threat on an international scale. Cardiovascular comorbidities are common in patients with severe COVID-19 and are associated with increased mortality. Elevation of cardiac enzymes, suggesting acute cardiac injury, can occur in up to one-fourth of patients with COVID-19 and worsens its outcome. It is crucial to measure cardiac biomarkers such as Troponins and NT-pro BNP serially in hospitalized patients to triage the patients, monitor treatment, and to predict prognosis. Our understanding of this novel coronavirus and its cardiovascular implications is still evolving. Researchers around the world need to share the data continuously at a rapid pace so that we can have a detailed understanding of this novel coronavirus and curb the menace it has caused.</p></sec><sec
