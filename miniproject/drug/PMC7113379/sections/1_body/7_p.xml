<p>At present, while there are no established drugs to treat COVID-19, some are showing promise. Chloroquine phosphate, an anti-malarial, has been shown to be useful in treating COVID-19 pneumonia (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>). These patients developed gastrointestinal symptoms and elevated liver function tests. Some patients with severe COVID-19 disease develop cytokine storm and this may be prevented with toclizumab. Passive infusion of polyclonal plasma antibodies from persons who have had COVID-19 infection has been suggested and monoclonal antibodies to COVID-19 are under development (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>). Finally, COVID-19 binds to the soluble portion of the ACE-2 receptor and this seems essential for the virus to enter cells. The possibility of a monoclonal antibody to the soluble portion of the ACE-2 receptor is under consideration. It is uncertain whether stopping the use of ACE 1 inhibitors which increase ACE-2 receptors should be undertaken. However, this may explain the increased virulence of COVID-19 in persons with hypertension and diabetes mellitus. COVID-19 infected patients may do worse if taking ibuprofen, so it is recommended that patients take acetaminophen or paracetamol for fever and pain.
