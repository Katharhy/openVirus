<p>On the other hand, while N95 or N100 respirator masks are highly efficacious in blocking the intake of particles, they are far more difficult to breathe through than are face masks, leading to the desirability of a medical evaluation prior to use. The high impedance of N95/N100 respirators is considerably reduced by the incorporation of a simple “flapper” valve (

 </xref>a) that reduces the work required in exhalation, albeit at a loss of much of the efficacy in trapping exhaled particles. While this is of course not a problem when the respirator’s sole purpose is to trap “dust” particles, it reduces a respirator’s efficiency in trapping exhaled viral/bacterial infectious droplets since they can pass straight through the valve. This has resulted in a directive prohibiting the use of valved respirators as acceptable “face coverings” for the general public in San Francisco, CA
