<p>On October 12, 1918, just over one hundred years ago, Doust and Lyon reported in the 
 <italic>Journal of the American Medical Association</italic> the results of an investigation into the effects of face masks on infections of the respiratory tract.

 </sup> They chose the bacterium 
 <italic>Bacillus prodigiosus</italic> (now called 
 <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic>, an opportunistic pathogen), and a volunteer was instructed to gargle with a suspension of the organism. Agar plates were then placed at 1, 2, 3, . . ., 10 ft, and the volunteer was instructed to talk in an ordinary conversational tone for 5 or 30 min or a loud tone for 5 min or to cough as much as possible for 5 min. The volunteer then left the room; plates were exposed for 10 min (for large droplets to settle), followed by 72 h of incubation and colony counting (which was facilitated due to the production of the red pigment, prodigiosin, by the bacterium). The results were fascinating in that they showed there was a “
 <bold>4 ft danger zone</bold> about the patient” during normal or loud speech and this extended to “
 <bold>a minimum radius of 10 ft</bold>” during coughing. These results led to the first concept of social distancing, now at ∼6 ft (2 m). About 100 years later, high-speed cameras
