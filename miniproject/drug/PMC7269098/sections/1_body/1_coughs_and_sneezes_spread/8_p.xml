 </sup> in 1919, having both infected donors and uninfected acceptors wear masks will reduce the incidence of transmission and that incidence will be given to a first approximation by the product of the probability that a particle escapes from the donor mask multiplied by the probability that it enters the acceptor mask. For example, for the 50% efficiency face mask value suggested by Kellogg and Macmillan,
 <sup>

 </sup> if the donor generates 
 <italic>N</italic> particles in a given volume, that would by definition be reduced to 
 <italic>N</italic>/2 by the donor mask, a value that would then be reduced to 
 <italic>N</italic>/4 by the acceptor mask, a factor of 4 reduction from the no-mask case. For two N95 masks, the result would be on the order of (5/100)
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.0025 or 400×, and for two N100 masks, it would be ∼(0.03/100)
 <sup>2</sup> = 9 × 10
 <sup>–8</sup> or ∼10
 <sup>7</sup>×. For filtered, valved respirators, the effects would be less but would still be very large. However, transmission of infective particles is not just via the nose/mouth.
