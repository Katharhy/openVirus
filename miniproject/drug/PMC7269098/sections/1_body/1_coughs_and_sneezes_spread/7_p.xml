<p>One logical solution we propose to this drawback is to simply incorporate a section of a surgical mask on the inside of the respirator mask valve as a pre-filter,

Unlike the use of full surgical masks for protection, in which there are inevitable leakages around the edges of the mask on inhalation and exhalation, a pre-filtered, valved respirator will provide excellent protection against both inhaled particles, droplets and aerosols, at or slightly better than the efficiency of the unfiltered respirator (since even a “closed valve” may leak slightly) as well as a major reduction in the level of exhaled particles, comparable to or better than that afforded by leaky surgical masks.
