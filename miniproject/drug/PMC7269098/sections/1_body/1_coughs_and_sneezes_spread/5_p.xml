<p>More recently, N95 “respirators” have been developed that are quite effective in blocking particle inhalation. They have a very complex microstructure, and the “95” refers to the specification that such masks block 95% of the entry of 0.3 μm particles, which unfortunately means that 5% of particles are not trapped; these could be infective given that masks may need to be worn for extended time periods. The question then arises: why not make “N100” respirators that block 100% particle (virus, bacterial droplet, aerosol) inhalation? In fact, N100 respirators are made, by the 3M Company, and are designed to block 99.97% particulate inhalation

 </sup>. So, why are N100 respirators not generally discussed? Presumably, this is due to the fact that, while N95 (or KN95) masks are in short supply, N100 masks are in even shorter supply. However, technologically, it is possible to reduce particle transmission from ∼5% (N95) to ∼0.03% (N100), which corresponds to a ∼170× improvement in blocking particle transmission, at least via the nose and mouth. The percentage of particles that penetrate a surgical mask is very variable
