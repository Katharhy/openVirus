 </sup> reviewed the Doust and Lyon paper and made the following proposal: “It is a reasonable corollary to deduce from their experiments that if the infected subject 
 <bold>or carrier</bold> and the noninfected person both wore three-ply butter-cloth face masks when in contact, the protection afforded the noninfected would be doubly efficient and secure. In other words, 
 <bold>during an influenza epidemic if everyone would, or was required to wear a face mask of that character the transmission of the infection from those in the incubation period, sick, convalescent, or from well carriers to the healthy noninfected population would be greatly minimized</bold>”. This is the first proposal for the universal use of face masks as well as an interesting comment about “well [asymptomatic] carriers”.
