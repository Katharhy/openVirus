<p id="sec1">The current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the most serious global pandemic in 100 years. However, in the past, there have been many other, far more deadly pandemics or epidemics, primarily, the Black Death,

 </sup>, each of which killed hundreds of millions of individuals. So, what have we learned about how to control (or prevent) pandemics? While vaccinations and/or effective drugs would by definition solve the current COVID-19 problem and it is often said that these are 12–18 months away, the questions arise: what do we do “next time” when a new pandemic threatens? What can be done in the shorter term to protect healthcare workers? What smallpox, influenza, pneumonic plague, and COVID-19 have in common is that they are transmitted by a respiratory route as well as in many cases via the eye. We thus give a brief history of how viral and bacterial transmission routes were discovered, since this leads to new ways to more effectively prevent transmission.
