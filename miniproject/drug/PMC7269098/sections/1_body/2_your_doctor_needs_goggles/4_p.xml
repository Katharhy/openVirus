<p>Thus, in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic and for past pandemics such as influenza, pneumonic plague, and smallpox as well as for other respiratory viruses, a second transmission route exists and is via the eyes, which is of course why healthcare workers wear goggles. The problem with wearing goggles is that, if they are hermetically sealed, they very rapidly fog up,

  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>c, while if they are ventilated (have holes), they do not protect against aerosols. The problem of fogging arises because aqueous secretions are continuously produced by the lacrimal glands,

 </xref>, and in a hermetically sealed environment, condensation occurs. One ingenious approach to solving the “foggy goggles” problem is the development of filtered eye masks, FEMs,
 <sup>

 </sup> which incorporate a vent that is protected from aerosols by a filter, such as a piece of an N95 mask. Such a filtered eye mask based on (hermetically sealed, swimming) goggles was recently reported
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
 </sup> in which there was a major increase in the time required for fogging, from 5 min to &gt;1 h (

  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>c,d), and it seems very likely that this first proof-of-principle experiment will soon be improved upon by the use of hydrophilic, anti-fog coatings, as currently used in vented goggles (which do not protect against infectious aerosolized particles).
