<p>Maxcy then calculated the relative importance of eye, nose, and mouth exposure to direct droplet spray (including estimates of the effect of blinking, expiration/air currents, and talking) and concluded that there was a 600 mm
 <sup>2</sup> area of eye exposure but only 100 mm
 <sup>2</sup> for the nose and very little for mouth exposure

 </sup>. Building on the work of Doust and Lyon, Maxcy then instilled 
 <italic>B. prodigiosus</italic> into one eye in each of five subjects. The results were that bacteria instilled into the conjunctival sac were recovered on a nasal swab within 5 min of the instillation. Then, after 15–30 min, bacteria were recovered (via a long wire swab) from the nasopharynx, and 24 h later, they were recovered from stool samples, just as with COVID-19. Thus, bacteria can enter the respiratory system via the eye, nasolacrimal duct, and nasopharyngeal system, as can other respiratory viruses,
