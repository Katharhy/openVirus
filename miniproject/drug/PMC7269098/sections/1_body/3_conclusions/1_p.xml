<p>During the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is clear that very large numbers of healthcare workers are being infected, and without improvements in PPE, this would likely occur in future respiratory disease outbreaks in which the ocular route is also involved. The development and use of filtered eye masks would decrease infection, and pre-filtered N100 masks would decrease infection as well as transmission. For the general public, very early use of eye as well as nose/mouth protection would again reduce the number of infected individuals, making testing, contact tracing, and isolation more feasible. However, it does appear that prompt action involving contact tracing/isolation combined with the universal use of PPE has been effective in Taiwan and Austria, at least so far, although face masks are still required in Wuhan and Taiwan, and eye protection may also be needed. What is not known is the degree to which “herd immunity” (without vaccines) will be effective in reducing overall morbidity and mortality: the Swedish Experiment, results of which are eagerly awaited.</p>
