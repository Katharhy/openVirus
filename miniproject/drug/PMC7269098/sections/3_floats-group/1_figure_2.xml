  <p>Illustration of the entry of viruses (or bacteria) into the respiratory system. Both viruses and bacteria can enter via the eyes as well as by the nose and mouth. In the eyes, lacrimal gland secretions and blinking sweep pathogens into the nasolacrimal duct and thence to the nasopharynx and then to the lungs. Entry into the nose leads more directly to the nasopharynx and lungs. Lacrimal gland secretions are also responsible for the fogging of hermetically sealed goggles, reducing their utility. In an infected individual, exhalation via the nose and mouth contributes to disease transmission.</p>
