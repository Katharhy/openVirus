  <p>Filtered nose/mouth respirators and filtered eye masks. (a) Standard N95 respirator, outside view showing the valve. (b) Inside view of an N95 respirator showing the valve (yellow) and surgical mask insert (blue) to be sealed over the valve. (c) Hermetically sealed goggles showing fogging after 5 min of use. (d) A filtered eye mask (FEM) showing no fogging after 1 h of use. The FEM was made from the same goggles as in (c) but with the incorporation of a circular vent covered by a sheet cut from an N95 respirator, indicated by the red arrow, to prevent aerosolized particle entry but allow water vapor exit.
