<p id="Par13">Conversely, more advanced virologic and genetic studies have shown that bats are reservoir hosts of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Yin and Wunderink 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>), and before these viruses spread to humans (Cui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>), they use the other animals as intermediate hosts. Studies have reported that most of the bat CoVs are the gene source of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, whereas most of the bird CoVs are the gene source of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs (Zhou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2020</xref>). Recent studies have shown that the novel virus causing epidemics coincides with the CoV isolated in bats (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2020a</xref>; Zhou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2020</xref>; Drexler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2010</xref>). The presence of the wild animal trade in the Huanan seafood market, where the first cases appeared, supports this finding (Wu et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2020</xref>).
