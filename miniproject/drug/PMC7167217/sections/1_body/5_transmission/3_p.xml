<p id="Par14">After the first outbreak, secondary cases began to be reported after approximately 10 days (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2020c</xref>). Moreover, while these new patients had no contact with the marketplace, they had a history of contact with humans there (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2020c</xref>). Confirmed recent reports from many infected healthcare workers in Wuhan show that human-to-human transmission can occur (Chan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>). As in SARS and MERS epidemics in the past, human-to-human transmission has accelerated the spread of the outbreak, and case reports have also started from other provinces in China (Luk et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>). The first non-Chinese case of the infection, which spread to the Chinese provinces, and then to the Asian continent, was reported from Thailand on January 13, 2020 (World Health Organization, 2019-nCoV Situation Report-41 on 01 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>). The patient reported being a Chinese tourist who had traveled to Thailand and had no epidemiologic connection with the marketplace (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020a</xref>). Other evidence from overseas countries such as the USA (Holshue et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>) and France has continued to be reported (Stoecklin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2020</xref>). This virus disseminated to the Midle Eastern region; for example, Iran was a region with potential to develop a major epidemiologic problem for healthcare (Zamani Ghaleshahi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2020</xref>; Tuite et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2020</xref>). This virus has the potential to become a pandemic problem (MacIntyre
