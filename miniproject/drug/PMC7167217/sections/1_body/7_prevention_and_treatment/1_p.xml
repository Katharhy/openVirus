<p id="Par21">In general, there are few or no treatment options for viral diseases of sudden occurrence (Nguyen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>). Today, there is no vaccine or effective treatment to prevent COVID-19 infection (Nguyen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>). Molecules are being tested for COVID-19 in in-vitro and human-based SARS-CoV, and MERS-Cov trials, and studies evaluating the antiviral activity of types I and II interferons have reported interferon-beta (IFNb) as the most potent interferon, which reduced in-vitro MERS-CoV replication (Nguyen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>; Arabi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2018</xref>). According to a human MERS-CoV case report from South Korea, use of the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) (anti-HIV drugs), pegylated interferon and ribavirin provided successful viral clearance (Arabi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2018</xref>). Another antiviral drug, remdesivir, was used in the first case reported in the USA, and it seemed successful; however, more cases are needed (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>). In-vitro studies have shown that viral RNA transcription was terminated with remdesivir in the early stages. Remdesivir showed strong antiviral activity in epithelial cell cultures against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and related zoonotic bat CoVs (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2020b</xref>; Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>; Brown et al.
