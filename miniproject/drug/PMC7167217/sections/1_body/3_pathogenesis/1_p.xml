<p id="Par10">SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV attach to the host cell respectively bind to cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (SARS-CoV associated) and cellular receptor of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (MERS-CoV associated) (Tortorici et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2019</xref>; Park et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2019</xref>; Letko et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2020</xref>). The viral RNA replicates in the cytoplasm after entering the cell (Letko et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2020</xref>). Genomic RNA is encapsulated and polyadenylated, and it encodes various structural and non-structural polypeptide genes (Cui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>; Subissi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2014</xref>). These polyproteins are split by proteases that exhibit chymotrypsin-like activity (Subissi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2014</xref>; Goo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>). The resulting complex drives (−) RNA production through both replication and transcription (Jordan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>). During replication, full-length (−) RNA copies of the genome are produced and used as a template for full-length (+) RNA genomes (Cui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>; Jordan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>). During transcription, a subset of 7–9 sub-genomic RNAs, including those encoding all structural proteins, are produced by discontinuous transcription (Cui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>; Jordan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>). Viral nucleocapsids are combined from genomic RNA and R protein in the cytoplasm and then are budded into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (Cui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>). Virions are then released from the infected cell through exocytosis (Cui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>). The released viruses can infect kidney cells, liver cells, the intestines and T lymphocytes, as well as the lower respiratory tract, where they cause the main symptoms and signs. Remarkably, CDT lymphocytes were found to be &lt; 200 cells/mm3 in three patients with SARS-CoV infection (Cui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>; Luk et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>; Paraskevis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). MERS-CoV can affect human dendritic cells, macrophages and T lymphocytes. This virus can make the antiviral T cell response irregular because of the stimulation of T cell apoptosis, thus causing a collapse of the immune system (Farooq et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>; Park et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2019</xref>; Goo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>; Cockrell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2016</xref>).
