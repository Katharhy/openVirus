<p id="Par18">In a cohort study that surveyed 41 hospitalized patients, fever, dry cough, myalgia and fatigue symptoms were reported in most patients; less often, symptoms of expectoration, headache, hemoptysis and diarrhea were also observed (Huang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>). According to the study, comorbidities such as underlying diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cardiovascular disease were found in about half of these patients (Huang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>). In addition, patients developed dyspnea accompanied by abnormal thorax CT compatible with pneumonia at mean 8 days after admission (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>). Complications include ARDS, acute heart damage, secondary infections and pneumothorax. Similar to the previous data, x-rays or thorax CT images of the patients revealed unilateral or bilateral lung involvement, compatible with viral pneumonia. Bilateral multiple lobular and sub-segmental consolidation areas were present in patients in the intensive care unit (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>; Gralinski and Menachery

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>; Jin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2020</xref>). The patients with underlying comorbidity exhibited a more severe clinical course, as expected from the experience gained from the previous epidemics (Jin et al.
