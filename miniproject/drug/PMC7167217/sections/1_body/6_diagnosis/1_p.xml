<p id="Par17">Before the cases of SARS-CoV, it was thought that human CoVs lead to a cold-like upper respiratory infection and self-limiting lower respiratory infection (Yin and Wunderink 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>). The first death due to coronaviruses was reported by the isolation of SARS-CoV from a patient with pneumonia in China (Ksiazek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2003</xref>). As in other respiratory infection viruses and previous beta-CoVs, there are similarities in the clinical aspects of COVID-19 infections, and it is known that the clinical picture varies from simple respiratory infections to septic shock (Gralinski and Menachery 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>). Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which have caused epidemics in the past years (Yin and Wunderink 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>), the first symptoms are commonly fever, cough and shortness of breath (Huang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>). Although diarrhea was present in about 20â€“25% of patients with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection (Yin and Wunderink 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>), intestinal symptoms have rarely been reported in patients with COVID-19 (Huang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>). In another study, which included 99 patients, chest pain, confusion and nausea-vomiting were noted in addition to previous findings (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>). On x-rays or thorax CT imaging of the examined patients, unilateral or bilateral involvement compatible with viral pneumonia was found, and bilateral multiple lobular and sub-segmental consolidation areas were observed in patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>; Huang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>; Tang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020b</xref>).
