<p id="Par8">Hospital-acquired secondary infections have been described for all three pathogens (Cui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>). Despite the knowledge about its etiology, no studies have reported a successful drug to treat the diagnosed patients (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2020b</xref>; Nguyen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>). Regarding the epidemic periods, SARS-CoV has had the shortest reported epidemic period so far, ending less than a year after its outbreak (Luk et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>), and the MERS-CoV epidemic lasted for 7 years even though its spread was toward a more restricted area (Farooq et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>). The questions that follow are how long this novel COVID-19 strain outburst will last and what its impact on the world population will be, questions everyone is curious about.
