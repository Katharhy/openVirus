<p id="Par3">CoVs have a high mutation rate (Cui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>). Zoonotic pathogens (Peiris et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2003</xref>) are present in humans and various animals and can cause clinical problems in the human respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic and neurologic systems with a wide range of asymptomatic strains that lead to hospitalization of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) (Cui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>; Holshue et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>). CoVs used to be considered mild pathogens for humans and are the cause of the common cold (Peiris et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2003</xref>), but they have gained more attention since being connected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China in 2002 and 2003 with mortality rates of 10% for SARS-CoV (Ksiazek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2003</xref>; Yin and Wunderink 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>). The next of these outbreaks, and its control, occurred approximately 1 decade after SARS-CoV, when another highly pathogenic CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), emerged in Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia with a 37% mortality rate (Yin and Wunderink 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>; Zaki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2012</xref>; Farooq et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>). Since December 8, 2019, a series of cases of pneumonia of of unknown etiologic origin emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China (Zhu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2020</xref>). This problem has been the focus of global attention because of clinical presentations, resembling viral epidemic pneumonia of unknown cause (Shen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2020</xref>; Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>). Most patients worked at or lived near the local Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where livestock animals are traded (Zhu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2020</xref>; Shen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2020</xref>; Imai et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>).
