<p id="Par2">Coronaviruses (CoVs) are non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses in the Coronaviridae family, Nidovirales order (Woo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>; Cui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>). These viruses characteristically contain crown-shaped peplomers of 80–160 nM size with 27–32 kb positive polarity (Woo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>; Cui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>). CoVs are pleomorphic and broadly distributed in mammals, especially humans. They have very high recombination rates. Therefore, they are constantly developing transcription errors and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) jumps (Woo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>; Cui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>).
