  <p>A. Location of the epidemic network. Centered on Wuhan, the province of Hubei shows three (road, railroad and air) networks. In addition, Wuhan has river-mediated connections (not shown). B. Temporal progression of covid-19 fatalities in twenty Chinese areas. C. Differentiation of epidemic nodes. To facilitate visualization, the same plot shown in A is displayed with truncated data. At least four groups of data patterns are observed: (i) the rank I node (composed only by Hubei data), which includes most fatalities at all times, (ii) the rank II node (composed of Heilongjiang and Henan data), which reported the second highest number of deaths; (iii) the rank III node (composed of Anhui and Chongqing data), which reported fewer deaths and they were observed after those of rank I and II nodes; and (iv) the remaining provinces, which did not display a slope and generated only one or no secondary fatalities. D. Synchronicity. A truncated set displays the data of rank I and II nodes. It is shown that Heilongjiang and Henan (the two provinces included in the rank II node) became activated at the same time and exhibited a similar increase in the number of fatalities over 18 consecutive days. E. Smallworld (long-distance) connections. A map that includes the provincial capitals of Heilongjiang (Harbin) and Henan (Zhengzhou), as well as the shortest link between these cities and Wuhan, Hubei, supports the notion that both short- and long-distance connections took place. Heilongjiang demonstrated smallworld epidemic connections (and synchronicity with Henan) even though the population of Heilongjiang is ∼2.5 smaller than that of Henan. F. Directionality. A truncated set of data demonstrates a non-random pattern in the temporal sequence of events: rank I node displayed a linear or exponential growth in the number of fatalities before rank II node deaths began to increase; similarly, the mortality of the rank II node were increasing while the number of rank III node deaths was unchanged. These patterns suggest a ‘from-high-to-low rank’ directionality in the number of fatalities. G. Earliest data patterns. A truncated plot displays the earliest data patterns of Hubei and Henan fatalities. The first phase does not show a structured or distinct pattern. Instead, both the data collected in Hubei and observations gathered in its northern neighbor, Henan, reveal a horizontal pattern (dark brown rectangle). Only later (about a month later in Hubei, one week later in Henan), a stage characterized by a linear growth in the number of fatalities is observed (red lines), which later becomes quadratic or exponential (blue line). Therefore, to be both effective and less costly, interventions should occur during the earliest (horizontal)stage.
