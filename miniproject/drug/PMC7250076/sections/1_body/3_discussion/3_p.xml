<p id="par0100">It is suggested that the fact that epidemic networks show highly structured (non-random) and distinct patterns can foster novel research opportunities in basic science. Because specific geographical locations are both fragmented (heterogeneous) and dynamic â€“ at least seasons and human mobility differ over time), they cannot be assumed or hypothesized. Yet, they can be explicitly measured. These precisions matter when responses, to be rapidly deployed and effective, have to be geographically specific. That is so because the Critical Response Time (time available to choose and deploy a policy expected to be successful) may be extremely short in a rapidly disseminating epidemic (
