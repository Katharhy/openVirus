<p id="par0130">The fact that bio-geo-temporal interactions may follow Network properties complements and, probably, may expand current research efforts on infectious diseases. One area of paramount relevance is antimicrobial resistance (AMR). While usually described with emphasis on bacterial pathogens and their ability to reproduce in the presence of antibiotics, the survival of viral pathogens to antiviral drugs is also included in the study of AMR. While geo-referenced data on bacterial and viral strains, as well as data on resistance against antibiotics and antiviral drugs are available, they are necessary but not necessarily sufficient to understand and/or predict how and/or when infectious diseases will spread and where they are more likely to affect specific subpopulations (
