<p id="par0090">Findings supported the view that, once the epidemic structure is consolidated (after a brief phase reveals a linear growth in fatalities), the epidemic progression may display network properties. While anticipated 22 years ago (
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">Watts and Strogatz, 1998</xref>), this is the first demonstration of network properties – including smallworld connections – in human epidemics. Supporting the potential epidemic role of long-distance (smallworld), rapidly connecting structures, the cumulative number of fatalities did not correlate with either Euclidian distance or population. In contrast, a network-based, geo-temporal analysis detected and differentiated three epidemic nodes. Because classic epidemiological concepts –including Euclidian distances, geographical assessments of population density, and the ratio of secondary infections generated per primary infections (also known as the basic reproductive number or
