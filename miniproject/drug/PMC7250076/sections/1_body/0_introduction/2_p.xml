<p id="par0030">A network may be defined as a set of lines that connects circles (nodes). Accordingly, an epidemic node could be categorized as the smallest surface that (i) includes an explicit connection, (ii) captures most infections per time point, and (iii) reports secondary deaths (

Assortativity distinguishes the magnitude of infections reported by epidemic nodes of different influence on epidemic dispersal. Synchronicity reveals epidemic nodes that are activated at the same time and exhibit similar number of infections per unit of time. Smallworld connections are those that, regardless of the distance between nodes, may induce outbreaks (e.g., air travel connections).
