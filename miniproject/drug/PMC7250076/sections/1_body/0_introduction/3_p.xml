<p id="par0035">While earlier studies have documented network properties in rapidly disseminating epidemics that affect non-human species, such properties have not yet been explored in human epidemics (
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Rivas et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, this study pursued to: (i) elucidate whether the early COVID -19 epidemic revealed network-like properties; (ii) distinguish epidemic nodes; and (iii) using real-time assessments, confirm or reject the properties and classifications previously mentioned.
