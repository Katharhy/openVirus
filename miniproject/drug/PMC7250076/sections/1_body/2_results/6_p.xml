<p id="par0080">To elucidate whether the geo-temporal series depicted in 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B and C were similar, a curve-fitting regression algorithm tested the slopes of rank Iâ€“III nodes. Data patterns distinguished three epidemic nodes: (1) rank I (Hubei only), (2) rank II (the sum of deaths reported in Heilongjiang and Henan provinces), and (3) rank III (the sum of deaths reported in Anhui and Chongqing provinces). To determine whether the slopes of these epidemic nodes differed, six curve-fitting regression analyses investigated linear, logarithmic, power, growth, exponential, and logistic regression models, respectively.
