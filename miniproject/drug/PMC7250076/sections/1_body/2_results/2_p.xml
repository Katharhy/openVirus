<p id="par0060">Not all provinces were epidemic nodes: Jiangxi and Jilin had one fatality each (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). Thus, these two provinces did not generate secondary fatalities. In contrast, the slopes of geo-temporal data on mortality differentiated, at least, three epidemic nodes: (i) rank I (Hubei), (ii) rank II (Heilongjiang and Henan), and (iii) rank III (Anhui and Chongqing) nodes (
