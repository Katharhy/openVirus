<p id="par0085">The time series correlated with the mortality series. The power curve was the best fitting model for all three slopes. Using the unstandardized slope regression coefficients and standard errors of the coefficients for the power curve models, 
 <italic>z</italic>-tests compared pairs (rank I vs. rank II, rank I vs. rank III, and rank II vs. rank III) of regression coefficients (

 <italic>z</italic>-test values ranged between 4.73 and 11.88. All three 
 <italic>z</italic>-test values exceeded the 
 <italic>z</italic>-critical value for alpha = 0.001 two-tailed test, which is 
 <italic>z</italic>  = 3.30. Therefore, rank I-III nodes were statistically significantly different from one another.
