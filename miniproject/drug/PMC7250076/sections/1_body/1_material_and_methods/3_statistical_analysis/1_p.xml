<p id="par0050">Data patterns distinguished three epidemic nodes: (1) rank I (Hubei only), (2) rank II (the sum of deaths reported in Heilongjiang and Henan provinces), and (3) rank III (the sum of deaths reported in Anhui and Chongqing provinces). To determine whether the slopes of these epidemic nodes differed, six curve-fitting regression analyses investigated linear, logarithmic, power, growth, exponential, and logistic regression models, respectively. Analyses and figures were conducted or made with commercial packages (IBM SPSS Statistics 24, IBM Corp, Armonk, NY; and Minitab 18, Minitab LLC, State College, PA, USA).</p>
