<p id="par0040">Epidemic and georeferenced data were collected from public sources as well as ESRI Data and Maps for ArcGIS (2019) and ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World (ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA, USA) (

 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Rivas et al., 2012</xref>), the absence of high-resolution (point-based) georeferenced data prevented the use of that procedure. In light of this limitation, an empirical analysis was conducted on sites suspected to be acting as epidemic nodes, that is, to determine whether they expressed network properties. Epidemic nodes were differentiated by data patterns: those that reported more fatalities were assigned the lowest ranks and those presenting with fewer or no secondary deaths received the highest rank. Therefore, one epidemic rank could include more than one province.
