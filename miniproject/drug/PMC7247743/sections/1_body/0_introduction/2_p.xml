<p id="Par3">Initially the response from China and elsewhere was for scientists to look at compounds tested previously against SARS and MERS almost exclusively (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>). Ritonavir/lopinavir, remdesivir (repurposed from Ebola and FDA emergency approved), chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (both now FDA emergency approved, see Supplementary Material) are the most well-known compounds currently in clinical trials. Other drug repurposing efforts have used computational approaches such as docking or biological network mining to identify molecules as candidates for future testing (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>) (Supplementary Material). To date there have been few large-scale high-throughput repurposing screens of antiviral inhibition described in the literature (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>). These data as well as the earlier SARS and MERS data (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>) could ultimately be useful for machine learning models in order to predict new molecules from a much wider array of sources and select compounds to test
