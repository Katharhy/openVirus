<p id="Par5">This information led us on a larger search for quaternary ammonium compounds with activity against coronaviruses and possible identification of chemicals that have already been tested in the clinic and could be used as a potential treatment for COVID-19 (Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). One of the disinfectants that has been shown to be destructive to viruses (Supplementary Material) and widely used in personal care products is cetylpyridinium chloride (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>). This compound is found predominantly in mouthwashes and is listed by the FDA as Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) such that it is also being used as an antimicrobial agent for meat and poultry products (up to 1%). Cetylpyridinium chloride has been used in multiple clinical trials (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>), including as a treatment against respiratory infections (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>) validating its use as an antiviral. Cetylpyridinium likely promotes virus inactivation by destroying the capsid as well as through its lysosomotropic action, which, as discussed above, is common for quaternary ammonium compounds. This raises the question as to whether some of the drugs identified with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> behave similarly, namely they may destroy the virus capsid as well as accumulating in the lysosome or endosomes and ultimately blocking viral entry. Additional published studies have suggested that this effect can be attenuated by the use of Cathepsin-L inhibitors (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>). Another potential treatment candidate is miramistin (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), a

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>), but it does not appear to have been adopted in the rest of the world. There are numerous FDA approved drugs that have a quaternary nitrogen, and it is possible these could also have a similar broad antiseptic effect.
