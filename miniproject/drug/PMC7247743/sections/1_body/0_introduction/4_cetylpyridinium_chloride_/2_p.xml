<p id="Par6">The current COVID-19 pandemic is sweeping the globe at an unprecedented rate fanned by our global connectivity. To date it has spurred drug discovery activity (albeit considerably impacted by research laboratory shutdowns) and much interest in drug repurposing in the hope of delivering effective drugs to the patient faster. The success of this approach will take time to validate as we await clinical trial data from all of the earliest compounds in the clinic. We hypothesized that text mining of the available published literature in PubMed would enable us to identify compounds faster that have been tested against other coronaviruses, but which were not currently being evaluated clinically. Our studies guided by this approach suggest that while many drugs have been tested, the lysosomotropic agent ammonium chloride and quaternary ammonium compounds such as cetylpyridinium chloride and miramistin may produce the desired antiviral effect but have not as yet been tested against SARS-CoV-2

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Limitations of the text mining approach are that at the time of writing there had only been reports of approximately 450 molecules associated with other coronaviruses and many of these could likely be discounted due to no reported antiviral activity, toxicity and perhaps most important, the lack of FDA approved status.
