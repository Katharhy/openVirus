In December 31 the pneumonia cases of unknown origin were officially reported; in early January 2020, market store owners were evacuated in succession; and Hubei Province began to investigate the source of the virus. However, after only two weeks, the number of mysterious pneumonia cases nationwide had reached 198 by January 18, then reaching 830 by January 23 [

The “Level 1 Emergency Response to major public health emergencies” was implemented, and comprehensive epidemic prevention began. One week later (January 30), the official reported number of confirmed domestic cases had reached 9,692, which exceeded the total number of previous cases of SARS in the world [

The Chinese government also made a series of significant responses in a very short period of time, including the establishment of a leading group of experts for epidemic response [
