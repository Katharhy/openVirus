  <p>Schematic Illustration of the Phases of COVID-19, Showing the Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 Replication and the Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses</p>
  <p>The illness can be divided into three phases: pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, and recovery. Viral replication occurs during the late pre-symptomatic and early symptomatic phases. Innate immune responses follow, including activation of macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. In severe disease, innate responses are exaggerated and remain elevated, contributing to tissue damage. Cellular immune responses with antigen-specific B and T cells are detected within the first week of infection in mild to moderate COVID-19 cases (
