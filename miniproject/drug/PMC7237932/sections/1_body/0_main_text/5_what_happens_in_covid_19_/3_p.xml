<p id="p0065">The pathogenesis of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is complex, and we are still learning about it at the time of this writing. The viral spike glycoprotein binds to the cell surface receptor ACE2 (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Hoffmann etÂ al., 2020</xref>), which plays an important regulatory role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The physiological role of ACE2 is in regulation of blood pressure; ACE2 metabolizes angiotensin II, a vasoconstrictor, to generate angiotensin 1-7, which is a vasodilator. Cells lining the mucosal surfaces of the nose and lungs are endowed with ACE2, which facilitates infection of the respiratory tract. However, ACE2 is also expressed on cells in many other tissues, including the endothelium, heart, gut, and kidneys, making these organs susceptible to infection by the virus.
