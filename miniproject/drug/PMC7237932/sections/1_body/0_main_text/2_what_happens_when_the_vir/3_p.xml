<p id="p0025">When host cells are infected by viruses, type I interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines are expressed, cellular translation is suppressed, and an antiviral state is induced. However, many respiratory viruses are able to block IFN activation and/or signaling and inhibit apoptosis. This prevents the host from effectively clearing virally infected cells and also induces an antiviral state in neighboring cells, promoting viral replication in infected tissues that may contribute to the observed pathology.</p>
