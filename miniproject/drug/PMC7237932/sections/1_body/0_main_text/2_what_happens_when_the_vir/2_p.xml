<p id="p0020">After attachment to the receptor, the virus gains entry into the cell, and the viral genome is uncoated, releasing the viral genetic material, which is RNA in paramyxoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, and coronaviruses and DNA in adenoviruses. Viral transcription to produce viral proteins and viral replication to copy the viral genome are complex events unique to each viral family and occur in specific cellular compartments, although all viruses have crucial interactions with host cell proteins. Replication of paramyxoviruses, including RSV and parainfluenza viruses, occurs in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Influenza viruses are replicated entirely within the nucleus, and they utilize a unique strategy of “stealing” methylated capped ends of host cell messenger RNA (mRNA) as primers for viral mRNAs. The replication cycle of coronaviruses occurs entirely in the cytoplasm and involves generation of a series of subgenomic RNAs. Progeny virions are released from the infected cell into the respiratory tract, where they are shed by coughing and sneezing.</p>
