<p id="p0030">When a person is infected with a respiratory virus, there is an incubation period before onset of clinical signs and symptoms. During the incubation period, the virus attaches to and infects cells, replicates its genome, and spreads to infect adjacent cells. The incubation period for influenza is short, typically 1–2 days, whereas for SARS-CoV-2, it is 4.5–5.8 days (

 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Infection of the nasal, nasopharyngeal, and oropharyngeal mucosa causes a runny nose, coughing, sneezing, and sore throat, whereas tracheobronchitis or croup presents with a characteristic barking seal-like cough. Bronchitis refers to inflammation of the bronchi and presents with a cough; bronchiolitis, involving the smaller distal airways, is characteristic of RSV infection in young infants and presents with wheezing. Pneumonia occurs when infection and inflammation involve the alveoli and lung parenchyma and is associated with a cough and shortness of breath. Rhinovirus, adenovirus, and human coronavirus infections are usually limited to the upper respiratory tract. Parainfluenza viruses cause croup, RSV causes bronchiolitis and influenza, and SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 can cause pneumonia (
