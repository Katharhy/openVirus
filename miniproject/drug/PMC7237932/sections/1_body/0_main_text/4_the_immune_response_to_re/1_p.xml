<p id="p0035">The immune system responds to viral infection with cellular and humoral (antibodies, complement, and antimicrobial peptides) responses. These responses are initiated by the innate immune system, which recognizes pathogens and induces production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This is followed by responses of the adaptive immune system, which consists of TÂ cells, which can directly kill virus-infected cells, and B cells, which produce pathogen-specific antibodies in the serum and at mucosal surfaces (
