<p id="p0010">Viral respiratory infections result when a virus infects the cells of the respiratory mucosa; this can occur when virus particles are inhaled or directly contact a mucosal surface of the nose or eyes. Infected individuals shed virus into the environment by coughing or sneezing or even during quiet breathing. Virus shed during coughing and sneezing is often present in large droplets that fall out of the air within a short distance. If the virus falls on a surface and survives, it can be transmitted when someone touches the infected surface and then touches their nose, eyes, or mouth. Virus is also spread by the airborne route in the form of small (&lt;5 μm) droplet nuclei that can remain suspended for long periods of time and can be inhaled into the lower respiratory tract. The relative contribution of different particle sizes and of direct contact versus airborne transmission as a means of spread differs among the respiratory viruses. Influenza viruses are spread by contact as well as by airborne transmission, but the mode of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still being discussed. Some viruses are more fragile than others; for example, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the most important respiratory virus in early childhood, does not survive for long on inanimate surfaces, whereas coronaviruses are much more stable in the environment (

Cough etiquette, hand hygiene, and surface decontamination are effective control measures for a virus that is spread by direct contact and large droplets. Preventing airborne spread via droplet nuclei requires use of special measures such as P2/N95 masks or respirators and special air handling.
