<p id="p0090">Immunomodulators may ameliorate severe COVID-19 and could be useful as adjuncts to antiviral agents (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Cytokine release syndrome and the observation of elevated levels of serum IL-6 and other proinflammatory cytokines in patients with severe COVID-19 has prompted trials of drugs that inhibit the IL-6 pathway, such as tocilizumab and sarilumab. Antibodies that can block the infectivity of the virus can be derived from the plasma of recovered patients or from monoclonal antibodies generated from B cells from recovered patients or phage display libraries. Convalescent plasma has been used in SARS and severe influenza (
