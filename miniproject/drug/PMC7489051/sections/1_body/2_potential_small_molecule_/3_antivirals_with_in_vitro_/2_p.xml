 </sup> The efficacy of the commercially available drugs ribavirin, nitazoxanide, penciclovir, nafamostat, CQ/HCQ, remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734), and favipiravir (FPV, T-705) was evaluated for activity against SARS-CoV-2 
 <italic>in vitro.</italic> Among all seven tested drugs, CQ/HCQ and RDV potently blocked viral infection at low micromolar concentrations in cell cultures and showed a high selective index (SI) against SARS-CoV-2.
