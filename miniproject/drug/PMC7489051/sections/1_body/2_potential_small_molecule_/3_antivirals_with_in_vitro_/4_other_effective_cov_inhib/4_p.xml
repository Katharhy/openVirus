<p>Another alkaloid, lycorine (

 <italic>Amaryllidaceae</italic> plants, has been reported to inhibit poliomyelitis virus, Bunyamwera virus, herpes simplex virus, dengue virus, West Nile virus, and SARS-CoV

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75">75</xref>) Lycorine exhibited significant inhibition of SARS-CoV in Vero cell-based cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assays, with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.0157 μM, CC
 <sub>50</sub> of 14.98 μM, and an SI of 954.

 </sup> The anti-CoV activity of lycorine was recently confirmed by Shen and colleagues.

 </sup> Furthermore, they found that lycorine protected BALB/c mice against lethal HCoV-OC43 infection by suppressing viral replication in the central nervous system. Twenty days after HCoV-OC43 infection, intraperitoneal injection of lycorine at 15 mg/kg provided 83.3% protection in infected mice, similar to the survival rate of the CQ-treated group.

 </sup> These results suggest that lycorine could be a broad-spectrum antiviral agent against CoV infection and might offer promising therapeutic possibilities for combating SARS-CoV-2 infection.
