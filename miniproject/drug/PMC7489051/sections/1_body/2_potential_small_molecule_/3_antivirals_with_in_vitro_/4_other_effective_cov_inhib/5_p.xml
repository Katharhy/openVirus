 </sup> Recently, Hoffman et al. indicated that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the SARS-CoV receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the cellular protease transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to enter lung cells. Camostat was able to inhibit TMPRSS2, effectively inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 entry into mouse lung cells.

 </sup> These findings suggest that camostat may be a valuable therapeutic against COVID-19.
