<p>Another guanine derivative, ribavirin (

 </sup> On January 18, 2020, a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving 199 hospitalized severe COVID-19 patients was initiated to evaluate the efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir treatment in hospitals in Wuhan, China. Disappointingly, no differences were observed between lopinavir/ritonavir treatment and standard care in clinical improvement or mortality within 28 days.
