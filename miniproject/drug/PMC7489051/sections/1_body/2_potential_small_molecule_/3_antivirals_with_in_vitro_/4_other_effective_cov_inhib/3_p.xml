 </sup> Various studies showed that matrine exhibited antiviral activities against coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) in Vero cells and influenza H3N2 virus in MDCK cells.

 </sup> Recently, Jing et al. evaluated the therapeutic effect of matrine sodium chloride in a mouse pneumonia model infected with HCoV-229E. The results showed that intraperitoneal injection of matrine sodium chloride significantly decreased the pathological damage to the lung tissue and reduced the lung index. The percentage of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, the number of B cells in peripheral blood, the production of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and the viral load in the lung were significantly inhibited compared to those in the controls. Therefore, matrine sodium chloride showed a therapeutic effect on HCoV-229E-infected mice via a mechanism related to the regulation of immune function.
