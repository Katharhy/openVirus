<p>CQ (
 <bold>1</bold>), a widely used antimalarial and autoimmune inhibitory drug, was reported to be a potential broad-spectrum antiviral drug.

 </sup> Recently, Wang et al. evaluated the antiviral effect of CQ against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> in Vero E6 cells. CQ was able to block viral replication at a low concentration [effective concentration for 50% inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 1.13 μM] with acceptable cytotoxicity (50% cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) of &gt;100 μM).

 <sup>

 </sup> showed that CQ inhibited the replication of three human CoVs, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, and HCoV-229E, respectively, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> at submicromolar concentrations. Keyaerts et al. developed an 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> model to test CQ against HCoV-OC43 in newborn C57BL/6 mice. The highest survival rate (98.6%) was found when the mother mice were treated daily with CQ at a dose of 15 mg/kg body weight (BW).

 </sup> These results suggested that CQ might be an effective drug to manage human CoV infections. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in February 2020, CQ and its analog HCQ have drawn intense attention, and a series of clinical trials evaluating the therapeutic effects of CQ and HCQ on SARS-CoV-2 have been conducted in several countries. Huang and collaborators performed a multicenter prospective observational study to evaluate the clinical effects of CQ on SARS-CoV-2, in which a total of 197 patients from 12 hospitals in Guangdong and Hubei Provinces in China were treated with CQ, and 176 patients were included as historical controls. The median time for viral RNA to be undetectable and the duration of fever were shorter in the CQ-treated group than in the control group. The authors suggested that CQ could be a cost-effective therapy without serious adverse events for combating the COVID-19 pandemic.
