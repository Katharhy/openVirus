<p>Chen et al. conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label multicenter trial involving adult patients with COVID-19. A total of 240 enrolled COVID-19 patients were randomly assigned to receive conventional therapy plus FPV or Arbidol (120 patients in each group), a broad-spectrum antiviral compound that blocks viral fusion,

 </sup> for 10 days. The results showed that FPV led to significantly shorter latencies to relief of pyrexia by 1.70 days and cough by 1.75 days. However, no differences were observed in the rate of auxiliary oxygen therapy or noninvasive mechanical ventilation. The most frequently observed FPV-associated adverse event was elevation of serum uric acid.
