<p>HCQ sulfate, a derivative of CQ, was first synthesized in 1946 by introducing a hydroxyl group into CQ, and it showed significantly reduced (∼40%) toxicity compared to CQ.

 </sup> Gautret et al. conducted the first open-label, nonrandomized controlled clinical trial for a therapeutic evaluation of HCQ in 36 COVID-19 patients in France and suggested that 600 mg/day HCQ significantly reduced viral loads in these patients. They also showed that when HCQ was used in combination with azithromycin, it was more efficacious.

 </sup> However, this report was questionable because six HCQ-treated patients who withdrew from the study were excluded from their data analysis. The beneficial outcomes of HCQ treatment on COVID-19 patients were also confirmed by Chen et al., a medical team in Wuhan, China. They conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial that included 62 patients to test the efficacy of HCQ and showed that HCQ treatment significantly shortened the disease course.

 </sup> However, the effectiveness of HCQ for treating COVID-19 has been the subject of debate.

 </sup> Recently, Tang and other groups reported various contradictory effects of HCQ in COVID-19 patients, which disapproved the use of HCQ.

 </sup> Tang and colleagues conducted an open-label, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of HCQ in 150 COVID-19 patients within the mild to moderate clinical classifications. The results showed that HCQ did not lead to a significantly higher probability of negative conversion compared to standard care alone in hospitalized patients with persistent mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms. Adverse events, mainly diarrhea, were significantly higher in patients who received HCQ.

 </sup> Another recent study of HCQ in 181 COVID-19 patients who required oxygen also did not support the use of HCQ in patients admitted to the hospital who required oxygen.

 </sup> In addition, Mehra and colleagues recently conducted a multinational registry analysis of the use of HCQ or CQ with or without a macrolide for the treatment of COVID-19, in which 96 032 patients from 671 hospitals on six continents were included. The results showed that HCQ or CQ, used with or without a macrolide, was associated with decreased in-hospital survival, and increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias.

 </sup> Therefore, the FDA withdrew the emergency approval for HCQ as treatment of COVID-19 based on its ineffectiveness and serious side effects.
