<p>Recent studies directed at PL
 <sup>pro</sup> suggested potential roles beyond viral peptide cleavage, including deISGylation, deubiquitination, and involvement in evasion of the innate immune response.

 </sup> Compared to the existing SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors, fewer natural compounds have been reported for PL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibition. Since 2012, Park et al. have made ongoing efforts to develop CoV PL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors. They isolated nine diarylheptanoids from 
 <italic>Alnus japonica</italic> and found that hirsutenone (
 <bold>32</bold>) exhibited an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 4.1 μM with noncompetitive inhibition. Further structure–activity relationship analysis suggested that the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups linked to a catechol moiety in the structure of hirsutenone were the key requirement for PL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibition.

 </sup> In a later study, they found a polyphenol, papyriflavonol A (
 <bold>33</bold>), derived from 
 <italic>Broussonetia papyrifera</italic>, with a promising inhibitory effect on PL
 <sup>pro</sup> (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 3.7 μM).

 </sup> Kim et al. found that the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>Psoralea corylifolia</italic> seeds showed strong activity against SARS-CoV PL
 <sup>pro</sup> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 15 μg/mL). Furthermore, they demonstrated that six flavonoids isolated from the ethanol extract displayed PL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibition in a dose-dependent manner with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 4.2 to 38.4 μM, in which the compounds isobavachalcone (
 <bold>34</bold>) and psoralidin (
 <bold>35</bold>) were the most promising, inhibiting PL
 <sup>pro</sup> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 7.3 and 4.2 μM, respectively. Interestingly, the inhibition kinetics analysis by Lineweaver–Burk plots showed that isobavachalcone and psoralidin are mixed-type inhibitors, as the two compounds exhibited affinities for both the substrate-bound and free enzymes.

 </sup> Similarly, the cinnamic amide terrestrimine (
 <bold>36</bold>), isolated from 
 <italic>Tribulus terrestris</italic> fruits, was also found to be a mixed-type inhibitor with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 15.8 μM.
