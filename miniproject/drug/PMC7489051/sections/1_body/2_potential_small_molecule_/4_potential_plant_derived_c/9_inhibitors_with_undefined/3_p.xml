<p>The antiviral activities of 15 GL derivatives against SARS-CoV replication in Vero cells were evaluated by Hoever and colleagues. Among the 15 derivatives tested, seven inhibited SARS-CoV replication at concentrations lower than GL. Addition of 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine into the GL glycoside chain increased anti-SARS-CoV activity approximately 9 times compared to GL. Compound 
 <bold>52</bold> inhibited SARS-CoV replication (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 40 μM with a CC
 <sub>50</sub> of &gt;3000 μM), resulting in an SI of &gt;75. It is proposed that addition of the 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine residue into the carbohydrate part of the GL molecule increases its hydrophilic properties, which might be important for the interaction of GL with viral proteins, especially the highly glycosylated S protein on the virus envelope. The S protein is important for viral entry into the cell by binding to cellular receptors.

 </sup> It is speculated that viral entry was inhibited by 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine binding to the carbohydrates of the S proteins.

 </sup> In addition, the anti-SARS-CoV activity of several GL glycopeptides has been studied. For example, the glycopeptide containing 
 <sc>l</sc>-Cys (SBn, 
 <bold>53</bold>) exhibited the strongest activity with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 35 μM and a CC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1462 μM, which was 10-fold increased antiviral activity compared to GL (EC
 <sub>50</sub>, 365 μM).

 </sup> One derivative of aescin, α-hederin (
 <bold>54</bold>), showed strong anti-SARS-CoV activity at concentrations of 
 <italic>&lt;</italic>100 μM.

 </sup> In addition, previous studies demonstrated that modification of GL may lead to novel anti-SARS-CoV drugs with increased activity.
