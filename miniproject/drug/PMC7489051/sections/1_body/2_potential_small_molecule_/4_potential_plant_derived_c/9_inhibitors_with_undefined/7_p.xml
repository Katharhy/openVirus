 </xref>, compounds 
 <bold>54</bold>–
 <bold>72</bold> showed significant antiviral activity against CoV replication 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> ≤ 10 μM. Although GL and its derivatives (
 <bold>51</bold>–
 <bold>53</bold>) exhibited less inhibitory activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 35 to 365 μM, their cytotoxicity was much lower with CC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 1462 to 24 000 μM. The detailed mechanism(s) of action of these compounds needs to be investigated further to better target SARS-CoV-2.
