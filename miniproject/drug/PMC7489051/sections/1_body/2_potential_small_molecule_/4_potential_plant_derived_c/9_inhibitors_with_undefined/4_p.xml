<p>SSs, including SSa, SSb, SSc, and SSd, are active triterpenoids isolated from

 </sup> These compounds are effective against viruses such as HIV, influenza virus, and herpes simplex virus.

 </sup> Cheng et al. evaluated the antiviral activity of four types of SSs against HCoV-229E in Vero cells and found that saikosaponin B
 <sub>2</sub> (SSB
 <sub>2</sub>, 
 <bold>55</bold>) exhibited the strongest anti-HCoV-229E activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.7 μM. Time-of-addition studies showed that SSb (
 <bold>55</bold>) interferes with viral replication early during the viral replication cycle, likely due to absorption and penetration of the virus.

 </sup> In addition, triterpenoid betulonic acid (
 <bold>56</bold>) was found to be a potent inhibitor for SARS-CoV replication with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.63 μM and CC
 <sub>50</sub> of &gt;100 μM in an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study reported by Wen and colleagues. Meanwhile, they found that diterpenoids (
 <bold>57</bold>–
 <bold>60</bold>) were also potent SARS-CoV inhibitors with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 1.15 to 1.57 μM. These findings provide a new direction for the development of anti-SARS-CoV agents.
