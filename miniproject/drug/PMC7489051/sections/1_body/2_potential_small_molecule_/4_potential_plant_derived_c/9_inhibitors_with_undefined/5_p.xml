<p>Shen et al. screened a 2000-compound library of approved drugs and pharmacologically active compounds and identified seven compounds (lycorine (
 <bold>8</bold>), mycophenolic acid (
 <bold>61</bold>), emetine (
 <bold>62</bold>), mycophenolate mofetil (
 <bold>63</bold>), phenazopyridine (
 <bold>64</bold>), monensin sodium (
 <bold>65</bold>), and pyrvinium pamoate (
 <bold>66</bold>)) as broad-spectrum inhibitors for four CoVs (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, MERS-CoV, and MHV-A59) with EC

 <sub>50</sub> values of tetrandrine, fangchinoline, and cepharanthine were 0.29, 0.91, and 0.72 μM, respectively, indicating that compound 
 <bold>67</bold> was more effective against HCoV-OC43 than the other two alkaloids. Tetrandrine appeared to inhibit viral replication during the early infection stage, likely related to interaction with the viral S and N proteins.
