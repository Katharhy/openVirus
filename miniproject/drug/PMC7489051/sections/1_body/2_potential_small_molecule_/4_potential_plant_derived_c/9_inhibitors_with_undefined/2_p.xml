 </sup> Cinatl et al. examined the antiviral effects of GL on clinical isolates of SARS-CoV (strains FFM-1 and FFM-2) in Vero cells. GL was effective when given both during and after the virus adsorption period with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 365 μM and little cytotoxicity (CC
 <sub>50</sub> = 24 000 μM).
