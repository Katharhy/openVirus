<p>A SARS-CoV and Vero E6 cell-based assay was developed to screen existing drugs to identify effective anti-SARS agents. The potent inhibitors found were reserpine (
 <bold>70</bold>), a well-known antihypertensive drug derived from several members of the genus 
 <italic>Rauwolfia</italic>, andaescin (
 <bold>71</bold>), a cerebrovascular drug widely used in Europe, and valinomycin (
 <bold>72</bold>), a peptide insecticide targeting potassium ion transporter. The IC
 <sub>50</sub>, based on ELISA, and SI for reserpine, aescin, and valinomycin were 3.4 μM (SI = 7.3), 6.0 μM (SI = 2.5), and 0.85 μM (SI = 80), respectively, against SARS-CoV.
