<p>SARS-CoV has a single-stranded RNA genome approximately 30 kb long containing 5′-methylated caps and 3′-polyadenylated tails. The partially overlapping 5′-terminal open reading frame 1a/b (ORF1a/ORF1b) within the 5′ two-thirds of the genome encodes the large replicase polyproteins 1a (pp1a) and pp1ab. The polyproteins are cleaved by two virus-encoded proteinases: PL
 <sup>pro</sup> and 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> to produce 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs), as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>. Among the 16 NSPs, RdRp and Hel are involved in the transcription and replication of the virus genome. The 3′ one-third of the CoV genome encodes structural proteins essential for virus binding to cell-surface receptors and virion assembly.

 <sup>pro</sup>, PL
 <sup>pro</sup>, RdRp, and Hel/RNA nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) play pivotal roles in SARS-CoV replication and are therefore ideal drug targets.

 </sup> Some small molecules from the terpenoid, lignoid, polyphenol, and flavonoid classes were identified as effective SARS-CoV inhibitors by targeting viral proteinases.
