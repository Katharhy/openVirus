<p>Marine algae are rich sources of structurally diverse bioactive compounds that have great potential as pharmaceutical and biomedical agents. Park et al. reported that nine phlorotannins isolated from the edible brown algae 
 <italic>Ecklonia cava</italic> possessed SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitory activities in a dose-dependent and competitive manner. Among the nine compounds, dieckol (
 <bold>17</bold>), with a structure of two eckol groups linked to diphenyl ether, exhibited the most potent SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitory activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.7 Î¼M.
