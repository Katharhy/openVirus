<p>Flavonoids are one class of the most abundant natural products with extensive physiological activities, including antioxidation, anti-inflammation, and antiviral effects.

 </sup> Ryu et al. found that biflavone amentoflavone (
 <bold>18</bold>) isolated from 
 <italic>Torreya nucifera</italic> possessed stronger SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitory activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 8.3 μM) than two authentic flavonoids, luteolin (
 <bold>19</bold>) and quercetin (
 <bold>20</bold>, IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 20.2 and 23.8 μM, respectively). Structure–activity relationship analysis suggested that flavonoids against 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> appeared to be associated with an apigenin moiety at the C-3′ position.

 </sup> In another study, quercetin (
 <bold>20</bold>), epigallocatechin gallate (
 <bold>21</bold>), and gallocatechin gallate (
 <bold>22</bold>) displayed significant inhibition of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 73, 73, and 47 μM, respectively. Gallocatechin gallate was found to be a competitive inhibitor of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>.

 </sup> Recently, by use of a flavonoid library, several flavonoids with a wide range of inhibitory activities against 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> were detected. Rhoifolin (
 <bold>23</bold>), herbacetin (
 <bold>24</bold>), and pectolinarin (
 <bold>25</bold>) showed the highest inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. The enzyme kinetics assay and docking simulation results suggested that the active flavonoids have a wide range of binding affinities to SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> due to their hydrophobic aromatic rings and hydrophilic hydroxyl groups. The presence of carbohydrate groups appeared to be important for the binding affinity of the chromen-4-one moiety.

 </sup> Therefore, direct inhibition of the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> protein may be the mechanism of action of flavonoids.
