<p>For developing anti-SARS agents, Shie et al. prepared a diversified library of peptide anilides and evaluated their inhibition activities against SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. Among the 32 tested compounds, the peptide anilide JMF1507 (
 <bold>30</bold>) showed the most potent inhibition, with an IC
