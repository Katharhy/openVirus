<p>Park et al. reported that nine alkylated chalcones isolated from 
 <italic>Angelica keiskei</italic> exhibited different inhibitory activities against SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> and PL
 <sup>pro</sup> based on a cell-free assay. Of the nine chalcones, xanthoangelol E (
 <bold>26</bold>), containing a perhydroxyl group, showed the most potent 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> and PL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitory activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 7.1 and 1.2 Î¼M, respectively). Protein inhibitor analysis showed that chalcones exhibited competitive inhibition of SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, while noncompetitive inhibition was evident with SARS-CoV PL
 <sup>pro</sup>.
