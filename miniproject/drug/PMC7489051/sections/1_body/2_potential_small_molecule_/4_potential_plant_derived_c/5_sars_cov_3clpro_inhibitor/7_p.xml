<p>A series of isatin derivatives were designed as possible SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors and evaluated by protease assay. Compounds 
 <bold>27</bold> and 
 <bold>28</bold> displayed significant inhibition of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.04 and 1.18 μM, respectively.

 </sup> Additionally, the peptidyl bisulfite adduct GC376 (
 <bold>29</bold>) was found to be a potent inhibitor with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 4.35 μM.
