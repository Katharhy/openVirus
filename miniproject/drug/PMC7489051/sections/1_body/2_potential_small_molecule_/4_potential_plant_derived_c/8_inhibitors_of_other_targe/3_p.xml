<p>Nitazoxanide (
 <bold>48</bold>) is a commercially available antiprotozoal agent with potential antiviral activity against a number of viruses, including animal and human CoVs. Wang et al. recently reported that nitazoxanide inhibited SARS-CoV-2 with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2.12 μM. Nafamostat (
 <bold>49</bold>), a highly efficacious inhibitor of MERS-CoV as it prevents membrane fusion, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 22.5 μM. However, the nucleoside analog penciclovir (
 <bold>50</bold>) was required for viral inhibition, yielding an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 95.96 μM. Further 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of the two drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection are recommended.
