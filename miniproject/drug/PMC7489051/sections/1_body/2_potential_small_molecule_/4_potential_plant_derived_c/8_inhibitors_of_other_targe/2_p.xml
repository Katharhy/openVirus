<p>Zhou et al. synthesized a series of vinyl sulfone analogs and evaluated their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV. Among all tested analogs, K11777 (
 <bold>45</bold>), SMDC256159 (
 <bold>46</bold>), and SMDC256160 (
 <bold>47</bold>) showed the most potent antiviral activities in 293T-ACE2 cells, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 3.2 × 10
 <sup>–4</sup>, 7.0 × 10
 <sup>–5</sup>, and 8.0 × 10
 <sup>–5</sup> μM, respectively. Structurally, the potent antiviral activity of vinyl sulfones is associated with the presence of a basic piperazine ring at the P3 position, which is consistent with accumulation in endosomal (acidic) compartments where the target cysteine proteases required for viral entry are located.

 </sup> Thus, vinyl sulfones are promising antiviral lead compounds for further optimization as potential CoV inhibitors.
