<p>The SARS-CoV NTPase/Hel, another NSP (nsp13), is also an attractive target, as it is indispensable for viral replication.

 </sup> Hel has been reported to possess the ability to translocate along with nucleic acids by hydrolyzing ATP.

 </sup> Important progress has been made in the identification of novel CoV Hel inhibitors in natural compounds and their derivatives. Tanner et al. reported that four adamantane-derived bananins, including bananin (
 <bold>37</bold>), vanillinbananin (
 <bold>38</bold>), iodobananin (
 <bold>39</bold>), and eubananin (
 <bold>40</bold>), exhibited potent inhibition against both ATPase and Hel activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the ranges of 0.54–2.8 μM and 2.7–7.0 μM, respectively. In a cell culture system of SARS-CoV, bananin (
 <bold>37</bold>) showed significant antiviral activity with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of less than 10 μM and a CC
 <sub>50</sub> of 390 μM.

 </sup> Another compound, 7-ethyl-8-mercapto-3-methyl-3,7-dihydro-1
 <italic>H</italic>-purine-2,6-dione (EMMDPD, 
 <bold>41</bold>), was identified as a SARS-CoV Hel inhibitor and was able to suppress ATP hydrolysis.

 </sup> Similarly, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-3-(furan-2-yl)-
 <italic>N</italic>-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)acrylamide (FSPA, 
 <bold>42</bold>) was also found to inhibit ATP hydrolysis and Hel activities and did not show significant cytotoxicity at 40 μM.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref113">113</xref>
 </sup> Two natural compounds, myricetin (
 <bold>43</bold>) and scutellarein 
 <bold>(44</bold>), were reported as strong inhibitors of the ATPase activity of SARS-CoV Hel (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.71 and 0.86 μM, respectively).
