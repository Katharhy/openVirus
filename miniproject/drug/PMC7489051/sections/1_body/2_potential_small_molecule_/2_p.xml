<p>As a supplement to conventional medicine, TCM treatment has played important roles in the campaign of managing the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in China. However, the effects of TCM are often influenced by multiple factors, including esoteric TCM theory; inconsistent medicinal material quality, which could be significantly affected by soil and climate conditions, agricultural methods, and the process involved in their final preparation; unclear effective ingredients and mechanism of action. Furthermore, whether TCM is effective in the clinic often relies on the clinician’s experience. These variations make it very difficult to develop a standardized TCM regimen for a particular disease.

 </sup> In addition, only a few Asian countries have the tradition of using TCM, and most countries in the world do not practice TCM as a complementary medicine. Therefore, potent antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogenic CoVs are urgently needed. Since the outbreak of SARS in 2002–2003 and MERS in 2012, some research groups have been devoted to the development of antivirals against CoVs and documented a number of effective compounds. As there are limited numbers of CoVs and as these CoVs have relatively similar structures,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
 </sup> it is possible that the drugs developed for other CoVs might be useful for managing COVID-19. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 shares 82% sequence identity with SARS-CoV (GenBank code NC_004718.3), and there is greater than 90% sequence identity in several of the essential enzymes of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
 </sup> indicating that inhibitors of SARS-CoV might be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, some commercially available drugs, such as antiparasitic CQ/HCQ and antiviral favipiravir (FPV), with reported activity against SARS-CoV and other CoVs, have shown pronounced inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.

 </sup> However, to date, few reviews have focused on small molecules with reported anti-CoV activity. In this review, we identify 72 reported small molecules with activity against human CoVs and discuss their potential application in combating COVID-19. On the basis of inhibitory mechanisms against CoV replication, these compounds are categorized in
