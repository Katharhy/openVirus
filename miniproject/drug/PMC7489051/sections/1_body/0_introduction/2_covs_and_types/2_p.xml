<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) represent a group of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses with a genome size of 27–33 kb. They can cause diseases of the respiratory tract, intestinal tract, liver, and nervous system of many animal species, including humans, with varying degrees of severity.

 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> in the order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic> is divided into four genera: α-, β-, γ-, and δ-CoVs, of which only α- and β-CoVs can infect humans. There are seven known types of human CoVs. Four human CoVs are known to be prevalent: HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63, which are common and cause mild to moderate respiratory infections, such as the common cold.

 </sup> Two other β-CoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), have zoonotic origins and have been linked to fatal illness in past years.

 </sup> In 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), caused by MERS-CoV, emerged in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and subsequently spread to 27 countries.

 </sup> MERS presented as a severe respiratory disease with frequent gastrointestinal and renal complications. As of September 12, 2017, 2080 confirmed cases and 722 deaths have been reported.
