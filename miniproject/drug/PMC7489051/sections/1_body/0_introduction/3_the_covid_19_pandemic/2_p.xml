<p>In December 2019, pneumonia cases caused by a novel pathogen emerged in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in Central China. The pathogen was soon identified as the novel CoV SARS-CoV-2, which is closely related to SARS-CoV.

 </sup> Recently, Dorp et al. estimated that the initial timing of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 may have been in early December or even earlier in 2019 by analyzing the emergence of genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2.

 </sup> However, the native host(s) of SARS-CoV-2 and the place of origin of human SARS-CoV-2 infections remain uncertain, even though Wuhan was the first city in which this disease was detected and managed. As of March 30, 2020, COVID-19 has led to over 80 000 confirmed cases with over 3000 deaths in China. Due to strict quarantines throughout China, new cases have sharply decreased since mid-March, and the outbreak was successfully contained in China. Unfortunately, as of August 14, 2020, this virus has now spread to over 200 other countries and areas worldwide and led to over 20 million people infected and over 750 000 deaths.
