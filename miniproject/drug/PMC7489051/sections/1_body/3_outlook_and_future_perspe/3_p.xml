<p>While randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled studies are the most effective methods to assess therapeutic efficacy; most studies evaluating the efficacy of TCMs in the treatment of SARS-CoV infections were found to be poorly designed. Hopefully, current and future clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of TCMs in the treatment of COVID-19 will be conducted using stricter protocols and allocation concealment. Furthermore, standardized manufacturing, quality control and monitoring should be established to ensure consistency. Although the identification of all components in a TCM formula is almost impossible, the identification of harmful components and the main active components is indispensable for understanding the underlying mechanism of TCMs and avoiding potentially harmful TCMs in the treatment of COVID-19. Some TCM herbs are reported to contain mutagens and nephrotoxins,

 </sup> In addition, some components in TCMs might interact with Western medicines and lead to additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effects.
