<p>Due to the acute nature of COVID-19 and the importance of immunopathology, combination therapies aimed at the virus and host are likely to yield the best clinical outcomes. Fatal SARS-CoV-2 cases are closely related to cytokine storms in patient lungs, similar to SARS-CoV and highly pathogenic IAV infections.

 </sup> Thus, the application of anti-inflammatory drugs for COVID-19 patients, especially for severe cases, is almost equally as important as antivirals. In fact, glucocorticoids such as methylprednisolone have been approved to treat some severe COVID-19 patients in combination with antiviral agents in China. Recently, researchers at the University of Oxford found that a low-to-moderate dose (6 mg/day for 10 days) of dexamethasone reduced deaths in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who were on ventilators by one-third or receiving oxygen support by one-fifth, but the steroid did not benefit hospitalized COVID-19 patients who did not require respiratory support.

 </sup> However, the use of glucocorticoids might cause side effects for patients, including immunosuppression, delayed virus clearance time, and osteoporosis.

 </sup> In this regard, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that are not associated with these side effects might be a preferred option for treating COVID-19 patients in combination with antiviral agents. Further studies are urgently needed to identify potent anti-inflammatory drugs for COVID-19 patients from a large number of NSAIDs. In addition, treatment (especially antiviral therapy) should be started as early as possible to prevent extensive lung damage.
