<p>Since the COVID-19 outbreak in early January 2020, global ongoing efforts to identify effective drugs against COVID-19 have been undertaken, including clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of some commercially available drugs. CQ and its analog HCQ have received the highest attention; however, the FDA has withdrawn the emergency approval for HCQ as a treatment of COVID-19 based on its ineffectiveness and serious side effects. RDV and FPV might be relatively effective drugs for COVID-19 at present, but the exact effectiveness of the two drugs remains to be further evaluated with randomized and controlled clinical studies. Therefore, effective therapeutics against COVID-19 are still urgently needed. Various stages of the SARS-CoV-2 viral life cycle could be targeted by small molecule antiviral inhibitors. Four viral NSPs, including protease 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, PL
 <sup>pro</sup>, RdRp, and Hel play pivotal roles in SARS-CoV replication and are therefore ideal targets. The drug-repurposing effort summarized in this report focuses primarily on small-molecule inhibitors known to be effective against CoVs, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with a wide variety of chemical structure categories. However, among the 72 identified small-molecule inhibitors summarized in
