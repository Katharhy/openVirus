<p>The present pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is spreading globally and has posed major challenges to public health due to a lack of a specific vaccine and antiviral drugs. Complementary and alternative treatments are urgently needed for the management of COVID-19 patients. In China, TCM has been used for thousands of years in the treatment of pandemic and endemic diseases. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in early January 2020, integrated treatments of TCMs with conventional medicines have been extensively used to treat COVID-19 patients in China and have achieved positive effects. However, the major challenges in the use of TCM are inconsistencies in the origins of the herbs used and incomplete understandings of the active compounds in these preparations and their mechanisms of action.</p>
