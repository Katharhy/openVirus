<p>Suitable animal models are critical for testing anti-CoV drugs. Some non-human primates were found permissive to SARS-CoV, but none consistently reproduced severe human disease.

 </sup> Small animals, including mice strains such as BALB/c, knockout mice with immune deficiencies, ferrets, and golden Syrian hamsters can be productively infected with SARS-CoV, but few develop clinical symptoms.

 </sup> Recently, Sun et al. successfully developed a mouse model expressing human ACE2 via inoculation with a replication-deficient adenovirus (Ad5-hACE2). These mice showed weight loss, severe pulmonary pathology, and high viral load in the lungs post-SARS-CoV-2 infection but no mortality.
