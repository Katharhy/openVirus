<p>Unlike chemical drugs, which generally function on defined targets with clearly understood mechanisms of action, TCM prescriptions consist of multiple herbs with multiple targets. Recently, Yang and colleagues comprehensively analyzed the chemical constituents of QFPDT using liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). A total of 129 compounds were identified or tentatively characterized from QFPDT, including 58 flavonoids, 20 glycosides, 13 carboxylic acids, 7 saponins, 6 alkaloids, and 4 terpenes. 
 <italic>In silico</italic> approaches such as network pharmacology and molecular networking revealed multiple constituents, such as glycyrrhizic acid (glycyrrhizin, GL), saikosaponins (SSs), scutellarein, and betulonic acid. Various compounds from different herbs in QFPDT may interfere with the disease process of COVID-19 through multiple signaling pathways, such as Toll-like receptor activation and IFN response induced by viral infection, thereby reducing the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting viral replication to protect patients.
