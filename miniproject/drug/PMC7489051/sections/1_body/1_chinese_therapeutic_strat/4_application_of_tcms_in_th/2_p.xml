<p>TCMs have been used for thousands of years to treat pandemic and endemic diseases, and there is evidence of efficacy against SARS-CoV reported in 2002–2003,

 </sup> Taking into account the similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in epidemiology and genomics, TCM is expected to have therapeutic value for SARS-CoV-2.

 </sup> In the seventh edition of the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19, 15 commercially available proprietary Chinese medicines (formulas) and 10 TCM decoction prescriptions were recommended for patients in different phases of the disease and stages, including medical observation period, clinical treatment period, and recovery period, as shown in

As of March 23, 2020, 392 clinical trials aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of various treatments for COVID-19 patients had been launched in China. Among them, 78 trials (19.9%) utilized TCMs, including 21 (5.3%) examining the effects of the combined treatment of TCM and Western medicine.

 </sup> A total of 92% of COVID-19 patients in China received TCM treatment, with a total effective rate of 90%.

 </sup> Among the recommended TCM formulas and prescriptions, three formulas, including Jinhua Qinggan granule (JHQGG), Lianhua Qingwen capsule (LHQWC), and Xue Bi Jing injection (XBJI), and three prescriptions, including Qingfei Paidu Tang (QFPDT), Xuanfei Baidu Tang (XFBDT), and Huashi Baidu Tang (HSBDT) (shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">2</xref>
 </xref>), were widely used in the treatment of COVID-19 patients due to their significant clinical efficacy. JHQGG and LHQWC were recommended to treat mild and moderate COVID-19 patients. A comparative clinical trial showed that among the recruited 80 COVID-19 patients, the average duration of viral nucleic acid detection was 7 (±4) days in the JHQGG administration group (44 patients) and 10 (±4) days in the control group (36 patients).

 </sup> In February 2020, Hu and collaborators performed a prospective multicenter open-label randomized controlled trial to determine the safety and efficacy of LHQWC in COVID-19 patients. A total of 284 patients were randomized to receive standard treatment alone or in combination with LHQWC (142 patients in each group) for 14 days. The results indicated that the symptom (fever, fatigue, and coughing) recovery rate was significantly higher in the combined treatment group than in the control group (91.5% vs 82.4%), and no serious adverse events were reported.

 </sup> QFPDT, consisting of 21 components that included both herbs and mineral drugs, was recommended as a basic prescription for treating mild to severe cases of COVID-19. A clinical survey evaluating the effect of QFPDT showed that among the 1263 recruited COVID-19 patients from 66 hospitals in 10 cities in China, 1214 patients were cured and discharged, and none of the patients with mild and moderate disease progressed to the severe stage. Among these patients, out of the 49 severe patients who were treated with both QFPDT and Western medicine, 42 were cured.
