<p>Developing a vaccine for a new pathogen needs at least 18 months, and thus, vaccinations are unlikely to control emergent epidemics. Developing novel drugs against this virus could take a longer time than developing a vaccine. However, since SARS-CoV-2 shares high similarity in gene sequence and pathogenic mechanism with previous human pathogenic CoVs, especially SARS-CoV (82% sequence identity),

 </sup> existing therapeutic strategies for combating SARS might be effective for managing COVID-19. In 2002â€“2003, the SARS outbreak first started in South China and subsequently spread to 31 countries worldwide. Patients in mainland China accounted for over 60% of the total cases. Interestingly, the average death rate in mainland China (approximately 6.5%) was lower than the worldwide average death rate (9.3%). The higher cure rate in China for SARS infections was attributed to combining traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with Western medicine in China.

 </sup> Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in early January 2020, some therapeutic strategies for SARS, including the application of TCM, have been repurposed for combating COVID-19 in China.
