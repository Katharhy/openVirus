<p>On January 20, 2020, the National Health Commission (NHC) of China issued the first edition of the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19. Subsequently, these guidelines have been frequently revised, and the seventh version was released on March 4, 2020. In the seventh edition of the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19, COVID-19 patients are classified into four groups based on the severity of illness: mild, moderate, severe, and critical, and the therapeutic regimen varies according to this classification (

 </sup> Among the recommended antiviral drugs, interferon α (IFN-α) represents one of the broad-spectrum antiviral interferons extensively and clinically used to induce the host innate immune response. Lopinavir–ritonavir, the anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) combination drugs, was shown to be beneficial for MERS-CoV infections,

 </sup> while its effect on COVID-19 is currently being assessed in clinical trials along with umifenovir (also named Arbidol) and ribavirin. Chloroquine (CQ), a widely used antimalarial and immunomodulatory drug, showed

 </sup> These findings led to 15 clinical trials of CQ or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in China to test their efficacy and safety for COVID-19 patients. Results from more than 100 patients so far have demonstrated reduced hospital stays and improved the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia after CQ phosphate treatment with no severe adverse reactions.

 </sup> Given these findings, CQ phosphate was included in the seventh edition of the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19.
