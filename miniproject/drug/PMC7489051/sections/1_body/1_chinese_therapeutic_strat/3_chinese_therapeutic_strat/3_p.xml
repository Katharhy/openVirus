<p>It has been thought that deaths induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection are due to vigorous systemic inflammation caused by “cytokine storms”, driven by proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interferon γ (IFN-γ), similar to those induced by SARS-CoV and highly pathogenic influenza A virus (IAV) infections.

 </sup> Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody with interleukin 6 (IL-6)-neutralizing activity, has been used to clinically treat rheumatoid arthritis. In a recent initial clinical trial, tocilizumab was used in 21 severe COVID-19 cases. The results showed that all patients had resolution of fever within 24 h, with reported relief of clinical symptoms. All 21 patients were discharged from the hospital within 2 weeks, although two were readmitted to the hospital by the end of follow-up.

 </sup> Glucocorticoids were extensively used to treat SARS patients in 2002–2003 due to their significant suppression of exaggerated systemic inflammation induced by SARS-CoV infections. However, high-dose therapy with glucocorticoids could cause severe side effects to SARS patients, including immunosuppression, delayed virus clearance, and osteoporosis.

 </sup> In the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19, glucocorticoid methylprednisolone was prudently recommended to treat severe patients at a low dose (≤1–2 mg kg
