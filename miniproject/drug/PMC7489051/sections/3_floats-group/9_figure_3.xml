  <p>Candidate antiviral agents for SARS-CoV-2 in relation to the viral replication cycle. SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells either through an endosomal pathway or by virus–cell fusion mediated by spike (S) glycoprotein binding to the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Viral genomic RNA is unveiled in the cytoplasm, and the single-stranded positive-sense genome is transcribed to produce the viral proteases papain-like protease (PL
   <sup>pro</sup>) and 3C-like serine protease (3CL
   <sup>pro</sup>), which cleave the two large polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) into 16 mature nonstructural proteins (NSPs), including two replicase polyproteins (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and helicase (Hel)). Mature NSPs and the RdRp and Hel proteins are gathered into replication–transcription complexes (RTCs) for viral replication and transcription. RTCs synthesize negative-strand guide RNA (gRNA) and a set of subgenomic RNAs for viral replication and transcription. The newly produced subgenomic RNAs are translated into viral structural proteins such as the S, membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins. These proteins are inserted into the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then transported to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) to assemble with the N protein-encapsidated RNA to form viral particles. Virions are then released from the cell through exocytosis.
