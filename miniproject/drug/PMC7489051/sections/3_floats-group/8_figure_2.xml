  <p>Genome structures of SARS-CoV- 2 and SARS-CoV. A typical CoV has a single-stranded positive-sense genome (top panel). Next to the 5′ UTR, two-thirds of the genome consists of partially overlapping ORFs (ORF1a and ORF1b) encoding large NSPs (nsp1 to nsp16). During translation, the ORF1b protein is produced by a 1 bp ribosomal frameshift in the reading frame of ORF1a. The remaining one-third of the genome at the 3′ end encodes structural proteins such as the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Other proteins, such as SARS-CoV-2 ORF3 (NC-045512) and SARS-CoV 3a (NC-004178.3), are shown. The key enzymes, namely, papain-like protease (PL
   <sup>pro</sup>), 3C-like serine protease (3CL
   <sup>pro</sup>), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and helicase (Hel), are shown. The clinical applications of the key pathogenic nonstructural genes or gene products are shown in boxes. (Bottom panel) A schematic representation of the morphology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The virus is a large pleomorphic spherical particle with a lipid bilayer composed of the S, M, and E proteins surrounding the helical nucleocapsid-wrapped single-stranded RNA ribonucleoprotein genome.
