  <p>Postulated mechanisms of vitamin D in prevention of COVID-19 infection. Vitamin D treatment inhibits the T-helper-1 cell (Th1) response, which reduces serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and induces the production of anti-inflammatory Th2 cytokines. Vitamin D treatment downregulates the expression of DPP4/CD26, which may play a role in the virulence of the SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) for cellular entry. However, upregulation of ACE 2, protects against lipopolysaccharide induced acute lung injury. Vitamin D is found to be a negative endocrine regulator of RAAS. Vitamin D inhibited renin, ACE, and Ang II expression, and induced ACE2 levels. ACE2, converts angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7. Upon binding AT1R, angiotensin II causes inflammation, fibrosis, and apoptosis. AT-(1-7) opposes the effects of angiotensin II by interacting with its own receptor. Red arrows indicates inhibitory action and green arrows, stimulatory action. ACE1, angiotensin-converting enzyme 1; ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; AT1R, type 1 angiotensin 2 receptor; AT1-7, heptapeptide angiotensin (1-7); DPP4/CD26, dipeptidyl peptidase 4/cluster of differentiation 26; Th1, T helper 1 cells; Th2, T helper 2 cells.</p>
