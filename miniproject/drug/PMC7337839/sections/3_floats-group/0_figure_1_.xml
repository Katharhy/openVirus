  <p>Viral entry and cellular pathogenesis. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the respiratory tract via the epithelial cells in the nasal cavity (1). The virus binds via its membrane spike protein S, to the cell membrane protein ACE2 in lungs (2). TMPRSS2, another cell membrane protein, triggers cleavage of the S protein into 2 subunits (3). The S1 subunit promotes fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane culminating endocytosis of the virus (4). The virus then releases its genomic RNA into the host cell (5). The viral RNA is translated into polyproteins pp1a and 1ab, both of which in turn undergo proteolysis by vital proteinases into small particles. In parallel, more genomic RNA are produced via the enzyme replicase (6). The genomic RNA gets transcribed into mRNA (7) and results in viral protein synthesis via translation (8). The replicated genomic RNA and the synthesized viral proteins are incorporated into virions in the RER and Golgi apparatus (9). The virions are ultimately released from the host cell as vesicles via exocytosis (10). pp1a and 1ab, viral replicase polyproteins; RER, rough endoplasmic reticulum; S, Spike protein; TMPRSS2, transmembrane protease serine 2.</p>
