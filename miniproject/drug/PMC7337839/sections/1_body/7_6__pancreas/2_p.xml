<p>A study during the SARS epidemic demonstrated ACE2 expression in islet cells and a high incidence of hyperglycemia among SARS patients. The authors speculated that SARS-CoV-1 may directly infect islet cells causing their dysfunction, resulting in hyperglycemia or new-onset diabetes [

No studies have described differences in insulin level or insulin resistance to establish a direct link between the coronavirus infection and hyperglycemia.
