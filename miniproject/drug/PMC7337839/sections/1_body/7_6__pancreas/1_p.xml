<p>ACE2 is expressed in pancreatic cells. An animal study and a postmortem study among SARS fatalities showed ACE2 to be expressed in islets rather than the exocrine pancreas; specifically, in β and δ cells as opposed to α cells [

In fact, animal studies have shown diabetes to increase ACE2 expression in pancreatic as well as lung and other tissues [
