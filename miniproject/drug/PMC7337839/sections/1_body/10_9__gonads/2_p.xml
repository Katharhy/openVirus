<p>To date, there are no reports on the viral distribution or pathological effects of virus on human gonads from SARS-CoV-2 infection. A study conducted to define the organ distribution of SARS-CoV-1 in 2003 using autopsy samples of 2 male and 2 female patients who died of SARS in China revealed that virus RNA material or antigens were not present in the testis or ovary [

There was marked germ cell destruction, reduced spermatozoon in the seminiferous tubule, thickened basement membrane, and leukocyte infiltration. In situ hybridization for SARS viral genomic material was negative in the samples. Therefore, the authors suggest possible immune-mediated damage as the cause of destruction rather than direct viral entry and damage [
