<p>Analysis of the tissue expression pattern of ACE2 in different human tissues has revealed a high level of expression in the human testis [
 <xref rid="CIT0136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. According to a recent study, ACE2 is expressed in spermatogonia and somatic (Leydig and Sertoli) cells in the testis. It was shown that TMPRSS2 is concentrated in spermatogonia and spermatids. This is shown to be used for viral S protein priming [
 <xref rid="CIT0138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. This suggests that the testis is a high-risk organ vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there are no similar studies on ACE2 expression in ovaries.
