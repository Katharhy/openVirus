<p>The inhaled virus binds to the epithelial cells of the nasal cavity [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Ciliated cells in the conducting airway are the primary cells where the virus binds. In this initial phase, the virus can be detected by nasal swabs even though the patient is asymptomatic [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The lifecycle of the virus begins when the S protein binds to ACE2. The S protein is a trimetric spike glycoprotein located on the envelope of the virus and is composed of an N-terminal peptide domain, C-terminal Collectrin-like domain, and a 40-residue intracellular segment [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although ACE2 has structural similarity to angiotensin-converting enzyme, it is not inhibited by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, but is upregulated with their use [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. ACE2 expression is highest in kidney, endothelium, lungs, and the heart [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The main substrate for ACE2 is angiotensin II, and ACE2 acts as a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) by converting the active angiotensin and angiotensin II to the inactive angiotensin 1-7 [
