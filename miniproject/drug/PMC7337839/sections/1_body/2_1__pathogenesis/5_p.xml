<p>The potentially life-threatening complication of coronavirus is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is secondary to a “cytokine storm” induced by the hyperactivation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B (NF-κB) with the release of massive amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. NF-κB is activated directly by SARS-CoV-2 via pattern recognition receptors [
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Down-regulation of ACE2 resulting from the binding of SARS-CoV-2, and the resultant increase in angiotensin II, activates STAT 3. Activation of STAT 3 leads to hyperactivation of the NF-κB pathway via the IL-6 amplifier and the resultant increase in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Very high levels of cytokines including IL1-β, IL1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), granulocyte colony stimulating factor, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), TNF-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein α, and vascular endothelial growth factor-A have been reported in those with severe COVID-19 [
