<p>Following the initial symptomatic period without a significant immune response, the second phase commences with an initial innate immune response [

Following entry of the virus into the host cells, the viral antigens are presented by antigen-presenting cells recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. There is evidence that certain HLA polymorphisms are related to the susceptibility and protection from SARS-CoV-1 infection [
