<p>Hyperprolactinemia is known to occur in response to any form of stress, including infections [
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. High prolactin levels have been shown in patients with severe sepsis and in infants with severe respiratory infections [
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Prolactin also has shown immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects in experimental studies [
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, no data are available on susceptibility to infection among patients with hyperprolactinemia or any risk conferred by prolactin-lowering therapy.
