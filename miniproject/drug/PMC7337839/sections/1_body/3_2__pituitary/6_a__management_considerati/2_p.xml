<p>Based on the currently available evidence, patients with preexisting hyperprolactinemia may continue dopamine receptor agonist (DRA) therapy during the pandemic and during acute mild to moderate COVID-19. In patients with hyperprolactinemia, prolactin levels should not be measured to assess disease control during acute illness. It is noteworthy that patients on DRAs who develop COVID-19 are at risk of drug interactions. Antiretroviral agents lopinavir/ritonavir, which are currently being used for the treatment COVID-19 in some parts of the world, can inhibit CYP3A4 enzymes and may increase plasma bromocriptine levels [

In critically ill COVID-19 patients who require pressor support because of septic shock, use of amine derivatives (norepinephrine, epinephrine, dobutamine, dopamine) with DRAs may cause additive vasospasm and a rapid blood pressure rise resulting from pharmacological synergism [
 <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Therefore, close monitoring is required and temporary discontinuation of DRAs in severe COVID-19 should be considered. Chloroquine is not known to adversely interact with DRAs. In fact, it has been shown to induce cell apoptosis in pituitary tumors when used in combination with cabergoline in animal studies [
