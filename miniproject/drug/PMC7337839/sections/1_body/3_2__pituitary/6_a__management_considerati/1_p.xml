<p>Electrolyte and water imbalances can occur in COVID-19 resulting from insensible loss caused by high fever and tachypnea, gastrointestinal loss such as vomiting and diarrhea, as well as the inability to take adequate fluids because of an impaired level of consciousness [

If intranasal desmopressin cannot be administered because of impaired consciousness, it can be converted to a parenteral form (IV/IM) to allow more stringent titration [
