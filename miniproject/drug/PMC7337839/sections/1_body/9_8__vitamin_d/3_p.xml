<p>Increased serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with pulmonary inflammation and lung injury have been reported in studies with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV-1 [
 <xref rid="CIT0119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Although the exact pathogenesis is yet to be elucidated, increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL1B, IFN-γ, IP10, and MCP1) have been found in patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, the levels of inflammatory cytokines (granulocyte colony stimulating factor, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF-α) were found to be associated with disease severity [
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Vitamin D treatment seems to inhibit the T-helper-1 response and reduces serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IFN-γ [

 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Vitamin D and 1,25(OH)2D induce the production of Th2 cytokines, which are anti-inflammatory [
 <xref rid="CIT0122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Therefore, vitamin D may play a role in reducing inflammation in COVID 19 by increasing the anti-inflammatory cytokines and reducing the pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, it has been found that the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein interacts with the human DPP4/CD26, which is important for its virulence [
 <xref rid="CIT0123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Vitamin D may play a role in modulating the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 as it has been demonstrated that treatment of vitamin D deficiency leads to reduced expression of DPP4/CD26 [
