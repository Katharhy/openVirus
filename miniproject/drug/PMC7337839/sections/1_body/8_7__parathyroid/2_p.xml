<p>Intracellular calcium signaling is essential for the replication of certain viruses and the cellular outcomes [
 <xref rid="CIT0112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. It is known that the cytoplasmic domain of the 3a protein of SARS-CoV-1 binds calcium in vitro, causing a change in its protein conformation [
 <xref rid="CIT0113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. However, the role of calcium signaling in the context of COVID-19 is yet to be elucidated and needs further research. No data exist on ACE2 expression, viral invasion or inflammation of the parathyroid glands, or alterations in parathyroid hormone or calcium homeostasis during coronavirus infections. Although hypocalcemia has been reported in patients with severe illnesses in the past, no published data are available regarding COVID-19 disease severity and serum calcium levels. Unpublished data suggest a possible association between hypocalcemia and COVID-19 disease severity and prognosis.
