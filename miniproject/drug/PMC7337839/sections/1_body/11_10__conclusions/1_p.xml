<p>In the absence of literature relating to the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on endocrine organs, we have made speculations based on the evidence from SARS-CoV-1 infection during the years 2002 through 2003. Research on clinical effects during the current pandemic and follow-up of recovered patients is a priority, considering the potential for multitude of effects on endocrine organs. We have highlighted management strategies based on available data in the current pandemic and have also demonstrated the need for multifaceted research. The research needs include collection of carefully prepared clinical data, histological and autopsy studies, as well as basic science studies to understand the effect of SARS-Cov-2 on the endocrine system. Furthermore, studies on viral genomics to fill the gaps in the knowledge on effects of direct viral invasion and immune-mediated injury are needed. Clinicians should be encouraged to report their experience in managing patients with preexisting endocrine diseases to improve current practices, which are mostly empirical.</p>
