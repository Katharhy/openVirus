<p>If infected with COVID-19, patients with central hypothyroidism and primary hypothyroidism should be advised to continue the same dose or higher doses of thyroxine, depending on the clinical context. Patients on antithyroid drugs would need to exercise extra caution because signs of neutropenia and COVID-19 could mimic each other. Urgent medical care and a full blood count should be arranged for these patients in case of any doubt. For patients on antithyroid drugs, regular consultation with their physician may often be postponed, but medications can be titrated according to thyroid function tests. If blood tests are not available, a thorough clinical assessment and history is recommended. Consultation is advisable in situations such as pregnancy, poor disease control, and patients with adverse effects to medications. Definitive therapy is best postponed until the epidemic is controlled unless used as an emergency measure in a poorly controlled patient. Block-and-replacement therapy is also suggested if monitoring of thyroid function is not feasible for a considerable period [
