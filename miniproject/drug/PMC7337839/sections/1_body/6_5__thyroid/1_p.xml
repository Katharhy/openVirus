<p>A report on thyroid function tests in 48 patients infected with SARS-CoV-1 showed reduced free T3 and free T4 in 94% and 46% of patients, respectively. Serum TSH levels were also reduced in these patients, raising the possibility of either central hypothyroidism or the “sick euthyroid” syndrome [

In another follow-up study that looked at endocrine disorders among 61 patients who had SARS, 2 patients were identified as having subclinical thyrotoxicosis, 3 had central hypothyroidism, and 1 had primary hypothyroidism with positive thyroid autoantibodies [
