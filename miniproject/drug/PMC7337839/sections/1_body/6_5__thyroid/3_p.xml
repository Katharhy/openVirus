<p>Although there is conflicting evidence, 2 independent studies have shown the adverse effects of SARS-CoV-1 on the thyroid in autopsy samples. In 1 study, samples of all 5 patients showed destruction of follicular epithelia and exfoliation of epithelial cells into the follicles. There was also evidence of destruction of parafollicular cells [
