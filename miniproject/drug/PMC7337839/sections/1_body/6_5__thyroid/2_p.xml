<p>Acute and chronic phases of critical illness have different effects on the thyroid axis [
 <xref rid="CIT0084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Sick euthyroid syndrome or “nonthyroidal illness syndrome” can manifest in patients with COVID-19, especially during the acute and recovery phase of the illness, which will further complicate their management. This mechanism is complex. During an acute illness, changes in thyroid hormone binding, cellular uptake, and decreased activity of type I deiodinase enzyme leading to decreased T4 to T3 conversion, can occur [
 <xref rid="CIT0084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Type I deiodinase enzyme activity is reduced as it is influenced by various substances including circulating cortisol, cytokines, endogenous free fatty acids, and various drugs used in management [
 <xref rid="CIT0084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Increased T3 catabolism in peripheral tissues can occur because of increased activity of type 3 deiodinase [
 <xref rid="CIT0084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. The cumulative effect is low circulating T3 levels [
 <xref rid="CIT0084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. In addition to these changes, down-regulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis leads to low circulating TSH and T4 levels during the course of illness [
 <xref rid="CIT0084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Differentiating this from central hypothyroidism might be difficult in the acute stage and may require reevaluation later. If nonthyroidal illness syndrome is suspected, therapy with thyroxine or liothyronine is not currently recommended because of lack of clinical benefit and safety concerns [
