<p>Based on the available evidence, a random serum cortisol of less than 275 nmol/L (10 µg/dL) or a serum cortisol rise by less than 248 nmol/L (9 µg/dL) at 1 hour following 250 µg cosyntropin/Synacthen can be used to diagnose CIRCI [

 <xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Furthermore, one needs to be aware that threshold levels of cortisol will vary according to assay. These assay-related variations can be even more prominent in critically ill patients because of the presence of heterophile antibodies and cortisol metabolites, and can impact the diagnosis of CIRCI [

 <xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. For these reasons, a glucocorticoid trial can be considered based on clinical parameters, regardless of the cortisol response, following a discussion between the treating intensivist and endocrinologist. Patients with CIRCI can be treated with IV hydrocortisone (up to 400 mg/day) for 3 days or longer depending on the clinical parameters, with slow tapering of doses once the patient’s condition is stable [

The decision regarding hydrocortisone treatment should be made cautiously, and it is also important to be mindful about the possible drug interactions as well. Ritonavir is known to inhibit the cytochrome P4503A enzyme and thereby increase the exposure to corticosteroids and prolong their half-lives [
