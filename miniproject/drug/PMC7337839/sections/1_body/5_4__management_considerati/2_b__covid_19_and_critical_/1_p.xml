<p>Usually, any stressful condition including infections results in activation of the HPA axis with increased secretion of corticosteroids to optimize the stress response. The strongest activators of HPA axis are hypoxia, hypotension, and sepsis. In some patients with critical illness or sepsis, this response may be inadequate because of impaired cortisol secretion or cortisol resistance caused by abnormalities in glucocorticoid receptors, known as critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) [
