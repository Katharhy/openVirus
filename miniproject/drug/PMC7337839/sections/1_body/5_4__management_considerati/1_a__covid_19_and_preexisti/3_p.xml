<p>If hospitalized with pneumonia, patients should be closely monitored for features of acute adrenal insufficiency such as syncope, vomiting, hypotension, and electrolyte imbalances including hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hypoglycemia [

Severe pneumonia or any features of acute adrenal insufficiency would warrant IV or IM hydrocortisone treatment with 100 mg given immediately, followed by 200 mg every 24 hours as a continuous IV infusion or 6-hourly in divided doses, accompanied with appropriate fluid resuscitation [
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Patients with primary adrenal insufficiency would not require additional fludrocortisone in this setting as hydrocortisone doses above 50 mg per day are known to exert adequate actions on mineralocorticoid receptors [
