<p>These patients would be on steroid replacement in physiological doses, usually with hydrocortisone which needs continuation without disruption. Patients should have a “steroid emergency card” and bracelet with details of hydrocortisone dosing during an infection. Standard guidelines suggest doubling the usual steroid dose in accordance with “sick day rules,” in the event of mild to moderate infection [

However, based on the experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is associated with continuous high levels of acute inflammation, it is suggested that this regimen might be inadequate because it can result in periods of glucocorticoid deficiency in these patients with ongoing continuous inflammation [

 <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Therefore, an immediate dose of doubled hydrocortisone morning dose, followed by replacement dose of 20 mg 4 times daily is proposed as a better approach in the current context because it provides a more evenly spaced and continuous glucocorticoid cover [
 <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. This should be tapered off to double the patients’ usual dose once they have no fever and show clinical improvement, followed by tapering down to the routine dose once they are completely asymptomatic [
 <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. However, an individualized approach is recommended, based on the patient characteristics and severity of the infection because it is evident that all patients with COVID-19 do not behave the same way. COVID-19-PCR positive, asymptomatic patients may not need to increase their routine dose. Thus, we recommend that it is imperative to have a discussion with the treating endocrinologist before making changes to the steroid replacement dose of a COVID-19 patient with adrenal insufficiency.
