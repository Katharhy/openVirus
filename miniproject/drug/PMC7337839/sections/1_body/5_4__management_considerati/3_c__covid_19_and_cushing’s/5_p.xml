<p>As has been discussed, there are several mechanisms that can contribute to increased mortality in CS patients with COVID-19. Therefore, it is crucial to adhere to standard infection prevention measures. During an infection, blood pressure and blood glucose levels needs close monitoring and management according to standard guidelines. Close monitoring of electrolytes is important. Prophylactic, low-dose low-molecular-weight heparin should generally be administered given there are no major contraindications [

Intravenous etomidate can be considered in patients with severe illness needing parenteral glucocorticoid-lowering therapy with careful dose adjustments to achieve a target cortisol level. If the patient has coexisting acute kidney injury, further stringent dose titration is warranted. It is crucial to keep in mind that the precursor 11-deoxycortisol may crossreact in many assays [
