<p id="Par12">The RBD region is a critical target for neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), and SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBD are ~73%–76% similar in sequence. Nine ACE2-contacting residues in CoV RBD are fully conserved, and four are partially conserved. Analysis of the RBM (receptor-binding motif, a portion of RBD making direct contacts with ACE2) of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 revealed that most residues essential for ACE2 binding in the SARS-CoV S protein are conserved in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. However, some studies showed that murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and polyclonal antibodies against SARS-RBD are unable to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, revealing differences in antigenicity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [
