<p id="Par9">In the native state, the CoV S protein exists as an inactive precursor. During viral infection, target cell proteases activate the S protein by cleaving it into S1 and S2 subunits [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], which is necessary for activating the membrane fusion domain after viral entry into target cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Similar to other coronaviruses, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits by cellular proteases, and the serine protease TMPRSS2 is used as a protein primer. Although the cleavage site of SARS-CoV is known, that of SARS-CoV-2 S has not yet been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].
