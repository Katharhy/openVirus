<p id="Par17">Targeting the heptad repeat (HR) has attracted the greatest interest in therapeutic drug discovery. The S protein is an important target protein for the development of specific drugs, while the S1 RBD domain is part of a highly mutable region and is not an ideal target site for broad-spectrum antiviral inhibitor development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In contrast, the HR region of the S2 subunit plays an essential role in HCoV infections and is conserved among HCoVs, as is the mode of interaction between HR1 and HR2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A synthetic peptide derived from the stem region of the ZIKV envelope protein was demonstrated in 2017 to potently inhibit infection byÂ ZIKV and other flaviviruses in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], implying antiviral efficiency of peptides derived from conserved regions of viral proteins. Peptides derived from the HR2 region of class I viral fusion proteins of enveloped viruses competitively bind to viral HR1 and effectively inhibit viral infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Therefore, HR1 is a promising target for the development of fusion inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
