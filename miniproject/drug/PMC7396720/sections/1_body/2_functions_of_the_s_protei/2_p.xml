<p id="Par19">The trimer of the S protein located on the surface of the viral envelope is the basic unit by which the S protein binds to the receptor [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The S1 domain contains the RBD, which is mainly responsible for binding of the virus to the receptor, while the S2 domain mainly contains the HR domain, including HR1 and HR2, which is closely related to virus fusion [
