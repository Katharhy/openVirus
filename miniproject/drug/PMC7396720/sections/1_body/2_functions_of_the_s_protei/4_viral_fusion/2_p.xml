<p id="Par24">The formation of 6-HB is essential for viral fusion. The FP in the N-terminus of SARS-CoV-2 and the two HR domains on S2 is essential for viral fusion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. After cleavage of the S protein, the FP of SARS-CoV-2 is exposed and triggers viral fusion. Under the action of some special ligands, the fusion protein undergoes a conformational change and then inserts into the host cell membrane (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. For example, the ligand for influenza A virus is H
 <sup>+</sup>, while the ligand for HIV is a coreceptor such as CCR5 or CXCR4 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The distance between the viral membrane and host cell membrane is shortened, and the HR1 domain of the S protein is in close proximity to the host cell membrane, whereas the HR2 domain is closer to the viral membrane side. Then, HR2 folds back to HR1, the two HR domains form a six-helix structure in an antiparallel format of the fusion core, the viral membrane is pulled toward the host cell membrane and tightly binds to it, and the two membranes fuse [
