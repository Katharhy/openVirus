<p id="Par37">The S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 shows 88% sequence homology with the SARS-CoV S2 domain and is structurally conserved. Therefore, the development of antibodies targeting this functional motif may cross-bind and neutralize these two viruses and related CoVs. Antiviral peptides prevent SARS-CoV-2 membrane fusion and can potentially be used for the prevention and treatment of infection. It is worth mentioning that EK1C4, which targets the highly conserved HR1 domain of the S2 subunit, is expected to have therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, EK1C4 can be used as a nasal drop, which increases its medicinal properties, it possesses a high genetic barrier to resistance, and does not easily induce drug-resistant mutations. On the other hand, peptide fusion inhibitors may not be widely used clinically and have low bioavailability. Therefore, the development of oral small molecule fusion inhibitors is a major direction.</p>
