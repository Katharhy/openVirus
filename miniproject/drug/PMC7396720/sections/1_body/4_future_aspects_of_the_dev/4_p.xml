<p id="Par38">In the course of virus epidemics, the ability to adapt to external pressure is an important factor affecting the spread of the virus. Regarding the envelope S protein, recombination or mutation in the gene of its RBD can occur to promote transmission between different hosts and lead to a higher fatality rate [

To effectively prevent disease, combinations of different mAbs that identify different epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 S surface can be assessed to neutralize a wide range of isolates, including escape mutants [
