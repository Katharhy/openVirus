<p id="Par28">On the other hand, several mAbs have shown promising results in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. CR3022, a SARS-CoV-specific human mAb, binds potently with SARS-CoV-2 (

 <sub>D</sub> of 6.3 nM, measured by BLI in OctetRED96), suggesting that CR3022 has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutic, alone or in combination with other nAbs, for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection [

A mAb targeting S1 prepared from immunized transgenic mice expressing human Ig variable heavy and light chains has recently been shown to neutralize both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections via an unknown mechanism that is independent of the blockade of RBD–hACE2 interaction [

In addition, sera from SARS patients during rehabilitation or animals specifically immunized with SARS-CoV S1 may cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and reduce S protein-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry (Fig.
