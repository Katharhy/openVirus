<p id="Par30">Sequence alignment shows that SARS-CoV-2 HR2 has the same sequence as SARS-CoV HR2. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 HR2P (1168–1203 residues) was designed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 fusion and entry into a target cell. Surprisingly, HR2P showed inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated fusion and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.18 and 0.98 μM, respectively [

 <sub>50</sub> of 15.8 nM, ~149-fold more potent than the original EK1 peptide. Another sequence-based lipopeptide fusion inhibitor, IPB02, potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell–cell fusion and pseudovirus infection [
