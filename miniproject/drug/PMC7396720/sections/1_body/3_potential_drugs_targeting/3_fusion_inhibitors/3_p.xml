<p id="Par31">In addition to peptide fusion inhibitors, nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept), a currently prescribed anti-HIV protease inhibitor, suppresses both SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S-mediated cellâ€“cell fusion. Viracept is the first reported small molecule fusion inhibitor in addition to peptide fusion inhibitors. Moreover, nelfinavir may inhibit the function of TMPRSS2 involved in activation of the S protein [
