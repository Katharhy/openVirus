 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The mapping of multiple S sequences of the subgenus Sarbecovirus underscores that the S2 fusion region is more conserved than the S1 subunit and that the S1 subunit is more exposed at the viral surface [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The SARS-CoV S2 subunit plays a key role in mediating virusâ€“cell fusion and its integration into host cells, where HR1 and HR2 interact to form 6-HB, thus enabling the virus to bind to and fuse with the cell membrane [
