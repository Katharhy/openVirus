<p id="Par34">Furin (proprotein convertase (PC) subtilisin kexin 3, PCSK3), as a member of the PC family, catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide and protein substrates at paired basic residues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2 S harbors a furin cleavage site (682–685 residues) at the S1/S2 boundary, which may increase the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. The furin-like cleavage site in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 may have implications for the viral life cycle and pathogenicity. Therefore, furin inhibitors can be used as a drug therapy for SARS-CoV-2 [
