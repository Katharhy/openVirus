<p id="Par6">These proteins are critical to the viral life cycle and provide potential targets for drug therapies. For example, ACE2-based peptide, 3CLpro inhibitor (3CLpro-1), and a novel vinylsulfone protease inhibitor have been experimentally demonstrated to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 [

The SARS-CoV-2 S protein is highly conserved among all human coronaviruses (HCoVs) and is involved in receptor recognition, viral attachment, and entry into host cells. Due to its indispensable functions, it represents one of the most important targets for COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic research. In this review, we summarize advances in research of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and its therapeutic targeting.
