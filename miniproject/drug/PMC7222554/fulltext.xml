This review highlights the preventive measures, available clinical therapies and the potential of vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 by taking into consideration the strong genetic similarities of the 2003 epidemic SARS-CoV. Recent studies are investigating the repurposing of US FDA-approved drugs as there is no available vaccine yet with many attempts under clinical evaluation. Several antivirals, antimalarials and immunomodulators that have shown activity against SARS-CoV and Middle East coronavirus respiratory syndromes are being evaluated. In particular, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, arbidol, tocilizumab and bevacizumab have shown promising results. The main aim of this review is to provide an overview of this pandemic and where we currently stand.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="tde-2020-0035GA.jpg"/></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords:&#x02002;</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>infection</kwd><kwd>repurposed therapies</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>viruses</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="24"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S0001"><title>Background</title><p>Viruses are defined as obligate intracellular parasites that infect cells susceptible and permissive to their life cycle [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Viruses have an amazing architectural arrangement with a protein capsid that protects the nucleic acid and forms from repetitive building units to give a mainly spherical arrangement of structures [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Viral diseases continue to appear and pose a major public health concern, according to the WHO. Many epidemics have been reported over the past 20&#x000a0;years, including severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome (SARS-CoV) from 2002 to 2003 and influenza A subtype H1N1 from 2010. Most recently, Saudi Arabia was initially infected by Middle East coronavirus respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), a member virus of the same family [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The latest coronavirus strain, severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome-2 (SAR-COV-2), is very infectious and highly contagious and spread across the globe very fast. WHO proclaimed the epidemic as an international disaster for the public safety of importance since it has expanded to over 18 nations. Four nations confirmed a human-to-human infection, at the meeting of 30&#x000a0;January 2020 under the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005. The WHO announced this epidemic on 30&#x000a0;January 2020; a further milestone was established when the first case of the disease was recorded in the USA and not imported from China. This review highlights the prevention measures, available clinical therapies and the potential of vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Antivirals, antimalarials and immunomodulators that have shown to be active against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV will be reviewed. Other potential therapies that have been suggested or proposed and are in the Research and Development process will also be discussed.</p><sec id="S0002"><title>Coronavirus family</title><p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the genus Coronavirus in <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family. CoVs are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses with a nucleocapsid (capsid with nucleic acid) reported size of 300&#x02013;400&#x000a0;nm under the electron microscope [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. All CoVs are pleomorphic viruses that usually produce 80&#x02013;160&#x000a0;nm and 27&#x02013;32&#x000a0;kb positive polarity of crown-shaped peplomers [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. CoV recombinations are very large as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) jumps, and transcription errors are continually increasing, which might lead to genetic drifting within the same strain [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. With their rapid mutation rates, CoVs are zoonotic viruses found in humans as well as other animal species, with a broad array of clinical symptoms from asymptomatic to the hospitalization in an intensive-care facility [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. CoVs were not known to be highly pathogenic in humans until they were first detected in Guangdong in 2002 and 2003 with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. There were two more common types of CoVs, CoV-OC43, and CoV-229E, that trigger moderate infections in people with an adequate immune system, before these outbreaks. About 10&#x000a0;years ago, since SARS appeared, MERS-CoV in the Middle East countries, another extremely pathogenic CoV virus has evolved [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (nCoV) was established in Wuhan, Huanan, province of Hubei, and has become a significant global priority because of the outbreak of pneumonia, where livestock was exchanged (traded) [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The novel new virus SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh known CoV to infect humans from this viral family. At first, on 12&#x000a0;December 2019, an unexplained case of pneumonia was identified in Wuhan. Laboratory tests eliminated suspected influenza and other CoVs. On 7 January 2020, the authorities in China declared the isolation of the new CoV type [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. On 12th January, 2019-nCoV was designated by WHO, and on 11&#x000a0;February 2020 was assigned COVID-19 name. A total of 2,355,853 recorded cases were registered, with 164,656 fatalities as of the 20&#x000a0;April 2020 [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. On 29&#x000a0;January 2020, Li <italic>et al.</italic>&#x02018;s case study reported in the New Britain Journal of Medicine summarizes the 425 first documented cases in Wuhan [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Once the first case was identified, the infection was possibly spread from animal to human as a zoonotic agent. A second human-to-human route of transfer confirmed a surge in cases in Wuhan and globally after the shutdown of the Wuhan market and relocation of cases in China. At the time of writing this review, Although China declared that it is free of new cases, but have been reported at the beginning of April of 2020 of viral re-emergence. A surge in the reported cases in Europe (Italy, France, Spain and UK) and the USA had been reported [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This review is intended to provide an informed opinion on the epidemic and forms in which this initial outbreak may be handled and avoided with expert insight into the current and potential available therapies. Scientists at the Scripps Research Institute have found no proof that SARS-CoV-2 is a product of bio-engineering (manipulation) in laboratory facilities by conducting a comparative analysis of genomic data [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, this virus is possibly novel and subsequent natural results of the mutations that the CoVs family is renowned for having.</p></sec><sec id="S0003"><title>Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2</title><p>This epidemic has spread exponentially across the globe ever since the advent of the latest coronaviral epidemic COVID-19 triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In consideration of the possibility of a pandemic, scientists and physicians have been trying to grasp this emerging virus and its pathophysiology to recognize potential therapeutic protocols and to find therapeutic agents and vaccinations that are successful in the disease management. Several pneumonia cases that were localized in Wuhan in December 2019 were identified, and sources were checked. On 12&#x000a0;December 2019, the first case of COVID-19 was identified with apparent pneumonia, while on 31&#x000a0;December 2019, 27 cases of extreme viral pneumonia were officially confirmed [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Etiological studies of people that came to the hospital due to specific viruses have been conducted. The medical history of these patients has increased the likelihood of a virus outbreak. Novel SARS-COV-2 from wild bats and group 2 &#x003b2;-CoVs, which comprises severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-COV), was announced to be developed on 22 January 2020. This was the case, although COVID-19 and SARS belong to the same category of &#x003b2;-CoVs, genome-overlap between the two species is only 70%. The research group led by Bao S has reported that there are some genetic differences with SARS-CoV [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This outbreak has occurred in similar ways to the SARS epidemic during China's spring festival, which is China's most prominent traditional festival, where almost 3&#x000a0;billion citizens fly around the world to witness it. This created ideal conditions for the transmission and resulted in severe problems in the prevention and control of this extremely infectious disease. From 17 January till 23 February 2003, the Chinese Spring Festival ended in the SARS outbreak, and from 10th January to 18th February 2020, the festival was conducted once more. The number of COVID-19 reports from 10 to&#x000a0;22 January has risen rapidly. Wuhan is also a significant node of the spring festival transport network, the center of the outbreak, with approximately 10&#x000a0;million inhabitants. The number of tourists expected at the spring festival in 2020 rose 1, seven-times over 2003, the same festival, from 1.82&#x000a0;billion up to 3.11&#x000a0;billion. The massive population flow has often provided ideal conditions for this problem to spread [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>About 2,355,853 cases were reported globally after the start of the outbreak, the evidence provided by the WHO safety specialist website (20 April at 22:51 CET), and&#x000a0;164,656 of these were deadly. Approximately 83,817 cases were recorded in China, where nearly all fatalities were registered in 4636. With the highest level of reported cases in USA at the time of preparing this review with around 759,687 reported cases and 40,682 fatalities on 20 April at 22:51 CET. The WHO current coronavirus board of directors (COVID-19) is the most modified source of outbreaks in this evolving pandemic that has updated statistics of the virus epidemiology.</p></sec><sec id="S0004"><title>Virology pathogenesis</title><p>Based on the structural studies of &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-coronavirus, the viral genome encodes many structural proteins; including the spike (S) protein glycosylated, which serves as a critical inducer for the host immune response with a functional polybais (furin) cleavage site at the S1&#x02013;S2 boundary through 12 nucleotides that have been reported [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The S protein mediates host cell invasion by SARS-CoV as well as SARS-CoV-2 through binding of the host cell's membrane protein receptor named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A detailed study conducted has shown that this cellular invasion includes the production of S-proteins, facilitated by serine protease TMPRSS211, formed by the host cell. The viral genome also encodes a variety of nonstructural proteins such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), coronaviral principal protease (3CLpro)&#x000a0;and papain-like protease (PLpro) [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The viral genome is discharged as a positive sense of a single-strand RNA (ssRNA) into the cell. Subsequently, it uses host cell protein translation machinery (ribosomes) to produce the viral polyprotein and then cleaves it into effector proteins through viral proteases 3CLpro and PLpro [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The most complex component of the CoV genome is the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S protein. Six RBD amino acids were found to be important for ACE2 binding and the host spectrum of viruses close to SARS-CoV [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The Y442, S472, N479, D480, T487 and Y4911, which are L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501 and Y505 in SARS-CoV-2, are the co-ordinates centered on SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV are five or six residues. SARS-CoV-2 tends to have an RBD that connects humans, ferrets, cats and other highly-receptor-homologated animals with elevated ACE2 affinity [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S0005"><title>Sources &#x00026; modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2</title><p>As there were several new SARS-CoV-2 cases in association with the Huanan market in Wuhan [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], an animal host could be identified as a source of virus transmission. Since SARS-CoV-2 is identical to previous bat SARS-CoV [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], bats are possibly the host for their progenitor. While RaTG13, sampled with <italic>Rhinolophus affinis</italic> bat, is approximately 96% identical to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that it cannot effectively bind to human ACE2 [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Furthermore, illegally smuggled infected animals into Guangdong province, such as Malayan pangolins (<italic>Manis javanica</italic>), can carry CoVs that is identical to SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Besides, while there is no animal CoV quite close to SARS-CoV-2, the range of the CoVs is greatly undersampled in bats and other animals. In the S1&#x02013;S2 junction of the CoV mutations, insertions and removals of nucleiotides may occur []. This demonstrates that a normal evolutionary cycle will lead to a polybasic cleavage location. In order for the precursor virus to obtain the polybase site of cleavage and the spike protein mutations necessary for the human binding of ACE2, it will possibly need an animal host with a large population density (for natural selection to occur effectively) and an ACE2 gene close to that present in human [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The SARS-CoV-2 progenitor has probably jumped to humans, gaining the mentioned genomic features by evolving during unrecognized human-to-human transmission. Such adaptations allowed the pandemic of the disease once it has been acquired [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>SARS-CoV-2 infection is primarily thought to transmit from human-to-human among individuals nearby (about 6 feet) with each other through direct contact and droplets [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Such droplets may fall or be inhaled by a cough or sneezing onto the mouths or throats of surrounding people. Furthermore, it has been reported that people are known to be more infectious when they are most (sickest) symptomatic. Besides, an individual may get SARS-CoV-2 by contacting a surface or entity contaminated with the virus by rubbing ears, nose and maybe eyes after direct contact. The SARS-CoV-2 virus in some of the infected populations &#x02018;community spread&#x02019; appears to be circulating quickly and sustainably among individuals [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S0006"><title>Symptoms of catching an infection</title><p>Information from public care bodies, reviews and guidelines provide for separating the clinical cases according to the seriousness of the clinical photos. The SARS-CoV-2 might be mild, moderate or severe based on the strength of the immune system of the infected individual. Acute influenza, ARDS, sepsis and septic shock are among severe health symptoms. A definite pattern in the bulk of cases tends to reflect the scientific development of the disease. In a proportion that has yet to be identified, after around a week, infected individual health outcomes have unexpectedly worsened, as respiratory failure has declined rapidly. The extreme respiratory failure conditions and medical requirements of sepsis and septic shock should be taken seriously [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Patients with uncomplicated (mild to moderate) illness usually have signs that include mild fever, dry cough, sore throat, respiratory irritation, fatigue, stomach aches and malaise, whereas reported dyspnea in patients were asymptomatic [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Nonrespiratory signs such as diarrhea are challenging to identify relative to prior HCoV infections. Moderate pneumonia respiratory signs such as cough and shortness of breath (or children's tachypnea, etc.) were reported for patients with some cases [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Extreme pneumonia fever is caused by heavy illnesses, respiratory depression or hypoxia (SpO2 &#x0003c;90%&#x000a0;in the room). Fever is consistent with extreme pneumonia [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Nevertheless, fever signs thought to be correctly recognized as mild or sometimes missing, even in extreme cases of the disease. In children, cyanosis can occur. The description includes a psychiatric condition, and radiological terminology is used to remove complications with clinical and ventilatory requirements that are needed for this diagnosis [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This condition indicates a severe new respiratory problem and a deterioration of a respiratory feature that has already been established.

Several drugs have been used before to control and treat previous viral outbreaks, including the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003 and the MERS-CoV outbreak in 2012, which are currently being investigated to determine their efficiency in improving patients' survival and reducing the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The investigations include antiviral drugs such as lopinavir, ritonavir, favipiravir, ribavirin and remdesivir [<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Investigated drugs also include antimalarials, immunomodulators, VEGF inhibitors, corticosteroids, among others. Several of these medications are now part of the recommendations of the People's Rep&#x000fa;blica of China National Health Commission (NHC) for the study of SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia for prevention, diagnostic and care [<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. <italic>In silico</italic>, <italic>in vitro</italic> and clinical studies are intensively conducted throughout the world, especially in China and USA. For example, molecular modeling studies are using docking software to determine the binding efficiency of these compounds to SARS-CoV-2. These studies are aiming to validate the repurposing of the use of different drugs such HIV protease inhibitors, nucleoside analogs for SARS-CoV-2&#x000a0;and other existing drugs with antiviral activity [<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>].</p><sec id="S0016"><title>Antiviral agents</title><p>Lopinavir (LPV) is a HIV type 1 aspartate protease inhibitor while ritonavir (RTV) is usually combined to it to increase the plasma half-life of LPV by inhibiting CYP450 enzyme [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Since the outbreak, several clinical trials have been investigated on the potentials of this combination (LPV/RTV) on SARS-CoV-2 patients outcomes. A clinical trial was conducted in Jin Yin-Tan Hospital, Wuhan, on 199 seriously ill patients of SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Male and nonpregnant patients of 18&#x000a0;years or older were included. The patients have an oxygen saturation of 94% or less with pneumonia confirmed by chest imagining. They were divided into two groups: a control group received the standard care in hospital, and the other treatment group received a combination of LPV/RTV (400 and 100&#x000a0;mg, respectively) twice daily plus the standard hospital care for 14&#x000a0;days. The treatment group showed no improvement in survival compared with control patients. The mortality percentage in LPV/RTV patients was not significantly different from control 19.2, and 25%, respectively [<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. No differences in the percentages of viral RNA detection was found at different times points in the members of the two groups [<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Another clinical trial was conducted at the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen to measure the effectiveness of favipiravir (FPV) compared with LPV/RTV combination as control. FPV is a novel RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor that showed promising <italic>in vitro</italic> results on SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. It blocks the replication of several viruses other than influenza. The included patients have an age range of 16&#x02013;75. Patients with severe conditions, including RR &#x0003e;30, oxygen saturation &#x0003c;93%, respiratory failure, shock, and end-stage kidney or liver diseases, were excluded. The FPV group included 35 patients and received FPV day 1: 1600&#x000a0;mg twice daily; days 2&#x02013;14: 600&#x000a0;mg twice daily) plus interferon alpha (IFN-&#x003b1;) by aerosol inhalation (5&#x000a0;million U twice daily). The LPV/RTV group received (days 1&#x02013;14: 400&#x000a0;mg/100&#x000a0;mg twice daily) plus IFN-&#x003b1; by aerosol inhalation (5&#x000a0;million U twice daily). Standard care was given to both groups. Clinical outcomes include viral clearance (two constitutive negative results on qPCR detection throughout 24&#x000a0;h), changes in chest imaging (improvement in CT scan for lung parenchyma based on well-defined scales), as well as adverse drug effects (by questionaries and lab results). The median time of viral clearance was significantly lower in FPV group compared with the LPV/RTV group 4 and 11&#x000a0;days, respectively. The improvement rate in CT scans was only higher in FPV group on day 14 of the treatment compared with LPV/RTV group 91.4 and 62.2%. The FPV group showed fewer adverse drug reactions compared with LPV/RTV group, and no patients needed to discontinue the treatment [<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Therefore, FPV stands as a promising agent in the management of SARS-CoV-2. Currently, three clinical trials are being conducted to validate further the role of FPV in the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection (NCT04303299, NCT04310228 and NCT04273763). FPV is being investigated as monotherapy or in combination therapy. It is also being compared with placebo or other antiviral regimens. Examples of combinations are LPV/RTV plus FPV, darunavir/ritonavir, chloroquine and FPV combined with tocilizumab [<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>].</p><p>Clinical trials are also being conducted on the antiviral drug, remdesivir (RDV) (Phase III), after reports on its significant effect when given intravenously to some SARS-CoV-2 patients [<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. RDV is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent by acting as a nucleoside analog that was initially developed to treat Ebola. A molecular modeling study suggested that RDV could be a potential therapeutic agent as the active form (CHEMBL2016761) of RDV has shown perfect docking scores among other antiviral agents [<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. It also showed promising <italic>in vitro</italic> activities by blocking the viral infection of SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated by Wang M. <italic>et al.</italic>, (EC<sub>50</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.77&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M; CC<sub>50</sub>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M; SI&#x000a0;&#x0003e;129.87) [<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. A clinical case study for the first patient diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in USA has shown promising effectiveness of RDV [<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Infusion with RDV was administrated to patients on day 7 after developing worsening in clinical conditions (pneumonia). The patient showed improvement in clinical symptoms, oxygen saturation and CT imaging scans [<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Thus, RDV is currently one of the most promising antiviral agents for reversing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Currently, about seven clinical trials are registered for investigating RDV at Clinicaltrials.gov and being conducted in USA and China (NCT04292899, NCT04292730, NCT04252664, NCT04257656, NCT04280705, NCT04315948 and NCT04302766). The studies have differences in patients disease conditions (mild, moderate and severe), treatment durations (5, 9 and&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;days), as well as the control group (RDV is being compared with placebo, LPV/RTV or LPV/RTV plus IFN-&#x000df;-1a) [<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The safety profile for RDV is acceptable with GI symptoms and has the most common side effects, including nausea, vomiting and rectal bleeding. Some patients also experience elevations in liver enzymes [<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. A very recent case study was published showing the advantage of delayed administration of RDV to patients with severe SAR-COV-2-associated pneumonia. The patient received RDV on day 13 of symptoms and showed significant improvement in respiratory symptoms (extubation) after 6&#x000a0;h of RDV first dose [<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. An NIH-supported clinical trial is being conducted in the USA. RDV will be provided to patients as a loading dose of 200&#x000a0;mg on the first day of the study. Then, the drug will be given as 100&#x000a0;mg in the following days for 10 days. The patients' clinical outcomes from full recovery to death will be compared with the placebo group [<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>].</p><p>Ribavirin (RBV) is another broad-spectrum antiviral agent and acts as a nucleoside analog [<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic> cytotoxicity of RBV against SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated with EC<sub>50</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;109.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M [<xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. RBV is being given for SARS-CoV-2 patients in different hospitals. However, the clinical outcomes from its administration are still not clear. RBV was given to 80 patients referred to the First People's Hospital of Yancheng City, the Second People's Hospital of Yancheng Cit and the Fifth People's Hospital of Wuxi from 22 January to 14 February 2020, in China. RBV was given intravenously for periods of 3&#x02013;12&#x000a0;days [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It is recommended to be given at a dose of 500&#x000a0;mg each time, two- to three-times/day, in combination with other drugs such as IFN-&#x003b1; or LPV/RTV [<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Currently, one clinical trial (NCT04276688) is recruiting patients to determine the efficacy of RBV for SARS-CoV-2 infection at the University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital. In the study, RBV (400&#x000a0;mg twice daily for 14&#x000a0;days) was administrated in addition to LPV/RTV and INF beta-IB compared with the control group with LPV/RTV alone [<xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>].</p><p>Arbidol is another antiviral that is being considered for SARS-CoV-2 infection. A retrospective study from the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University has shown that the addition of arbidol to or LPV/RTV treatment significantly provided additional benefits on viral clearance and patients' clinical outcomes. Arbidol was administered at 200&#x000a0;mg every 8&#x000a0;h for the entire study group of 16 patients and LPV (400&#x000a0;mg)/RTV (100&#x000a0;mg) orally every 12&#x000a0;h until coronavirus had been reported three-times with negative results, while the control group (17 patients) received and LPV (400&#x000a0;mg)/RTV (100&#x000a0;mg) orally every 12&#x000a0;h. The combination group achieved higher viral clearance rates at days 7 and 14 compared with the control group (75 and 94% vs 35 and 52.9%, respectively). LPV/RTV, combined with arbidol, have shown antiviral effects in SARS-CoV-2 in other reports from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine [<xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. This is maybe important as earlier viral clearance is associated with more prevention of severe lung lesions. Indeed, the patients' CT imaging at day 7 was significantly better in a combination group compared with control (69 vs 29%, respectively) [<xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Current ongoing clinical trials are further investigating the role of arbidol in the management of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in different combinations, including NCT04260594 and NCT04286503 [<xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>].

CQ is an old antimalarial drug with limited use due to its resistance as well as poisoning risk (rhythm disturbance, QT interval prolongation) [<xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was developed later and showed better clinical safety and lower risks of toxicities [<xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. HCQ is also an option for the management of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus. HCQ is a highly available drug with a low cost and an acceptable toxicity profile [<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Moreover, HCQ has good oral bioavailability allowing it to reach significant blood concentration that is sufficient to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. These properties nominate HCQ as a great candidate to be applied on large scale use such as the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. On the <italic>in vitro</italic> level, HCQ showed significant inhibition of the SAR-CoV-2 infection [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. CQ and HCQ resulted in significant antiviral cytotoxicity in African green monkey kidney VeroE6 cells (ATCC-1586) (CC<sub>50</sub> 273.20 and 249.50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M, respectively). The two compounds reduced the viral RNA copy number, with CQ being significantly more potent [<xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Another <italic>in vitro</italic> study has shown the potency of CQ and HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 with HCQ with enhanced potency (EC<sub>50</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.72%&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M vs 5.47%&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) [<xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Suggested mechanisms of action include interfering with the pH-dependent steps of viral replication by increasing the pH of intracellular vesicles such as lysosomes and endosomes [<xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. CQ also blocks the ACE2 receptor glycosylation and thus prevents the S protein binding [<xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>].

The clinical outcomes include time to clinical recovery, all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, relapse after discharge, liver function tests, C-reactive protein (CRP), the incidence of adverse effects, days on mechanical ventilation, cost, among others. These trials are investigating CQ or HCQ alone or in combination with other therapies. Some of these trials published its outcomes, and some are still waiting for the results. Reports from over 100 patients in studies demonstrated that CQ showed excellent results compared with control. CQ treated patients showed lower viral load, better CT imaging, and shorter disease period [<xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. The ongoing clinical studies, efficacy and safety of CQ or HCQ alone in treating SARS-CoV-2 are being investigated in ChiCTR2000030054 (a total 80 patients are enrolled), ChiCTR2000029992 (three groups: CQ, HCQ and control), ChiCTR2000029988 (severe patients/critical illness cases), ChiCTR2000029975 (CQ is given as aerosol inhalation), ChiCTR2000029935 (100 patients), ChiCTR2000029899 (HCQ vs CQ), ChiCTR2000029898 (HCQ vs CQ), ChiCTR2000029803 (HCQ as prophylactics to prevent SARS-CoV-2), ChiCTR2000029741 (CQ vs LPV/RTV), ChiCTR2000029559 (HCQ vs placebo) and ChiCTR2000029542 (CQ vs placebo) [<xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>].</p><p>In parallel, studies are being conducted all over the world, investigating CQ and HCQ effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of SAR-CoV-2. Clinical trials were registered to the Clinicaltrials.gov from USA, Korea, Mexico, among others [<xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Interestingly, a clinical prevention study (COPCOV) is intended to administrate CQ in healthy, not previously infected by SAR-CoV-2 volunteers. CQ is to be initially given as a loading dose of 10&#x000a0;mg base/kg, followed by 150&#x000a0;mg daily (250&#x000a0;mg CQ phosphate salt) will be taken for 3 months [<xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>].</p><p>Combinations of other drugs with CQ are also being investigated in ongoing clinical trials. FBV tablets combined with CQ phosphate in the treatment of coronavirus pneumonia is being investigated in the ChiCTR2000030987 clinical trial. In ChiCTR2000029609, the efficacy of CQ alone, LPV/RTV alone and CQ plus LPV/RTV is being investigated in mild and severe patients [<xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Two or more drug combinations with CQ are also being investigated in other countries. For example, in THDMS-COVID19, oseltamivir 300&#x000a0;mg per day plus CQ 1000&#x000a0;mg per day or darunavir 400&#x000a0;mg every 8&#x000a0;h RTV 2.5&#x000a0;mg/kg plus oseltamivir 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;mg/kg plus CQ 500&#x000a0;mg are being studied [<xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>].</p><p>The dosing system and duration of treatment are still varied between different studies. For example, in ChiCTR2000029992, the dosing of CQ is 1.0&#x000a0;g x 2&#x000a0;days for the first dose, 0.5&#x000a0;g x 12&#x000a0;days from the third day, for HCQ is 0.2&#x000a0;g twice daily x 14&#x000a0;days. In ChiCTR2000029975, 150&#x000a0;mg CQ phosphate is dissolved in 5&#x000a0;ml of normal saline, twice daily, and inhaled by atomization for 1 week. The dosing in ChiCTR2000029899 and ChiCTR2000029898 is for HCQ: day 1: first dose: 6 tablets (0.1&#x000a0;g/table, second dose: six tablets (0.1g/tablet) after 6h; day 2&#x02013;5: two tablets (0.1&#x000a0;g/tablet), twice daily and for CQ day1&#x02013;3: 500&#x000a0;mg, twice daily. Day 4&#x02013;5: 250&#x000a0;mg, twice daily. In ChiCTR2000029559, HCQ is given in two doses, and one group received 0.1 oral 2/day, the second group received 0.2 oral 2/day, while the third group is a placebo. In ChiCTR2000029542, CQ is given as 0.5&#x000a0;g every time, twice daily for a 10-day course. More clinical trials are needed to determine the effective dosing regimen as toxicities (cardiomyopathy and retinopathy) are still possible after prolonging and high doses of HCQ [<xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. The application of CQ and HCQ for SARS-CoV-2 should also consider contraindications, including patient allergies, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, previous history of retinopathy, cardiomyopathy (QT prolongation)&#x000a0;or end-stage kidney disease [<xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>].</p><p>A recent protocol approved by the office of National Clinical Advisor, acute hospital division, recommended the use of CQ 500&#x000a0;mg twice daily for 10 days for patients diagnosed as mild, moderate and severe cases. Alternatively, HCQ in a regimen of day 1: 400&#x000a0;mg twice daily, then days 2&#x02013;5, 200&#x000a0;mg twice daily (total duration 5&#x000a0;days). Another alternative is RVD as an intravenous infusion, 200&#x000a0;mg on day 1, then 100&#x000a0;mg on days 2&#x02013;10 (total duration 10 days) [<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. A novel combination of CQ and azithromycin was used recently in a small French clinical trial [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. About 36 patients were included, including asymptomatic patients, patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms, and patients with lower respiratory tract symptoms were included. About 20 patients received HCQ sulfate 200&#x000a0;mg, three-times daily for 10 days. Out of the HCQ-treated patients, six patients received azithromycin 500&#x000a0;mg on day 1 and 250&#x000a0;mg for the following 4&#x000a0;days. On day 6, virological clearance was significantly higher in HCQ compared with the control group (70 vs 12.5%). Azithromycin + HCQ group showed 100% virological clearance on day 6. However, this combination is not established yet. The risk of developing severe QT interval prolongation may be a limiting factor. The sample size in this study is small, and more significant studies are needed [<xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. A very recent study utilized global affinity purification-mass spectrometry (APMS) analysis to identify the host-pathogen interferences for SARS-CoV-2, further validate the possible efficacies of CQ and azithromycin. The study showed that the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp6 protein interacted with the sigma receptor. The sigma receptors interact with CQ. Azithromycin has also been shown to be an off-target activity to human mitochondria and ribosomes subunits that interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp8 protein (MRPS27, MRPS5, MRPS25 and MRPS2 ) [<xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Another unusual combination that was proposed recently is nitazoxanide and HCQ. The studies on SARS-CoV-2 showed that the virus interfered with host pathways that are needed to activate the innate immune system of the patient to fight the infection (immune senescence). SARS-CoV-2 blocks the interferon pathway and prevents its upregulation in the host system. Nitazoxanide is antiprotozoal that upregulates the innate antiviral mechanisms and activates interferon pathways in the host [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Accordingly, the study is proposing that dual use of the HCQ with nitazoxanide would have synergistic effects against SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. The proposed dosing system is 400&#x000a0;mg twice a day for 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;days (loading) then 200&#x000a0;mg twice a day for 4&#x000a0;days for HCQ and 600&#x000a0;mg &#x02013;sustained-release (SR) tabs/twice daily of nitazoxanide for 7 days [<xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S0018"><title>Immunomodulators &#x00026; immunosuppressants</title><p>The rationale of using immunosuppressants in the management of SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia comes from several reports of cases of hyper inflammation and cytokine storms in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2 patients [<xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>].

It acts by inhibiting the binding of IL-6 to IL-6 receptors. It has potent anti-inflammatory effects and already approved for the treatment of RA [<xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Tocilizumab is a biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (BoDMARD) and recommended as an alternative to methotrexate or TNF-&#x003b1; antagonists in RA patients [<xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Tocilizumab is well tolerated and associated with an acceptable safety profile [<xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Investigating its role in the management of SARS-CoV-2 associated pneumonia is based on the inflammation and cytokine storm detected in those patients. Key inflammatory mediators including IL-6, IL-2, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, IFN-&#x003b3; inducible protein 10 and TNF-&#x003b1; were found to be highly involved in the inflammatory storm inducing severe alveolar destruction and dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Elevations in IL-6 levels, in particular, were found as a significant predictor of fatality in patients [<xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Therefore interfering with IL-6 and other mediators may have potential clinical benefits in reversing respiratory dysfunction in those patients. A retrospective study from China hospitals demonstrated the benefits of tocilizumab in addition to the standard therapy of 26 patients with severe and critical care conditions [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Tocilizumab was given at a dose of 400&#x000a0;mg once through an intravenous drip in 18 patients. Another dose of tocilizumab was given for the last three patients due to the fever. Treatment with tocilizumab resulted in a significant relief of fever (100%), lowering of oxygen intake 75% and improvement in respiratory function. Tocilizumab normalized lymphocytes levels 52.6%, significantly decreased the C-reactive protein level 84.2% and improved the CT imaging 90.5%. The results from this study are suggesting tocilizumab as promising therapeutic agent for severe and critical SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, this study is observational study with limited number of patients. According to clinical trials are currently conduced to validate these results [<xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>].</p><p>A clinical trial (TOCIVID-19, NCT04317092) supported by the National Cancer Institute was recently registered in Clinicaltrials.gov to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of tocilizumab in the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Tocilizumab is to be injected as two doses, 8&#x000a0;mg/kg (up to a maximum of 800&#x000a0;mg per dose), with an interval of 12&#x000a0;h [<xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Another clinical study (NCT04315480) has been conducted in Italy is investigating the early administration of single-dose injection of tocilizumab 8 mg/kg in patients with SARS-CoV-2 severe multifocal interstitial pneumonia [<xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Two more Chinese studies are also investigating tocilizumab effectiveness. ChiCTR2000029765 is a multicenter, randomized controlled trial for the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia, SARS-CoV-2. The study is being conducted in the First Affiliated Hospital of the University of Science and Technology of China. About 94 patients are receiving standard care therapy, and 94 patients were receiving standard care therapy along with Tocilizumab. ChiCTR2000030894 is another clinical trial investigating the use of FPV combined with tocilizumab versus FPV alone versus tocilizumab alone for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Sarilumab is another IL-6 blocker that is used in moderate-to-severe RA [<xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. It is also being investigated for its effectiveness in the management of SAR-CoV-2 patients in the Chinese clinical trial, NCT04315298 [<xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. However, the use of these agents is usually associated with several risks, including the development of secondary infections and severe allergic reactions. Such risks should be considered while using these agents in SARS-CoV-2.</p></sec><sec id="S0019"><title>Immune therapies: bevacizumab as an example</title><p>Bevacizumab is another monoclonal antibody (humanized) that blocks the VEGF and interferes with its binding to its receptors. Thus, it inhibits angiogenesis, which is an essential process for the development of new blood vessels to supply cancer cells with oxygen and nutrients [<xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Bevacizumab showed productive anticancer activities against colorectal, kidney, lung, breast and head and neck cancers [<xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Bevacizumab is also being studied as a candidate to manage the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. An ongoing multicenter clinical trial in Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, China, NCT04305106, is investigating the use of bevacizumab for a severing of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2. The study is enrolling 118 patients. Bevacizumab will be administrated in a regimen of 500&#x000a0;mg +0.9% NaCl (100&#x000a0;ml), intravenous drip (not less than 90&#x000a0;min) [<xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. NCT04275414 is another similar clinical study that is also established in the same hospital with similar settings on 20 patients. However, the therapeutic benefits of bevacizumab are limited by possible serious events associated with its use. Bevacizumab was reported to result in new-onset hypertension, bleeding, delaying wound healing, thromboembolic events and bowel perforations [<xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. These risks should be considered while repurposing the use of this drug for SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><p>Other immunomodulators are being considered, including adalimumab. As mentioned above, TNF-&#x003b1; is an inflammatory mediator that is upregulated in SARS-CoV-2. Adalimumab is a TNF inhibitor and may show effective inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia [<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S0020"><title>Corticosteroids (methylprednisolone in particular)</title><p>Previously, corticosteroids have been used to treat the SARS-CoV outbreak with proven efficacy. Accordingly, it is valid to evaluate the role of corticosteroids in the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak [<xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone are expected to inhibit inflammatory response that is the main factor inducing lung damage in SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the other hand, corticosteroids may suppress the immune response and delay the viral clearance of SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. To investigate their exact effects, a case study by Xu&#x000a0;<italic>et al.</italic>, in a 50-year-old patient that was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, showed that the administration of methylprednisolone (80&#x000a0;mg twice daily) to the standard care did not improve patients outcomes. The patients' symptoms continued to deteriorate over several days after the medications. Patients developed severe dyspnea and shortness of breath. Oxygen saturation was dropped to less than 60%, and the patient developed cardiac arrest and died [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A study included 80 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection received treatment of a single antibiotic (moxifloxacin) and RBV antiviral therapy. Only 12 patients received methylprednisolone to improve patients' shortness of breath. The study did not indicate any advantages for the use of methylprednisolone in those patients [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Another study was conducted on 46 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who received standard care of oxygen, cough relief, antiviral (LPV/RTV and IFN-&#x003b1;) and nutritional support. Of those, 26 patients additionally received methylprednisolone at a dose of 12&#x000a0;mg/kg/d for 5&#x02013;7&#x000a0;days via intravenous injection. Three deaths were reported, and two of them received methylprednisolone. Patients received methylprednisolone, showed faster improvement in fever, a shorter period of supplemental oxygen and better absorption of lung focus [<xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Accordingly, methylprednisolone did not improve mortality outcomes but may result in a beneficial impact on clinical symptoms and recovery time. Until the time of this review, the role of corticosteroids as adjunctive treatment in the management of SARS-CoV-2 is still controversial. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, corticosteroids are not preferred as they may be associated with prolongation of viral replication, as noted in previous MERS-CoV outbreak [<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Ongoing clinical trials are being conducted at this moment to confirm their role. ChiCTR2000029386 is a randomized clinical trial currently being conducted in China on 48 patients and methylprednisolone to be administrated to half of them like a dose of 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;mg/kg/day for 3&#x000a0;days [<xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Other studies also registered for <underline>Clinicaltrials.gov</underline> and currently in the process of recruiting patients. These studies include NCT04244591 (for critically-ill patients with severe acute respiratory failure (Steroids-SARI) in Beijing, China), NCT04263402 (to compare the efficacy of different hormone doses in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 severe pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei, China), and NCT04273321 (to determine efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in SARS-CoV-2 in different areas in China) [<xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S0021"><title>Immune boosters</title><p>In contrast to the above reports about the potential benefits of using immunosuppressants and immunomodulators in the management of SARS-CoV-2, a very recent study is suggesting the use of immune booster interventions. The study is proposing the use of individualized interventions to improve the immune response (I4R) approach. Low-level radiation, statins and aspirin are suggested for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. This proposal stems from previous reports about the effectiveness of these interventions in curing pneumonia in general. The study urges the implantation of clinical studies to investigate these regimens [<xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S0022"><title>Anti-parasitic agent (ivermectin)</title><p>Recent <italic>in vitro</italic> reports demonstrated the potential efficacy of ivermectin against SAR-COV-2. 5000-fold reduced the viral load (in 2-h post-infection with SARS-CoV-2 Vero-hSLAM cells) after 48&#x000a0;h of single ivermectin treatment (5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) [<xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. An observational study showed the survival benefits of using single ivermectin dose (150&#x000a0;mg/kg) after initiating mechanical ventilation in critically ill SAR-COV-2 patients. Patients who received ivermectin showed better survival, shorter hospital stay and intensive care unit length [<xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. A recent study from Italy is suggesting a synergistic effect of combining hydroxychloroquine with ivermectin against SAR-COV-2.

Besides, <italic>in silico</italic> discovery of molecules is relatively a slow process as these molecules need to be experimentally tested. In this section, we summarize the potential therapies as suggested and proposed by several research groups and pharmaceutical companies from the beginning of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The selection of these potential therapies was based on their role in similar viral infections on the corresponding targets.</p><sec id="S0024"><title>Anti-inflammatory therapies</title><p>Inflammation is a response of the immune system during the earliest stages of viral infections [<xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. As a result, the anti-inflammatory drug is a choice for viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2 infection. Few studies discussed anti-inflammatory therapies as an option to reduce the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection with baricitinib, and melatonin being the most related [<xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>].</p><p>Baricitinib, a drug approved for RA, was identified by <italic>in silico</italic> screening for anti-inflammatory drugs that could be potential therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. SAR-COV-2 enters lung cells by ACE2-mediated invasion. AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) is one of the regulators for this invasion. Few approved drugs with high affinity to inhibit AAK-1 enzymes such as fedratinib and sunitinib were <italic>in silico</italic> screened with the only barcitinib showing an inhibitory effect on the enzyme janus kinase (JAK), another regulator for the invasion. Stebbing&#x000a0;<italic>et al.</italic> have suggested that baricitinib could be trialed for its anti-inflammatory and entry inhibition effects [<xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. Moreover, the patent application reveals the preparation of baricitinib by Incyte Corporation pharmaceutical company [<xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>].</p><p>Melatonin is another drug that has been proposed as a potential anti-inflammatory drug to relieve the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral infections cause injury of the immune system that is commonly associated with oxidative stress and damage of organs [<xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. Melatonin is an old biogenic amine for treating sleep disturbances and circadian rhythm. It has an antioxidant effect and has been previously encouraged to be used for Ebola viral infection [<xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. As suggested by Cheng&#x000a0;<italic>et al.</italic>, melatonin could reduce the clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and prolong the survival time for the patient.</p></sec><sec id="S0025"><title>Angiotensin receptor blocking therapies</title><p>As mentioned previously, SARS-CoV-2 gets into the pulmonary cells after binding to the ACE2 receptor domain [<xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>].

Kruse has suggested that therapies that block the ACE2 receptor domain could be studied for their potential effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. For example, using the small receptor-binding domain (RBD) from the vital domain of the SARS S protein that has shown to bind to ACE2 [<xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>,<xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>] receptor. A second option is to administer an antibody that binds to ACE2, which could prevent SARS-CoV-2 particles from binding to the ACE2 receptor. A third potential option that has been suggested by Zhang and Liu is using compounds that have shown to inhibit ACE2 enzyme such as emodin and promazine [<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Emodin is a natural anthraquinone compound that is derived from the commonly used Chinese medicinal herbs, such as the genus <italic>Rheum</italic> and <italic>Polygonum</italic> [<xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Emodin was found to block the binding of SARS-CoV S protein with the enzyme ACE2 [<xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>], while promazine is an old anti-psychotic drug with structural similarity to emodin. Promazine has shown inhibitory signs for the replication of SARS-CoV.

sec-type="conclusions" id="S0029"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The review offers reported information on the global research and advancement of potential and current therapeutic agents and vaccines under development relevant for SARS-CoV-2 focused on the complete, up-to-date generic drug product selection. This describes morphology, physiology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and focuses primarily on antivirals, antimalarials and immunotherapeutics aimed at diverse molecular associations linked to infection and replication. This review focuses primarily on agents reported to be beneficial against certain RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, influenza, Ebola and counter inflammatory medications, as well as product reuse attempts. There is a broad range of products available in recombinant biotechnology to generate antibodies as well as in cytokines targeted at the production and transmission of virus genes and cellular receptors. A significant attempt will be made to produce successful drugs and vaccinations against current and possible future SARS-CoV-2 infections and other potentially pathogenic virus outbreaks to minimize the tremendous effect on human life. The epidemic of COVID-19 underlines further the importance of developing a relatively broad spectrum of antiviral drugs and the significance of implementing innovative strategies like artificial intelligence to expedite therapeutics development, considering the cost and effort involved in developing clinical drugs. As highlighted in this review, the abundance of publications and the fast publishing race associated with the virus SARS-CoV-2 outbreak suggests a concentrated initiative on the part of research organizations and the pharmaceutical industry both concerning molecular mechanisms and concerning therapeutic pathways used for current and potential coronavirus outbreaks.</p></sec><sec id="S0030"><title>Future perspective</title><p>This overview of the current COVI19 global interest offers a summary of the existing state of the art concerning effects on public health and safety, pathophysiology and clinical symptoms of the pandemic infection, diagnostics tools available, patient management and global response from enforced curfew to total lockdown that we are witnessing around the globe. Only when the pandemic ceases will we evaluate the health, social and economic consequences of this catastrophic event and, therefore, can draw insights from any possible potential epidemics for future cases, particularly in public and global safety.
