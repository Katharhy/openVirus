<p>Previously, corticosteroids have been used to treat the SARS-CoV outbreak with proven efficacy. Accordingly, it is valid to evaluate the role of corticosteroids in the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak [
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone are expected to inhibit inflammatory response that is the main factor inducing lung damage in SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the other hand, corticosteroids may suppress the immune response and delay the viral clearance of SARS-CoV-2 [

 <italic>et al.</italic>, in a 50-year-old patient that was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, showed that the administration of methylprednisolone (80 mg twice daily) to the standard care did not improve patients outcomes. The patients' symptoms continued to deteriorate over several days after the medications. Patients developed severe dyspnea and shortness of breath. Oxygen saturation was dropped to less than 60%, and the patient developed cardiac arrest and died [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A study included 80 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection received treatment of a single antibiotic (moxifloxacin) and RBV antiviral therapy. Only 12 patients received methylprednisolone to improve patients' shortness of breath. The study did not indicate any advantages for the use of methylprednisolone in those patients [

Another study was conducted on 46 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who received standard care of oxygen, cough relief, antiviral (LPV/RTV and IFN-α) and nutritional support. Of those, 26 patients additionally received methylprednisolone at a dose of 12 mg/kg/d for 5–7 days via intravenous injection. Three deaths were reported, and two of them received methylprednisolone. Patients received methylprednisolone, showed faster improvement in fever, a shorter period of supplemental oxygen and better absorption of lung focus [
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Accordingly, methylprednisolone did not improve mortality outcomes but may result in a beneficial impact on clinical symptoms and recovery time. Until the time of this review, the role of corticosteroids as adjunctive treatment in the management of SARS-CoV-2 is still controversial. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, corticosteroids are not preferred as they may be associated with prolongation of viral replication, as noted in previous MERS-CoV outbreak [
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Ongoing clinical trials are being conducted at this moment to confirm their role. ChiCTR2000029386 is a randomized clinical trial currently being conducted in China on 48 patients and methylprednisolone to be administrated to half of them like a dose of 1–2 mg/kg/day for 3 days [
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Other studies also registered for 
 <underline>Clinicaltrials.gov</underline> and currently in the process of recruiting patients. These studies include NCT04244591 (for critically-ill patients with severe acute respiratory failure (Steroids-SARI) in Beijing, China), NCT04263402 (to compare the efficacy of different hormone doses in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 severe pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei, China), and NCT04273321 (to determine efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in SARS-CoV-2 in different areas in China) [
