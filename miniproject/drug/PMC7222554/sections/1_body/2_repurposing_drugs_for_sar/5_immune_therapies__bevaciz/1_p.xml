<p>Bevacizumab is another monoclonal antibody (humanized) that blocks the VEGF and interferes with its binding to its receptors. Thus, it inhibits angiogenesis, which is an essential process for the development of new blood vessels to supply cancer cells with oxygen and nutrients [

An ongoing multicenter clinical trial in Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, China, NCT04305106, is investigating the use of bevacizumab for a severing of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2. The study is enrolling 118 patients. Bevacizumab will be administrated in a regimen of 500 mg +0.9% NaCl (100 ml), intravenous drip (not less than 90 min) [

However, the therapeutic benefits of bevacizumab are limited by possible serious events associated with its use. Bevacizumab was reported to result in new-onset hypertension, bleeding, delaying wound healing, thromboembolic events and bowel perforations [
