<p>As discussed above, the repurposing of existing drugs is the fast solution to act against the invasive spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several drugs have been used before to control and treat previous viral outbreaks, including the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003 and the MERS-CoV outbreak in 2012, which are currently being investigated to determine their efficiency in improving patients' survival and reducing the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 infection [

Several of these medications are now part of the recommendations of the People's República of China National Health Commission (NHC) for the study of SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia for prevention, diagnostic and care [

For example, molecular modeling studies are using docking software to determine the binding efficiency of these compounds to SARS-CoV-2. These studies are aiming to validate the repurposing of the use of different drugs such HIV protease inhibitors, nucleoside analogs for SARS-CoV-2 and other existing drugs with antiviral activity [
