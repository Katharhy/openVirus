<p>A clinical trial (TOCIVID-19, NCT04317092) supported by the National Cancer Institute was recently registered in Clinicaltrials.gov to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of tocilizumab in the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Tocilizumab is to be injected as two doses, 8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 800 mg per dose), with an interval of 12 h [

ChiCTR2000029765 is a multicenter, randomized controlled trial for the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia, SARS-CoV-2. The study is being conducted in the First Affiliated Hospital of the University of Science and Technology of China. About 94 patients are receiving standard care therapy, and 94 patients were receiving standard care therapy along with Tocilizumab. ChiCTR2000030894 is another clinical trial investigating the use of FPV combined with tocilizumab versus FPV alone versus tocilizumab alone for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection [

 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. It is also being investigated for its effectiveness in the management of SAR-CoV-2 patients in the Chinese clinical trial, NCT04315298 [
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. However, the use of these agents is usually associated with several risks, including the development of secondary infections and severe allergic reactions. Such risks should be considered while using these agents in SARS-CoV-2.
