<p>Lopinavir (LPV) is a HIV type 1 aspartate protease inhibitor while ritonavir (RTV) is usually combined to it to increase the plasma half-life of LPV by inhibiting CYP450 enzyme [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Since the outbreak, several clinical trials have been investigated on the potentials of this combination (LPV/RTV) on SARS-CoV-2 patients outcomes. A clinical trial was conducted in Jin Yin-Tan Hospital, Wuhan, on 199 seriously ill patients of SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Male and nonpregnant patients of 18 years or older were included. The patients have an oxygen saturation of 94% or less with pneumonia confirmed by chest imagining. They were divided into two groups: a control group received the standard care in hospital, and the other treatment group received a combination of LPV/RTV (400 and 100 mg, respectively) twice daily plus the standard hospital care for 14 days. The treatment group showed no improvement in survival compared with control patients. The mortality percentage in LPV/RTV patients was not significantly different from control 19.2, and 25%, respectively [

Another clinical trial was conducted at the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen to measure the effectiveness of favipiravir (FPV) compared with LPV/RTV combination as control. FPV is a novel RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor that showed promising

 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. It blocks the replication of several viruses other than influenza. The included patients have an age range of 16–75. Patients with severe conditions, including RR &gt;30, oxygen saturation &lt;93%, respiratory failure, shock, and end-stage kidney or liver diseases, were excluded. The FPV group included 35 patients and received FPV day 1: 1600 mg twice daily; days 2–14: 600 mg twice daily) plus interferon alpha (IFN-α) by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily). The LPV/RTV group received (days 1–14: 400 mg/100 mg twice daily) plus IFN-α by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily). Standard care was given to both groups. Clinical outcomes include viral clearance (two constitutive negative results on qPCR detection throughout 24 h), changes in chest imaging (improvement in CT scan for lung parenchyma based on well-defined scales), as well as adverse drug effects (by questionaries and lab results). The median time of viral clearance was significantly lower in FPV group compared with the LPV/RTV group 4 and 11 days, respectively. The improvement rate in CT scans was only higher in FPV group on day 14 of the treatment compared with LPV/RTV group 91.4 and 62.2%. The FPV group showed fewer adverse drug reactions compared with LPV/RTV group, and no patients needed to discontinue the treatment [

Currently, three clinical trials are being conducted to validate further the role of FPV in the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection (NCT04303299, NCT04310228 and NCT04273763). FPV is being investigated as monotherapy or in combination therapy. It is also being compared with placebo or other antiviral regimens. Examples of combinations are LPV/RTV plus FPV, darunavir/ritonavir, chloroquine and FPV combined with tocilizumab [
