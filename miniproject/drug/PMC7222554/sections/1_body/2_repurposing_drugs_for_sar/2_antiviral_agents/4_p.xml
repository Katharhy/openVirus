<p>Arbidol is another antiviral that is being considered for SARS-CoV-2 infection. A retrospective study from the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University has shown that the addition of arbidol to or LPV/RTV treatment significantly provided additional benefits on viral clearance and patients' clinical outcomes. Arbidol was administered at 200 mg every 8 h for the entire study group of 16 patients and LPV (400 mg)/RTV (100 mg) orally every 12 h until coronavirus had been reported three-times with negative results, while the control group (17 patients) received and LPV (400 mg)/RTV (100 mg) orally every 12 h. The combination group achieved higher viral clearance rates at days 7 and 14 compared with the control group (75 and 94% vs 35 and 52.9%, respectively). LPV/RTV, combined with arbidol, have shown antiviral effects in SARS-CoV-2 in other reports from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine [
