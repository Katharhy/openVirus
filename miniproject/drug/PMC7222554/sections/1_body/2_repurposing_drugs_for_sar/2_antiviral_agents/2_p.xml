<p>Clinical trials are also being conducted on the antiviral drug, remdesivir (RDV) (Phase III), after reports on its significant effect when given intravenously to some SARS-CoV-2 patients [
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. RDV is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent by acting as a nucleoside analog that was initially developed to treat Ebola. A molecular modeling study suggested that RDV could be a potential therapeutic agent as the active form (CHEMBL2016761) of RDV has shown perfect docking scores among other antiviral agents [
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. It also showed promising

 <italic>et al.</italic>, (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.77 μM; CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt;100 μM; SI &gt;129.87) [
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. A clinical case study for the first patient diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in USA has shown promising effectiveness of RDV [
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Infusion with RDV was administrated to patients on day 7 after developing worsening in clinical conditions (pneumonia). The patient showed improvement in clinical symptoms, oxygen saturation and CT imaging scans [
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Thus, RDV is currently one of the most promising antiviral agents for reversing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Currently, about seven clinical trials are registered for investigating RDV at Clinicaltrials.gov and being conducted in USA and China (NCT04292899, NCT04292730, NCT04252664, NCT04257656, NCT04280705, NCT04315948 and NCT04302766). The studies have differences in patients disease conditions (mild, moderate and severe), treatment durations (5, 9 and 10 days), as well as the control group (RDV is being compared with placebo, LPV/RTV or LPV/RTV plus IFN-ß-1a) [
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The safety profile for RDV is acceptable with GI symptoms and has the most common side effects, including nausea, vomiting and rectal bleeding. Some patients also experience elevations in liver enzymes [
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. A very recent case study was published showing the advantage of delayed administration of RDV to patients with severe SAR-COV-2-associated pneumonia. The patient received RDV on day 13 of symptoms and showed significant improvement in respiratory symptoms (extubation) after 6 h of RDV first dose [
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. An NIH-supported clinical trial is being conducted in the USA. RDV will be provided to patients as a loading dose of 200 mg on the first day of the study. Then, the drug will be given as 100 mg in the following days for 10 days. The patients' clinical outcomes from full recovery to death will be compared with the placebo group [
