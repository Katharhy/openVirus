<p>The dosing system and duration of treatment are still varied between different studies. For example, in ChiCTR2000029992, the dosing of CQ is 1.0 g x 2 days for the first dose, 0.5 g x 12 days from the third day, for HCQ is 0.2 g twice daily x 14 days. In ChiCTR2000029975, 150 mg CQ phosphate is dissolved in 5 ml of normal saline, twice daily, and inhaled by atomization for 1 week. The dosing in ChiCTR2000029899 and ChiCTR2000029898 is for HCQ: day 1: first dose: 6 tablets (0.1 g/table, second dose: six tablets (0.1g/tablet) after 6h; day 2–5: two tablets (0.1 g/tablet), twice daily and for CQ day1–3: 500 mg, twice daily. Day 4–5: 250 mg, twice daily. In ChiCTR2000029559, HCQ is given in two doses, and one group received 0.1 oral 2/day, the second group received 0.2 oral 2/day, while the third group is a placebo. In ChiCTR2000029542, CQ is given as 0.5 g every time, twice daily for a 10-day course. More clinical trials are needed to determine the effective dosing regimen as toxicities (cardiomyopathy and retinopathy) are still possible after prolonging and high doses of HCQ [

The application of CQ and HCQ for SARS-CoV-2 should also consider contraindications, including patient allergies, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, previous history of retinopathy, cardiomyopathy (QT prolongation) or end-stage kidney disease [
