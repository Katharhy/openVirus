The clinical outcomes include time to clinical recovery, all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, relapse after discharge, liver function tests, C-reactive protein (CRP), the incidence of adverse effects, days on mechanical ventilation, cost, among others. These trials are investigating CQ or HCQ alone or in combination with other therapies. Some of these trials published its outcomes, and some are still waiting for the results. Reports from over 100 patients in studies demonstrated that CQ showed excellent results compared with control. CQ treated patients showed lower viral load, better CT imaging, and shorter disease period [

The ongoing clinical studies, efficacy and safety of CQ or HCQ alone in treating SARS-CoV-2 are being investigated in ChiCTR2000030054 (a total 80 patients are enrolled), ChiCTR2000029992 (three groups: CQ, HCQ and control), ChiCTR2000029988 (severe patients/critical illness cases), ChiCTR2000029975 (CQ is given as aerosol inhalation), ChiCTR2000029935 (100 patients), ChiCTR2000029899 (HCQ vs CQ), ChiCTR2000029898 (HCQ vs CQ), ChiCTR2000029803 (HCQ as prophylactics to prevent SARS-CoV-2), ChiCTR2000029741 (CQ vs LPV/RTV), ChiCTR2000029559 (HCQ vs placebo) and ChiCTR2000029542 (CQ vs placebo) [
