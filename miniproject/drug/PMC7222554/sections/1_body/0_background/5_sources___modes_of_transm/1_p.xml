<p>As there were several new SARS-CoV-2 cases in association with the Huanan market in Wuhan [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], an animal host could be identified as a source of virus transmission. Since SARS-CoV-2 is identical to previous bat SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], bats are possibly the host for their progenitor. While RaTG13, sampled with 
 <italic>Rhinolophus affinis</italic> bat, is approximately 96% identical to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that it cannot effectively bind to human ACE2 [

 <italic>Manis javanica</italic>), can carry CoVs that is identical to SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Besides, while there is no animal CoV quite close to SARS-CoV-2, the range of the CoVs is greatly undersampled in bats and other animals. In the S1â€“S2 junction of the CoV mutations, insertions and removals of nucleiotides may occur []. This demonstrates that a normal evolutionary cycle will lead to a polybasic cleavage location. In order for the precursor virus to obtain the polybase site of cleavage and the spike protein mutations necessary for the human binding of ACE2, it will possibly need an animal host with a large population density (for natural selection to occur effectively) and an ACE2 gene close to that present in human [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The SARS-CoV-2 progenitor has probably jumped to humans, gaining the mentioned genomic features by evolving during unrecognized human-to-human transmission. Such adaptations allowed the pandemic of the disease once it has been acquired [
