<p>The University of Hong Kong used two monoplex assays that were reactive Sarbecovirus (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and SARS coronavirus like) with coronaviruses [

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The N-gene is recommended to be used as the screening tool in RT-PCR analysis, whereas the Orf1b tool serves as the confirmative measure. The protocol has only been evaluated for the SARS-CoV RNA control samples. The synthetic oligonucleotide was used as a positive control. whereas, SARS-CoV-2 endogenous sequence is yet to be evaluated [
