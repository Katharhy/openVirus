<p>Just as the SARS-CoV-2 appeared, real-time polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) remained the primary diagnostic tool for the latest viral strain among the different diagnostic platforms. One research addressed the usage of RT-PCR in diagnosing patients with SARS-CoV-2 from 16 experimental trials [

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The respiratory tests were shown to be positive for the virus, although the serum in the early days of infection was negative. This has indicated that patients had elevated virus rates amid minimal signs in the early days of illness [

Besides commonly used RT-PCR for the diagnosis of MERS-CoV, several diagnostic procedures have been reported in four clinical trials, such as RT-LAM (RT-LAM)P, RT-insulated isothermal PCR (RT-IiPCR) and rRT-PCR (RT-PCR) as one-step test focused on unique TaqMan kit. RT-LAMP is as responsive as RT-PCR, as summarized in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. It is also extremely sensitive and can be used for MERS-CoV strain identification. It is comparable to the standard diagnostic tests and is fast, easy and comfortable. RT-iiPCR and a one-step RRT-PCR study were equally responsive and demonstrated strong MER-CoV specificity. Finally, a review based on validating the six consumer RT-PCR kits was carried out [
