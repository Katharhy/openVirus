<p>The level of contamination, including measurement of asymptomatic incidence and the attack intensity, is easily calculated through serological measures including ELISA, IIFT, and neutralization studies. The serological experiments identify proteins and antigens in addition to the identification of the virus genome using biochemical approaches [

Furthermore, evidence indicates that low titers of antibodies may be correlated with high viral load in a second week or with delayed antibody development. Serological diagnosis is more likely to be employed if nucleic amplification tests (NAAT) are not given or available [
