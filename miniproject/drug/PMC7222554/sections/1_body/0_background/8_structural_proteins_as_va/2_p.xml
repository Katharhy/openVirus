<p>The glycoprotein of the outer membrane, renowned for its glycosylation, is identical to many other coronaviruses [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The primary host interacting protein is essential for cell adhesion (such as ACE2, CD26, Ezrin, cyclophilins and other cell adhesive factors). The specific host cell factors or proteins that make the current SARS-CoV-2 simpler are, therefore, still elusive [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Therefore the undertaken research at the present moment to investigate SARS-CoV-2 spike structures for glycoprotein and glycan shield patterns that have significant effects on viral camouflage and mode of cell entry, which could help the production of new infection screening, vaccinations and treatment. Another report of the COVID-19 and SARS-CoV clustal/w sequential coordination of glycoproteins reveals a 91% similarity in the S2 domain region (aa570–aa1278), but in three other regions (aaa677–690, wing) (aaa877–884 and aa930–943, stalk), there are no structural correlations. However, in the S1 domain, with a 51% difference in (aa01–aa550), known for its host–cell interaction involving cell adhesion and virulence [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The potential molecular associations between S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and human CD26 receptors are considered to investigate structural variations or similarities in the interaction between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S protein.
