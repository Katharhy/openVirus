<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the genus Coronavirus in 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family. CoVs are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses with a nucleocapsid (capsid with nucleic acid) reported size of 300–400 nm under the electron microscope [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. All CoVs are pleomorphic viruses that usually produce 80–160 nm and 27–32 kb positive polarity of crown-shaped peplomers [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. CoV recombinations are very large as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) jumps, and transcription errors are continually increasing, which might lead to genetic drifting within the same strain [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. With their rapid mutation rates, CoVs are zoonotic viruses found in humans as well as other animal species, with a broad array of clinical symptoms from asymptomatic to the hospitalization in an intensive-care facility [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. CoVs were not known to be highly pathogenic in humans until they were first detected in Guangdong in 2002 and 2003 with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. There were two more common types of CoVs, CoV-OC43, and CoV-229E, that trigger moderate infections in people with an adequate immune system, before these outbreaks. About 10 years ago, since SARS appeared, MERS-CoV in the Middle East countries, another extremely pathogenic CoV virus has evolved [

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (nCoV) was established in Wuhan, Huanan, province of Hubei, and has become a significant global priority because of the outbreak of pneumonia, where livestock was exchanged (traded) [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The novel new virus SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh known CoV to infect humans from this viral family. At first, on 12 December 2019, an unexplained case of pneumonia was identified in Wuhan. Laboratory tests eliminated suspected influenza and other CoVs. On 7 January 2020, the authorities in China declared the isolation of the new CoV type [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. On 12th January, 2019-nCoV was designated by WHO, and on 11 February 2020 was assigned COVID-19 name. A total of 2,355,853 recorded cases were registered, with 164,656 fatalities as of the 20 April 2020 [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. On 29 January 2020, Li 
 <italic>et al.</italic>‘s case study reported in the New Britain Journal of Medicine summarizes the 425 first documented cases in Wuhan [
