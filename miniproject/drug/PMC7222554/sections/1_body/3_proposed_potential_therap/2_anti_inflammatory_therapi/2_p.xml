<p>Baricitinib, a drug approved for RA, was identified by 
 <italic>in silico</italic> screening for anti-inflammatory drugs that could be potential therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. SAR-COV-2 enters lung cells by ACE2-mediated invasion. AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) is one of the regulators for this invasion. Few approved drugs with high affinity to inhibit AAK-1 enzymes such as fedratinib and sunitinib were 
 <italic>in silico</italic> screened with the only barcitinib showing an inhibitory effect on the enzyme janus kinase (JAK), another regulator for the invasion. StebbingÂ 
 <italic>et al.</italic> have suggested that baricitinib could be trialed for its anti-inflammatory and entry inhibition effects [
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. Moreover, the patent application reveals the preparation of baricitinib by Incyte Corporation pharmaceutical company [
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>].
