<p>Carboxamide derivatives have been shown to have an antiviral inhibitory effect targeting 3CLpro [
 <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>] and are undergoing studies in research and development [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], as reported by Liu 
 <italic>et al.</italic> From these carboxamide derivatives, ML188 analog has IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.5 μM, and ML300 analog has IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 6.2 μM. Benzenepropanamide derivatives have also shown a disruption effect for the function of proteases 3CLpro and Plpro in SARS-CoV infection [
 <xref rid="B141" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. These candidates are also undergoing studies in research and development, as reported by Liu 
 <italic>et al.</italic> Few peptidomimetic compounds and GC376, a previously known protease inhibitor, have been reported to inhibit protease 3Clpro [
 <xref rid="B141" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>,
 <xref rid="B142" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. α-ketoamide inhibitors were previously synthesized and tested against MERS-CoV infection by Liu research group. α-ketoamide derivatives have shown picomolar activity against protease 3CLpro of MERS-CoV. Hilgenfeld 
 <italic>et al.</italic> have recently reported the x-ray structures of SARS-CoV3 3Clpro and its complex with an α-ketoamide inhibitor and considered α-ketoamide inhibitors as promising agents for SARS-CoV-2 infection [
