<p>The review offers reported information on the global research and advancement of potential and current therapeutic agents and vaccines under development relevant for SARS-CoV-2 focused on the complete, up-to-date generic drug product selection. This describes morphology, physiology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and focuses primarily on antivirals, antimalarials and immunotherapeutics aimed at diverse molecular associations linked to infection and replication. This review focuses primarily on agents reported to be beneficial against certain RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, influenza, Ebola and counter inflammatory medications, as well as product reuse attempts. There is a broad range of products available in recombinant biotechnology to generate antibodies as well as in cytokines targeted at the production and transmission of virus genes and cellular receptors. A significant attempt will be made to produce successful drugs and vaccinations against current and possible future SARS-CoV-2 infections and other potentially pathogenic virus outbreaks to minimize the tremendous effect on human life. The epidemic of COVID-19 underlines further the importance of developing a relatively broad spectrum of antiviral drugs and the significance of implementing innovative strategies like artificial intelligence to expedite therapeutics development, considering the cost and effort involved in developing clinical drugs. As highlighted in this review, the abundance of publications and the fast publishing race associated with the virus SARS-CoV-2 outbreak suggests a concentrated initiative on the part of research organizations and the pharmaceutical industry both concerning molecular mechanisms and concerning therapeutic pathways used for current and potential coronavirus outbreaks.</p>
