<p>Antipyretic/analgesics should be prescribed as needed for pain and fever and should not be administrated on routine bases. These agents might mask fever and delay diagnosis and treatment [

 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. These reports suggest that NSAIDs may upregulate ACE receptors, which could worsen the disease progression [
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Examples of supportive management are described briefly in several studies. For example, 199 patients in a clinical study conducted in Jin Yin-Tan Hospital, received a supportive therapy of supplemental oxygen, noninvasive and invasive ventilation, antibiotics, vasopressor support, renal-replacement therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Another clinical study at the national clinical research center for infectious diseases (the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen), Shenzhen, China, has reported the use of oxygen inhalation, oral or intravenous rehydration therapy, electrolyte correction, antipyretics, analgesics and antiemetic drugs as supportive therapy for the patient [
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Another example of supportive care is what is given to the first diagnosed case of SARS-CoV-2 in Washington, USA. The dosage of 650 mg acetaminophen every 4 h and 600 mg ibuprofen every 6 h was administered as prescribed to the patient. In the first 6 days of hospitalization, he was also given 600 mg guaifenesin for persistent coughing and around 6 L of regular saline [

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For example, a retrospective study from Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China showed that antibiotics were given to 70 patients (71%). About 25 patients received a single antibiotic, while 45 patients received a combination of antibiotics. Used antibiotics included cephalosporins, quinolones, carbapenems, tigecycline and/or linezolid [
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Another study on 139 patients has shown that antibacterial therapy is given as moxifloxacin, 64.4%; ceftriaxone, 24.6%; and azithromycin, 18.1% [
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. There are still no detailed guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 patients with comorbidities, including cardiovascular diseases, asthma, and cancer. However, current recommendations are still according to the conventional guidelines for each comorbidity [
