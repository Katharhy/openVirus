<p>Until the time of this review, there are no specific therapeutic regimens approved for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. The development of novel compounds or vaccines that work correctly against SARS-CoV-2 is a time-consuming process. Thus, efforts are focusing on repurposing the use of drugs available on the market to act against SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65–67</xref>]. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine stand as excellent examples and are being adopted at the moment in the standard clinical practices of China for SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, the validity of using these compounds should be further confirmed. Accordingly, agents with confirmed curing potentials are still lacking. All the therapeutic agents are still under evaluation, and the outcomes derived from clinical trials will determine future winners of the race. Currently, patients are still managed adjunctively. Standard care is composed of isolation and prevention measurements, supportive care for symptoms and complications as well as advanced organs supports in patients with severe illness status [
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The patients with mild illness and no risk factors can be managed in outpatient settings. However, due to risks of deterioration in health, sudden respiratory failure and isolation failure, inpatients setting are preferred when possible. Outpatients settings include sporadic cases or small clusters, or in repurposed, nontraditional settings; or at home [
