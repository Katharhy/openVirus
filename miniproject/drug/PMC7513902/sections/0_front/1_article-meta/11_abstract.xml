  <italic>Background</italic> The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new, highly infective virus. In the absence of specific vaccines and antiviral drugs, the China National Health Commission has released a series of COVID-19 treatment guidelines, which include symptomatic treatment, antiviral treatment, and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM). 
  <italic>Aim of the review</italic> To analyze and summarize the role of TCMs in the treatment of COVID-19. 
  <italic>Methods</italic> Relevant studies on TCMs related to the study aim were undertaken through a literature search to synthesize the extracted data. 
  <italic>Results</italic> The China National Health Commission guidelines recommend 15 oral and injectable TCMs for COVID-19. Studies on TCMs have demonstrated that these compounds possess broad-spectrum antiviral and antibacterial properties, and they have certain advantages in the treatment of viral pneumonia and other emergent infectious diseases. Many TCMs also have potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Treatment based on syndrome differentiation is one of the significant features in TCM. TCM compounds contain a variety of active ingredients that have proven multi-target effects, making it difficult for viruses to develop drug resistance. A variety of clinical pathways are involved in the actions of these TCMs. These properties allow TCMs to be used in the treatment of COVID-19. 
  <italic>Conclusion</italic> TCMs have been widely used in the treatment of COVID-19 in China. The unique properties of TCM compounds allow TCMs to have a role in the management of COVID-19.
