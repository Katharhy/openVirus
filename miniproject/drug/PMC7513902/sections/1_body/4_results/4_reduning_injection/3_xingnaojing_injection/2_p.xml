Xingnaojing combined with azithromycin can reduce the levels of serum inflammation indexes of TNF-α and CRP, increase the content of CD3 + and CD4 + , and reduce the level of CD8 + when treating mycoplasmal pneumonia in the elderly. Also, they can improve the body's immune function and improve treatment effect by reducing the inflammation level [
