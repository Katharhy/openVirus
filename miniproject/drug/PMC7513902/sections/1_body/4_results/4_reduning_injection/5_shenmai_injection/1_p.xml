<p id="Par29">Shenmai is composed of red ginseng and ophiopogon japonicus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. It is used to treat coronary heart disease, viral myocarditis, chronic pulmonary heart disease, and neutropenia. It can improve the immune function of tumor patients. When used in combination with chemotherapy drugs, it has a synergistic effect and can reduce the side effects of chemotherapy drugs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The main components of Shenmai injection are saponins, sugars, amino acids, flavonoids, lignans, organic acids, and other substances [

Shenmai can reduce the level of inflammatory factors, increase anti-inflammatory factors, and reduce the content of white blood cells, c-reactive protein, and procalcitonin when used for the adjuvant treatment of severe pneumonia. Shenmai improves the cure rate in severe pneumonia through its anti-inflammatory effects [

The three groups were given conventional treatment with high-dose and low-dose Shenmai, respectively. The results showed that the patients who received high-dose Shenmai had significantly reduced white blood cells, CRP and procalcitonin, and increased peripheral blood CD4 + /CD8 + ratio [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. In the treatment of sepsis, Shenmai significantly increased CD3 + , CD4 + , NK, IgM, and complement C3, and increased the value of CD4 + /CD8 + , indicating that Shenmai can improve the immune function of patients [

These clinical functions of Shenmai might improve symptoms of critical patients with COVID-19 in terms of lung inflammation, virus infection, and drug-induced disease lung injury. However, there are no clinical studies in COVID-19. Currently, Shenmai is recommended for treating patients in the progressive stage of COVID-19 (critical case) in the NHC guidelines [
