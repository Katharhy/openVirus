<p id="Par18">Shufeng JieduÂ capsules (granules) are mainly used for acute upper respiratory tract infections. The granules consist of polygonum cuspidatum, forsythia, radix isatidis, bupleurum, radix, verbena, reed root, and licorice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It has been found that Shufeng Jiedu has a broad-spectrum antiviral effect. It has an inhibitory effect on influenza-A virus H1N1 type, herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, Coxsackievirus B4, Coxsackievirus B5, and adenovirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory effects of Shufeng Jiedu are related to the inhibition of the MAPK/NF-kB signaling pathway and the down-regulation of NF-kB mRNA expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Compounds such as iridoid glycosides and phenylethyl alcohol glycosides are the basis for inhibiting the expression of inflammatory factors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This inhibitory effect is seen primarily through reducing the level of lactic acid, increasing the oxygen partial pressure in the lung tissue, promoting the absorption of lung inflammation, and relieving local symptoms. It plays an active role in the treatment of viral pneumonia. The biological approach of Shufeng Jiedu in the treatment of COVID-19 may be similar to the above-discussed properties. There are no reported clinical studies in the COVID-19 treatment. It is recommended for treating patients during the clinical observation and early stages of the disease (mild case) in the NHC guidelines [
