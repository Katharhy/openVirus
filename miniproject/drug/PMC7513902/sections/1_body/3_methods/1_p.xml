<p id="Par10">Studies were identified through searching in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and the China Wanfang database. Both CNKI and China Wanfang are the two most authoritative, comprehensive, and the most abundant sources in China. Studies and reviews were limited to those in English or Chinese concerning the use of TCMs in COVID-19. Additional articles were identified through cross-referencing articles published in either English or Chinese. We also searched websites of the China NHC, and the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) to identify relevant information. The following grouped keywords were used as search strategy and modified according to different databases: (“coronavirus disease 2019” OR “COVID-19” OR “SARS-CoV-2” OR “novel coronavirus pneumonia” OR “novel coronavirus”) AND (“Chinese herbal medicine” OR “traditional Chinese medicine” OR “classical Chinese herbal formulas” OR “Chinese herb” OR “Chinese herb therapy” OR “herbal medicine” OR “herb therapy” OR “herbal remedy”) AND (“clinical trial” OR “clinical study” OR “randomized controlled trial”).</p>
