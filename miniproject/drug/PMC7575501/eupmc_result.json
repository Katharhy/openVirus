    "Graphical abstract  Structures of protein-drug-complexes provide an atomic level profile of drug-target interactions. In this work, the three-dimensional arrangements of amino acid side chains in known drug binding sites (substructures) were used to search for similarly arranged sites in SARS-CoV-2 protein structures in the Protein Data Bank for the potential repositioning of approved compounds. We were able to identify 22 target sites for the repositioning of 16 approved drug compounds as potential therapeutics for COVID-19. Using the same approach, we were also able to investigate the potentially promiscuous binding of the 16 compounds to off-target sites that could be implicated in toxicity and side effects that had not been provided by any previous studies. The investigations of binding properties in disease-related proteins derived from the comparison of amino acid substructure arrangements allows for effective mechanism driven decision making to rank and select only the compounds with the highest potential for success and safety to be prioritized for clinical trials or treatments. The intention of this work is not to explicitly identify candidate compounds but to present how an integrated drug repositioning and potential toxicity pipeline using side chain similarity searching algorithms are of great utility in epidemic scenarios involving novel pathogens. In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we demonstrate that the pipeline can identify candidate compounds quickly and sustainably in combination with associated risk factors derived from the analysis of potential off-target site binding by the compounds to be repurposed."
