<p id="Par20">We calculated five-year aggregated new HIV diagnoses for each ABS. Multiple-year counts provide more stable estimates of HIV diagnoses, particularly in ABSs with small populations. New diagnosis rates per 100,000 persons were calculated by dividing the incident case count by the five-year sum of the population assigned yearly to each ABS.</p>
