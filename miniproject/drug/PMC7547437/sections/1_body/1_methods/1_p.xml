<p id="Par18">We performed a cross-sectional ecological study using the “basic health area” (ABS [acronym in Catalan]) as the geographical study unit. The ABS is the regional demarcation used by the Catalan Health Service to organize primary healthcare services. An ABS includes a reference territory of a primary health care team and its population, which comprises 5000–25,000 people. Those ABSs with fewer than 5000 people were merged with bordering ABSs in order to protect the patient anonymity. During the study period, the limits of the ABSs were sometimes modified (basically ABS splits); this problem was solved by maintaining the original division and aggregating the data. Thus, we obtained a fixed number of 355 ABSs.</p>
