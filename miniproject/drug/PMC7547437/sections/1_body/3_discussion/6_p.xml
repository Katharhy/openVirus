<p id="Par40">Our study has several limitations. Given that we report the results of an ecological study at the ABS level, the inferences drawn are only valid at this level and do not demonstrate any causal relationship. Furthermore, our results are based on the place of residence of newly diagnosed persons. However, place of residence and place of exposure may not necessarily be the same. Data on the rate of new diagnoses were obtained from the Catalan HIV Surveillance Registry, where 10â€“20% of cases are thought to be undiagnosed, as reported in similar registries [
