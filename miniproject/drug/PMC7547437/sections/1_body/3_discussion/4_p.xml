<p id="Par38">The rate of new diagnoses of HIV infection is higher in ABS with a higher proportion of migrants from Western Europe and Latin America. Transmission of HIV has been severely affected by mobility. Migrants are considered a key group at risk for HIV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Commission consider them a priority group in HIV prevention and care [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In Catalonia, sex between men is the most frequent route of transmission among migrants from Western Europe (65%) and from Latin America (60.4%), who account for 19.8 and 70.5%, respectively, of all cases of HIV infection reported among migrant GBMSM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] in Catalonia. The mode of transmission of HIV infection among migrants in Western Europe mimics epidemics in their countries of origin, that is, mainly through GBMSM. Conversely, transmission of HIV infection between men is less common in Latin America, and the high rates of HIV infection among GBMSM from Latin America may reflect selective migration of GBMSM from this region to Europe owing to the more permissive attitudes toward same sex relationships [
