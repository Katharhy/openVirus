 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> show the rates of new HIV diagnoses. New HIV diagnoses are far from being homogenously distributed across Catalonia, with a gradient ranging from rural low-incidence areas to urban high-incidence areas and the highest rates in the ABSs of Barcelona city and its metropolitan area. A total of 22 ABSs out of 355 had no HIV diagnoses during the study period, while 31 had only one case.
