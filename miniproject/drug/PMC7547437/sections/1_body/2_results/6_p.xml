<p id="Par34">The statistical modeling of new HIV diagnoses in Model (1) showed significant spatial autocorrelation (Moran I, 0.163, p &lt; 0.001, see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), suggesting the need for correction; therefore, only Model (2) results (including the autocovariate) are commented on. The McFadden R
 <sup>2</sup> value was 0.236, indicating adequate goodness of fit of the model. The ABSs that proved to be significantly associated with a higher rate of new HIV diagnoses were those located in the city of Barcelona (IRR, 2.520; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), those with a higher proportion of men aged 15–44 years (IRR, 1.193; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.003), those with higher proportion of MSM as the transmission mode (IRR, 1.230; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.030), those with a higher proportion of men from Western Europe (IRR, 1.281; P = 0.003) and men from Latin America (IRR: 1.260 P = 0.003), and those with a higher number of gay locations (IRR, 2.665; P &lt; 0.001). On the contrary, no association was observed between HIV diagnosis rate and economic deprivation (Table
