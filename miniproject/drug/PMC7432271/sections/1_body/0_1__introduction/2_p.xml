<p>This rapid spread of COVID-19 has generated intense research interest to find a cure or a vaccine. However, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, although remdesivir, an investigational antiviral drug, is available through an FDA emergency use authorization [
