 <xref rid="B40-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], NOD-like receptor (NLR) especially NLRP3 inflammasome [
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and free molecule receptors such as STING, cGAS, IFI16 and DAI can be involved in the recognition of viruses and in mediating immune response-related signaling pathways [
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. RLRs are comprised of the H family members RIG-I (DDX58), MDA5 (IFIH), and LGP2 which recognize the genomic structure of RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B27-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. NLRs are a subclass of PRRs which are comprised of a conserved NOD structure and classified into three main categories according to their functions: inflammasome (NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRP6, NLRC4, NLRC5W, and AY2); embryo regenerative and regulatory NLRs [

 <xref rid="B41-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. CLRs are soluble PRRs mostly expressed in myeloid cells responsible for phagocytosis, maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and chemotaxis and have been proposed to be associated in SARS-CoV-2 immunopathogenesis [
