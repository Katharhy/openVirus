<p>Like other viral infections, the SARS-CoV-2 antigens are processed by specific antigen presenting cells (APCs) including macrophages and dendritic cells [
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The antigens are then presented by major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) or human leukocyte antigens (HLA) to specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) [
 <xref rid="B45-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. It is thought that SARS-CoV-2 relies on MHC I, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with minimal contribution by MHC II [

 <xref rid="B47-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], so it is predicted that polymorphisms in HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-DR B1, HLA-Cw and HLA-DQB1 could also exert an effect on the immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 [
