<p>All coronaviruses have specific genes downstream of the open reading frame 1 (ORF1) that encode for proteins necessary for viral replication and generation of the nucleocapsid and spike proteins [
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 has 14 ORFs encoding for 27 proteins. ORF1a/b and ORF1a are located at the 5′ end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and code for the pp1ab and pp1a polyproteins, respectively. These polyproteins contain 15 non-structural proteins (NSP) including NSP1 to NSP10 and NSP 12 to NSP 16. The 3′ end of the genome encodes four structural proteins including spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E), matrix protein (M), nucleocapsid protein (N) and eight accessory proteins (3a, 3b, p6, 7a, 7b, 8b, 9b, and ORF14). Despite similarity in the overall amino acid composition of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, remarkable amino acid differences have been identified [
