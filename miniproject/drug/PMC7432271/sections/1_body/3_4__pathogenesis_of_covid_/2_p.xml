<p>As discussed, SARS-CoV-2 employs ACE2 as the host cell receptor. ACE2 is highly expressed on many different cell types in a variety of human organs, including lung alveolar epithelial cells and small intestinal epithelial cells, both of which are considered potential SARS-CoV-2 routes of transmission. Overall, ACE2 is expressed widely in the main target organs of SARS-CoV-2, as well as organs that play less important or even unknown roles in COVID-19 pathophysiology [
