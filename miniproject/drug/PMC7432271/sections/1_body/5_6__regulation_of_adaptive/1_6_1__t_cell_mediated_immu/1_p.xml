<p>T lymphocytes play a crucial role in the anti-viral immune response to coronaviruses [
 <xref rid="B32-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Cluster of differentiation CD4+ and CD8+ T cells maintain the balance between the immune response against these pathogens and immune tolerance [

 <xref rid="B52-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Antibody-producing B cells are activated by CD4+ T cells, while CD8+ T cells are cytotoxic to virus-infected cells [
 <xref rid="B53-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. During SARS-CoV infection, the majority (approximately 80%) of inflammatory cells infiltrating the lungs of affected individuals are CD8+ T cells [
 <xref rid="B54-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and T cells can survive in infected tissues [
 <xref rid="B55-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In contrast, CD4+ T cells are more susceptible than CD8+ cells to infection by MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B56-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. During SARS-CoV-2 infection, a reduction in the number and quality of CD4+ T cells could be associated with decreased activation of B lymphocytes, with reduced levels of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies and pro-inflammatory cytokines (including IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α), leading to defective clearance of virus from infected organs [
 <xref rid="B56-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Cooperating with innate immune cells, helper T cells are involved in producing major pro-inflammatory cytokines via NF-kB activation, which is responsible for initiating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the cytokine storm [
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. IL-17 produced by Th17 cells mediates the activation of monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) and neutrophils and enhances the production of cytokines (IL-1, LL-6, IL-8, IL-21, TNF-α, and Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)) from these cells [
 <xref rid="B30-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The possible role of IL-17 and related altered cytokines are highlighted in SARS-CoV-2 infection [
