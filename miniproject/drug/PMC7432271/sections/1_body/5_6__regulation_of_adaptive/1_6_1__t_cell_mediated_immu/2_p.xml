<p>One of the important methods that SARS-CoV-2 may use to evade T cell-mediated immune responses is the induction of apoptosis, similar to previous reports in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, by enhancing the binding of T-cells to B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xL) molecules [

Although this might result in T-cell depletion, recent findings suggest that the T cell response to structural proteins of coronaviruses (including the S, M and N proteins) persists, providing effective and long-term T-cell responses against COVID-19, which conveys promise for developing vaccines [
