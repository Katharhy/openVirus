<p>Nafamostat mesylate (6-amidino-2-naphthyl p guanidinobenzoate dimethanesulfonate) is a synthetic serine protease inhibitor available in Japan since 1986 that has been approved for the treatment of inflammatory-related diseases such as pancreatitis [

 <xref rid="B22-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The anti MERS-CoV activity of nafamostat is through inhibition of the host protease TMPRSS2, which is responsible for the proteolysis of the S protein after the receptor-binding stage [

Recently a study in lung cell culture tested the inhibitory effect of gabexate mesylate, nafamostat mesylate and camostat mesylate on SARS-CoV-2 infection and demonstrated that nafamostat mesylate inhibited S-mediated entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells 15 times more effectively that camostat mesylate, with an EC50 in the low nanomolar range [

An advantage of targeting host proteases instead of viral protein inhibitors is that it avoids treatment failure due to mutations of the target. Despite these promising in vitro data, the efficacy of nafamostat as a COVID-19 treatment needs to be tested in clinical trials.
