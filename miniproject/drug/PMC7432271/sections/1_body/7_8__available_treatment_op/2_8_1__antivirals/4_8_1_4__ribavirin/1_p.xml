<p>Ribavirin (1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide) is a synthetic guanosine analogue with broad-spectrum activity against several RNA and DNA viruses [
 <xref rid="B125-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. It was first approved in 1972 and has been used as a therapeutic agent against respiratory syncytial virus, Lassa fever virus, influenza A and B and in combination with interferon-α for hepatitis C [
 <xref rid="B126-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. Ribavirin has multiple mechanisms of action-including interference with RNA capping, inhibition of polymerases, introducing random mutations, suppression of natural guanosine generation by inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and immunomodulatory effects by enhancing the T cell response [

It is possible that ribavirin may be more effective when co-administrated with IFN as this combination inhibited replication of SARS-CoV in five different cell types of animal or human origin, at considerably lower concentrations than with either single treatment alone [

 <xref rid="B129-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. In terms of SARS-CoV-2, in vitro studies revealed that high concentrations of ribavirin (EC50 of 109.5 µM) are required to reduce the viral infection and ribavirin is 100 times less potent than remdesivir [
 <xref rid="B101-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Administration of high doses of ribavirin in SARS trials was associated with serious adverse reactions including haemolytic anaemia, electrolyte disturbances and significant teratogenicity. [

 <xref rid="B131-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. Given its considerable adverse effect profile, toxicity and the lack of in vitro data evaluating the efficacy of this compound, the administration of ribavirin for the treatment of COVID-19 is not recommended. An ongoing trial in China (ChiCTR2000029387) is evaluating the efficacy and safety of ribavirin and LPV/r in combination with interferon alpha-1b for SARS-CoV-2 infection [
