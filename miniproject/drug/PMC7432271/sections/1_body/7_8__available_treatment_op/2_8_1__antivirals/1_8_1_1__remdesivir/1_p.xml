<p>Remdesivir (RDV) was originally developed as a treatment for Ebola and Marburg virus infection and is a promising candidate for treatment of COVID19. RDV is an adenosine nucleotide analogue with broad-spectrum antiviral activity against RNA viruses including 
 <italic>Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae,</italic> and 
 <italic>Coronaviridae.</italic> It acts as an inhibitor of RdRps and inhibits virus replication through premature termination of RNA transcription as it incorporates into nascent viral RNA chains [

Recently, an in vitro study on Vero E6 cells has shown that remdesivir at low-micromolar concentrations blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection with high selectivity (half-maximal effective concentration (EC50), 0.77 μM; half-cytotoxic concentration (CC50) &gt; 100 μM; SI &gt; 129.87) [

 <xref rid="B103-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. The first randomized controlled clinical trial of remdesivir in the United States, known as the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial, enrolled 1063 patients and showed that patients who received remdesivir recovered faster, with a median time of 11 rather than 15 days (

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.059) [

Another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial of remdesivir in 237 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, from ten hospitals in China (NCT04257656), revealed that time to clinical improvement was not associated with the use of remdesivir; adverse events were reported in 66% of patients [
