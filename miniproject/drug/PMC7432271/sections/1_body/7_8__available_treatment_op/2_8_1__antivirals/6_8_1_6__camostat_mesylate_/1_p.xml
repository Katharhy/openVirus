<p>Camostat mesylate (

 <italic>N</italic>-dimethylcarbamoylmethyl 4-(4-guanidinobenzoyloxy)-phenylacetate) is a synthetic serine protease inhibitor used for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis, dystrophic epidermolysis, oral squamous cell carcinoma and exocrine pancreatic enzyme inhibition [

Some coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV) and influenza virus activate their envelope glycoproteins by employing host cell proteases [

 <xref rid="B140-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Zhou et al. demonstrated that serine proteases cause the spread of SARS-CoV and camostat effectively prevents this step, suggesting it may be an option for treating SARS and potentially MERS [
 <xref rid="B141-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Another study demonstrated that camostat partially blocked SARS-CoV and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) infection in HeLa cells expressing the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 [
 <xref rid="B142-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. Additionally, the effect of camostat mesylate in blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection of human lung Calu-3 cells has been demonstrated [
 <xref rid="B143-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. A double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial is evaluating the efficacy of camostat mesylate for treatment of COVID-19 (NCT04353284), but more studies are needed to clarify whether adequate concentrations for suppressing the virus can be attained in a patientâ€™s lung.
