<p>There is limited published evidence supporting the activity of hydroxychloroquine against coronaviruses. An in vitro study in Vero cells showed that the chloroquine was approximately 5-fold more potent (EC50 of 6.5 ± 3.2 μM) than that of hydroxychloroquine (EC50 of 34 ± 5 μM) against SARS-CoV [

However, there are some limitations to the study including small sample size, unclear criteria for enrollment of cases and controls, lack of clinical outcomes as well as enrolment of asymptomatic individuals. Widespread administration of hydroxychloroquine is likely to cause rare adverse effects in patients, including fulminant hepatic failure, serious cutaneous adverse reactions and ventricular arrhythmias (especially when administrated with azithromycin) [

Moreover, the FDA announced the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients can cause serious heart rhythm problems and other safety issues, including blood and lymph system disorders, kidney injuries, liver problems and even liver failure [
 <xref rid="B163-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. Owing to the potential side effects—namely heart problems—on June 15th the FDA withdrew the emergency use authorization it issued in March for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as COVID-19 treatments. The FDA made this determination based the results from the RECOVERY trial in 1542 hospitalized COVID-19 patients administrated hydroxychloroquine, which found no significant difference in the primary endpoint of 28-day mortality or hospital stay duration [
