<p>Nitric Oxide (NO) is a free radical with vasodilator properties. In vascular smooth muscle cells, NO activates soluble guanylate cyclase resulting in production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). The latter, acting as a second messenger, activates cGMP-dependent kinase, leading to reduced cellular calcium level and vasodilation [

 <xref rid="B232-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">232</xref>]. Moreover, nitric oxide or its derivatives can inhibit palmitoylation of the viral spike protein, affecting virus binding to its receptor ACE2 and inhibiting SARS-Co-V replication [
 <xref rid="B235-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">235</xref>]. Nitric oxide inhalation has been successfully used to treat SARS patients, resulting in elevated oxygen saturation, and reduced or discontinued ventilation support [
 <xref rid="B236-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">236</xref>]. There are several clinical trials currently investigating the therapeutic potential of nitric oxide therapy in patients with COVID-19 (NCT04358588, NCT04305457), as more data are required to confirm its effectiveness.
