<p>Azithromycin (9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homoerythromycin) is a widely used macrolide antibiotic which can inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria by targeting 23S ribosomal RNA. Beside its antibacterial activity, azithromycin has immunomodulatory and anti-viral effects. Previous studies have suggested an antiviral function for azithromycin in Ebola virus infection, both in vitro and in mice [

Azithromycin (but not other macrolides like erythromycin or telithromycin) can inhibit rhinovirus replication and release in human bronchial epithelial cells, by inducing expression of interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) [

Interestingly, Tran et al. reported antiviral activity of azithromycin against Influenza (H1N1) virus; treatment prior to infection inhibited virus replication by blocking internalization into host cells, without changing viral attachment [
