<p>Early clinical experience suggested that the elderly and people of any age with serious underlying medical conditions are at a greater risk of severe illness from COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B87-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Consistent with this, previous studies showed the presence of comorbidities conferred a 3–4 fold increased risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with SARS-CoV [

 <xref rid="B89-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. For COVID-19, medical conditions that put people at increased risk of severe disease include: uncontrolled diabetes; hypertension; lung, liver, and kidney disease; cancer; smoking; solid organ transplant; pregnancy; thalassemia; asthma; neurologic conditions, such as dementia; pulmonary fibrosis (having damaged or scarred lung tissues); obesity and long term steroid therapy [

 <xref rid="B91-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 1576 patients with COVID-19 showed that hypertension (21.1%) and diabetes (9.7%) were the most prevalent comorbidities, followed by cardiovascular disease (8.4%) and respiratory disease (1.5%) [

This reflects international studies, which show that comorbidities associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 include hypertension (20–30%), diabetes (10–20%), cardiovascular disease (8–12%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (1.5–7.5%), chronic kidney diseases (1–3%), cerebrovascular disease (1.5–3%), co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B virus (1–2%), malignancy (1–3.5%), respiratory illnesses (1.4%), renal disorders (0.5–1.5%) and immunodeficiencies (0.01%) [

 <xref rid="B98-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The most common comorbidity varied among the seven countries reviewed, as follows: China (hypertension 39.5%), South Korea (cardiovascular disease 25.6%), Italy (hypertension 35.9%), USA (hypertension 38.9%), Mexico, (other 42.3%), UK (hypertension 27.8%), Iran (diabetes 35.0%); diabetes was the second most common comorbidity in five of them [

Evaluating the mechanisms underlying the associations of severe COVID-19 disease with hypertension, diabetes and respiratory diseases is crucial for the management of high-risk patients and for developing policies and guidelines to reduce future risk of severe COVID-19 disease. Finally, strong precaution should be considered when managing and treating COVID-19 patients with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors, especially high blood pressure and diabetes, while patients with uncontrolled hypertension should be informed about their increased risk and advised to take appropriate preventative measures.
