<p>Early data on administration of hydroxychloroquine often in combination with azithromycin were promising, however studies were very low quality, with methodological concerns raised including small subject numbers, poor study design, the absence of appropriate controls and end points of unclear utility. Therefore, on 4 July 2020 the WHO accepted the recommendation from the Solidarity Trialâ€™s International Steering Committee to discontinue the hydroxychloroquine arm in the trial. The fusion inhibitor umifenovir and protease inhibitor lopinavir /ritonavir were also regarded initially as likely effective candidates to treat COVID-19. However, the NIH panel now recommends against the use of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/ritonavir or non-SARS-CoV-2-specific intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) for the treatment of COVID-19, except in a clinical trial. Furthermore, NIH does not recommend either for or against the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma, SARS-CoV-2 immune globulin or Interleukin-6 inhibitors (e.g., sarilumab, siltuximab, tocilizumab) for the treatment of COVID-19, due to insufficient data.</p>
