<p>By screening hybridomas from immunized mice using pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus, a chimeric mAb called 47D11 was identified which has cross-neutralizing activity against the S protein from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. This antibody was subsequently cloned to produce a fully humanized mAb, which in cell culture was able to block SARS-CoV-2 infection [

In another study, four mAbs were isolated from individuals who recovered from COVID-19 (B5, B38, H2, and H4), which were able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 effectively. In particular, B38 and H4 were able to bind RBD of the viral S protein, inhibiting its attachment to ACE2 and reducing the virus titer in animal models [
