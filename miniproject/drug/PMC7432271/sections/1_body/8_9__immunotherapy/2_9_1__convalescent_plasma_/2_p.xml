<p>Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection develop a serum antibody response (IgG) to different epitopes of the virus and some of these antibodies have the potential to neutralize the virus. To prepare convalescent plasma, plasma rich in IgG antibody is collected at least two weeks after the recovery date [

 <xref rid="B3-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] of 10 adult patients with severe COVID-19 demonstrated that a single dose (200 mL) of convalescent plasma was not only well tolerated but was able to increase and maintain neutralizing antibodies at a high level. Moreover, clinical and paraclinical symptoms improved within three days and viral RNA was undetectable in blood seven days after the transfusion [
