 <italic>Restriction of exposure to virus</italic>. First are measures to restrict exposure to the virus. This includes social distancing, quarantine, frequent hand-washing, wearing facemasks, restricting large gatherings, etc. These measures will reduce the viral load people will experience, and therefore reduce the levels of viruses to be neutralized by the immune system. However, relative to 'clean rooms' for i) planetary NASA mission preparation or ii) allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation patient recuperation, these measures will still allow viral transmission and infection to occur.
