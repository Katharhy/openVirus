<p>Numerous mid- and longer-term potential adverse effects from vaccines have been identified. These include: i) Antibody-dependent enhancement (where enhanced virus entry and replication in a number of cell types is enabled by antibodies) (

 <xref rid="b19-ijmm-46-02-0463" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>); ii) vaccine-associated virus interference (where vaccinated individuals may be at increased risk for other respiratory viruses because they do not receive the non-specific immunity associated with natural infection) (

 <xref rid="b21-ijmm-46-02-0463" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>); iii) vaccine-associated imprinting reduction (where vaccinations could also reduce the benefits of 'imprinting', a protection conferred upon children who experienced infection at an early age) (

 <xref rid="b23-ijmm-46-02-0463" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>); iv) Non-specific vaccine effects on immune system (where previous infections can alter an individual's susceptibility to unrelated diseases) (

 <xref rid="b25-ijmm-46-02-0463" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>); v) impact of infection route on immune system (where immune protection can be influenced by the route of exposure/delivery) (

 <xref rid="b27-ijmm-46-02-0463" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>); and vi) impact of combinations of toxic stimuli (where people are exposed over their lifetime to myriad toxic stimuli that may impact the influence of any vaccine) (
 <xref rid="b28-ijmm-46-02-0463" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).
