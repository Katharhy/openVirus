<p>A recent study examined myriad COVID-19 vaccines under development (
 <xref rid="b17-ijmm-46-02-0463" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). As stated in this reference: 'Normally, the period of development of a vaccine is 12-15 years'. Against this backdrop, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are being targeted for accelerated development by an order of magnitude. Each of the accelerated steps listed in this reference (
 <xref rid="b17-ijmm-46-02-0463" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) has drastically reduced the time required. Strongly accelerated development and implementation (relative to standard vaccine development times) is the goal; bypassing some critical steps in the vaccine development process is troubling. While much of the vaccine development and testing effort focuses on efficacy, it is difficult to see how true long-term safety can be validated within these limited time scales.
