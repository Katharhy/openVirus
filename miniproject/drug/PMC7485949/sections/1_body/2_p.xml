<p>COVID‐19 is a historic pandemic that is testing populations, healthcare systems, and the biopharmaceutical industry in previously unimagined ways. We now are seeing new drug developers, including biopharmaceutical companies, government agencies, academicians, and private foundations, come together in full force to consider approaches to treat and prevent infection with SARS‐CoV‐2. Vaccines, which if effective will result in mass active immunity, are now in clinical trials. The most advanced vaccines (Moderna and Oxford/Astra Zeneca) could be available via emergency use authorization as early as Fall 2020. The first wave of therapies, such as remdesivir (Gilead), are completing clinical trials and the second wave, including repurposed existing drugs and new drug candidates, are now entering clinical trials. Until vaccines and new therapeutics are widely available, passive immunotherapies to manage COVID‐19 may prove to be effective agents in the fight against SARS‐CoV‐2 and COVID‐19.</p>
