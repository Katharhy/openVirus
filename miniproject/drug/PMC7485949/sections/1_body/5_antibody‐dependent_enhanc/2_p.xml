<p>ADE describes two basic phenomena mediated by virus‐specific antibodies: enhanced viral infection and enhanced immunologic response in the advanced disease, independent from viral load. There are no data to date to suggest that ADE occurs in COVID‐19, but research in this space is relatively immature. The strongest set of data on ADE in coronavirus infections come from SARS‐CoV. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> data suggest that although anti‐Spike protein serum inhibits viral entry into epithelial cells incubating in SARS‐CoV inoculated medium, there is enhanced uptake of virus in immune cells via FcgammaRII (not ACE2)

 </xref>: whether this uptake enhances immune pathology requires scientific evaluation. Additional 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> results from a macaque model showed that induction of anti‐SARS‐CoV Spike IgG resulted in enhanced‐acute lung injury, related to enhanced pro‐inflammatory morphological changes in alveolar macrophage.

 </xref> Additional preclinical animal studies are needed to understand whether H‐IGs at high neutralization titers will enhance antibody‐dependent immune pathology. Human data to correlate these findings do not exist, yet, it is important to note that in SARS ~ 80% of patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), coincidentally with IgG seroconversion. Preclinical and clinical correlation in COVID‐19 are needed.
