<p>Although the clinical dose will be defined in clinical trials, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralization titers of the finished product will inform dose selection. Based on assessments done in our own laboratories, the current estimate is that the dose will range from 0.1 to 0.5g/kg, given i.v. once (every 28Â days if used for prophylaxis). The experience to date with CP as therapy suggests that a lower dose may be effective: this will be tested in randomized clinical trials.
