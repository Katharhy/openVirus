<p>To date, no high‐quality clinical trial has demonstrated convincing efficacy and safety of H‐IG in coronavirus epidemics. Thus, randomized controlled trials are needed now to establish the benefit‐risk balance of this intervention for COVID‐19 and to guide future H‐IG use in new, emerging epidemics. Target indications for the COVID‐19 H‐IG include treatment and prevention. In coronavirus diseases, including COVID‐19, endogenous antibody production is nondetectable early in disease (&lt; 5–7 days). In COVID‐19, ~ 95% of patients convert within 14 days of symptom onset, and IgM and IgG seroconversion seems to occur simultaneously and plateaus after 6 days.

 </xref> Thus, patients who have rapidly progressing yet early disease may benefit from the antibody boost that would come from H‐IG. Randomized, placebo controlled clinical trials in treatment paradigms are anticipated to begin in Summer 2020.
