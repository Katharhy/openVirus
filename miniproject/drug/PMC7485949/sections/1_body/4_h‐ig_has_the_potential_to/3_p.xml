<p>To assess PDs, animal models may be a key mainstay in COVID‐19. Preclinical studies using human transgenic ACE2 mice and non‐human primates will provide prospective understandings of minimal protective titers that can substantiate human dosing, evaluate efficacy in a therapeutic setting, and address key safety risks (as discussed below). Ongoing preclinical experiments can substantiate the proposed clinical dose through pharmacometric modeling of the PK/PD relationship. However, due to the urgency of the pandemic and the speed of clinical development in this situation, these experiments will run concurrently with pivotal clinical trials. Thus, the early reads on PD may come from human therapy trials.</p>
