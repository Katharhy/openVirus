<p>Manufacturing clinical and commercial supply of H‐IG depends on plasma collection. In the United States, Europe, Japan, and China, there is established and highly regulated plasma collection infrastructure that is being mobilized now to collect plasma from the increasing number of convalescent patients in these regions. Once collected and pooled, plasma is manufactured into H‐IG through a series of steps that can take several months: fractionation, purification, incubation, release testing, finishing, and packaging. The process ensures product purity, pathogen safety, and adequate titers of neutralizing antibodies before release for clinical use. H‐IG may be stored up to 3 years depending on conditions. Further, H‐IGs may be manufactured at commercial scale, following the process outlined above, with manufacturing runs that can process up to 20,000 L of plasma.</p>
