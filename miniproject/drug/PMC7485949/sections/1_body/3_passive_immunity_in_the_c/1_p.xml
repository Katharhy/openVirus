<p>Passive immunity is conferred by the transfer of pathogen‐specific antibodies and, in the case of CP, innate humoral immune factors, to patients at‐risk of developing or actively suffering from infection. The pathogen‐specific antibodies include all immunoglobulin isotypes (IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE) and nonspecified humoral innate immunity factors in CP or high purity polyclonal IgG and its subclasses in H‐IG. In viral diseases, antibodies exert effect by viral neutralization (blocking viral cell entry and, therefore, replication), complement activation, opsonization, and antibody‐dependent cellular cytotoxicity mediation. Viral neutralization is antigen‐specific; other antiviral activities are antigen‐nonspecific and are effected in part via Fc:FcReceptor interactions. In SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, the principle target antigen associated with neutralization is the Spike protein, which is responsible for SARS‐CoV‐2 attachment to epithelial cells, including pneumocytes. The antibodies in COVID‐19 passive immunotherapies are polyclonal in nature, with multiple epitopes against SARS‐CoV‐2 paratopes, including the receptor‐binding domain in the Spike protein.</p>
