<p>Passive immunotherapy from convalescent plasma and H‐IG drugs may be effective in future epidemics caused by novel or known pathogens, to target pathogens against which no existing direct antiviral therapy exists. These approaches may be standardized and scaled, and we are actively learning how to initiate collections, supply, clinical trials, and distribution network in order to mobilize agilely for the next epidemic. As H‐IG therapies become available, rapid and cost‐effective distribution needs to be ensured to optimize the full potential of this therapy.</p>
