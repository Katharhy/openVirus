<p>Beyond the lack of access to care, patients with substance use disorder will face unique challenges in the coming months. Predictions of escalating deaths from COVID19 abound in every newspaper and medical journal and, in all likelihood, the mortality rate for patients with substance use disorder will be significantly higher than the general population. Furthermore, many patients do not have housing, so cannot isolate at all and will be cohorted with other COVID19 patients in shelters if they do become ill. Additionally, the stress and limitations of this new crisis exacerbates mental health conditions, which can act as a trigger for recurrence of use. Even the strategy of social distancing can prove dangerous to this population due to the increased risk of an isolated overdose without opportunity for rescue. Prevalence of take-home doses of methadone, while important to attenuate daily methadone clinic visits, may be diverted without knowledge of potency. The DEA has publicly anticipated a limited drug supply due to importation and transportation issues, which escalates street prices, which may prompt more people to seek treatment. This is a long awaited opportunity if we are ready to respond. Given the increased need, and without the safety net of emergency departments, it is critical that we design innovative methods to reach these at risk patients.</p>
