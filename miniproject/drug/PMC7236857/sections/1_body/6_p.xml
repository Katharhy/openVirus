 </sup> paths to treatment for new patients while keeping our existing patients engaged in care. Our peer recovery teams currently use texting and video conferencing platforms to do outreach. During this time of crisis, case management and social work services are wholly feasible by phone. Buprenorphine prescribers in any setting (and especially the ED and correctional facilities) should provide a longer duration of buprenorphine prescriptions to create flexibility in coordinating follow up care. Institutional or citywide appointment lines, especially those augmented by CRS support like the one we have developed at our institution, can centralize access and triage patients to existing virtual clinics.
