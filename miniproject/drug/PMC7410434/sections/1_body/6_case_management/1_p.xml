 </sup> Remdesivir, which has been shown to be effective in reducing the length of hospitalization for moderately severe cases, is not yet available in the DRC.

 </sup> Weak health systems in the DRC, with limited intensive care beds, oxygen supply, ventilators, and trained staff, remain a key challenge in the management of COVID-19, especially as case numbers rise. Several hospitals were identified as reference centers for the treatment of COVID-19 as part of the National Plan. Furthermore, building on an existing innovative tele-mentoring program developed to capacitate nurses and other frontline healthcare workers, a series of in-service COVID-19 training modules covering triage, infection prevention and control, testing, maintenance of essential services, and other topics was developed. At the start of the outbreak, only 60 ventilators were available country-wide and oxygen supplies were limited, and there was minimal technical capacity to provide intensive care. A clinical protocol was developed by the case management commission with support from technical partners. Bilateral and multilateral partnerships are scaling-up donations including medical and personal protective equipment to the reference hospitals, and training has been provided to clinical staff to ensure optimal care and prevention of infection of healthcare workers.
