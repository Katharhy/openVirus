<p>Globally, the current gold standard test for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is detection of viral RNA in a sample from the respiratory tract by RT-PCR.

 </sup> Laboratories with skilled staff and the RT-PCR equipment to perform these tests are scarce in the DRC (
 <xref rid="t2" ref-type="table">Table</xref> 2); all COVID-19 testing is performed at the National Institute of Biomedical Research in Kinshasa, a national referral laboratory. Because of sample transport from the provinces, turnaround times are lengthy for samples collected from provinces, causing delays in diagnoses. Of note, PoC or near-patient solutions would be preferable.

 </sup> The GeneXpert platform, already in place for TB testing across Africa, is an attractive option, but drawbacks include cost and limited supplies of SARS-CoV-2 cartridges. PoC viral antigen detection is not yet sufficiently sensitive.

 </sup> Serological testing for antiviral antibodies is unavailable in the DRC and is unsuitable for diagnosing active COVID-19 cases.
