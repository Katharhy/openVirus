 </sup> Various organizations involved in the COVID-19 fight across the country, supported by the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration, are implementing multidisciplinary teams of physicians, nurses, midwives, pharmacists, medical students, and CHCWs for COVID-19 sensitization, screening, and testing activities endorsed by the Ministry of Health, the community, and faith leaders. When a suspect case of COVID-19 is identified based on the presence of signs or symptoms, epidemiological links, or being a high-risk contact, CHCWs send a COVID-19 alert notification to the emergency operations center, and a surveillance team is deployed to investigate. When the suspected case meets the case definition for COVID-19, a respiratory sample is taken, and the person is quarantined at home or in a designated COVID-19 isolation unit while awaiting laboratory results. If the test result is positive, then the patient is referred to the case management team to initiate care.
