 <p>The use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been considered a therapeutic option by international guidelines and expert opinions during the first phase of COVID‐19 pandemics, 
  <sup>1‐10</sup> although scientific evidence remained too scarce to make a definitive recommendation 
  <sup>11</sup>. While HCQ use has now been questioned by recent data 
  <sup>7</sup>, some previous works draw attention to contrasting results on enhanced viral clearance after HCQ treatment 
  <sup>1‐6,10</sup>.
