  <title>Effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on endothelial cell function, systemic coagulation and thrombosis.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> | Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) directly infects endothelial cells owing to their high expression levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). After binding by SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 is internalized, and the lack of ACE2 on endothelial cells favours the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes triggered by local angiotensin II (Ang II) hyperactivity. Inhibition of ACE2 by binding of SARS-CoV-2 reduces the ACE2-mediated conversion of Ang II to Ang 1–7, the vasoactive ligand of the MAS receptor. The reduction of MAS receptor activation induces a pro-inflammatory phenotype through increased activation of type 1 angiotensin receptors (AT
   <sub>1</sub>R). Additionally, the reduction in levels of ACE2 limits the degradation of des-Arg
   <sup>9</sup> bradykinin (DABK) into inactive peptides, ultimately leading to increased pro-thrombotic signalling via the activation of bradykinin receptors (BKRs). 
   <bold>b</bold> | SARS-CoV-2 also activates the complement system — an integral component of the innate immune response. The complement cascade can be activated by three different pathways, the classical, the lectin and the alternative pathway, that resolve around the formation of the C3 convertases that cleave C3, generating the pro-inflammatory peptide C3a and large amount of C3b that opsonizes pathogens. C3b also forms the C5 convertase, which leads to release of the potent anaphylatoxin C5a, as well as the fragment C5b, responsible for the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) C5b–9 on target cells, which is considered to be the terminal event of complement activation. In addition, complexes of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and viral antigens might induce endothelial cell injury through activation of the C1 complex of the classical pathway and induction of antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADC). 
   <bold>c</bold> | Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines released by activated macrophages amplify the vicious cycle of vascular integrity disruption, vessel coagulation and thrombosis by degrading the endothelial glycocalyx, activating the coagulation system and dampening anticoagulant mechanisms. The adhesive phenotype of endothelial cells induced by inflammatory cytokines and chemokines promotes infiltration of neutrophils, which produce large amounts of histotoxic mediators, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), ultimately leading to injury of endothelial cells. 
   <bold>d</bold> | Activated endothelial cells initiate coagulation by expressing P-selectin, von Willebrand factor (vWf) and fibrinogen, leading to massive platelet binding, fibrin formation and clotting of red blood cells (RBCs), ultimately resulting in systemic thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
