    <p id="Par4">Although most patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) experience mild to moderate symptoms that resolve after 6â€“10 days, almost 20% of patients develop severe illness characterized by atypical interstitial bilateral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, with a high fatality rate.</p>

    <p id="Par5">Accumulating evidence suggests that an unbalanced and unrestrained innate immune response, which comes at the expense of effective adaptive immunity, underpins the progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).</p>

    <p id="Par6">In severe cases of COVID-19, massive endothelial dysfunction, widespread coagulopathy and complement-induced thrombosis can lead to the development of systemic microangiopathy and thromboembolism; these complications can be life-threatening and ultimately lead to multi-organ failure.</p>

    <p id="Par7">The kidney is one of the main targets of COVID-19 complications, and abnormal kidney function is associated with a significantly increased risk of death in severely ill patients.</p>

    <p id="Par8">Most repurposed anti-viral drugs have failed to improve clinical outcomes in COVID-19; by contrast, therapeutic interventions that target the host response, including the hyper-immune response, complement activation and systemic thrombosis, seem to be more promising approaches to the treatment of severe COVID-19.</p>
