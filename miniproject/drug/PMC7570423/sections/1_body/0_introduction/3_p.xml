 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) begins when the viral spike protein attaches to its complementary host cell receptor
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>. The host protease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the main surface protein responsible for SARS-CoV-2 entry
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>. In contrast to SARS-CoV, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a molecular structure that eludes the host immune response
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>; moreover, its receptor binding domain harbours a single mutation that significantly enhances its ACE2 binding affinity
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>, suggesting that this novel coronavirus has evolved with an increased ability to infect and spread among humans
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. In addition to ACE2, the MERS-CoV receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) may also act as a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>; however, this interaction remains to be confirmed. After attachment to ACE2, the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) cleaves and primes the receptor-bound spike protein to mediate fusion of the viral envelope with the membrane of the target cell in the host
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>. Other proteases, expressed at different levels in various tissues, may also cleave the spike protein and facilitate virus entry
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>. Depending on the availability of protease on the host cell surface, this priming of the spike protein allows the virus to enter the host cell through endocytosis or via direct fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane. Once inside its target cell, the viral particles are uncoated and the released viral genome is translated by the host ribosome in the endoplasmic reticulum
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>. The viral structural proteins move along the secretory pathway into the Golgi intermediate compartment for progeny assembly, and the progeny are then released from the host cell via secretory vesicles by exocytosis
