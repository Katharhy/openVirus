<p id="Par9">Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The 
 <italic>Orthocoronavirinae</italic> family encompasses several coronaviruses that can infect mammals and birds. Although such infections usually cause mild respiratory disease, in the past two decades, coronaviruses have caused two epidemic diseases in humans: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2003 and 2012, respectively. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that was isolated from the respiratory epithelium of patients with unexplained pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. As of 17 September 2020, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has reached pandemic proportions, affecting more than 30 million individuals and claiming more than 1 million lives worldwide.
