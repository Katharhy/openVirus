<p id="Par12">Here, we review the current understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection and progression of COVID-19, focusing on the critical role of the immunological hyper-response in disease exacerbation. We also examine emerging data in support of a role for SARS-CoV-2 infection in inducing widespread endothelial damage, complement-associated blood clotting and systemic microangiopathy, and describe how these consequences may contribute to the development of kidney complications in severely ill patients with COVID-19. Finally, we discuss the therapeutic interventions that currently hold most promise to limit progression of disease during the early phases and discuss currently available drugs that may be repurposed to treat severe cases of COVID-19.</p>
