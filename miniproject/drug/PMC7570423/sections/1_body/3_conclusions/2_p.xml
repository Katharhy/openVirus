<p id="Par57">Currently, no vaccines or effective antiviral drugs are available for COVID-19, although many are in development and some may become available soon. The paucity of available specific therapies has stimulated the search for existing drugs that can be repurposed for COVID-19. So far, these drugs have included steroids, several anti-interleukin drugs, complement inhibitors and agents that target coagulation and endothelial dysfunction. However, some of these next-generation targeted therapies are not devoid of adverse effects, which can be serious and sometimes life-threatening. The identification of inexpensive and effective drugs — including low-dose steroids and LWMH — is of utmost importance to prevent exacerbation of inflammatory and thrombotic processes and halt disease progression. Given the spectrum of pathogenic mechanisms involved in the development of severe COVID-19, ranging from immune hyperactivation to thromboembolic complications, it is unlikely that a single individual treatment will be effective. Although corticosteroids may be able to target most of these pathogenic pathways, the multifactorial pathogenic nature of the disease indicates that multiple avenues of treatment might be required and major effort should therefore be invested to determine the optimal timing and combinations in which these drugs should be administered to maximize their efficacy in severely ill patients with COVID-19.</p>
