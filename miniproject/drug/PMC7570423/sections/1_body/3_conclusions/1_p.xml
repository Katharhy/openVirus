<p id="Par56">Available evidence demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces immune dysfunction, widespread endothelial injury, complement-associated coagulopathy and systemic microangiopathy. The clinical outcome of COVID-19 seems to be profoundly dependent on the individual response of the host. Although the contribution of differences in viral loads to clinical outcome cannot be excluded

 </sup>, it is possible that predisposing genetic or biological factors may modulate the degree of disease severity. Additionally, socioeconomic conditions and structural racism may contribute to poor disease outcomes in some regions, as demonstrated by disproportionately poor outcomes among minority ethnic groups, including Black, Asian and Pakistani populations

 </sup>. Improved insights into the mechanisms underlying predisposition to adverse disease outcomes might aid the identification of new strategies and targets for therapy, as well as identify ways to improve outcomesÂ for susceptible individuals and those from minority ethnic backgrounds. However, the development of new drugs is a long process and may not be useful for dealing with the immediate challenge posed by the current COVID-19 pandemic.
