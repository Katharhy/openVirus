<p id="Par44">The first week following SARS-CoV-2 infection — during which the virus enters alveolar cells and starts replicating in the lungs — represents a critical time for blocking the infection using antiviral agents. Of the repurposed antivirals investigated to date, the adenosine analogue remdesivir was initially identified as a promising therapy to induce premature termination of SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication by competing with endogenous nucleotides for the viral RdRp

 </sup>. Despite initial, encouraging results
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">190</xref>
 </sup>, the first placebo-controlled trial in COVID-19 failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of remdesivir
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">191</xref>
 </sup>. However, the US FDA granted emergency use authorization for remdesivir when review of the topline data from an ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">192</xref>
 </sup> showed that patients with COVID-19 who received remdesivir recovered 30% more quickly than those who had received placebo, although no statistical difference in mortality was found between the two study arms
 <sup>

 </sup>. One major obstacle to the development of effective nucleotide-based drugs is our lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying substrate recognition during SARS-CoV-2 replication. New studies that have provided insights into the structural basis of RNA replication by the RdRp complex

 </sup> and the residues that are critical for nucleotide recognition and excision
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">189</xref>
 </sup> may aid the identification of more effective and targeted nucleotide-based therapies. The combination of HIV protease inhibitors lopinavir–ritonavir has also been investigated for their ability to treat COVID-19. However, these drugs specifically inhibit the HIV aspartyl protease (retropepsin), an enzyme that is essential HIV virion maturation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">195</xref>
 </sup>. Consistent with this high selectivity, a randomized, controlled, open-label trial reported no differences between treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir and standard care in time to clinical improvement
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR196">196</xref>
 </sup>. Given the lack of specific SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors, preclinical studies are underway to develop more effective antiviral treatments for COVID-19, including a specific inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 protease M

 </sup>, although it may be some time before these novel targeted drugs are available for use in humans.
