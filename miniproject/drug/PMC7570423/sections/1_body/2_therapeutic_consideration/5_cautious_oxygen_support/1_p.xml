<p id="Par54">Oxygen therapy has been used as first-line supportive treatment for breathing dysfunction and dyspnoea in patients with COVID-19 with pneumonia and ARDS. However, despite fulfilling most of the criteria of classic ARDS, COVID-19-associated pneumonia may be a discrete disease characterized by two distinct phenotypes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR253">253</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR254">254</xref>
 </sup>. In the early phase of the disease, the severe hypoxaemia induced by ARDS is often associated with near normal respiratory system compliance
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR253">253</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR254">254</xref>
 </sup>. In these patients, gentle oxygen therapy — such as high flow nasal cannula, continuous positive airway pressure or non-invasive ventilation — is recommended
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR253">253</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR254">254</xref>
 </sup>. During this phase, a patient’s condition may remain unchanged for a period of time and then either improve or suddenly deteriorate to a more severe disease stage. In the latter situation, the resulting ARDS phenotype is similar to that of acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia — a rare form of acute lung injury that differs from the diffuse alveolar damage found in classic forms of ARDS
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR255">255</xref>
 </sup>. The obliterative pattern of lung injury in these severe cases of COVID-19 raises concerns about the potential deleterious effect of invasive mechanical ventilation at a high level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR255">255</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR256">256</xref>
 </sup>. Indeed, if vascular alterations, such as pulmonary vasoconstriction, pulmonary emboli or thrombi, are the major driver of hypoxaemia in COVID-19, then increasing PEEP levels might not improve oxygenation but, conversely, might contribute to lung damage
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR257">257</xref>
 </sup>. For this reason, oxygen therapy should be personalized in each patient because the response to PEEP differs on the basis of individual respiratory mechanics
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR257">257</xref>
 </sup>. This issue is of particular relevance for nephrologists, given that mechanical ventilation is also associated with a threefold increase in the risk of AKI, and that patients with combined respiratory failure and AKI have a mortality of 60–80% in the ICU setting
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">168</xref>
 </sup>. On the other hand, acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia is a cortico-sensitive pathology and, as described above, appropriate corticosteroid therapy should be established for the clinical management of severely ill patients to avoid unnecessary ventilation.
