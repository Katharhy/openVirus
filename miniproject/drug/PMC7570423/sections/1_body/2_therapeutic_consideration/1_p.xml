From this point of view, understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19 offers important opportunities to identify and repurpose therapeutics that are already available to attenuate viral attachment and replication, hyperinflammation and the mechanisms underlying endothelial damage, blood clotting and systemic microangiopathy.
