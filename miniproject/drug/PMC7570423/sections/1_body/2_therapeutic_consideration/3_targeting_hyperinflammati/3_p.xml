<p id="Par49">The first drug used to target specific components of the hyperactivated immune response in COVID-19 was the IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab. Two retrospective reviews found that tocilizumab treatment was associated with a significant reduction in markers of inflammation and in the need for ventilatory support, and with improvements in radiological findings in patients with severe disease

 </sup>). However, adequately powered, randomized controlled trials are still needed, and at least 16 different clinical trials are currently underway to assess the effects of other anti-interleukin drugs. Importantly, anti-interleukin agents will only limit propagation of the hypercytokinaemia but are unlikely to resolve the underlying cause of immune system dysregulation in COVID-19.
