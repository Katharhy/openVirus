<p id="Par50">The clinical characteristics of lymphocytopenia and exhausted circulating T cells indicate that immunotherapies could represent another potential therapeutic option for COVID-19. As in cancer, PD1-mediated inhibitory signals contribute to T cell exhaustion and inhibit T cell effector functions in the early stages of viral infection

 </sup>. Thus, PD1 blockade with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors may enhance the effector function of T cells and stimulate viral clearance

 <sup>+</sup> T cells and was associated with positive clinical outcomes

 <sup>+</sup> T cells in COVID-19 is unknown, but will be assessed in three ongoing clinical trials underway to assess the efficacy of anti-PD1 antibodies in severely ill patients with COVID-19 (refs

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR230">230</xref>
 </sup>). A more intriguing possibility is whether combining anti-PD1 antibodies with anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) blockade might increase the efficacy of the respective monotherapies. Indeed, combination therapy can promote switching of phenotypically exhausted CD8

 <sup>+</sup> and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell counts, as well as reversed T cell exhaustion by reducing expression of the T cell exhaustion markers PD1 and TIM-3 on CD8

 </sup>. Compared with untreated patients, supplementation of thymosin alpha 1 in COVID-19 patients with severe lymphocytopenia was associated with a significantly lower death rate and reduced need for invasive mechanical ventilation
