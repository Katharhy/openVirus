<p id="Par48">Given the role of immune system hyperactivation and cytokines in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, the potential benefits of more targeted therapies should also be considered. For example, the observed suppression of interferon responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that interferon supplementation may be a potential therapeutic approach for COVID-19, as it is for other infectious diseases such as hepatitis. However, caution must be taken with this approach given the important immunomodulatory properties of interferon therapy, since interferon supplementation could induce or aggravate pre-existing autoimmune diseases or induce life-threatening complications, such as kidney and/or cardiac impairment or pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
