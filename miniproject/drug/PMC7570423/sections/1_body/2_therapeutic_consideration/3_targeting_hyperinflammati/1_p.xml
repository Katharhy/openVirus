 </sup>, and prompt intervention with these drugs could be crucial for controlling the early stages of immune-mediated lung injury in COVID-19. Based on experience gained with previous coronavirus outbreaks, the use of high-dose corticosteroids in COVID-19 was initially discouraged because of the potential risk of secondary infections, long-term complications and prolonged virus shedding

 </sup>. However, early reports from China indicated that treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death of patients with COVID-19 (ref.

 </sup>. In randomized case–control studies in adult patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia, early and short-term (from 5 to 7 days) corticosteroid therapy and intravenous administration of immunoglobulin after hospital admission reduced morbidity and rates of treatment failure
