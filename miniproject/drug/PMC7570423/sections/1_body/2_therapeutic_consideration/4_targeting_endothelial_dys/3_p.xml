 </sup>, the anti-C5 monoclonal antibody eculizumab could be the most valuable tool for preventing complement activation in COVID-19. C5 inhibitors block the formation of the terminal products that are common to the three complement pathways, while still allowing C3 activation and viral opsonization

 </sup>). C5a may represent an alternative therapeutic target. C5a stimulates cytokine release, increases vascular permeability and induces the upregulation of adhesion molecules that favour leukocyte extravasation and transmigration into lung parenchyma

 </sup> — pathological events that are all observed in severe cases of COVID-19. Interestingly, a preliminary study published in preprint form reported a promising immunosuppressive effect of the anti-C5a antibody BDB-001 in two severely ill patients with COVID-19 (ref.

 </sup>). Of note, C5 blockade has demonstrated benefit in various kidney diseases, including C3 glomerulopathy and atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome
