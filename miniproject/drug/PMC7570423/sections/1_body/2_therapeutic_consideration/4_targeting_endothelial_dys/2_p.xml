<p id="Par52">Of the available drugs, inhibitors of the complement system may have the most potential to preserve endothelial cell function and limit thromboembolic complications. A case report of a patient with COVID-19-associated ARDS and pneumonia showed that treatment with a C3 inhibitor was safe and associated with a favourable course

 </sup>, suggesting that C3 blockade may have broad anti-inflammatory potential owing to the upstream positioning of C3 in innate immune cascade signalling. However, C3 inhibition prevents activation of the entire complement cascade, halting the opsonization of viral particles by C3b. Indeed, studies in knockout mice have demonstrated that C3 is required for protection from the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza infection and proper viral clearance
