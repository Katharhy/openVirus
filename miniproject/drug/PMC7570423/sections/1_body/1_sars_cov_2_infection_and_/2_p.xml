<p id="Par14">Although the lung is the primary site of pathology, an accumulating body of evidence shows that the virus can disseminate to other organs and induce additional pathological conditions. Kidneys, brain, heart, eye and gut can be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, potentially leading to specific disease manifestations such as 
 <xref rid="Glos4" ref-type="list">anosmia</xref> and

 </sup>. Many cell types present in these organs express ACE2 and proteases such as TMPRSS2 and have been shown to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 in in vitro and in vivo studies
