<p id="Par24">In contrast to T cells, very few studies have demonstrated an effect of SARS-CoV-2 on B cell biology. To date, studies regarding B cell function in COVID-19 have mainly focused on the generation of specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. In a study of 285 patients with COVID-19, seroconversion for IgG and IgM against the nucleocapsid and the spike protein occurred simultaneously or sequentially and their titres plateaued within 6 days of seroconversion

 </sup>; these beneficial effects were associated with potent neutralizing antibody responses. Moreover, treatment with two potent human monoclonal antibodies that recognize the spike protein protected rhesus macaques against a challenge with SARS-CoV-2 as reported by a preprint study

 </sup> — a finding that strongly suggests that a protective humoral response can be induced by vaccination.
