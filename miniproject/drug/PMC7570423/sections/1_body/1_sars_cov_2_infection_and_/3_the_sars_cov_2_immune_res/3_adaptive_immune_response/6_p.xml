<p id="Par25">However, the extent to which naturally induced antibodies against disease relapse may provide long-lasting protection is still unknown. The longevity of the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 in humans may be transient, as demonstrated by the finding that 40% of asymptomatic patients and 13% of symptomatic patients became negative for anti-spike IgG in the early convalescent phase

 </sup>. As shown in a preprint study, longitudinal evaluation of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection reported a rapid decline in levels of neutralizing antibody during a 4-month follow-up period, with titres approaching the lower threshold of positivity in several individuals
