<p id="Par21">However, T cell lymphopenia may also result from SARS-CoV-2-induced cell death. Findings from a post-mortem examination of the spleen and lymph nodes of patients with COVID-19, published in preprint form, identified high levels of T cell apoptosis and increased expression of the death receptor FAS

 </sup> and further supporting the notion that T cell depletion in COVID-19 results from AICD. Regardless of the underlying cause, however, the absence of an effective anti-viral T cell and NK cell response could play a critical part in the maintenance of a high viral load and hyperactivation of the innate response
