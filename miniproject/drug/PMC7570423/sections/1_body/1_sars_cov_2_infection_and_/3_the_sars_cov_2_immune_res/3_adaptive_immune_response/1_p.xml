<p id="Par20">Lymphopenia is a common feature of severe COVID-19, characterized by drastically reduced absolute numbers of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and particularly CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells

 </sup>. A proteomic analysis of peripheral blood cells from patients with COVID-19 reported decreased T cell counts, associated with reduced indices of T cell activation and function, including lower expression of T cell receptor (TCR) subunits (CD3e, CD3g, CD247, TRAC and TRBC1) in patients with severe disease than in patients with mild disease
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>
 </sup>. Levels of T cell surface molecules (CD4, CD8a, CD8b and CD2), T cell migration stimulators (DDP4), TCR signalling kinases (ZAP70, LCK and FYN) and MHC class II molecules (HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB4 and HLA-DRB5) were also significantly lower in patients with severe disease, indicating a global impairment in the adaptive immune response
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>
 </sup>. Decreased numbers of peripheral T cells might result from increased migration to the lungs or other infected tissues. However, although CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells can be detected in lung tissue of deceased patients with COVID-19, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell are infrequently observed
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. Peripheral CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells from patients with COVID-19 express high levels of exhaustion markers, including programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) and T cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM3); of note, this expression pattern was more pronounced among patients who required intensive care than in patients with mild disease
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>
 </sup>. In addition to confirming the exhausted phenotype of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in patients with COVID-19, another study demonstrated that natural killer (NK) cells were also exhausted with increased expression of inhibitory CD94–NK group 2 member A (NKG2A) receptor heterodimer. Of interest, numbers of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and NK cells were restored in convalescent patients, with reduced expression of CD94–NKG2A
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>
 </sup>. These findings suggest that the rise in inflammatory cytokine levels induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection might drive the depletion of T and NK cells, which subsequently fail to destroy infected cells.
