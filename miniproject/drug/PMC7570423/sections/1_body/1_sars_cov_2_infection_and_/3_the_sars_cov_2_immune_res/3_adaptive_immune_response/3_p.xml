<p id="Par22">Despite the impaired T cell response associated with severe COVID-19, a study from the USA documented the presence of circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in 100% and 70%, respectively, of patients who had recovered from the disease

 <sup>+</sup> T cell response against SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a classical T helper (T
 <sub>H</sub>) type 1 response, which was robust against the spike protein, the membrane protein and the nucleocapsid protein. Additional CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses were found to target NSP3, NSP4, ORF3a and ORF8 in convalescent patients with COVID-19 (ref.

 <sup>+</sup> cells were IFNÎ³
 <sup>+</sup> and recognized the spike and membrane proteins, and at least eight different SARS-CoV-2 ORFs

 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells; in the blood of patients with severe COVID-19, these SARS-CoV-2-specific lymphocytes were already detectable at ICU admission

 </sup>. Notably, these studies have consistently identified the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in a large subset of seronegative convalescent individuals, suggesting that T cells could represent a more sensitive indicator of SARS-CoV-2 exposure than antibodies
