In this context, a study that suggested that the humoral response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may increase the severity of lung injury by skewing macrophage responses, abrogating wound-healing responses and promoting macrophage recruitment and accumulation in the lung parenchyma, is of particular interest

Relative levels of IgA and IgG have also been demonstrated to be markedly higher in severely ill patients with COVID-19 than in patients with milder disease, suggesting that IgA may have synergistic effects with IgG in promoting antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and COVID-19 exacerbation
