 </sup>. When viruses colonize their target cells, viral single-stranded RNA, like that of SARS-CoV-2, activates innate immune cells by engaging any one of a number of intracellular 
 <xref rid="Glos6" ref-type="list">pattern recognition receptors</xref> (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), which sense aberrant RNA structures that often form during viral replication
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup>. Following PRR activation, molecular signalling cascades culminate in the activation of downstream transcription factors, such as interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup>. These transcription factors trigger the initial cellular antiviral defences by inducing the transcriptional activation of type I and III interferons (IFN-I and IFN-III) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), as well as cytokines and chemokines (Fig.
