<p id="Par18">In line with the above-described findings, the most frequent laboratory abnormalities in patients with unfavourable COVID-19 progression include a cytokine profile characterized by increased levels of IL-2, IL-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), IFNγ inducible protein 10 (IP-10, also known as CXCL10), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and 3 (MCP1 and MCP3, also known as CCL2 and CCL7, respectively), macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP-1α, also known as CCL3) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)

 </sup>. Of these dysregulated cytokines and chemokines, the combined evaluation of IP-10 and MCP3 had the highest predictive value of poor outcomes among patients with COVID-19 (ref.

 </sup>). These findings are reminiscent of the hyper-inflammatory syndrome, secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and consequently, the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection was initially considered to involve a form of

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>
 </sup>. However, this concept has since been revisited and the contribution of cytokines to COVID-19 questioned

 </sup>. Single-cell RNA sequencing of immune cells from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with COVID-19 suggested the expansion of pro-inflammatory monocytes and Ficolin-positive monocyte-derived macrophages, paralleled by a decrease in tissue-resident reparative alveolar macrophages in patients with severe disease compared with that seen in moderate cases

 </sup>. A further elegant single-cell RNA sequencing study confirmed an enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the lung macrophage population of infected patients, and differential gene expression analysis revealed that infected macrophages had higher chemokine expression than non-infected macrophages

 </sup>. Moreover, use of untargeted metabolomics has shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers profound alterations in macrophage phenotype and function by downregulating the expression of apolipoproteins that are important for proper macrophage polarization towards anti-inflammatory phenotype

 </sup>. Mechanistically, virus–host interactome and proteomic analysis of peripheral blood cells from patients with varying symptoms of COVID-19 suggests that NSP9 and NSP10 of SARS-CoV-2 interact with the NF-kB repressor NKRF, which induces an over-exuberant innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection
