<p id="Par19">A transcriptome analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells from eight patients with COVID-19 suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits more pronounced neutrophil infiltration than other forms of pneumonia

 </sup>. A new study has also indicated that neutrophil activation and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) may have a prominent role in propagating the severe cytokine release observed in severe cases of COVID-19, representing a previously unrecognized, but powerful innate defence response that may exacerbate lung damage in affected patients

 </sup>. These findings suggest that unbalanced innate immunity may exacerbate the hyper-inflammatory response in severe cases of the disease (Fig.Â
