<p id="Par17">This broad antiviral response has placed selective pressure on viruses to develop countless countermeasures to avoid host immune responses, most of which are poorly understood

 </sup>. Mechanistically, NSP1 of SARS-CoV-2 suppresses RIG-I-dependent innate immune responses by binding to the 40â€‰S ribosomal subunit, resulting in shutdown of host mRNA translation

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>
 </sup>. SARS-CoV-2 may also evade immunological defence mechanisms through the indirect binding of ORF9b to the mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein (MAVS) via the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane 70 (TOM70)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>
 </sup>. The localization of MAVS on the outer mitochondrial membrane is essential for the activation of IFN-I after infection of RNA viruses
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>
 </sup>, and it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 binding to MAVS might prevent its translocation and IFN-I activation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>
 </sup>. In support of this hypothesis, SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with lower IFN-I and IFN-III levels and a moderate ISG response compared with other respiratory viruses, despite being characterized by vigorous production of inflammatory cytokines
