 </sup>. However, renal vasculopathy has not been consistently found in the kidney and no significant glomerular disease has been described, with the exception of collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, which has been reported in a few patients and seems to be associated with the presence of genetic ‘risk’ variants of

Together, these findings suggest that the kidney is severely affected in some patients with COVID-19 and imply that further insight into disease pathogenesis may aid the identification of novel therapeutic targets to prevent kidney dysfunction and/or hasten renal recovery during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
