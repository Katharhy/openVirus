<p id="Par38">The lungs are the main site for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the first affected organ in COVID-19. However, sustained viral shedding and hyperactivation of the immune response in severe cases greatly increases the risk of systemic multi-organ failure. Of the organs affected by COVID-19, the kidney is one of the main sites of COVID-19 complications (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), and abnormal renal function is a significant risk factor for death in severely ill patients with COVID-19 in the ICU setting. In a prospective cohort study of 701 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, almost 17% (113) died in hospital

 </sup>. Reports published later in the pandemic described a higher incidence of AKI (8–17%), with the highest ranges in the critically ill (14–35%)

 </sup>. In most patients with COVID-19, abnormal kidney function in the presence of low-level proteinuria possibly reflects tubular injury. In some cases, however, proteinuria is abundant or contains albumin, suggesting glomerular impairment

 </sup>. Patients with kidney disease are at a significantly higher risk of death than those without kidney disease, and elevated levels of baseline serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen, AKI stage, proteinuria or haematuria were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality
 <sup>

 </sup>. A systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that, in patients with COVID-19, severe AKI is an ominous clinical predictor and is associated with high mortality
