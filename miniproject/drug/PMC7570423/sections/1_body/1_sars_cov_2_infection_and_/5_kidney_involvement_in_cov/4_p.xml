  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">174</xref>
 </sup>. ACE2 internalization following SARS-CoV-2 infection could induce an imbalance in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, with increased Ang II signalling leading to pro-inflammatory and profibrotic processes in the kidney

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">175</xref>
 </sup>. The critical role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 kidney infection is emphasized by findings from in vitro studies that show that SARS-CoV-2 can infect human kidney organoids and that this infection can be limited by expression of human recombinant soluble ACE2 — a decoy receptor that is undergoing evaluation in clinical trials

 </sup>. Also, in support of the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 exerts tropism in the kidney, electron microscopy examination of autopsy samples from 26 patients who had died with COVID-19 demonstrated clusters of viral particles in the tubular epithelium and podocytes

 </sup>. Another study that involved microdissection of autoptic tissue demonstrated detectable SARS-CoV-2 viral load in three of six deceased patients; within the three SARS-CoV-2-positive samples, virus was detected in all kidney compartments examined, with preferential targeting of glomerular cells

 </sup>. However, most analyses of kidney tissue have used electron microscopy, light microscopy and/or immunohistochemistry, which cannot conclusively ascertain whether the identified particles are actually SARS-CoV-2 or merely viral-like structures. In particular, the identification of viral particles in kidney tissue by electron microscopy has been questioned given the resemblance of these particles to other cellular structures, such as clathrin-coated vesicles
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">177</xref>
 </sup>, and the fact that several studies have been unable to confirm the presence of virus in the kidney
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">178</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">181</xref>
 </sup>. Moreover, studies of SARS-CoV-2 in biological fluids have rarely shown viral shedding in the urine

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>
 </sup>, raising the possibility that a reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 might not exist in the kidney. Despite these discrepancies and unknowns, one elegant study has documented enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in glomerular epithelial and endothelial cells by in situ hybridization

 </sup>. In line with this finding, active viral replication in different tissues, including kidney tissue, was found in a subset of patients with COVID-19 (ref.

 </sup>), although it is still not clear whether this renal active replication contributes to the viral burden in the body.
