<p id="Par40">Several non-specific mechanisms may contribute to the development of AKI in the setting of COVID-19, including haemodynamic alterations, cardiac dysfunction, hypovolaemia due to poor oral intake or high-grade fever, use of nephrotoxic drugs and nosocomial sepsis

Additionally, high levels of mechanical ventilation can potentially induce AKI by inducing neuro-humoral-mediated alterations in intra-renal blood flow and other haemodynamic changes that impair renal perfusion, and through the induction of systemic inflammatory mediators as a consequence of ventilator-induced lung injury
