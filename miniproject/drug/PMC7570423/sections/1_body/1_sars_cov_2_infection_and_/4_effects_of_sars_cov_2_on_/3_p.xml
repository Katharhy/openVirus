 </sup> indicates that additional host-dependent factors might contribute to systemic endothelial dysfunction and vasculopathy in COVID-19, rather than direct viral-dependent effects on endothelial cells. As reviewed elsewhere, the hypercytokinaemia and the massive pro-inflammatory response of the host may contribute to endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19, particularly via the actions of IL-6 and TNF â€” levels of which are strongly increased in critically ill patients

 </sup>. Cytokines exert their pathogenic effects through various mechanisms. For example, IL-6 can increase vascular permeability and promote the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by endothelial cells themselves, thereby amplifying the cytokine release

 </sup>. Additional mechanisms, such as a reduction of endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity and nitric oxide levels, as well as the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a consequence of the systemic hypoxia induced by ARDS, have also been proposed as key pathogenic processes underlying endothelial dysfunction following SARS-CoV-2 infection
