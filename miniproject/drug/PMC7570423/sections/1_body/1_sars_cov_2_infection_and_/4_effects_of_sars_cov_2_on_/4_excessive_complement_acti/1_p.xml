<p id="Par32">The complement system is an integral component of the innate immune response and comprises over 30 different proteins

 </sup>. This system can be activated by three different pathways: the classical, the lectin and the alternative pathway

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>
 </sup>. All of these pathways converge on the formation of C3 convertases that cleave C3 to generate the pro-inflammatory peptide C3a and a large amount of C3b, which opsonizes pathogens

 </sup>. C3b also forms C5 convertase, which induces release of the potent anaphylatoxin C5a, as well as the fragment C5b that is responsible for the formation of the membrane attack complex C5b–9 on target cells — the terminal event of complement activation. Although complement, like other innate immune system components, helps to control bacterial and viral infections, its unrestrained activation — for example, in the context of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection — can be detrimental by causing direct damage of host tissues
