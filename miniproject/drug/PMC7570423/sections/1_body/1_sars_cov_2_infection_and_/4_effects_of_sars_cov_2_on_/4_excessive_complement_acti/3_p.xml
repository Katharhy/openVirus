<p id="Par34">In addition to the lectin pathway, the classical pathway may also contribute to tissue injury induced by coronavirus infection. Indeed, immune complexes formed by viral antigens and antibodies can activate C1 and initiate complement activation. In patients with SARS-CoV infection, the development of autoantibodies against human pulmonary epithelial cells and endothelial cells mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity

 </sup>; however, whether this process is also activated following SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Use of an ultra-high-throughput clinical proteomic approach identified consistent activation of the classical complement pathway (specifically, complement components C1R, C1S and C8A) in the sera of patients with clinically severe COVID-19, along with increased activation of the alternative pathway component, complement factor B (CFB) and its modulators CFI and CFH
