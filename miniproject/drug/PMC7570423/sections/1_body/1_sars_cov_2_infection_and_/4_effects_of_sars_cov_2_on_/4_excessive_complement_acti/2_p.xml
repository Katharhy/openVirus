<p id="Par33">Most available data on complement activation in the context of coronavirus infection are derived from the SARS and MERS epidemics. A 2018 study of SARS-CoV demonstrated that C3-deficient mice experienced a less severe form of disease than wild-type mice, associated with reduced lung infiltration of inflammatory cells and lower hypercytokinaemia in both the lungs and sera

 </sup>. SARS-CoV activates the lectin pathway by interacting with the complement component mannose-binding lectin (MBL) — a C-type lectin that activates mannose-binding protein-associated serine protease 2 (MASP-2) — enhancing the deposition of C4 activation fragments on virus-infected cells

 </sup>. In mice infected with MERS-CoV, levels of circulating C5a increased post-infection and the expression of the C5a receptor (C5aR) was upregulated in pneumocytes and inflammatory leukocytes, associated with strong C5b–9 deposition on bronchiolar epithelial cells, pneumocytes and infiltrating leukocytes

 </sup>. In line with these findings, immunohistochemistry analyses in post-mortem lung tissue from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients revealed high expression of the complement components MBL, C4, C3 and C5b–9, in alveolar epithelial cells and pneumocytes, as well as in inflammatory cells, as reported by a preprint study

 </sup>. As mentioned above, the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 can interact indirectly with MASP-2 and initiate the lectin pathway of complement, resulting in aberrant complement activation and aggravated inflammatory lung injury

 </sup>. Circulating levels of C5a were higher in patients with severe COVID-19 than in patients with mild disease who had levels of C5a similar to those of healthy controls

 </sup>. Use of an untargeted metabolomic approach also demonstrated upregulation of complement activation proteins, including membrane attack complex proteins such as C5, C6 and C8, in sera from 46 patients with severe disease
