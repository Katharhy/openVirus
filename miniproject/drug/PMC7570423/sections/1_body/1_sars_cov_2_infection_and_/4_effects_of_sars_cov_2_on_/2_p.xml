<p id="Par30">SARS-CoV-2 may alter vascular homeostasis by directly infecting endothelial cells via ACE2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). In support of this proposal, SARS-CoV-2 can successfully infect engineered human blood vessel organoids, confirming SARS-CoV-2 tropism for endothelial cells
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>
 </sup>. This finding is further corroborated by electron microscopy analyses of post-mortem tissue, which have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can infect pulmonary endothelial cells and induce endotheliitis, at least in a subset of critically ill patients

 </sup>. After binding by SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 is internalized and downregulated on endothelial cells, which favour the progression of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic processes in the lung triggered by local angiotensin II (Ang II) hyperactivity
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>
 </sup>. Given that ACE2 converts Ang II into Ang (1–7), which acts on the MAS receptor, it is conceivable that a reduction of ACE2 expression by endothelial cells in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to reduced generation of Ang 1–7 and consequently, reduced activation of MAS, promoting a local pro-thrombotic endothelial cell phenotype (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Furthermore, reduced expression of ACE2 might in turn indirectly activate the kallikrein–kinin system (KKS), which ultimately leads to increases in vascular permeability
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>
 </sup>. Indeed, several studies have documented that a tight balance between the KKS and renin–angiotensin systems is required to regulate the thromboresistance of endothelial cells

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>
 </sup>. The reduction in pulmonary ACE2 impairs the inactivation of des-Arg
 <sup>9</sup> bradykinin (DABK), leaving it free to bind its cognate receptors
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>
 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Moreover, high levels of bradykinin in patients with COVID-19 might explain the majority of severe symptoms, spanning from blood vessel injury to neurological complications
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>
 </sup>, suggesting that inhibition of the KKS, for example, with the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist icatibant
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>
 </sup>, could be a possible therapeutic strategy

 </sup>. Mechanistically, disruption of the endothelial barrier by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is mediated by changes in the surface expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1), vascular cell adhesion protein-1 (VCAM1) and the tight junction scaffold protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), as reported by a preprint study
