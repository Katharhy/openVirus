<p id="Par36">Activation of the complement system leads to endothelial cell injury and death with subsequent vascular denudation and exposure of the thrombogenic basement membrane, which drives activation of clotting cascades. These events result in inflammation, microvascular thrombosis, vessel oedema and haemorrhagic sequelae — all of which are prominent features of the lung pathology of patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia
