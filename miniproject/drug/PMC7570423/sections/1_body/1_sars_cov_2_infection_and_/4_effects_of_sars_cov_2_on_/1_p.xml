 </sup>. Mounting evidence suggests that loss of vessel barrier integrity and the development of a pro-coagulative endothelium contributes to the initiation and propagation of ARDS in COVID-19, by inducing endotheliitis and mediating inflammatory cell infiltration in the lungs

 </sup>. A substantial proportion of patients with severe COVID-19, including young individuals and children, develop venous and arterial complications. In New York City, over a 2-week period from 23 March to 7 April, 2020, researchers observed a sevenfold increase in large-vessel stroke among patients younger than 50 years of age compared with a 2-week time frame over the previous 12 months

 </sup>. This syndrome has been described as a pathological condition with features similar to Kawasaki disease — a rare condition that affects blood vessels, including those in the heart. All children tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 on bronchoalveolar lavage or nasopharyngeal aspirates, but laboratory tests were indicative of infection and inflammation, including high levels of C-reactive protein, ferritin and D-dimers

 </sup>. More recent evidence suggested that this syndrome, now termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), has unique haematological and immunological characteristics that are distinct from those of both typical COVID-19 in adults and Kawasaki disease
