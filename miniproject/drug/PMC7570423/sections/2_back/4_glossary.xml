   <term>Betacoronavirus</term>
   <def>
    <p>One of four genera (α, β, γ and δ) of enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses that infects humans and mammals, causing respiratory diseases that can be mild or severe.</p>

   <term>RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</term>
   <def>
    <p>(RdRp). An enzyme encoded by viral RNA that catalyses the synthesis of new RNA strands complementary to the initial RNA template included in the viral capsid.</p>

   <term>Incubation period</term>
   <def>
    <p>The number of days between the initial exposure to a pathogen and the day in which the infected individual experiences the first symptoms of the disease.</p>

   <term>Anosmia</term>
   <def>
    <p>Complete loss of the ability to detect one or more smells; anosmia can be temporary, as in the case of COVID-19, or permanent such as occurs in certain neurological conditions.</p>

   <term>Ageusia</term>
   <def>
    <p>Complete loss of taste on the tongue, particularly the inability to perceive sweetness, sourness, bitterness and saltiness; ageusia can be temporary, as in the case of COVID-19, or permanent such as occurs in certain neurological conditions.</p>

   <term>Pattern recognition receptors</term>
   <def>
    <p>(PRRs). Host sensors that detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) generated during infections or injury.</p>
   </def>

  <def-item id="Glos7">
   <term>Cytokine storm</term>
   <def>
    <p>Also called hypercytokinaemia. An excessive and uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory molecules by the cellular components of the innate immune system in response to a number of infectious and non-infectious aetiologies that can lead to multi-organ damage and failure.</p>

   <term>VH gene</term>
   <def>
    <p>The heavy-chain-variable region (VH) gene gene is located along with diversity (D), joining (J) and constant (C) genes at three primary loci in the human genome and undergoes somatic rearrangements for the biosynthesis of the heavy (H) or light (L) chain of IgG.</p>

   <term>Glucuronidases</term>
   <def>
    <p>A class of enzyme that includes beta-glucuronidases — a glycosidases that catalyse the breakdown of complex carbohydrates by hydrolysing β-
     <sc>d</sc>-glucuronic acid residues from the non-reducing end of glycosaminoglycans, such as heparan sulfate.
