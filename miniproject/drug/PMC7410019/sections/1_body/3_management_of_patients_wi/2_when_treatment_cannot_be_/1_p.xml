<p>The rationale of the recommendation is to reduce the risk of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection by reducing hospital visits and to avoid chemo(immuno)therapy, idelalisib plus rituximab and duvelisib, due to the concern about a higher risk of infection. Based on these considerations, we suggest ibrutinib or acalabrutinib and, for logistical reasons, venetoclax for patients not fitting for BTK inhibitors. We use BTK inhibitors as monotherapies instead of rituximab or obinutuzumab combinations and delay combining anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies with venetoclax until later in the course of treatment when safer.</p>
