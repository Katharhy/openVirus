<p>The decision about delivering treatment should be primarily influenced by the tempo of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, the local situation of the hospital and the potential therapeutic benefit of the anti-leukemic therapy. CLL rarely conveys the need for immediate, urgent therapy that cannot be postponed a few weeks while waiting for a decline of the outbreak and a safer delivery of the drugs. Therefore, during the rise and the peak of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, we strongly consider the possibility of delaying the start of a treatment even in advanced stage CLL. It is known that advanced stage CLL is seldom complicated by life-threatening end organ damage or profound, debilitating symptoms requiring immediate treatment. In addition, it is important to note that lymph node size and degree of cytopenia do not affect progression free survival of targeted treatment of CLL,
