<p>If SARS-CoV-2 will transit from an epidemic to an endemic state, recurrent seasonal epidemics of SARS-CoV-2 are expected, and if immunity to SARS-CoV-2 wanes in the same manner as in related coronaviruses, recurrent wintertime outbreaks are likely to occur. The total incidence of SARS-CoV-2 through 2025 will depend crucially on the proportion of patients developing efficient immunity and its duration, as well as the availability of a vaccine and effective therapy. Doctors taking care of patients with CLL must be prepared for possible outbreaks of the infection and adapt the management of patients with CLL accordingly, by reintroducing strict preventive measures during SARS-CoV-2 reappearance, while relaxing them during the post-epidemic period until virus extinction. An expert opinion is the sole evidence that can be provided at the moment, given the lack of any specific data about COVID-19 in CLL. As understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and the available information evolves, we expect the proposed approach will be modified in the future.</p>
