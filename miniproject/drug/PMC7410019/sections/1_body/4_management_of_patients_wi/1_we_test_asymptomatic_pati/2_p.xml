<p>We monitor closely symptoms and keep a high suspicion for COVID-19 during treatment. Typical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, myalgia, chills, coryza, cough, shortness of breath or sore throat. Gastrointestinal symptoms, as diarrhea, nausea, anosmia and ageusia can precede the development of fever and lower respiratory tract symptoms.

 </sup> The specificity of such symptoms toward COVID-19 diagnosis is decreased because they may overlap with common adverse events of CLL therapies. In addition, sensitivity of infection-control strategies only based on symptoms triage is limited and these policies are not sufficient to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, with up 50% of SARS-CoV-2 infections detected in an asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic condition in a skilled nursing facility.
