<p>Patients with CLL may have infectious diseases other than COVID-19, while COVID-19 symptoms are similar to other respiratory infections. Differential diagnoses must therefore include influenza and respiratory tract diseases. Indeed, even during the epidemic up to 50% of patients with fever and respiratory symptoms from the general population are positive for respiratory pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2, depending on the seasonal outbreaks and geographic location.
