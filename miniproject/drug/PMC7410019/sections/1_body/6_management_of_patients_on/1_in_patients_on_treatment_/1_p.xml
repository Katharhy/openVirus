<p>Patients with CLL may be already at increased risk of developing life threatening COVID-19 for multiple reasons, including the underlying cancer, disease-related immune suppression, age, concomitant medical conditions and the immune suppressive effect of most CLL therapies.

 </sup> Thus, if the patient is receiving CLL therapy, its continuation should be carefully considered against the risk of drug-related immune suppression even in cases with mild COVID-19 symptoms. Occasional patients on BTK inhibitors, particularly those recently started and in whom the disease is not yet well controlled, may develop tumor flare with drug hold, which usually resolves rapidly with resumption of the inhibitor. However, most patients with well-controlled disease will remain stable during drug hold.
