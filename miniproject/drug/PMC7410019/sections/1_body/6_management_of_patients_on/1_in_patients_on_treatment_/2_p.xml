 </sup> We counsel the COVID-19 team to closely monitor these patients with remote 24/24 hours home health care and real time rapid evaluation of complications or with hospitalization. Remdesivir is the sole approved pharmaceutical agent effective at treating severe COVID-19. Use of investigational therapies for treatment of patients with CLL and with COVID-19 should ideally be done in the context of randomized controlled trials.
