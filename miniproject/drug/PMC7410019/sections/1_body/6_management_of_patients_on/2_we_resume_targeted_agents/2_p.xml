<p>One single RT-PCR test on nasopharyngeal swab has up to 15% false negative results when performed at the time of COVID-19 recovery. It is likely that 2 negative RT-PCR tests on nasopharyngeal swab samples collected 24 hours apart may not be sufficient for viral clearance evaluation, since an average of 7 ± 3 days between two tests is required to exclude an initial false negative assessment.</p>
