<p>MEGA v6.0 was used to construct a phylogenetic tree employing the neighbor-joining method based on the Kimura two-parameter model with 1000 bootstrap replicates based on Kimura's two-parameter model [

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] using a 200 nt window with tree construction by the neighbor-joining method applying Kimura's two-parameter substitution model. The possible intertype mosaicisms of URFs were screened using the Recombinant Identification Program (RIP,

When determining the most probable geographic origin of novel HIV variants circulating in Krasnoyarsk Krai, each novel URF sequence was aligned with HIV-1 sequences isolated worldwide with the highest identities using the online tool HIV BLAST, available at the LANL HIV database.
