<p>It is notable that HIV-1 СRF63_02A1 distribution in Krasnoyarsk Krai significantly differs from other cases of HIV-1 СRF63_02A1 rapid spreading in Novosibirsk Oblast, Tomsk Oblast, Kemerovo Oblast, and Altai Krai that were described earlier [

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In those Siberian regions, HIV-1 subtype A was predominant up to 2008–2012. HIV-1 СRF63_02A1 was spreading in those regions during local epidemic outbreaks that were accompanied by a multifold increase in morbidity among PWID. After that, further spreading of that HIV genetic variant was registered among HS partners of PWID, and currently, HIV-1 СRF63_02A1 is being registered among the whole population. Among newly diagnosed patients, HIV-1 СRF63_02A1 infection is registered in more than 80–85% of cases in these territories. Kemerovo Oblast is the only exception where the distribution of СRF63_02A1 was detected at the level of 74% already in 2014–2016, and in 21% of the cases, HIV-1 URF63/A infection was registered [
