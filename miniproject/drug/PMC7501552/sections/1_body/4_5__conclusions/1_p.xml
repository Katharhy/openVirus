<p>The study of the molecular epidemiological picture of HIV-1 distribution in Krasnoyarsk Krai enabled us for the first time since 2008 to register considerable changes in the features of the developing epidemic. Although subtype A (A6) remains predominant HIV-1 genetic variant, we detected not only transmission and distribution of previously rare HIV-1 genetic variants in Krasnoyarsk Krai but also the emergence of a large variety of new unique recombinant HIV-1 forms, which originated from viruses of subtypes А, В, СRF63_02A1, and CRF02_AG. Our study demonstrated a high frequency of HIV-1 reinfection for newly diagnosed HIV infection cases among Krasnoyarsk Krai population, suggesting that the region population, including PLHIV, is probably insufficiently informed on the negative impact of HIV-1 reinfection on the progress of the disease. Although general coverage of Krasnoyarsk Krai population with HIV testing is high, targeted HIV testing among people practicing risk behavior seems to be insufficient.</p>
