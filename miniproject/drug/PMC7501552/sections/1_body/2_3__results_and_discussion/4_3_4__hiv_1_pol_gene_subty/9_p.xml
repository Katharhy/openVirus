<p>The tropism was successfully predicted for 108 (67.9%) patients. In 91 cases (84.3%), virus tropism was predicted to coreceptor ССR5, and in 17 to СXCR4 (15.74%). Out of 17 СXCR4-tropic HIV-1, 14 belonged to subtype A, two to URF63/A, and one to CRF63_02A1. In 6 cases, HIV СXCR4-tropism was detected in patients infected in 1999–2013, in 5 cases in 2014–2016, and in 6 patients with HIV infection newly diagnosed in 2017. Four of them had not been tested for HIV earlier; their CD4 value varied from 305 to 603 cells per
