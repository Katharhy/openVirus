<p>Subtype-specific mutations were also detected in the HIV integrase region. In the case of subtype A virus, L74I was detected in 100% of the cases, while among CRF63_02A1 this substitution was detected only in 3%. Alone, L74M/I have minimal, if any, effect on INSTI sensitivity, but in combination with mutation Y143H/R/C L74I, causes reduction of HIV sensitivity to raltegravir [
