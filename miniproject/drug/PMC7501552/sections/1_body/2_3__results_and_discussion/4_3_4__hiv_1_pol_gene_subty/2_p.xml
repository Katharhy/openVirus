<p>For protease region of viruses CRF63_02A1, the presence of amino acid substitutions K20I and I64M was registered in all cases, whereas only one of the mutations, K20I, was found among HIV-1 subtype A, and it was detected in 2.3% of all cases. Substitution I64M is usual for the CRF02_AG genetic variant. Combination of mutations I64M and G17E in HIV protease is believed to be connected with the development of hypersensitivity to NFV, ATV, and IDV. K20I is the consensus amino acid in HIV-1 subtypes G and CRF02_AG.</p>
