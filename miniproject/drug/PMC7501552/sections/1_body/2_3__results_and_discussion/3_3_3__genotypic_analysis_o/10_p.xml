<p>The second patient Krasnoyarsk 74: a man infected via HS with HIV detected in 2010 was under ARVT for six years; data on compliance evaluation are absent. HIV-1 has a set of mutations (A62V, D67E, T69S_SA, L210W, T215F, K101E, V179F, Y181C, Y188L, V106I, and K238R) resulting in the development of high-level resistance to all NNRTIs and five NRTIs drugs except for emtricitabine and lamivudine, to which intermediate level resistance was detected. In addition to amino acid substitutions in positions connected with the emergence of TAMs, we discovered V179F in combination with Y181C in Krasnoyarsk 74 HIV variant. Such a combination of mutations is associated with high-level ETR and RPV resistance. Additionally, amino acid insertions were identified between codons 67 and 70 (T69S_SA). Together with TAMs, they are associated with high-level resistance to AZT, d4T, ddI, ABC, and TDF and intermediate to 3TC and FTC.</p>
