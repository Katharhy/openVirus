<p>Q151M in combination with accessory mutations at positions V75I confers high-level resistance to AZT, ddI, d4T, and ABC and intermediates resistance to TDF, 3TC, and FTC. V75M causes intermediate d4T resistance, low-level ddI resistance, and potentially low-level AZT resistance. L74I causes high-level resistance to ddI and intermediate resistance to ABC.</p>
