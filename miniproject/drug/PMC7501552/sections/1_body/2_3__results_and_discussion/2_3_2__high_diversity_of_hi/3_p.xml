<p>It is important to note that Krasnoyarsk subtype A HIV-1 variants are distributed in the phylogenetic tree within subtype A genetic cluster mixing with samples isolated in other Siberian territories. Several HIV-1 subtype A from Krasnoyarsk Krai formed separate subbranches that frequently aggregated viruses isolated from Krasnoyarsk residents PWID and HS patients who probably had sexual contacts with PWID but failed to know about it or to report that their partners might belong to PWID.</p>
