<p>For 159 (100%) HIV-1 samples, fragments encoding protease-reverse transcriptase (PR-RT), for 112 (70.4%) integrase (IN), and for 108 (57.9%) fragments encoding V3 region of the major envelope protein (
 <italic>env</italic>) were obtained. The obtained nucleotide HIV-1 sequences were used for genotyping by constructing phylogenetic trees using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method. Detection of potential recombinant events between virus subtypes was performed using specialized program resources (jpHMM, SimPlot software, RIP). The complex of data obtained during recombination and phylogenetic analyses was used for genotyping of 159 HIV-1 samples (
