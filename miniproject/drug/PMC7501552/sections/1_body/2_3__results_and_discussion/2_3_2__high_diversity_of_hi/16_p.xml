<p>Out of the three samples, HIV-1 similar to parent variants was reliably detected only for Krasnoyarsk 37, with Krasnoyarsk 37 origin being the result of their recombination. Recombinant analysis using selected reference sequences for HIV-1 Krasnoyarsk 115 and Krasnoyarsk 126 allowed reliable establishment only of the fact that Krasnoyarsk 37, 115, and 126 have a similar profile of recombination; in particular, it is an insertion of sequence that differed from subtype A with approximately the same length and location of recombination regions, which is observed in all HIV-1 samples in this group. For HIV-1 Krasnoyarsk 115 and Krasnoyarsk 126, reliable determination of the origin of the insertion was not possible.</p>
