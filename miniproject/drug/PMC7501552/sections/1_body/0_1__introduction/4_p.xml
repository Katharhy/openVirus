<p>In 1999â€“2001, a share of PWID among newly identified incidents of HIV infection in Krasnoyarsk Krai exceeded 95%. From 2002, Krasnoyarsk Krai has shown a decrease in the rate of HIV spreading among PWID; at the same time, PWID sexual partners became involved in the development of the epidemic process and this was reflected by the increase of heterosexual (HS) transmission route contribution in HIV spreading.</p>
