<p>Alternatively, some factors in PLWH might be protective for COVID-19. Antiretroviral therapy was suggested as a protective factor during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003 [

Some antiretroviral agents such as lopinavir/ritonavir are currently being tested for COVID-19 in major trials such as RECOVERY (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04381936) or SOLIDARITY (ISRCTN83971151). In-vitro studies have shown that some nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors used as anti-HIV therapy may inhibit the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [
