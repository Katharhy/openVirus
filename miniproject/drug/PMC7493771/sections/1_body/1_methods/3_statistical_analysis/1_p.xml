<p>We calculated absolute frequencies and proportions for categorical variables and median and interquartile range (IQR) or mean and SD for quantitative variables. No imputation was made for missing data. Fisher's exact or Chi-squared and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were used for comparisons. Standardized incidence rates of COVID-19 were estimated along with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a Poisson regression model with robust standard errors. The standardized incidence rate ratio represents the ratio of the number of observed COVID-19 cases in the cohort of PLWH to the number that would be expected if this cohort had the same age and sex-specific rates as in Barcelona. The number of new COVID-19 cases during the period of study was obtained from the Government of Catalonia registry [
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and the age and sex of Barcelona population from the Statistical Institute of Catalonia [
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. All tests were two-tailed and the significance level was set at 0.05. We used REDCap for data storage and STATA (version 15; Stata Corp LLC, College Station, Texas, USA) for statistical analyses.
