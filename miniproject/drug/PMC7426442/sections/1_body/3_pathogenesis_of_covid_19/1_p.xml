<p>The path followed by SARS-CoV-2 to reach the lungs is via the naso-oral cavity. Once the virus is inhaled, it enters the epithelial cells of the nasal cavity by engagement of ACE2 receptor with the viral RBD and initiates its replication (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). This initial asymptomatic phase lasts for about 1–2 days, during which the virus multiplies in the upper respiratory tract, where no major hindrance is caused by the innate immune cells. Within 2–14 days of initial encounter, the common symptoms of COVID-19 start to appear, which are similar to those of SARS and MERS, i.e., fever, dry cough, pharyngitis, shortness of breath, joint pain, and tiredness. Numerous problems arise during this phase of the disease, including nosocomial and fomite transmission of infection, which enhances the chances of community spread (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Soon, the virus begins to move toward the lower respiratory tract via airways, and this triggers a strong innate immune response. Patients at this stage start exhibiting enhanced pro-inflammatory response that leads to viral sepsis accompanied by other complications, including pulmonary edema, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), different organ failures, and death in the worst scenarios (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). The infected individuals rarely show the intestinal symptoms like diarrhea that were evident in other coronavirus infections. Patients are recommended to be quarantined to prevent community spread of this pandemic virus (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). The severity of COVID-19 has been found to be greater in aged individuals and in people with a health history, such as those immune-compromised by HIV infection or by chemotherapy for cancer. Diabetic and asthma patients, along with individuals with hypertension, obesity, or heart, kidney, or liver disorders, are also at higher risk if they acquire the disease (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Autopsy reports of individuals who died due to SARS show multi-organ dysfunction, with the highest viral titers in the lungs and immune cells in circulation, thus damaging the pulmonary and immune system (

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). As opposed to adults, only a very small population of children has been infected with SARS-CoV-2. In one study, the symptoms displayed by children above 15 years were found to be milder as compared to those of younger children, who showed severe symptoms but with rare deaths and better prognosis (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). The study speculated two major possibilities related to COVID-19 severity in children among different age groups. One of these rests on the finding that ACE2 activity is higher in children aged 4–13 years; after this age, it starts to decline until adolescence. This could be one of the reasons why lung fibrosis is observed mainly in younger children. Secondly, differential CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell populations have been seen in children as compared to adults (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). A large number of clinical and epidemiological criteria were defined to assess probable pediatric cases of COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). A preliminary report from a cross-sectional study of children admitted to US and Canadian Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) during March 14-April 3, 2020, revealed that the 48 children were admitted in the USA whereas no COVID-19 cases were reported in Canadian PICUs. The study revealed that there are fewer COVID-19 cases in children as compared to adults and that there is a median PICU time of 5 days (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). A recent preprint from Paris reports that 11 children (age 3.7–16.6) were admitted experiencing symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease (KD) along with gastrointestinal issues and elevated inflammatory markers. Further investigation suggested that they were also SARS-CoV-2-positive, speculating that this could be the reason for KD shock syndrome (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Similar cases have been observed in New York, where four otherwise healthy SARS-CoV-2-positive children started displaying symptoms similar to KD and toxic shock syndrome, thereby needing intensive care (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Therefore, medical practitioners should be prepared to tackle such sudden post-infection complications to avoid the associated risks.
