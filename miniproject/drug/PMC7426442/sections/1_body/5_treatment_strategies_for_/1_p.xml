<p>Just like SARS and MERS, there are no specific clinically approved drugs available for COVID-19 as of June 15, 2020 (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>). Currently, the treatment regime focuses mainly on providing intensive care in order to alleviate the symptoms and discomfort associated with COVID-19. Conservative fluid therapy accompanied by broad-spectrum antibiotics are also given to the patients as a protective measure to avoid opportunistic bacterial infections. However, ventilator support for respiration is provided to the patient under extreme conditions (

 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). But this approach may reduce the availability of these drugs and vaccines for the intended diseases and for the patients with the greatest need. The molecular, structural, and functional relationships of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV might define the use of existing anti-viral drugs against COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>), considering the total time it takes to perform clinical trials and get FDA approval for the use of novel drugs and vaccines. The increasing knowledge of the genetic, immunological, and molecular mechanisms behind its enhanced pathogenicity might help in developing specific treatment approaches for COVID-19 in the future.
