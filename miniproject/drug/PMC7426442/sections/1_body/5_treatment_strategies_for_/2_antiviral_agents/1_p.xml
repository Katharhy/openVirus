<p>Considering the studies on the molecular mechanism of coronavirus infection (
 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>), several antiviral drugs could be repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19. Remdesivir is a nucleotide analog that acts as an antiviral agent for a wide variety of viruses and has been tested widely against previous epidemics of coronavirus infections in both 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> models (

 <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>–
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>). This adenosine analog gets incorporated into the newly synthesized viral RNA, which inhibits the addition of further nucleotides by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and hence terminates the ongoing transcription. Administration of intravenous remdesivir was found to be effective in treating the first known patient of COVID-19 in the USA (
 <xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>). A randomized double-blinded clinical trial on 1,059 adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients was sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, USA, to further test the potency of intravenously administered remdesivir. The preliminary outcomes of the trial reported that remdesivir treatment decreased the median recovery time in the treatment group (11 days) as compared to the placebo group (15 days). The mortality rate was also less in the treatment group (7.1%) in contrast to the placebo group (11.9%) (
 <xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>). Numerous clinical studies, similar to this, are required so as to validate the proposed drugs for COVID-19. Favipiravir, ribavirin, and galidesivir are also potential nucleoside analogs that might be useful against novel coronavirus infection (
 <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>). The combinatorial therapy approach of using remdesivir along with chloroquine, a well-known anti-malarial drug, has also been tested 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> so as to study its effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B141" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>). It has been reported that chloroquine immuno-modulates the host microenvironment and also interferes with the replication of the virus and its interaction with the receptor (
 <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>). In a randomized clinical trial (NCT04308668) involving 821 asymptomatic individuals across the US and Canada who had come into close contact with potential COVID-19 patients, the individuals were given either hydroxychloroquine or placebo as a prophylactic measure. The results revealed that hydroxychloroquine treatment had the same effect as did the placebo group. The usage of hydroxychloroquine resulted in minor side effects (40.1%) as compared to the placebo treatment (6.8%). However, no cardiovascular disorder or treatment-related major complications were observed (
 <xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>). Based on the putative function of hydroxychloroquine on the endosomal acidification, whereby it is presumed to hinder viral uncapping, it can be observed that it has a great potential for prophylaxis, not to prevent infection but to reduce effective viral load in patients and thus lead to milder disease. Numerous clinical trials to further explore the usage of hydroxychloroquine in different combinations are in the pipeline and will finally provide a better understanding of the efficacy of this drug for COVID-19. A few anti-HIV drugs, such as lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta (IFN-β), have been tested 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> for treating coronavirus infections (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV) and have also been used in the case of COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>). Various complementary therapies could also be employed as a preventive measure against viral infections. Many essential proteases, such as chymotrypsin (3C-like protease) and PLpro, which are required by coronavirus for completing the replication process, can also be targeted using drugs. Cinanserin, flavonoids, and some small molecules are known to inhibit 3CLpro, whereas diarylheptanoids are used to inhibit PLpro (
 <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>–
 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>). In a recent study, 16 potential anti-HCoV drugs were identified through a systems biology-based approach, such as melatonin, mercaptopurine, sirolimus, dactiomycin, and toremifene, which are to be tested further for their potency (
