<p>The new technology of the microneedle array (MNA) has been employed for delivering SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccine, which could be really helpful in the treatment of the emerging COVID-19 outbreak (

A novel encapsulated mRNA vaccine candidate developed by ModernaTX, Inc. that encodes full length S protein of SARS-CoV-2, is also under clinical trial (NCT04283461). There is an urgent need to develop more such specific vaccines that could neutralize the novel coronavirus effectively (
