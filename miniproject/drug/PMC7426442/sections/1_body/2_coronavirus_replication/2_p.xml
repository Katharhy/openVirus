<p>Once the coronavirus is inside the host cell via membrane fusion, it releases its +ve ssRNA genome into the cytoplasmic compartment, where the translation of ORF-1a and ORF-1b begins resulting in the formation of two large polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab). Three functional proteases then cleave the polyproteins into 16 non-structural proteins (NSP1-16), which eventually create the viral RNA polymerase and other accessory proteins for virus assembly (

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). An uninterrupted replication-transcription event results in the formation of various nested sets of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs that eventually translate into numerous structural and accessory proteins (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The E glycoproteins after synthesis are incorporated into the rough endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi membrane. The +ve ssRNA combines with capsid protein to form the nucleocapsid, followed by budding of assembled virus particles in the ER-Golgi Intermediate Compartment (ERGIC) (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Lastly, the virus particle-loaded vesicles are fused with the cell membrane for effective shedding of the virus (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). These new virions are now accessible to infect the neighboring healthy cells and are also released into the surrounding environment via respiratory droplets that are highly contagious and hence potentially spread the disease to healthy individuals.
