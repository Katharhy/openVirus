<p>All coronaviruses initiate entry inside the target cell by engaging the host receptor with the S glycoprotein present on their surface so as to gain entry inside the target cell. The region of S protein containing the RBD is present on the S1 subunit. In a few coronaviruses, RBD is present at the N-terminus region of S1, whereas in SARS-CoV, it is situated at the C-terminus region (
