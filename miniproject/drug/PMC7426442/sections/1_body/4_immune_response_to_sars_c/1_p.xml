<p>Once the virus gains access inside the target cell, the host immune system recognizes the whole virus or its surface epitopes, eliciting the innate or adaptive immune response (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) present on immune cells, mainly Toll-like receptors 3, 7, and 8, are the first to identify the virus, which leads to enhanced interferon (IFN) production. The function of host innate immune cells is impaired during SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection by their non-structural proteins, which affects the overall cytokine production (

Humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be similar to that against other coronavirus infections, involving the characteristic IgG and IgM production. At the onset of SARS-CoV infection, B cells elicit an early response against the N protein, while antibodies against S protein could be detected after 4–8 days from the appearance of initial symptoms (

 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Although N protein is smaller than S protein, it is highly immunogenic, and the absence of glycosylation sites on it results in N-specific neutralizing antibody production at an early stage of acute infection (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). SARS-CoV-specific IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies were detected after the onset of symptoms at different time points in infected patients. A persistent level of IgG was detected for a longer period, whereas IgM levels started to decline after 3 months (

 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). In an observational case study of 16 SARS-CoV-2 patients, anti-S-RBD IgG was detected in all of the subjects, whereas anti-N IgG and anti-S-RBD IgM were detected in 15 patients and anti-N IgM in 14 patients (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). An ELISA-based time kinetics study to detect the COVID-19 specific humoral immune response showed that the patients produced IgM and IgG antibodies that did not cross-react with other human coronaviruses except SARS-CoV. IgM and IgA antibodies were detected 5 days after the onset of initial symptoms, whereas IgG was detected after 14 days (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). Another kinetic study of viral shedding and antibody detection was published in a preprint and reported the presence of higher IgG and IgM antibody titers in severe patients. They also observed that weak responders for IgG antibody had higher viral clearance than strong responders. This observation suggests that robust antibody response leads to disease severity while feeble response is associated with the elimination of virus (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). A case study on pediatric patients reports that 5 out of 6 children showed a protective humoral response, with neutralizing IgG and IgM antibodies targeting the N and S-RBD proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). These studies propose that IgM-based ELISA can be used for early diagnosis of patients along with qPCR techniques to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the technique.
