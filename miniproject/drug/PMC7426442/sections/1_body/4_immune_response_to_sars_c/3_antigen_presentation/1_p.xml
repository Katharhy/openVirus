<p>During viral infection, T cells also recognize the viral antigens presented by MHC class I [MHC; Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) in humans], which in turn promotes the cytokine release and cytotoxic activity of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). But in some other cases, MHC class II is also found to present SARS-CoV peptides to CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells. Due to the genetic polymorphism of HLA, some haplotypes, like HLA-B
 <sup>*</sup>07, HLA-B
 <sup>*</sup>46, HLA-DRB1
 <sup>*</sup>12 (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>), and HLA-Cw
 <sup>*</sup>08 (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>), are found to be more susceptible to coronavirus infection, whereas the HLA-DRB1
 <sup>*</sup>03, HLA-A
 <sup>*</sup>02, and HLA-Cw
 <sup>*</sup>15 haplotypes are protected from SARS-CoV infection (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). Similarly, HLA-DRB1
 <sup>*</sup>11 and HLA-DQB1
 <sup>*</sup>02 were found to be vulnerable to MERS-CoV infection (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). Additionally, MHC expression is also found to be reduced during the infection due to epigenetic modifications of downstream molecules (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). So far, HLA association is not very well-identified for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and this could be crucial for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. However, in a recent report, blood plasma from COVID-19 patients was able to block the expression of HLA-DR on CD14
 <sup>+</sup> monocytes, which was restored effectively on inhibiting IL-6, suggesting that decreased HLA-DR expression in SARS-CoV-2 patients is due to the buildup of hyper-inflammatory conditions (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). Decrease in MHC expression is also evident in cancer cells, which is a mechanism by which they evade the immune response by epigenetically modifying calnexin promoter. But infection with influenza virus in these cancer cells results in enhanced MHC-I presentation due to the increased expression of chromatin remodeling proteins, which stabilizes p53 expression and hence augments the immune surveillance of cancer cells (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). Therefore, molecules that can upregulate chromatin regulators and increase the MHC-I expression could potentially be used for COVID-19. Most of the T-cell epitopes presented by MHC complex are derived from structural proteins such as the S and N proteins of the coronavirus in both humans and animal models, while the NSPs have regulatory effects on the signaling cascade (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). T cells can be stimulated by 14 epitopes, most of which are observed to be located on ORF3 and the S protein in SARS patients (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). In a large cohort study during SARS-CoV infection, S protein was the only immuno-dominant epitope for CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell activation (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>), whereas, in MERS, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> response was against the S and N proteins along with some of the M/E epitopes (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). These T-cell epitopes have been tested in animal models by assessing the lung pathology and T-cell response upon infection in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). The sequence of SARS-CoV-2 being more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV, with no mutation in 19 epitopes, provides a prospective subunit vaccine for stimulating a strong T-cell response in COVID 19 patients (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). In a recent study, samples from 20 convalescing COVID-19 patients were analyzed to check the development of adaptive immune response during infection. The results highlighted that helper T cells were eliciting a robust immune response against S, M, and N protein. The effect of adaptive immune response on humoral immunity was also compared, where a strong CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2 eventually resulted in an increase in anti-S-RBD-specific IgG and IgA antibody titer. Along with CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, immunogenic epitopes on S, M, and N proteins were also able to activate CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells. However, such T-cell response was not specific to recovered patients only but was also present in 40â€“60% of the individuals who were not exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Further analysis showed that they had pre-existing cross-reactive CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, which might have been generated in response to some previous coronavirus infection. Hence, these T-cells could impart protective immunity in such individuals against SARS-CoV-2 to some extent (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). These epitopes could be a promising factor in developing immunotherapy by small molecules that can increase the presentation of viral epitopes.
