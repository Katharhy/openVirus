<p>Following viral/antigen clearance, most of the effector T cell undergoes apoptosis in the contraction phase. Subsequently, a pool of memory T cells are generated that are programmed to fight against re-infection. CD4
 <sup>+</sup> memory T cells, upon re-stimulation, trigger B cells and other immune cells by cytokine production, while cytotoxic memory T cells help in destroying the infected cells during subsequent infection (

 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>). Case studies in recovered SARS patients showed that both CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> memory T cells were efficient in eliciting immune response from 3 months to 6 years without the presence of any antigens (
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>). In a case study of 23 recovered SARS-CoV patients, the patients showed very low frequencies of memory B cells, while memory T cells elicited a response against the S protein in 60% of recovered individuals (
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>). Considering the memory T-cell subset, N-specific helper T cells had more of central memory markers (CD45RA
 <sup>−</sup>, CCR7
 <sup>+</sup>, CD62L
 <sup>−</sup>) while the CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell population had the effector memory (CD45RA
 <sup>+</sup>, CCR7
 <sup>−</sup>, CD62L
 <sup>−</sup>) phenotype in a steady-state manner (

In recent reports, COVID-19 subjects have shown reduced regulatory T cell populations and memory T cells, which may aggravate the inflammatory response leading to cytokine storm and hence enhance the tissue damage and organ failure (

 <sup>+</sup> memory T cells as a vaccine by the intranasal, but not the subcutaneous, route imparted a protective response against the human coronavirus. The infused CD4
 <sup>+</sup> memory T cell, upon re-stimulation, produces IFN-γ and recruits CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells for rapid clearance in response to SARS-S366 peptide (
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>). Recently, a human ACE-2-expressing mouse model has been developed by CRISPR/Cas9 technology that recapitulates the human symptoms upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 through the intra-nasal route. This tool will be beneficial for evaluating the efficacy of vaccines for COVID-19 and also to study its transmission and pathogenesis (
