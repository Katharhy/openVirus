<p>A rapid and coordinated immune response during viral infection leads to enhanced secretion of various cytokines, which acts as a defense mechanism against the virus. Numerous reports suggest that individuals affected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV have dysregulated cytokine production from both innate and adaptive immune cells. In the case of SARS, infected hematopoietic cell, monocyte-macrophages, and other immune cells trigger enhanced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-α/-γ, with reduced anti-inflammatory cytokines (

 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). Similarly, MERS-CoV infection leads to delayed but increased production of IFN-α and pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1β (

 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>). Such elevated levels of cytokines were associated with Multi-Organ Dysfunctional Syndrome (MODS) and ARDS due to the accumulation of numerous immune cells like macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells in the lungs causing alveolar damage and edema (

 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>). Similarly, in COVID-19 patients, secretion of cytokines and chemokines, which attract the immune cells to the lungs, was increased, hence causing ARDS, which is fatal to critically ill individuals (

 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>). Signature cytokines in severely ill COVID-19 patients were consistent with those in SARS and MERS, i.e., enhanced expression of IL-6, TNF-α, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α (MIP-1α), MCP3, GM-CSF, IL-2, and IP-10 along with elevated chemokines (IP-10, CCL2/MCP1, CXCL1, CXCL5) were also detected in SARS-CoV-2 infection (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>–
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>). In children, the increased inflammatory markers include IL-6, IL-1, and C-reactive protein along with procalcitonin in serum (

 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>). Transcriptomic analysis of PBMC and BALF showed that a number of immune regulators were upregulated, particularly CXCL10, with respect to BALF. This study also reported that several apoptotic genes and P53 signaling molecules were upregulated, suggesting a possible reason for lymphopenia in these patients (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>). Therapeutic measures to control such cytokines involve neutralizing antibodies or small molecular drugs that can stop the signaling cascade for cytokine production.
