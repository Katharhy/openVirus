<p>Initial genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has shown that it is genetically similar to previously known coronavirus SARS-CoV and hence is placed under the family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>. Coronavirus contains positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ve ssRNA) as its genetic material, which can be about 30 kb in length and is mostly protected by an outer fatty layer of an envelope that also helps the virus to evade host immune response and assists its entry inside the host cell (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The subfamily 
 <italic>Coronavirinae</italic> is further subdivided into four genera, namely alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta- coronavirus (α-CoV, β-CoV, γ-CoV, and δ-CoV). Viruses having the potential to infect humans are placed under the genus α-CoV and β-CoV (SARS-CoV &amp; MERS-CoV), whereas viruses of γ-CoV and δ-CoV genera are mostly known to infect avians and pigs (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 falls under the genus β-CoV, as it shares 88% sequence identity with SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses (derived from bat) but is only 79% identical to SARS-CoV and 50% identical to MERS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Thus, it can be deduced by its genome identity that the immediate host of this virus could be a bat, which then transmitted it to some unknown intermediate host that acted as a source for the transmission of the virus to humans.
