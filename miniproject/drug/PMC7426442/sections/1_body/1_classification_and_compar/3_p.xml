<p>Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2, similar to SARS-CoV, exploits the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain access inside human cells, whereas MERS-CoV binds specifically to Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Binding of the virus particle to the specific receptor on the host cell plays a key role in governing its pathogenicity. Functional evaluation was carried out to reveal the potential receptors for different Betacoronaviruses (β-CoV) including SARS-CoV-2, and it was found out that the entry of the virus particle was enhanced in human cells expressing ACE2 receptor instead of DPP4 or Aminopeptidase N (APN) in the case of the novel coronavirus (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The latest reports suggest that the trimeric S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is sliced by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), similar to SARS-CoV (

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Hence, profound knowledge of the potential receptors to which the virus particle can bind and its associated proteases will help us in designing specific antiviral drugs and neutralizing antibodies and will lead us to foresee whether particular coronaviruses of zoonotic origin could be able to adapt and infect humans.
