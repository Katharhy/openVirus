<p>For example, in the case of the gliptins’ initial target DPP-4, a great number of tyrosine amino acids are present at the active site. As shown in the case of teneligliptin, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02529-f006">Figure 6</xref>, the amino acids Tyr586, Phe355, Tyr667, Tyr667, Ty548, and Tyr632 are involved in hydrophobic and pi interactions with distances among them varying between 8 Å and 19 Å. The amino acids Arg123, Glu203, Glu204, Ser631, Tyr633 and Asn711 are involved in polar interactions and hydrogen bond formation. All hydrophobic interactions originate from amino acids oriented at the same moiety of the active site, while the amino acids participating in polar interaction are placed in the other moiety. Distances, between 11 and 18 Å are observed between amino acids of the active site participating in polar and hydrophobic interactions. The length of the molecules, the great number of polar and hydrophobic groups, the flexibility of the molecules and the appropriate distances between characteristic groups seem to favor binding of gliptins at the Mpro active site. A higher binding energy was estimated for the smaller molecule alogliptin (
