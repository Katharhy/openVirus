<p>In general, there is a great variety between the groups placed at the S1 or S2 subsites of the enzyme, as concluded by our results and the literature [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-02529" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Most of the amino acids involved in complex stabilization of the natural substrate and the peptide analogues [

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-02529" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] participate in interactions with the studied compounds as well. However, the substantial interaction with His163 in peptidomimetic complexes is not observed in the interaction pattern of the most potent compounds. Different structures may offer the possibility of interaction with the crucial amino acids of the SARS-CoV-2 active site contributing to complex stability. However, the right distances between polar, Hd/a, hydrophobic/aromatic moieties constitute important features of each structure.
