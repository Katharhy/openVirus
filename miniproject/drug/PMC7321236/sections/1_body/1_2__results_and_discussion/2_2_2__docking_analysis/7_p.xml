<p>The SARS-CoV-2 protease preferentially cleaves its substrate after Gln which follows Leu and before a Ser or Ala or Gly amino acid (Leu-Gln â†“ Ser/Ala/Gly). The Gln amino acid, at the P1 position of the substrate, is an amino acid with a relatively long side chain leading to a polar amide group with hydrogen donor/acceptor possibility. As shown by studies of complexes of the Mpro enzyme with substrate analogues [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-02529" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], Gln is placed in vicinity to Cys145, at the subsite S1 of the active center, surrounded by the side chains of the amino acids Asn142, Glu166, His163, and His172 and the main chains of Phe140 and Leu141. The P2 amino acid, Leu, has a relatively long, hydrophobic but not bulky or aromatic side chain. The side chain of Leu is inserted at the S2 subsite, which consists of the side chains of the amino acids His41, Met49, Tyr54 and Met165 placed in vicinity to Asp187. The P4 amino acid of the peptide interacts with the amino acids Met165, Leu167, Phe185, and Gln192 and the main chain of Gln189.
