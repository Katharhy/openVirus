<p>Docking analysis was performed using the SARS-CoV-2 structure 6LU7. The results were promising for most of the compounds, with the exception of the ACE and renin inhibitors, captopril and aliskiren, for which the calculated free binding energy was −5.17 and −4.66 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02529-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). According to our previous experience and to the literature, a free binding energy higher than −5.5 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup> is an indication that the compound is inactive [
