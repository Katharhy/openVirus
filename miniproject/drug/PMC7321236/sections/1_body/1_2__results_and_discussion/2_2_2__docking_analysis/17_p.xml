<p>According to docking analysis, all active molecules are long enough to interact simultaneously with amino acids surrounding Glu166, Cys145 and amino acids in the vicinity of Thr25 and His41 and contain several hydrophobic and aromatic moieties as well as hydrogen bond donor/acceptor groups capable of hydrogen bond formation and polar interactions. The enzyme amino acids involved in hydrogen bond formation are Glu166, Pro168, Gln189, Arg188, Thr24, Thr25, Thr26, His41, Cys44, Ser46, Asn142, Gly143, Cys145, His164, Thr190, and Glu192 (
