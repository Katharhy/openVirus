<p>The best results were obtained for the HCV protease inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir, with free binding energies of −10.05 and −9.16 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, followed by the thrombin inhibitor argatropan and the DPP-4 inhibitor, sitagliptin, with free binding energies of −9.03 and −8.80 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The HIV-1 protease inhibitors ritonavir and lopinavir showed a little lower predicted activity, with free binding energies of −8.96 and −8.65 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Docking analysis to the whole enzyme indicated that the enzyme active site is the second preferred binding site of lopinavir, ritonavir and boceprevir. According to this observation, the expected inhibitory action of these compounds is to be lower than that predicted based on their binding energy to the active site [

 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively.
