<p>In betrixaban, the chloropyridin moiety is placed at the S1 subsite, interacting via halogen bonds with the amino acids Glu166, Phe140 and Leu141 and via hydrophobic interactions with Cys145. In addition, a hydrogen bond is formed between Cys145 and the 
 <italic>N</italic> of the amide bridge connecting the chloropyridin-2yl and the methoxybenzyl rings of the molecule. His41 of the S2 subsite forms pi interactions with the carbons of the methoxyphenyl ring. The 
 <italic>N</italic>,
 <italic>N</italic>-dimethylbenzimidamide moiety, placed in the area of the S4 subsite, strongly contributes to complex stabilization via the hydrophobic interaction between Met165 and the phenyl ring as well as by hydrogen bond formation between the amino acids Arg188, Thr190 and Gln192 and the 
 <italic>N</italic> of the 
 <italic>N</italic>,
 <italic>N</italic>-dimethylbenzimidamide moiety (
