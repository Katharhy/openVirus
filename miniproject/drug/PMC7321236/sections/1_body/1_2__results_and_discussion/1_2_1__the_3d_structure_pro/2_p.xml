<p>Significant 3D similarity was found between the SARS-CoV-2 and the HCV protease (

 <sup>−4</sup>) as well as between the SARS-CoV-2 protease and α-thrombin (
 <italic>p</italic> = 7.42 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>). Interestingly, the protein parts with increased structural alignment included the catalytic area of the enzyme. The lowest similarity was observed in the case of angiotensin-converting enzyme and coagulation Factor Xa (
