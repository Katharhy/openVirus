<p>In all cases, during enzyme preparation, the inhibitor of the initial enzyme complex was abstracted, and the pH was set at 7.0 for ligand preparation. For the evaluation of the docking method, the initial ligand was docked to the enzyme and the position was compared with its initial position at the complex. Examples of the similarity of the two positions are shown at
