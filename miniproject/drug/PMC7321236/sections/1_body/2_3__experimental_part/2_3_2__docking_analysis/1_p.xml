 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-02529" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], as previously described [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-02529" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) and the Solis and Wets local search method [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-02529" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] were used for the docking simulation. During docking, all rotatable torsions were released. AutoDock parameter set- and distance-dependent dielectric functions were used in the calculation of the van der Waals and the electrostatic terms, respectively—100 different runs that were set to terminate after a maximum of 2,500,000 energy evaluations were performed in each docking experiment. The population size was set to 150. A translational step of 0.2 Å, and quaternion and torsion steps of 5 were applied during the search. Docking analysis of the HCV protease and the HIV-1 protease presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02529-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> was performed using Autodock4.2. via Ligandscout. Among the values calculated by the program is the estimated free binding energy, which is an indicator of the probability of the compounds to form a stable complex with the selected enzyme target and consequently the probability to be effective enzyme inhibitors.
