<p>The 3D structure alignment of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease with the HIV-1 and HCV viral proteases as well as with the human proteases DPP-4, thrombin, coagulation Factor Xa, renin and ACE showed greater similarity with the HCV protease and with thrombin. This finding, in combination with the fact that these two proteases preferentially cleave before Ser like SARS-CoV-2 protease, enhances the possibility of finding effective SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors among the approved anti-HCV protease and anti-thrombin inhibitors. Docking analysis of 34 approved or phase III trial protease inhibitors to the SARS-CoV-2 protease revealed several drugs that may act as SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors, within the classes of the HCV protease, DPP-4, α-thrombin and coagulation Factor Xa inhibitors. Twenty five of them exhibited estimated binding energy lower than the reference inhibitor N3, and twenty one lower than −8.00 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>. Several of the most promising compounds are approved drugs characterized as well tolerated in subjects. Compared to lopinavir and ritonavir, most of the evaluated compounds showed better results, as characterized by lower predicted free binding energy and high preference for binding to the active site compared to other sites of the enzyme. These promising in silico results encourage further evaluation for in vitro and in vivo anti-viral activity. The DPP-4 inhibitors developed for the treatment of type II diabetes, as well as α-thrombin and Factor Xa inhibitors used as anti-coagulants, may not be appropriate for patients who do not suffer such problems but may be useful for patients who need such treatment. It is worth mentioning that diabetic patients belong to the high-risk group for this virus, while anti-coagulant therapy has been proposed for COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia.
