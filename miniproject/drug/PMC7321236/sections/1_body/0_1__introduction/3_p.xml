<p>Due to the urgent need for effective drugs to attenuate the disease, and the long-lasting process of novel drug development, researchers are focusing on “drug repositioning”. Among the drugs approved or developed for other purposes that have been proposed for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and are under clinical trials, most are enzyme inhibitors, targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) or the protease of the virus. Among them, favipinavir, ribavirin, remdesivir and galidesivir act as RDRP inhibitors while lopinavir, ritonavir [
