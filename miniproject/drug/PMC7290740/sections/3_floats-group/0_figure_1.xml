   <italic>Caesalpinia decapetala</italic> (Roth) Alston (EEC) inhibits influenza virus replication in A549 cells. A549 cells were infected with influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) at an multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.25 in the presence or absence of serially diluted EEC. Cells were then incubated at 37 Â°C for 48 h. Cell viabilities were detected by cytotoxicity assay using Cell Titer-Glo reagent (
   <bold>A</bold>). The inhibitory effects of EEC on virus replication were determined based on the reduction on NA levels using NA activity assay (A), the production of infectious virions determined by TCID
   <sub>50</sub> Assay (
   <bold>B</bold>), and the expression of M2 determined by IFA using the antibody against virus matrix protein 2 (M2) (
   <bold>C</bold>).
