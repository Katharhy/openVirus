  <p>EEC protects mice from lethal influenza virus infection. Six-week-old female BALB/c mice weighing 16–18 g were infected with 4 LD
   <sub>50</sub> of H1N1 PR8 virus intranasally. Three hours after infection, four groups of mice (10 mice in each group) were treated intraperitoneally with 60, 30, 15 mg/kg/d of EEC or placebo solution respectively for five consecutive days. Survival rate (
   <bold>A</bold>) and body weight loss (
   <bold>B</bold>–
   <bold>D</bold>) were monitored daily until day 18 post-infection. Lung lavage fluids (BALFs) from the infected mice treated with 60 mg/kg/d of EEC were collected on days 3 and 7 post-infection to monitor virus titers (
   <bold>E</bold>), and total cell counts (
   <bold>F</bold>) (mean ±SEM). The data are representative of three independent experiments. (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3 per group at each time point). *
