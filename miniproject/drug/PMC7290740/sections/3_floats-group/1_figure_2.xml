  <p>EEC has a broad spectrum of antiviral activities against influenza viruses in A549 cells. A549 cells were infected with influenza viruses A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1), A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1, H274Y oseltamivir-resistant), A/human/Hubei/1/2009 (H1N1), A/human/Hubei/3/2005 (H3N2), A/duck/Hubei/216/1983 (H7N8) and B/human/Hubei/1/2007 (IBV) at an MOI of 0.25. Serially diluted EEC was added at the same time during the virus infection. The cells were then incubated at 37 Â°C for 48 h. Cell viabilities and inhibition rates were determined by Cell Titer-Glo and NA activity assay, respectively. The dose-response curves of EEC against different influenza viruses were made using Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).</p>
