<p>Herb medicine has a long history of being used to treat the flu. Many studies have identified bioactive components or compounds in plant extracts that may be useful for treating influenza. A variety of polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, essential oils, and aromatic compounds isolated from medicinal plants and plant extracts have been extensively studied and tested for anti-influenza activity [

Utsunomiya et al. found that glycyrrhizin, an active component of licorice roots, could protect mice exposed to a lethal H2N2 virus through the stimulation of IFN-gamma production by T cells. Glycyrrhizin, by itself, does not inhibit influenza virus replication [

 <italic>Commelina communis</italic>. However, it is less potent than glycyrrhizin in increasing survival rate, though they both can lower the virus titer in the lung of mice for about one log value. When compared to the clinical drug oseltamivir, EEC showed less potency both in increasing survival rate and in lowering virus titer.
