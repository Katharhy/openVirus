<p>Next, the therapeutic effect of EEC was tested on a mouse influenza model. Our results demonstrated that EEC protected mice from lethal influenza infection by increasing the survival rate that is associated with decreased virus titer, cell infiltration, and inflammatory damage to the lung. We assume that the antiviral activity of EEC contributes mainly to the therapeutic effect. Furthermore, a preliminary mechanism study revealed that EEC inhibits the neuraminidase activity and interferes with the late stage of the virus life cycle. It is worth noting that when extracted with pure H
 <sub>2</sub>O or ethanol, the extract of 
 <italic>C. decapetala</italic> exhibits different antiviral activity and cytotoxicity from that extracted with 75% aqueous ethanol (data not shown). This observation suggests that the extraction methods can influence the efficacy of EEC on its antiviral activity and cytotoxicity. Further optimization of the extraction method for anti-influenza drug development is needed.
