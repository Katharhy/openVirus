 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Among them, artemisinin, one of the most famous drugs, was extracted from 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> and has been used to treat malaria [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To explore the potential of plant extracts in the treatment of influenza, we collected 600 species of plants from Shen Long Jia, Hubei province, China. By screening the extract library comprising the ethanol extracts of the 600 plants in a U937 cell model against influenza virus infection [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], we found that the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>Caesalpinia decapetala</italic> (Roth) Alston (EEC) has antiviral activity against influenza virus infection. 
 <italic>Caesalpinia decapetala</italic> (Roth) Alston (
 <italic>C. decapetala</italic>) is a climbing shrub, belonging to the 
 <italic>Caesalpinia</italic> genus of the Fabaceae family, which is distributed all over the world [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Chemical investigations revealed that EEC contains a variety of components, such as cassane diterpenoid, spathulenol, lupeol, resveratrol, quercetin, stigmasterol, astragalin, and sitosterol [

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The extract of 
 <italic>C. decapetala</italic> has been reported to have analgesic, anti-oxidant, anti-tumor, and anti-fertility activities [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The roots of 
 <italic>C. decapetala</italic> are used as a folk medicine to prevent colds, treat bronchitis, and malaria [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the extract of 
 <italic>C. decapetala</italic> has never been demonstrated experimentally to have antiviral activity.
