<p>For the antiviral assay, cells were plated and infected with the influenza virus in the presence or absence of the drug. After incubation at 37 °C for 48 h, the inhibition of viral replication was measured by the modified neuraminidase activity (NA) assay (Ivachtchenko et al., 2013). The fluorescence intensity was measured with a multi-label plate reader (Wallac Envision, PerkinElmer, MA, USA) and was expressed as the 50% effective (inhibitory) concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>). For detection of the production of infectious virus virions, the supernatants, harvested 48 h post-infection (hpi), were titrated through the TCID
 <sub>50</sub> assay, and the virus titers were calculated according to the method of Spearman–Karber [
