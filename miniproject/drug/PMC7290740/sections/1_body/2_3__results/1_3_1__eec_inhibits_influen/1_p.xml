<p>To screen for natural products of plants with anti-influenza activity, we made ethanol extracts of about 600 plant species from Shen Nong Jia, Hubei province, China. By screening these plant extracts, we found that the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>C. decapetala</italic> (EEC) inhibits the replication of the influenza virus on A549 cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00557-f001">Figure 1</xref>A, EEC inhibited the H1N1 influenza virus PR8 strain infection on A549 cells, with a CC
 <sub>50</sub> and an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 326.4 μg/mL and 9.8 μg/mL, respectively. The inhibition of virion production was also tested, as can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00557-f001">Figure 1</xref>B; the results showed that EEC inhibited the production of infectious virions potently and concentration-dependently. At concentrations higher than 43 μg/mL, the production of infectious influenza virions was below the detection limit (10 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL). The EC
 <sub>50</sub> of EEC is about 14 μg/mL. To exclude the possible cytotoxic effect of EEC on virus replication, we used the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) method to measure the cell viability by DAPI staining and to confirm the inhibitory effect by detection of the expression of M2 protein. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00557-f001">Figure 1</xref>C, EEC at 43.2 μg/mL and 14.4 μ g/mL inhibited the virus replication completely and about 50%, respectively, which is consistent with that measured by virus production. Importantly, the DAPI staining showed that EEC at these concentrations is not cytotoxic to A549 cells. In conclusion, we demonstrated that EEC inhibits influenza virus replication on A549 cells.
