<p>When mice are infected with the influenza virus, a large number of inflammatory cells are often infiltrated in the lung tissue, accompanied by enhanced inflammatory injuries in the lung [

 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To examine the total cell infiltration and pathological changes in the lungs of mice infected by lethal influenza and treated or untreated with EEC, the total cell counting in the BALFs and H&amp;E staining of the lung tissue of mice were conducted. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00557-f004">Figure 4</xref>F, the total number of cells at day 3 and 7 in BALFs of mice treated with 60 mg/kg/d of EEC decreased by 40% and 25%, respectively. A further pathological examination by H&amp;E staining revealed that the pathogenic damage in the lungs treated with EEC improved significantly at day 3 and 7 post-infection (
