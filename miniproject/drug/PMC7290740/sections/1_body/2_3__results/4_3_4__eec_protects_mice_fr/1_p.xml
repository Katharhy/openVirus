<p>To further study the therapeutic effect of EEC in vivo, BALB/c mice weighing about 18 g were infected with four LD
 <sub>50</sub> of H1N1 PR8 virus by the method of intranasal. After 3 h of infection, each group of mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10) was treated with 60, 30, and 15 mg/kg/d of EEC or placebo solution. The mice of the placebo group began to die on day 7, and all died on day 10 after infection. Compared with the placebo group, the mice treated with 60 mg/kg/d of EEC lost weight relatively slow and began to gain weight significantly after day 10, with a survival rate of 40% (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00557-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,C,D). Whereas treatment with the reference drug oseltamivir at 20 mg/kg/d protected 80% of mice from death caused by the same lethal dose of PR8 virus infection. These observations suggest that EEC protects mice from lethal influenza virus infection.
