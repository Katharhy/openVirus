In an effort to understand the dynamics of this disease, we propose a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based model. We train our model on more than four months of cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths. Our model can be adjusted based on the parameters in order to provide predictions as needed. We provide results at both the country and county levels. We also perform a quantitative comparison of mitigation measures in various counties in the United States based on the rate of difference of a short and long window parameter of the proposed LSTM model. The analyses provided by our model can provide valuable insights based on the trends in the rate of infections and deaths. This can also be of help for countries and counties deciding on mitigation and reopening strategies.

We focus on discussing related work with regard to COVID-19 disease dynamics, especially studies involving simulations and computational learning algorithms.</p><p id="p0015">Several studies have focused on projections of how the infections are likely to spread based on statistical analyses. Neher et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> have proposed a seasonal transmissability model based on SIR <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, a class of mathematical epidemiological models to predict the trajectory of the virus re-infecting sub-populations in the world in future years. They have taken into account the infection, emigration, and population turnover rates respectively as part of their proposed model. A refined version of their model <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> considers visualizing the projected hospital resources necessary in order to support a pandemic like COVID-19.</p><p id="p0016">Another similar hospital impact model CHIME (COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics) developed by Penn Medicine <xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> suggests the projection of the hospitalized, ICU (Intensive Care Unit), and ventilated patients respectively for Penn hospitals. They have used a statistical model based on measures like social contact, hospitalization rate, and probability of detection.</p><p id="p0017">With regard to COVID-19, there have been several machine learning based models proposed by various research teams globally in an effort to understand the different facets of COVID-19.</p><p id="p0018">Hu et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> proposed a machine learning model based on stacked auto-encoders to forecast cumulative COVID-19 cases in China till April 2020 based on past cumulative data.

They have trained an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model with an architecture composed of three hidden layers on the TCM prescriptions used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. They have also tested the validity of their OSPF model to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of use of TCM prescriptions for other flu-like diseases as a potential source of treatments for COVID-19. Their proposed model classifies a given TCM prescription as &#x02018;Safe&#x02019; or &#x02018;Unsafe&#x02019;. They have identified seven TCM prescriptions that should take precedence over others while treating COVID-19 patients.</p><p id="p0021">Wang et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> have proposed BI-AT-GRU, a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) based model with bidirectionality and attention in order to classify six different respiratory patterns. They have specifically observed that abnormal breathing patterns in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 arise significantly due to Tachypnea, which is characterised as abnormally rapid and shallow breathing. They show that their proposed model is able to distinguish respiratory patterns of &#x02018;Tachypnea&#x02019;, &#x02018;Central-Apnea&#x02019;, &#x02018;Bradypnea&#x02019;, &#x02018;Eupnea&#x02019;, &#x02018;Cheyne-Stokes&#x02019;, and &#x02018;Biots&#x02019; with high F-1 scores.</p><p id="p0022">Song et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> have proposed a deep learning model for studying CT (Computer Tomography) images of COVID-19 patients. They collected lung CT images from COVID-19 patients, bacterial pneumonia patients, and healthy people from two hospitals in China.

Statistical learning models require thorough understanding of data and coefficient tuning in order to fit models suitable for prediction. However, compared to statistical learning, machine learning approaches involve allowing the model to automatically learn complex patterns from the data based on the model constructed and tuned hyperparameters. This is particularly useful for handling epidemiological time-series data like that of COVID-19 where the cumulative curves of infections and deaths vary with respect to time and place.</p></sec><sec id="sec0003"><label>3</label><title>Proposed method</title><p id="p0027">Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), originally proposed by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber <xref rid="bib0036" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, are a special kind of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that have the ability of capturing long-term dependencies. In this paper, we apply LSTMs to study the disease dynamics of COVID-19, specifically in forecasting cumulative cases and deaths. Most importantly, the capabilities of LSTMs allow us to gain a deeper understanding of where the model stands in terms of future predictions and will serve as an aid in taking important healthcare and mitigation measures.</p><sec id="sec0004"><label>3.1</label><title>Dataset</title><p id="p0028">For the purpose of training, validation and testing, we utilize data from the Johns Hopkins University repository <xref rid="bib0037" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. For experimental purposes, we consider data over the period from January 22, to June 30. The dataset provides time-series data of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. We separately consider each of these scenarios, as well as look into more fine-grained data at the county-level in order to analyse the effectiveness of mitigation measures.</p><p id="p0029">Separating time series data into train, validation, and test sets requires care since all the temporal relations have to be maintained. Since COVID-19 is an infectious viral disease, it spreads over time. This means that we can predict the infections/deaths at a particular point of time based on preceding values. It is also essential to monitor the generalization capabilities of the model and select hyperparameters for the model accordingly. In order to handle this, we partition the data based on time for training and validation as shown in <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>

The smaller splits of train and validation sets are approximately maintained at a 60:20 ratio. Intuitively, an increase in the <italic>lookback</italic> and <italic>lookahead</italic> parameters reduces the number of training samples and testing samples respectively and leads to erroneous results. For experimentation purposes, we test <italic>lookback</italic> in the range of 1 and 7 and <italic>lookahead</italic> in the range of 5 and 7 for reasonable future predictions, while adhering to the index constraints on individual train, validation, and test data.</p></sec><sec id="sec0005"><label>3.2</label><title>Model design</title><p id="p0031">For the proposed LSTM model, Keras <xref rid="bib0038" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> was used as the framework with TensorFlow as backend.</p><p id="p0032">In all our experiments, we train the LSTM for 10,000 epochs with 10 layers and a batch size of 10.
