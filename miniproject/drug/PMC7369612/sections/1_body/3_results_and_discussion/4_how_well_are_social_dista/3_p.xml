 <xref rid="fig0028" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 28</xref> shows the various plots evaluating the trends of mitigation measures on rates of COVID-19 infections and deaths in eight affected counties in the United States: (a) Los Angeles, California, (b) Dallas, Texas, (c) Hillsborough, Florida, (d) Maricopa, Arizona, (e) King, Washington, (f) Fulton, Georgia, (g) Cook, Illinois, and (h) New York City, New York. The best_fit plots indicate the line of best fit in each figure while the LSTM_rate plots indicate the computed rate of difference of the two LSTM models as previously discussed. The line of best fit is of further interest as it provides valuable interpretations on how well the mitigation measures are working.
