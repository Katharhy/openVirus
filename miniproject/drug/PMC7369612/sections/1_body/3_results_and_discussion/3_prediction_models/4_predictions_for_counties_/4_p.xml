 <xref rid="fig0014" ref-type="fig">Figs.Â 14</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">15</xref> show the predictions for cases and deaths respectively in Dallas, Texas. Cases and deaths show a rising trend by the end of June, as shown by the actual and predicted plots. Stronger mitigation measures are also required here as the actual cases show a divergence over the LSTM predicted values.
