 <xref rid="fig0018" ref-type="fig">Figs.Â 18</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig0019" ref-type="fig">19</xref> show predictions for cases and deaths respectively in Maricopa, Arizona. The plots show a rise in cases in the month of June. The divergence between the actual and predicted values towards the end of June for both the predictions and deaths indicates that the mitigation measures have not worked.
