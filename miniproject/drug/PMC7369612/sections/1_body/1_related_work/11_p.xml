 <xref rid="bib0033" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> have proposed a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) based model ‘Inception Migration Neuro Network’ to identify the radiographical features in volumetric chest CT images of patients obtained from two medical institutions in China. The aim of their proposed model is to identify whether COVID-19 is present or not in the CT images of the patients. They have evaluated AUC and F-1 metrics on their model and have claimed that their method is not invasive and is low cost.
