 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> have proposed an “Ontology-based Side-effect Prediction Framework (OSPF)” for evaluating the “Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)” model using deep learning. They have trained an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model with an architecture composed of three hidden layers on the TCM prescriptions used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. They have also tested the validity of their OSPF model to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of use of TCM prescriptions for other flu-like diseases as a potential source of treatments for COVID-19. Their proposed model classifies a given TCM prescription as ‘Safe’ or ‘Unsafe’. They have identified seven TCM prescriptions that should take precedence over others while treating COVID-19 patients.
