 <xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> have proposed BI-AT-GRU, a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) based model with bidirectionality and attention in order to classify six different respiratory patterns. They have specifically observed that abnormal breathing patterns in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 arise significantly due to Tachypnea, which is characterised as abnormally rapid and shallow breathing. They show that their proposed model is able to distinguish respiratory patterns of ‘Tachypnea’, ‘Central-Apnea’, ‘Bradypnea’, ‘Eupnea’, ‘Cheyne-Stokes’, and ‘Biots’ with high F-1 scores.
