<p id="p0027">Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), originally proposed by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 
 <xref rid="bib0036" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, are a special kind of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that have the ability of capturing long-term dependencies. In this paper, we apply LSTMs to study the disease dynamics of COVID-19, specifically in forecasting cumulative cases and deaths. Most importantly, the capabilities of LSTMs allow us to gain a deeper understanding of where the model stands in terms of future predictions and will serve as an aid in taking important healthcare and mitigation measures.
