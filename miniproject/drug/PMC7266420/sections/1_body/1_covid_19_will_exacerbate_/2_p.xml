<p id="Par3">Global evidence suggests that up to 86% of women living with HIV have experienced some form of gender-based violence in their lifetime [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This is concerning, as experiences of IPV among women living with HIV have been associated with barriers to HIV care, including lower levels of treatment adherence, and a reduced likelihood of achieving viral suppression [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, recent Canadian data suggests that historical experiences of severe IPV, where women have reported lifetime histories of multiple forms (e.g. sexual, physical and emotional) of IPV, may increase women living with HIV’s likelihood of dying [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A growing body of literature suggests that experiences of violence may alter women’s important immune mediators, thereby increasing one’s risk to STIs, HIV, as well as women living with HIV’s ability to suppress HIV in the body [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Thus, the negative physical health effects of IPV among women living with and at risk of HIV may be in part due to biological responses to violence and trauma.
