<p id="Par1">During the current COVID-19 crisis, countries globally are telling citizens to stay home. But what happens when home is not a safe place?

In the United States, which as of June 1st has the largest COVID-19 epidemic globally, police data in a number of different jurisdictions that have implemented ‘stay home’ regulations have indicated increases in domestic violence reports ranging from 10% in New York City, to 27% in Jefferson County, Alabama [

Our response to COVID-19 must not repeat the violations to women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights that occurred during previous pandemic responses, including the 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak, whereby women were denied access to violence support and sexual and reproductive health services, which overwhelmed the judicial system, and resulted in a 75% increase in maternal mortality [
