It was reported that a study (published online 04th February 2020) was carried out by a Chinese group on the effect of chloroquine in vitro, using Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 has a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05. The study demonstrated that chloroquine was very effective in reducing viral replication, with an effective concentration (EC) 90 of 6.90 μM which can be easily achievable with standard dosage, thanks to its favorable penetration in tissues, including in the lungs [

The authors described that chloroquine is known to block viral infection by increasing endosomal pH and by interfering with the glycosylation of the SARSCoV cellular receptor. The authors also speculated on the possibility that the known immunomodulating effect of the drug could improve the antiviral effect in vivo [
