<p id="p0045">The Center of Disease control (CDC), in a public document on its website published on 21st March 2020, informed that there are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. At present clinical management includes infection prevention and control measures and supportive care, including supplementary oxygen and mechanical ventilator support when indicated. An array of drugs approved for other indications as well as several investigational drugs are being studied in several hundred clinical trials that are underway across the globe [

Very recent studies have tested and shown the effectiveness and use of two drugs (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) for the treatment of COVID-19 disease. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are oral prescription drugs that have been used for treatment of malaria and certain inflammatory conditions. Chloroquine has been used for malaria treatment and chemoprophylaxis, and hydroxychloroquine is used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and porphyria cutanea tarda. WHO includes it on its list of essential medicines, meaning it should be kept affordable and accessible at all times. Both drugs have in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and other coronaviruses, with hydroxychloroquine having relatively higher potency against SARS-CoV-2 [

According to Colson etÂ al., 2020 the activity of hydroxychloroquine on viruses is probably the same as that of chloroquine since the mechanism of action of these two molecules is identical, and hydroxychloroquine was prescribed for long periods, which would be therefore the first choice in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. For optimal treatment, it may be necessary to administer a loading dose followed by a maintenance dose [
