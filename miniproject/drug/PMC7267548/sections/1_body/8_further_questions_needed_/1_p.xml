<p>There are still some issues to consider in determining the advisability of implementing a large‐scale convalescent plasma transfusion program: What is the optimal timing for infusion? How long after clinical resolution of symptoms is there a chance to obtain neutralization antibodies if any? What is the most effective frequency of administration of convalescent plasma? Is clinical therapeutic effect related to antibody titer? Is it more likely to benefit young children and pregnant women? How do we make efficient use of convalescent plasma? More physiological studies are needed to explore why convalescent plasma is superior to fresh plasma and convalescent whole blood. Clinical research needs to explore the relationship between time (both extraction time and infusion time), volume, frequency, antibody titer and other healing factors, and clinical symptoms and signs of the patient. There is limited availability of eligible potential donors with sufficient levels of antibody. More large‐scale, randomized, well‐designed prospective studies are needed. Of note, eight studies, including a randomized controlled trial, have been registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (
