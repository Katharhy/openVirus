<p>The precise action mechanism of convalescent plasma therapy is not fully stated. There are some assumptions: First and foremost, the assumption is that convalescent plasma contains protective antibodies by neutralizing the pathogen, eventually leading to its eradication from the blood circulation. Rapid viral clearance would prevent further replication and the stimulus for the cytokine cascade. The level of anti‐Ebola virus immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers was found to be associated with a delay in the peak of viral replication in a lethal Ebola virus–infected mouse model.
