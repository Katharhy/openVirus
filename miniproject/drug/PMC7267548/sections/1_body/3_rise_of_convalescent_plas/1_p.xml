<p>Convalescent plasma has been applied more than 100 years (the first well documented was the Spanish flu in 1917‐1919).
 <xref rid="trf15797-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> Recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus epidemics (2003), A (H5N1) flu epidemics (2005‐2015), A (H1N1) flu epidemics (2009‐2010), and the Ebola virus epidemics (2013‐2015) have been proved exceedingly lethal and a threat to global health systems. There is an urgent need to have protective measures for nonexposed populations, prophylaxis for exposed but not yet infected populations, and experimental therapy for attacked individuals.
