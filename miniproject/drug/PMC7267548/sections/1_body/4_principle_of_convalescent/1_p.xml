<p>According to the WHO's criteria, only clinically asymptomatic survivors, 28 days after being discharged and who have twice tested negative for Ebola virus RNA by molecular techniques (the two samples for Ebola virus RNA testing should be taken at least 48 hours apart, and the test results should be negative on each sample), and aged between 18 years old and 55 years old, could be considered as potential convalescent plasma donors. A dosage of 400 to 500 mL of convalescent plasma was given in two doses of 200 to 250 mL each, separated from two different whole blood donations. For pediatric convalescent plasma transfusion, a dose of 10 mL/kg could be used based on the considerations of blood volume. Donors needed to be seronegative of HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, syphilis, and other locally transmitted infections.
