<p>Convalescent plasma has been used to treat several viral infections, including SARS, avian influenza A (H5N1), influenza A (H1N1), MERS, and Ebola virus. Although many studies have reported the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma infusion in the treatment of various infections, due to the lack of large‐scale, randomized, well‐designed, and prospective clinical trials, we tend to consider convalescent plasma as an “empirical” therapy.
 <xref rid="trf15797-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> Many studies have shown that convalescent plasma can effectively reduce viral load and increase antibodies to inhibit virus replication. Nevertheless, subsequent trials about convalescent plasma showed different results.
