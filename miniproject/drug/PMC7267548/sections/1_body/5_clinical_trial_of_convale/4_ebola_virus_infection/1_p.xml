<p>In 1995, a small study reported that eight patients received 150 to 400 mL of convalescent plasma and seven survived, for a case fatality rate of 12.5% in comparison to 80% in patients without convalescent plasma treatment.

 <xref rid="trf15797-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> performed a nonrandomized comparison study in which patients received two consecutive transfusions of 200 mL to 250 mL with unknown levels of antibody titer. Eighty‐four patients received convalescent plasma was not associated with a significant improvement in survival. From Day 3 to Day 16 after diagnosis, the risk of death was 31% (26/84 patients) in the convalescent plasma group and 38% (158/418 patients) in the control group (risk difference, −7 percentage points; 95% CI, −18 to 4). In conclusion, the transfusion of up to 500 mL of convalescent plasma with unknown levels of neutralizing antibodies in 84 patients with confirmed Ebola virus infection was not associated with a significant improvement in survival. Further clinical trial is worth performing.
