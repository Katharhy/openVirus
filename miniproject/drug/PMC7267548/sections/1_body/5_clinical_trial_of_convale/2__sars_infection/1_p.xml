<p>A retrospective comparative study showed a shorter hospital stay after convalescent plasma therapy in SARS patients who deteriorated despite ribavirin and high‐dose steroid therapy (74% vs. 19%; p = 0.001). Compared with five people who died in the continuing high‐dose methylprednisolone group, there were no deaths in the plasma group (p = 0.049).

 <xref rid="trf15797-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> stated that a 57‐year‐old woman infected with SARS improved gradually in clinical signs and symptoms after receiving a single 200‐mL dose of convalescent plasma by 15 days after symptoms onset, suggesting that convalescent plasma combined with antiviral drugs and a corticosteroid may be an available option for the treatment of SARS infection.
 <xref rid="trf15797-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> A study reported recovery of three patients infected with SARS who developed severe progression and failed to respond to the ribavirin or methylprednisone. The study shows that viral load dropped from 495 × 10
 <sup>3</sup>, 76 × 10
 <sup>3</sup>, or 65 × 010
 <sup>3</sup> copies/mL to zero or one copy/mL 1 day after transfusion, and anti–SARS‐Cov immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG also increased in a time‐dependent manner following convalescent plasma transfusion.
