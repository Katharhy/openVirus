<p>COVID‐19 belongs to the same coronavirus family as SARS and MERS. Many life‐threatening complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, can occur during the viral mass replication phase. None of them had specific and effective treatment. According to previous studies and WHO recommendations, convalescent plasma might be used when a specific treatment is not available. According to the press conference of the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council on February 28 (Guangming Net of China), up to 544 doses of plasma from convalescent COVID‐19 patients have been collected across the country and applied to 245 COVID‐19 patients. Of the 157 COVID‐19 patients who received convalescent plasma therapy and were closely monitored for more than 48 hours, 91 cases showed improvement in clinical indicators and symptoms. The plasma therapy has proved to be safe and effective. Neutralizing antibodies against the novel coronavirus have been identified in the plasma of convalescent patients. A pilot study that has just been reported shows that the convalescent plasma (titer ≥ 640) therapy was safe and could improve clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters.
 <xref rid="trf15797-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> We look forward to the release of relevant data about convalescent plasma applied in COVID‐19. More prospective comparative studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of convalescent plasma.
