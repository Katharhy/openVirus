<p>Two cases of convalescent plasma were reported. Both showed absolute reductions in viral load. One shows that the H7N9 virus was undetectable, the number of lymphocytes had been normalized by 4 days after infusing 200 mL of convalescent plasma with a titer of 80, and a computed tomography scan of the consolidation in the left lung had improved markedly after 12 days.

The overall crude case fatality rate was 16% (54/336) among treated patients and 37% (452/1219) among controls. A significant absolute reduction in the case fatality rate was observed in the patients treated within 4 days (19%; 28/) compared with 4 days or later (59%; 49/83). Therefore early definitive therapy is of great significance for pneumonia and hypoxia.

 <sup>8</sup> conducted an animal experiment in which ferrets were exposed to lethal doses of highly pathogenic influenza H5N1, infused with hyperimmune serum at three different times (24 hr before or 24 hr after virus exposure at the onset of fever [&gt;40°C] or immediately before the earliest expected onset of significant clinical signs [estimated from previous studies as Day 3 after exposure]). A total of 12 ferrets were included in the treatment group. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of convalescent plasma infusion at different time periods on survival. All four animals transfused hyperimmune serum 24 hours before virus exposure survived and were generally well, with slight weight loss. We can conclude that the greatest benefit was derived from passive immunization provided immediately before contact with an infectious dose of virus, compared to buffer controls or H3N2 nonhomologous hyperimmune serum. A prospective cohort study designed by Hung et al.
 <xref rid="trf15797-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> in which patients received a single 500‐mL dose of convalescent plasma with an antibody titer greater than 160. Mortality in the treatment group was significantly lower than in the nontreatment group (20.0% vs. 54.8%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that treatment with convalescent plasma reduced mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06‐0.69; p = 0.011). Subgroup analysis of 44 patients with serial respiratory tract viral load and cytokine level demonstrated that plasma treatment was associated with significantly lower Day 3, 5, and 7 viral load, compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Nevertheless, there is research showing different results. A randomized controlled trial reported that patients who received immune plasma and standard care for severe influenza showed a nonsignificant reduction in the mortality rate.
 <xref rid="trf15797-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> One death (2%) from the plasma plus standard care group and five (10%) from the standard care group (hazard ratio, 0‐19; 95% CI, 0·02‐1·65; p = 0·093). Twenty‐eight of 42 (67%) patients in the plasma plus standard care group normalized their respiratory status by Day 28 compared with 24 of 45 (53%) participants on standard care alone (p = 0·069). Moreover, the sequent study with patients suffering influenza A has suggested that there is no significant benefit from high‐titer (80) anti‐influenza plasma. There is no significant reduction in the discharge rate at Day 7 (95% CI, 0.65‐2.29; p = 0·54), mortality (six [7%] in the high‐titer group vs. four [9%] in the low‐titer group; p = 0·73).
 <xref rid="trf15797-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> Both of the randomized controlled trials focused on influenza A and B. These studies contradict what we know about the theory and previous research work. Meanwhile, a meta‐analysis showed that convalescent plasma may not have a clinically relevant impact in reducing the rate of mortality in patients with influenza (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.51‐2.23; p = 0.87; I
 <sup>2</sup> = 35%). There were nonsignificant reductions in days in the intensive care unit, days in the hospital, and days on mechanical ventilation. Nevertheless, there was evidence of a benefit of decreasing influenza B virus loads and cytokines after convalescent plasma treatment.
