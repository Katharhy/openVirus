<p>The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) epidemic is spreading all over the world. By March 23, over 300,000 patients had been confirmed and almost 15,000 died because of COVID‐19. More than 200,000 cases have been confirmed in other countries and regions outside China. Italy is the worst affected country in Europe. So far, no specific effective treatment has been developed for COVID‐19 except for meticulous supportive care including critical care and organ support when necessary. Convalescent plasma might be a potential treatment for COVID‐19.
