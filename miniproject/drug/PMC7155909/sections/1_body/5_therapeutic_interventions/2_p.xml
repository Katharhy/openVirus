 </sup> discourage the use of corticosteroids, given the risk for precipitating infectious and noninfectious complications, such as secondary bacterial infections or hyperglycemia. Further, in Middle East respiratory syndromeâ€“related coronavirus patients, steroid therapy was associated with delayed viral clearance and no improvement in survival.

 </sup> However, it can be difficult to account for the bias that sicker patients are more likely to receive steroids. In ARDS, despite multiple randomized controlled studies of corticosteroids, the benefits of corticosteroids remain equivocal.
