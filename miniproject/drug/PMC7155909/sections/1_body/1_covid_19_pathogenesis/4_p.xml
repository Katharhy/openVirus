<p>After viral binding to angiotensin converting enzyme-2, the virus may be endocytosed or directly fuse with the cell membrane (fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). A positive-sense viral RNA transcript is then translated by the host cell, yielding two polypeptides. These polypeptides are subsequently divided by viral proteases, yielding the viral replication machinery. Coronaviruses employ multiple mechanisms to shield viral RNA from host detection and subsequent induction of antiviral interferon responses, including direct antagonism of interferon signaling proteins and replication of viral RNA in double membrane vesicles.

 </sup> Nonetheless, COVID-19 strongly induces cytokines and chemokines including interleukin-2, interleukin-4, interleukin-7, interleukin-8, interleukin-10, interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1-α, suggesting a broad type 1 and type 2 helper T-cell response.
