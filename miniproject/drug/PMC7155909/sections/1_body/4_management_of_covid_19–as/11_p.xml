<p>When endotracheal intubation is indicated, the World Health Organization COVID-19 clinical guidelines suggest that it be performed by an experienced provider using airborne precautions.

 </sup> The guidelines also recommend the use of any modality (non-rebreather mask, bag valve mask, high flow nasal cannula, or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation) for preoxygenation with 100% oxygen for 5â€‰min, and the use of a rapid sequence induction when possible to avoid coughing or need for positive pressure breaths.

 </sup> Additional guidelines and experiential reports from Hubei province largely echo these recommendations.

 </sup> Of note, data from a recent meta-analysis did not note any benefit from the use of high flow nasal cannula for peri-intubation preoxygenation as compared with usual oxygen therapy in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure.

 </sup> However, high flow nasal cannula may be of benefit to prevent severe hypoxemia during intubations with prolonged apneic times or in patients who have very severe hypoxemia.
