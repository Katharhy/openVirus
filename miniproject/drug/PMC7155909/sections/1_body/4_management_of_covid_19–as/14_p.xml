<p>In patients with refractory hypoxemia despite lung protective ventilation with best practices, there are limited data to guide effectiveness of the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The United Kingdom ARDS guidelines weakly recommend consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS and refractory hypoxemia, although this recommendation was published before the results of a randomized controlled trial of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for ARDS, which was stopped early due to lack of a statistically significant mortality benefit between the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation group and the medical management group.

 </sup> However, a re-analysis of the data from this trial, as well as a meta-analysis incorporating these new trial data, suggest that extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may provide a mortality benefit in patients with severe ARDS.

 </sup> In a small case-control series during the Middle East respiratory syndromeâ€“related coronavirus outbreak, use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for refractory hypoxemia was associated with lower in-hospital mortality.

 </sup> Considering these data, it may be reasonable to refer COVID-19 patients with refractory hypoxemia despite lung protective ventilation for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in centers with the expertise and resources to properly manage such complex patients.
