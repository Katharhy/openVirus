    "The immune system protects against viruses and diseases and produces antibodies to kill pathogens. This review presents a brief overview of the immune system regarding its protection of the human body from COVID-19; illustrates the process of the immune system, how it works, and its mechanism to fight virus; and presents information on the most recent COVID-19 treatments and experimental data. Various types of potential challenges for the immunes system are also discussed. At the end of the article, foods to consume and avoid are suggested, and physical exercise is encouraged. This article can be used worldwide as a state of the art in this critical moment for promising alternative solutions related to surviving the coronavirus."
