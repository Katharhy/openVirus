<p id="par0050">The synopsis of Shi et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] is based on clinical common sense. They proposed some normal approaches for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> ). They posited that the two-phase immune defense-based protective phase and inflammation-driven damaging phase division are essential. In the first phase, doctors should attempt to boost immune response, and in the second phase, they should attempt to suppress it. Vitamin B3 should be used immediately after the coughing begins because it is highly lung protective. When breathing difficulty starts, hyaluronidase can be given intratracheally and simultaneously, 4-MU can be used to inhibit HAS2. Clearly, susceptibility information will be provided by HLA typing for strategizing prevention, treatment, vaccination, and clinical approaches.
