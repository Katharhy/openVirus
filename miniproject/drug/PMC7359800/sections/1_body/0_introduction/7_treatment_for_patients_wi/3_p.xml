<p id="par0070">At 28 days, dose-dependent antibody responses peaked, with seroconversion documented in 50%–75% of the participants in the middle- and high-dose groups. Moreover, specific T cell responses toward the spike glycoprotein were shown by interferon enzyme-linked immunospot and flow-cytometry. Among 83%–97% of participants, dose-dependent responses were detectable starting from 14 days. The most common adverse effects were fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain. One study demonstrated that [

Individuals from the tropical disease areas were also excluded. Plasma, approximately 400–800 mL, was collected from each donor, stored in units of 200 or 250 mL, and frozen within 24 h of collection to be used for further transfusions [

Any adverse event did not associate during the epidemic of influenza, SARS-CoV, and MARS-CoV but did occur for Ebola. Reports say treatment with convalescent plasma for patients with COVID-19 is safe without any major adverse events [
