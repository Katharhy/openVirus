<p id="par0125">Dong et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0520" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>] experimented on patients by using various methods. Initially, they used sera, but no significant result was observed. Subsequently, the team focused on NP and S-RBD. To determine optical dilutions, the serum from a patient and human AB serum was titrated. For IgM a dilution of 1:50 and for IgG a dilution of 1:150 were used. Compared with healthy donor groups, NP- and S-RBD-specific IgM and IgG antibodies were both detected in the area of newly discharged patients (
 <xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> ). Compared with those of healthy donors, Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were also more clearly observed than IgM in the followed-up patients. These findings indicate that patients with COVID-19 mounted IgG and IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2 proteins, especially NP and S-RBD, and suggest that patients who are infected could maintain their IgG levels, at least for 2 weeks. Because the RBD domain of the S protein has been shown to bind to the human receptor ACE2, the existence of antibodies against it may suggest the neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To assess that phenomenon, they performed a pseudovirus particle-based neutralization assay. Patients #1, 2, 4, and 5, all within the discharged group, had high levels of neutralizing antibody titers. Those findings demonstrate that most recently discharged patients had protective humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Except for patient #11, the followed-up patients had lower levels of neutralizing antibody titers than the recently discharged other patients, and all were positive except for patient #7, who was negative.
