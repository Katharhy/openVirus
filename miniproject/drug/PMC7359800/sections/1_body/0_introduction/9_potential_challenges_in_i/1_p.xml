An efficient immune system must have the ability to distinguish this. It should have the ability to adapt to strange environmental changes to fight against infections. A healthy immune system has symbiotic microbial farms and reacts to a harmful infection. When pathogens enter the body, they attempt to use it as a host, and the immune system poses many threats. A different door is used for every infection to enter a cell, and blocking these routes of entry can stop an infection before it begins. The immune system neutralizes an infection by producing antibodies; however, this must be conducted at the proper time. An immune system—ideally—must stop an infection before it has established a foothold in the body [
