<p id="par0140">This review on boosting the immune system is a potential resource for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. The process and mechanism of the immune system can be a good source of knowledge for immune system development. Further research could focus on the most recent observations regarding COVID-19 treatment. If the potential challenges can be overcome, this would be a substantial achievement. Finally, nutrition (eg, dietary recommendations) to boost the immune system should be explored and recommended because no registered medicine is available for COVID-19 treatment.</p>
