 <p>The outbreaks of viruses with wide spread and mortality in the world population have motivated the research for new therapeutic approaches. There are several viruses that cause a biochemical imbalance in the infected cell resulting in oxidative stress. These effects may be associated with the development of pathologies and worsening of symptoms. Therefore, this review is aimed at discussing natural compounds with both antioxidant and antiviral activities, specifically against coronavirus infection, in an attempt to contribute to global researches for discovering effective therapeutic agents in the treatment of coronavirus infection and its severe clinical complications. The contribution of the possible action of these compounds on metabolic modulation associated with antiviral properties, in addition to other mechanisms of action, is presented.</p>
