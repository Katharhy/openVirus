<p>In addition, quercetin glycosides with antioxidant activity, such as quercetin 3-
 <italic>β</italic>-glucoside, have already been isolated from plants such as 
 <italic>Passiflora subpeltata</italic> Ortega and 
 <italic>Chamomilla suaveolens</italic> (Pursh) Rydb. [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The administration of quercetin 3-
 <italic>β</italic>-glucoside (40 mg/kg p.o.) in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats promotes an increase in the levels of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GPx) and nonenzymatic antioxidants (vitamins C and E and GSH) and a reduction of lipid peroxidation [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Quercetin 3-
 <italic>β</italic>-galactoside (hyperoside) is found mainly in plants of the 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> genus such as 
 <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Moreover, it showed cardioprotective activity in high glucose-induced injury of myocardial cells through decreased apoptosis and ROS production and increased SOD levels [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Quercetin 7-ramnoside is also found in plants of the 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> genus such as 
 <italic>Hypericum japonicum</italic> Thunb. ex Murray. This flavonoid shows hepatoprotective activity against carbon tetrachloride in mice by decreasing lipid peroxidation and increasing CAT and GSH levels, in addition to presenting values of 118.75 
 <italic>μ</italic>M and 128.47 
 <italic>μ</italic>M in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) assays, respectively [
