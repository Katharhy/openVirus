<p>Luteolin is present in foods such as carrot, cabbage, tea, and apple and is found in 
 <italic>Ugni molinae</italic> Turcz. [
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Data show that luteolin (50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) increases the levels of GSH, the expression of GSH synthetase, and the activity of SOD and CAT in human colon cancer cells (HT-29) [
