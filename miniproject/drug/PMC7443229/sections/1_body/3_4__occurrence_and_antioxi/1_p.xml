<p>Quercetin can be found in plants such as 
 <italic>Rubus fruticosus</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Lagerstroemia speciosa</italic> (L.) Pers. [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Also, quercetin shows antioxidant activity at a concentration of 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol/L in HepG2 cells, inhibiting oxidative stress promoted by H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], promotes an increase in SOD, CAT, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and reduces lipid peroxidation in rats with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Moreover, quercetin improves sepsis-induced acute lung injury in rats, by reducing lipid peroxidation and inflammation and increasing SOD and CAT levels [
