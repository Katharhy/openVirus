<p>Herbacetin is ubiquitous in plants of the genus

 <italic>R. sachalinensis</italic> A. Bor and show antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Veeramani et al. reported that the administration of herbacetin (40â€‰mg/kg p.o.) in mice, with obesity-associated insulin resistance, promotes an increase in the activity of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is directly related to the production of NADPH [
