<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to a family of enveloped viruses with a positive sense, single-stranded RNA genome. CoVs cause illness ranging from upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) resembling the common cold to lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) such as bronchitis, pneumonia, and even severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) with most serious disease outcomes in the elderly, immunocompromised patients, and infants [

More recently, in 2012, a new human coronavirus, designated as Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was identified, and the global ongoing outbreak of MERS with over 2519 official cases and 866 deaths represented approximately 34% case fatality rate to date in humans [
