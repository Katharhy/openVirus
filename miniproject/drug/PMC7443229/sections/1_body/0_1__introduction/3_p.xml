<p>It is important to note that there are many similarities among different coronavirus species, but not in all aspects. Depending on the molecular mechanism of viral inhibition promoted by an antiviral agent, the analysis of the data and comparison between animal and human CoVs must be done very carefully. In fact, it is important to note that there are differences between human and animal CoV receptors, which will likely result in different affinities, or unlikely interactions, of an antiviral agent with the different CoV receptors. However, if the antiviral agent interferes with the replication and/or assembly of the CoVs, there is a higher probability of obtaining similar antiviral activity results in human CoV tests [
