<p>In conclusion, this review shows that antioxidant compounds, prominently flavonoids, exhibit antiviral action in models of coronavirus infections. In general, the antiviral activity might be attributed, at least in part, to the inhibitory effect on the enzymatic activity of targets involved in coronavirus replication, including SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PL
 <sup>pro</sup>), SARS-CoV helicase protein, and MERS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. In addition, some studies provide evidence that the reduction of ROS accumulation retards the coronavirus-activated apoptotic signaling. Therefore, the mechanisms of oxidative stress could be the key element to be studied in coronavirus infections, including those related to inflammatory processes arising from the action of this virus. Obviously, further investigations are needed to elucidate other pharmacological mechanisms by which natural antioxidants play an antiviral effect. Despite the findings reported in this review, they cannot be generalized to COVID-19. However, the data provided support to the investigation of natural antioxidants as a potential therapeutic approach in the treatment for COVID-19 and its severe clinical complications, either as an alternative or as an adjuvant to conventional therapies, and contribute to the search for new prototypes in the development of drugs against coronavirus infections.
