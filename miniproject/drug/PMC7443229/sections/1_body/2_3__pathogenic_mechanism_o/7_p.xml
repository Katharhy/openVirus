<p>Antioxidant substances promote improvement in cases of disease caused by coronaviruses, such as apolipoprotein D—a lipocalin that promoted a neuroprotective effect against encephalitis induced by human coronavirus OC43—in mice. This protective effect occurred through the reduction of oxidative stress, cerebral lipid peroxidation, and regulation of inflammation [
