<p>Mitochondria have an essential function in energy generation, and for this reason, their function and integrity are strictly regulated in order to respond to varying energy requirements and environmental conditions [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Mitochondria are known to function as the control point in apoptotic pathways, releasing proapoptotic factors, mainly ROS, which function as a signaling molecule that may result in cell death [

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Some studies have shown a relationship between coronavirus infection and dysfunctional or damaged mitochondria, leading to the release of ROS and other proapoptotic substances [

In a recent study, Xu et al. reported that ROS and p53 play key roles in regulating many kinds of the cell process during coronavirus infection in Vero cells. According to the authors, coronavirus infection appears to induce a time-dependent ROS accumulation, which in turn is linked to regulatory mechanisms of p53 activation and apoptosis in infected cells [
