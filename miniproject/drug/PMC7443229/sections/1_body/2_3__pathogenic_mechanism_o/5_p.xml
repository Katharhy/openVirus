<p>In an experimental model of SARS-induced acute lung injury in mice, it was noted that phospholipid oxidation, due to oxidative stress, is one of the main triggering factors of acute lung injury. This happens through the activation of the innate immune response, culminating in the activation of pulmonary macrophages via TLR4-TRIF-TRAF6-NF-
