<p>In addition, during viral infection, oxidative stress contributes to viral pathogenesis through stimulating inflammation, loss of immune function, and increased viral replication that may occur due to the activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-

This is followed by an increase in reactive oxygen species production and cytokine expression and release, which ultimately leads to acute lung injury [

In general, RNA viruses promote changes in the body's antioxidant defense system, affecting enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), in addition to reducing the levels of antioxidant molecules such as ascorbic acid, carotenoids, and reduced glutathione (GSH) [
