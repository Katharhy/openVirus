<p>Oxidative stress is defined as an interruption and/or deregulation of the signaling and redox system that can be caused by an imbalance in the production of oxidant and antioxidant species [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Among the main oxidant agents, ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) stand out. In order to counterbalance the oxidant species, there is an antioxidant system formed by enzymes and nonenzymatic molecules [

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, during pathological events, such as viral infections, there may be an increase in the production of oxidant species not neutralized by the antioxidant system, resulting in oxidative stress that promotes cellular damage through protein denaturation, changes in the functions of nucleic acids, lipid peroxidation, and cell death [
