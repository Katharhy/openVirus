<p>In a study performed by Lin et al., the antiviral activities of resveratrol were investigated in MERS-infected Vero E6 cells. The authors reported a significant inhibition of MERS-CoV infection and prolonged host cell survival after virus infection, which they speculate was promoted by resveratrol. In addition, they also found that the expression of the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is essential for MERS-CoV replication, is decreased after resveratrol treatment [
