<p>The oxidative stress pathway could potentially be a key element in coronavirus-induced apoptosis and pathogenesis [

For this reason, it is interesting to investigate the use of antioxidants as potential therapeutic tools—either as an alternative or as an adjuvant to conventional therapies—in the treatment of coronavirus infections. Among the antioxidant compounds evaluated as for coronavirus infections are the flavonoids, which are compounds widely found in fruits, vegetables, and certain beverages. In fact, research groups have reported that antioxidant flavonoids, including (+)-catechin, luteolin, apigenin, quercetin, and quercetin 7-rhamnoside, inhibit ROS accumulation and apoptosis of cells infected with different coronavirus, including porcine epidemic diarrhoea coronavirus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) [
