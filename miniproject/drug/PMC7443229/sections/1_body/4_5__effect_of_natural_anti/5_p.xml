<p>Many antioxidant compounds show antiviral activity against SARS-CoV. The antiviral activity has been mainly attributed to the inhibition of the 3C-like protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) of SARS-CoV, a vital enzyme for SARS-CoV replication [

 <italic>Î²</italic>-galactoside, display potent 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitory e5ffect and consequent reduction of SARS-CoV replication [
