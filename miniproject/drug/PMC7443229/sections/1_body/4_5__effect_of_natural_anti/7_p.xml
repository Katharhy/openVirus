<p>MERS-CoV is another zoonotic coronavirus transmitted between animals and human beings that causes severe morbidity and mortality. No antiviral medicines with satisfactory efficacy for the treatment of MERS-CoV-infected patients have been identified to date. Similar to SARS-CoV, natural antioxidant libraries have been probed for potential inhibitory compounds against MERS-CoV 3C-like protease. Jo et al. showed that herbacetin, isobavachalcone, quercetin 3-
 <italic>Î²</italic>-d-glucoside, and helichrysetin, four compounds with recognized antioxidant activity, can block the enzymatic activity of MERS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> using a tryptophan-based fluorescence method. Furthermore, the experimental and computational studies show that flavonol and chalcone are favourite scaffolds to bind with the catalytic site of MERS-CoV 3CL
