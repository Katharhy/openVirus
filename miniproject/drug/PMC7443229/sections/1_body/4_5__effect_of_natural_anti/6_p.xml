<p>Moreover, some natural antioxidants exhibit promising antiviral activity against SARS-CoV infection by interfering with different targets involved in SARS-CoV replication, in particular the SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PL
 <sup>pro</sup>) and SARS-CoV helicase protein. Kim et al. reported that isobavachalcone and psoralidin inhibit PL
 <sup>pro</sup> in a dose-dependent manner with IC
