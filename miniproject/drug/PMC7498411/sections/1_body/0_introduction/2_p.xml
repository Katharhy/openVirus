<p id="par0025">Generally, small-molecule drugs, vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, peptides, interferon, and oligonucleotide-based therapies can be used to combat viral infections such as the application of a SARS vaccine or combinatorial antiretroviral therapy (cART) in the treatment of HIV [

Nevertheless, up to 2016, only 90 antiviral drugs had been approved for the treatment of 9 types of human transmissible diseases, namely HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), herpesvirus, influenza virus, human cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human papilloma virus (HPV) [

Moreover, viral mutation, virus-induced secondary infections, side effects from drugs and vaccines, and long development cycles bring many uncertainties and pose challenges to the search for new antiviral drugs. Hence, there is an urgent need to realize more effective therapeutic strategies to combat viral emergence.
