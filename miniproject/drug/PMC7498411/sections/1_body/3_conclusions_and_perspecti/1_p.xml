<p id="par0090">The development of novel antiviral nanoagents may be a vital and highly desirable precaution against the emergence and recurrence of viral outbreaks. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches such as interfering RNAs, ENMs offer distinct advantages for antiviral therapy, including tunable physicochemical properties, high drug-loading efficacy and bioavailability, feasible incorporation of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic antiviral drugs, and outstanding stability under physiological conditions. Moreover, although diverse ENM-based antiviral strategies have already been proposed based on lab studies, their application in practical therapeutics is still in its infancy. Thus, the current challenges and knowledge gaps in the development of novel antiviral nanoagents, such as the therapeutic efficacy and potential health risks need to be addressed. Nevertheless, future research on antiviral nanoagents and combination therapy using approved antiviral drugs and ENMs is expected to produce promising developments.</p>
