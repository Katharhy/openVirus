<p>The area of novel coronavirus origination (Wuhan) will be considered as the region under the primary threat. The outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia imposed a serious threat to the residents of the city by infecting thousands of people and killing hundreds of them [

 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] (S17). MERS negatively impacted mental health up to a higher extent and in some cases, the impacts imposed were long term and severe (S18-S22). Comparatively, the COVID-19 may have strong negative effects on health and can cause serious mental problems including acute stress, insomnia, severe anxiety, and chronic depression. MERS and SARS induced serious psychological problems majorly in health care workers (S22), however, the COVID-19 infection may cause such abnormalities in the general public as well, because it is more intense in terms of infecting and killing the individuals [

To overcome serious problems in the future, all of the recommendations that we have discussed in the previous section of regions at secondary risks should be implemented here. Furthermore, the people should be provided with counseling and guidance at specified public centers, equipped with psychologists, and psychiatrists.
