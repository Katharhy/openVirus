<p>Interventions by health care authorities have consisted of equivocal recommendations for the prevention of viral infections (S4). For instance, some of the infected individuals were advised to stay isolated inside homes rather than hospitals, which may increase the stress burden on family members due to the fear of getting infected. The scarcity of preventive measurements such as gloves, masks, and headcovers during the massive lockdown in China may induce further stress in the general population. To mitigate the negative outcomes, interventions for the general population must be informed by these recommendations; information about viral outbreak and possible impact, individual risk, outcomes of negative health behaviors, identifying place and time of risk in advance to take specific measurements, public awareness regarding necessary actions to prevent the spread of viral infections. Furthermore, people must be provided with follow-up information during and after control of the outbreak.</p>
