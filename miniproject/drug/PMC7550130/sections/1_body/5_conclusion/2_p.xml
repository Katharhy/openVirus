<p id="p0050">Illegal wildlife trade and bushmeat trade not only lead to the loss of biodiversity and to major ecosystem dysfunctions, they also expose humans to a plethora of severe EID, some of which have contributed to the most dramatic global pandemics humankind has endured. These zoonotic pandemics threaten global health, trigger major economic crises, and unleash political instability. Risks to public health and to a larger extent, the socio-economic burden of EID, should be unassailable arguments for decision makers to combat the illegal trade for wildlife more efficiently. Mitigating the risk of spreading EID into EU should actually be part of any sustainable socioeconomic development plan. The EU which is currently one of the major destination markets for the illegal wildlife trade and a hub for trafficking in transit to other regions of the globe, should show a leadership in policies to combat this illegal activity. This is all the more true since EU, as one of the largest wealthy economic entities with a strong technology expertise, has probably also a moral duty in addressing the illegal wildlife trade to bear a part of the global burden associated to EID consequences which do not recognise geopolitical borders. Effective enforcement of existing legal instruments and more stringent scrutiny at EU border-crossing points have key roles to play in mitigating the illegal wildlife trade. In many cases, linking a suspect to a wildlife crime scene requires the use of wildlife forensic science. This criminal investigation field depends strongly both on the development of novel technologies and on researches in conservation genetics to produce reference DNA-databases for all CITES-listed species. This field of investigation offers great potential for mitigating wildlife trafficking and should become a high priority issue funded with substantial investments. The EU Wildlife Action Plan 2016–2020, adopted by the European Commission and which sets out a comprehensive blueprint to address the illegal trade for wildlife in EU does neither mention “wildlife forensic science” as a research area to prioritise nor a field of applications to promote. This should be addressed.</p>
