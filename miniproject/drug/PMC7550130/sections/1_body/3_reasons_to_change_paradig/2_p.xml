<p id="p0040">The socio-economic burden of epidemics is so considerable that public health authorities and intelligence agencies have classified infectious diseases as “a non-traditional threat to national and global security” (
 <xref rid="bb0435" ref-type="bibr">Snowden, 2008</xref>) and during a general assembly of the United Nations (UN), it was stated that a disease such as HIV “may pose a risk to stability and security if left unchecked” (
 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Heymann et al., 2015</xref>). Even though the HIV was first discovered about 40 years ago (
 <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Montagnier, 2002</xref>), the world is still struggling to contain this epidemic. About 37 million people live with HIV in the world (
 <xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">Platt et al., 2016</xref>) and about the same number of people have already died (
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Bell and Bedford, 2017</xref>). The amount of funding spent to control this epidemic has been considerable (
 <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">Pike et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Dieleman et al., 2018</xref>). Between 2000 and 2015, half a trillion USD was spent to tackle this pandemic (
 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Dieleman et al., 2018</xref>) and estimates predict that the cost of combating HIV could reach 35 billion USD per year by 2031 (
 <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Hecht et al., 2009</xref>). Considerable investments should be engaged by governments to both control epidemics and avoid financial crises and recessions (
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Dixon et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">Mullan, 2015</xref>). The societal impacts of EID related to morbidity and mortality affect, indeed, labor supply (
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Dixon et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Knobler et al., 2004</xref>), reduce labor productivity, competitiveness and profits of affected countries (
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Dixon et al., 2002</xref>). The World Bank estimated that the economic impact of zoonotic diseases that have occurred in specific countries between 1997 and 2009 has reached 80 trillion USD, which represents 5% of the global gross domestic product (
 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Gebreyes et al., 2014</xref>). It is still too early to make an assessment of the economic impact of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak but according to the United Nations (UN), it will cost at least 8.5 trillion USD to the world economy over the next two years and the EU needs to provide financial assistance of up to 100 billions € to protect jobs and workers affected by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and avoid a major economic crisis. Additionally, epidemics have demonstrated our vulnerability, unpreparedness and inability to prevent and control such events (
 <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">Pike et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Bloom et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, it is crucial for global health security that we carefully evaluate the lessons learned from current and previous major disease outbreaks (
 <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">Pike et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Heymann et al., 2015</xref>). Pandemics are inherently unpredictable (
 <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">Morse et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, despite intensive surveillance of EID, scientists have never managed to predict a single pandemic before it starts infecting humans after a cross-species transmission (
 <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Lloyd-Smith et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">Morse et al., 2012</xref>). International efforts were not sufficient to predict SARS-CoV-1 in 2002–2003 (
 <xref rid="bb0500" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2006</xref>), the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, the Ebola outbreak in 2014–2015 (
 <xref rid="bb0480" ref-type="bibr">Troncoso, 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Jacobsen et al., 2016</xref>), and the SARS-CoV-2 in 2019. Humans will continue to be assailed by new emerging and reemerging zoonotic diseases (
 <xref rid="bb0525" ref-type="bibr">Wolfe et al., 2007</xref>) and each of them will represent a unique challenge (
 <xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Morens et al., 2013</xref>). While a few pathogens such as the smallpox virus were eradicated, and others, such as poliomyelitis or measles, significantly controlled, it is very unlikely that most of the emerging diseases will be eradicated in the near future (
 <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Fonkwo, 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Morens et al., 2013</xref>). Because of their short life-cycles and elevated replication rates, pathogens evolve rapidly, enabling them to escape host defense mechanisms and environmental changes (
 <xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Morens et al., 2013</xref>) and sometimes to mutate into more virulent strains (
 <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Fonkwo, 2008</xref>). Further major epidemics will emerge in unpredictable times and places or in places where the surveillance systems and infrastructures are lacking (
 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Heymann et al., 2015</xref>). By adding in 2018 the “disease X” on the shortlist of EID that represent the greatest risk of becoming pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledged that global health policies must be prepared to a future world pandemic caused by a hypothetical and unknown pathogen (
 <xref rid="bb0535" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2018</xref>). Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 might well be the first “disease X”. Our answer to epidemics is currently reactive and not proactive (
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Bloom et al., 2017</xref>), focusing on post-emergence outbreak control with the establishment of quarantine protocols and the development of diagnostics, drugs and vaccines (
 <xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Morens et al., 2013</xref>). This approach is not sustainable on the long run because it is highly cost-intensive (
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Bhutta et al., 2014</xref>) and often ineffective (
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Bloom et al., 2017</xref>) due to the delays in detection and response (
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2017</xref>). Even if some scientists offer hopes to deliver a COVID-19 vaccine within a record time (
 <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2020</xref>), vaccine development is usually measured in years or decades with the most accelerated procedures (
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Bloom et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Graham, 2020</xref>). Yet, in the case of HIV, 35 years after the beginning of the pandemic, no successful vaccine has been developed (
 <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">Pike et al., 2010</xref>). For these reasons, the wait-and-response approach will not be sufficient for controlling emerging and reemerging infectious diseases (
 <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">Pike et al., 2010</xref>), and it is imperative that EU decision makers change their paradigm by switching from a “reactive” model to a “proactive” model (
 <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Jacobsen et al., 2016</xref>). Strengthening a network of public health agencies in several countries in order to detect and contain epidemics is often suggested to improve global health security, but this solution is still far from reality and alternative measures should be developed (
 <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">Pike et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Heymann et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Hyatt et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Jacobsen et al., 2016</xref>). Controlling and restricting the human/wildlife interface is most probably the best defense to prevent the emergence of infectious diseases (
 <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Karesh et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">Pike et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Jacobsen et al., 2016</xref>) and rather than deploying efforts and money to combat novel viruses, conservation interventions, biodiversity preservation and trade regulation should be emphasised instead (
 <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Hyatt et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">Muehlenbein, 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Di Marco et al., 2020</xref>).
