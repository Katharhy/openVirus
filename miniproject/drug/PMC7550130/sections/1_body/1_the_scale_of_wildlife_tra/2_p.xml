<p id="p0030">As a result of anthropogenic pressures, thousands of species are declining dramatically worldwide and many of them are facing a high risk of extinction (
 <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Hoffmann et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Estrada et al., 2017</xref>). The magnitude of wildlife trade has become so important that it is one of the most prominent anthropogenic driver of species extinction (
 <xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">Scheffers et al., 2019</xref>). According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), 26% of the assessed terrestrial mammals are threatened with extinction (
 <xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">Ripple et al., 2016</xref>). Wildlife trade occurs in 65% of all terrestrial vertebrate families with mammals and reptiles showing the highest percentage of traded species (
 <xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">Scheffers et al., 2019</xref>). Global movement of live animals for the illegal exotic pet trade affects hundreds of millions of animals every year, including for example 40,000 live primates and four million live birds (
 <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Fèvre et al., 2006</xref>). Between 1998 and 2007, 30 millions CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species)-listed animals corresponding to 300 different species, were illegally wild caught in South-East Asia and exported worldwide (
 <xref rid="bb0335" ref-type="bibr">Nijman, 2010</xref>). The trade for wildlife involves also a wide range of animal products including bushmeat (
 <xref rid="bb0335" ref-type="bibr">Nijman, 2010</xref>). Bushmeat hunting is defined by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) as “the harvesting of wild animals in tropical and subtropical countries for food and for non-food purposes, including medicinal use” (
 <xref rid="bb0405" ref-type="bibr">Secretariat of the CBD, 2011</xref>). Bushmeat hunting is also an important extinction threat of terrestrial mammals (
 <xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">Ripple et al., 2016</xref>). For example, roughly 200 millions and 12–35 millions of animals are harvested every year from the Congo and the Amazon basin respectively (
 <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Karesh et al., 2007</xref>). The illegal trade for wildlife is considered too often as a problem of developing countries but it is instead a global business. It ranks among the top three largest illegitimate businesses in the world (
 <xref rid="bb0485" ref-type="bibr">van Uhm, 2016</xref>) and represents a multibillion dollars' industry (
 <xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">Scheffers et al., 2019</xref>) comparable to the international trade of narcotics and weapons (
 <xref rid="bb0485" ref-type="bibr">van Uhm, 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0430" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2017</xref>). More alarmingly, the international wildlife trafficking is one of the fastest growing illegal market worldwide (
 <xref rid="bb0440" ref-type="bibr">Sollund, 2016</xref>), particularly when it involves the use of animals for food and traditional medicine (
 <xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">Maher and Sollund, 2016</xref>). By ranking at the third largest worldwide consumer and transit point (
 <xref rid="bb0445" ref-type="bibr">Sollund and Maher, 2015</xref>) and the top global importer by value (
 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Engler and Parry-Jones, 2007</xref>), the EU is largely concerned by international illegal wildlife trade. In Paris Charles de Gaulle airport, roughly 273 tons of bushmeat are reported to be imported every year on Air France routes from Central and West Africa and 7% of the searched passengers were found to be carrying bushmeat (
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Chaber et al., 2010</xref>). In 2018, EU member states reported 6012 seizures records, corresponding to 16,740 specimen of CITES-listed species (
 <xref rid="bb0470" ref-type="bibr">TRAFFIC, 2020</xref>). This figure should be considered cautiously as it is probably largely under-estimated compared to the global scale of wildlife trafficking reported in the scientific literature. Reported seizures can only be used as indicators if they are the expression of a genuine political will and if they are all scrupulously entered in specific databases (e.g. EU-TWIX) (
 <xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">Mundy-Taylor, 2013</xref>). Precise estimates of the illegal wildlife trade in EU are difficult to evaluate because of its clandestine character. However, weak controls at EU borders further contribute to make the true scale of the illegal wildlife trade difficult to measure (
 <xref rid="bb0445" ref-type="bibr">Sollund and Maher, 2015</xref>). At Charles de Gaulle airport for example, only 2.5% of luggage are searched for products of animal origin which rather seems a cosmetic and ineffective measure (
 <xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">Noordhuizen et al., 2013</xref>). The illegal importation of bushmeat and live animals from CITES-listed species in EU happens despites the fact that CITES is ratified by all EU members states (
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">CITES, 2020</xref>) and the European Union (EU, 
 <xref rid="bb0375" ref-type="bibr">Policy Department of the European Parliament, 2016</xref>). CITES is an international agreement which aims to ensure that the trade of species does not threat their survival. CITES regulations, which are implemented within the EU legislation through Council regulations EC No 338/97 and EC No 865/2006 (
 <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">European Commission, 2010</xref>), should thus be an important line of defense to prevent illegal importation of endangered species in EU. Additionally, while the hazardous nature of the illegal wildlife trade for public health comes precisely from its clandestine and unregulated nature (
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Can et al., 2019</xref>), the lack of searched procedures for the illegal importation of bushmeat contrasts with strict measures and veterinary inspections for legal importation of live animals and products of animal origins (
 <xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">Noordhuizen et al., 2013</xref>). The EU, as one of the biggest market for wildlife trade, thus plays a contradictory role (
 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Engler and Parry-Jones, 2007</xref>). On one side, it claims to be at the forefront of the fight against wildlife crime (
 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">European Commission, 2016</xref>) but on the other side, loopholes in enforcement policies, law penalties, and insufficient resources, demonstrate that the wildlife trafficking is not tackled appropriately (
 <xref rid="bb0540" ref-type="bibr">Wyatt and Cao, 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">Maher and Sollund, 2016</xref>). Ultimately, the weakness of EU policies and inspection measures at EU borders are ineffective to both combat the international wildlife trade of threatened species and to reduce the risk of introducing harmful pathogens in EU (
 <xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">Noordhuizen et al., 2013</xref>).
