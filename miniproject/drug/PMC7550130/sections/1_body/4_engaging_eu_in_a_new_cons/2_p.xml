<p id="p0045">Even though human-to-human transmissions facilitated by travel and global tourism remain, so far, the most recurrent drivers implicated in infectious disease events in EU (
 <xref rid="bb0410" ref-type="bibr">Semenza et al., 2016</xref>), it is unreasonable to wait for the next epidemic to be caused by the illegal wildlife trade to implement mitigation strategies preventing this illegal activity. For example, the potential for introduction and transmission of a highly pathogenic virus, such as Ebola, through illegally imported bushmeat into EU, is considered to be low, but the public health consequences of only one introduction would be devastating (
 <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">EFSA, 2014</xref>). Because the EU is a hotspot for EID (
 <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2008</xref>) and is a major hub of the wildlife trade, it has a critical role to play in restricting the human/wildlife interface. There is an urgent need to implement stricter protectionist measures toward wildlife importation and to drastically enforce policies. EU should first review its own environmental crime legislation to ensure that wildlife crime is consistently treated with harmonised rules and with the seriousness it deserves (
 <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">EFFACE, 2016</xref>). In this regard, EU member states should criminalise acts of wildlife crime that are not in accordance with environmental rules (
 <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">EFFACE, 2016</xref>). Second, specialised police forces prosecutors' offices and judges, expert in environmental crime, should be developed as they will grant environmental crimes a high priority and treat them in an efficient way (
 <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">EFFACE, 2016</xref>). To improve coordination and collaboration between member states, the latter should also have the obligation to communicate on the number of violations and prosecutions. Without independent records of illegal trade activity entered in specific electronic databases and enforcement, no conclusion can be drawn from these records about a country's effort or progress in controlling illegal wildlife trade (
 <xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Rosen and Smith, 2010</xref>). Additionally, a better control at border check points is a prerequisite to any attempt to counter wildlife trade. It would indeed help to accurately assess the scale of the illegal wildlife trade entering EU, determine its scope in terms of species, volume and origin and subsequently improve regulatory frameworks within EU and orientate conservation strategies in countries of origin. EU policies for biodiversity preservation should be framed into an international conservation context with, for example, independent scientific evaluations to ensure that they do not make the wildlife trade worse nor generate a geographic redirection of it, and to be adjusted if necessary (
 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Cardador et al., 2017</xref>). Concomitantly, EU should better control the surge of its legal wildlife trade market, finance programs that improve the livelihood of local communities living in epicenter regions of trade species, finance protected area management, engage changes in consumer behaviours by organizing awareness campaigns to reduce the demand for wildlife. Control procedures at EU border crossing points could be improved by increasing the amount of personal committed to searching for illegal bushmeat including online wildlife crime intelligence officers, and by increasing the number of detection tools such as scanning gears and sniffer dogs (
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Chaber et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Rosen and Smith, 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Jansen et al., 2016</xref>). Understanding and monitoring the wildlife trade require that traded species can be accurately identified (
 <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Gaubert et al., 2015</xref>). In some cases, such as for bushmeat which is often smoked or processed (
 <xref rid="bb0505" ref-type="bibr">Willcox et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">Minhos et al., 2013</xref>), the visual identification of the species involved is impossible or inaccurate (
 <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Gaubert et al., 2015</xref>). As wildlife crime investigators must be able to link a suspect to a crime, strengthening investments into wildlife forensic science and developing a network of forensic laboratories in Europe should be a cornerstone of the EU's plan to address wildlife trafficking within the EU. Over the past 30Â years, the field of forensic science has become an important conservation tool to tackle wildlife trafficking (
 <xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">Ogden et al., 2009</xref>) and genomic technologies are increasingly being used to provide evidence of illicit wildlife trade (
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Alacs et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">Ogden, 2011</xref>). Geneticists can recover DNA from almost any tissue (e.g. meat, bones, feathers) (
 <xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">Ogden et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Alacs et al., 2010</xref>) and genetic identification of species by DNA sequencing is employed worldwide for many species (
 <xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">Ogden, 2011</xref>). Wildlife forensic relies on finding short standardised species-specific DNA sequences that vary across species and are conserved within species (
 <xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">Ogden et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Alacs et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0465" ref-type="bibr">Tobe and Linacre, 2010</xref>). Two methods using these species-specific genetic markers - DNA barcoding and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) - are predominantly used by wildlife forensic scientists for species identification. One of the challenges to further integrate wildlife DNA forensics into law enforcement's toolkit, is that both the cutting-edge technology and data from scientific research must be available to produce clear and unequivocal evidence that can be used by law enforcement staff and in courtrooms (
 <xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">Ogden et al., 2009</xref>). With adequate political will, it becomes conceivable to develop platforms to combat illegal importations of wildlife and wildlife products, just like the FishPopTrace project funded by an EU framework programme to address illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (
 <xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Martinsohn and Ogden, 2009</xref>). Using array-based SNP assays, the FishPopTrace project allowed the monitoring of illegal fishing of four commercial species: cod (
 <italic>Gadus morhua</italic>), hake (
 <italic>Merluccius merluccius</italic>), herring (
 <italic>Clupea harengus</italic>) and sole (
 <italic>Solea solea</italic>) (
 <xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Martinsohn and Ogden, 2009</xref>). Even though several large-scale projects are already developed to restrain illegal wildlife trade in species with high economic value such as fish and wood, few projects are dedicated to endangered wildlife species (
 <xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">Ogden, 2011</xref>). In the recent years, progress has been achieved in the development of metabarcoding strategies for CITES-listed species even though genetic barcodes of such species are still under-represented (
 <xref rid="bb0450" ref-type="bibr">Staats et al., 2016</xref>). Wildlife forensic science promises to bridge the gap between illegal wildlife trade and law enforcement; however there is now an urgent need of financing comprehensive research on wildlife forensic science to enrich databases with reference DNA libraries of endangered and illegally traded species. Continued efforts of initiatives such as the Consortium for the Barcode of Life (CBOL) are essential. The CBOL aims to identify species, assess genetic diversity, and monitor the illegal wildlife trade (
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Eaton et al., 2010</xref>) by creating a cloud-based data storage and analysis workbench to support the use and assembly of DNA barcode data (
 <xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Ratnasingham and Hebert, 2007</xref>). With ever decreasing costs of high-throughput sequencing technology, molecular barcodes for thousands of taxa can be generated simultaneously (
 <xref rid="bb0420" ref-type="bibr">Shokralla et al., 2015</xref>). This show great promises to address the immense task of sequencing standardised species-specific DNA sequences that are still missing in DNA libraries. Generalising the use of DNA barcoding for wildlife forensic science in EU border-crossing points also requires cutting-edge technology to be affordable, fast, easy to use by non-research scientists (e.g. custom officers) and feasible in the absence of well-equipped facilities (
 <xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">Minhos et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">Menegon et al., 2017</xref>). Until recently, the prohibitive cost of high-throughput sequencing machines was a significant disadvantage precluding their use for screening samples at boarders in a large extent. But the recent advent in inexpensive mobile laboratory DNA sequencing technologies such as MinION, developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (
 <xref rid="bb0490" ref-type="bibr">University of Leicester, 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">MinION, 2017</xref>) brings hopes to facilitate future investigations at EU border check points (
 <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Krehenwinkel et al., 2019</xref>). Policies that promote comprehensive research to make this technology even more cost efficient and less labor intensive (e.g. sample preparation) would eventually open up the potential of generalising its use at EU border check points.
