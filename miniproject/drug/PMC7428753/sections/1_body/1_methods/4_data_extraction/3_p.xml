<p id="p0035">The primary endpoint of the study was poor outcome, including mortality, severe COVID-19, and the need for ICU care. Severe COVID-19 was defined as patients who had any of the following features at the time of admission or after admission: (1) respiratory distress (≥30 breaths per min); (2) oxygen saturation at rest ≤ 93%; (3) ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO
 <sub>2</sub>) to fractional concentration of oxygen inspired air (fiO
 <sub>2</sub>) ≤ 300 mmHg; or (4) critical complication (respiratory failure, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction/failure) [
