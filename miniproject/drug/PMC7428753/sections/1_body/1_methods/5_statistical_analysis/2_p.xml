<p id="p0040">The meta-analysis of the included studies was performed using STATA 16.0 (StataCorp LLC, Texas, US). Meta-analysis of proportions was used to pool the incidence of arrhythmia in the groups. Dichotomous variables were calculated to obtain risk ratios (RRs) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Random effect models were used regardless of heterogeneity. The p-values were two-tailed and statistical significance was set at ≤ 0.05. A sensitivity analysis by leave-one-out was performed to test the robustness of the findings. To assess the small-study effect, we performed a regression-based Egger’s test. Random-effects meta-regression was performed for gender, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, respiratory comorbidities, and lymphopenia.</p>
