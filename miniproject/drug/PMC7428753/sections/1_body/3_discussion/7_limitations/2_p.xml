<p id="p0100">This systematic review and meta-analysis has several limitations. First, the types of cardiac arrhythmias were not described in the included studies. Second, the risk of publication bias was high, as indicated by the asymmetrical funnel plot analysis and statistically significant Eggerâ€™s test. Third, most of the studies are from China and may not be generalizable to other populations. Fourth, the number of studies were limited and not divided into arrhythmias versus non-arrhythmias; hence, we were not able to assess the risk factors for cardiac arrhythmias in these patients. Fifth, the studies did not report the level of electrolytes. Sixth, the studies were mostly retrospective. The predictive power of meta-regression analysis is weaker if the number of studies are &lt;10. Nevertheless, this study emphasizes the clinical importance of arrhythmia in patients with COVID-19, and further studies should explore cardiac arrhythmias in these patients.</p>
