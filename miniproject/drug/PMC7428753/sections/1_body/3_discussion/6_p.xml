<p id="p0095">Furthermore, QT-prolonging drugs are frequently used in the management of COVID-19, synergistically amplifying the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Drugs such as azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine are associated with QT prolongation [

 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Azithromycin is known to prolong the QT interval [
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and increase the risk of cardiovascular death [
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The anti-malarial chloroquine is associated with prolonged QT interval with or without azithryomycin according to a randomized controlled trial from the Pfizer Labs [

 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Interestingly, Hu et al. reported that these drugs are associated with severe COVID-19, thus potentially affecting the association between arrhythmia and severe COVID-19 [

 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This score may be used to guide treatment choices for patients with COVID-19.
