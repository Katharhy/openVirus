<p id="p0090">Arrhythmia may be attributed to metabolic disarray, hypoxia, inflammation, or neurohormonal stress associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, COVID-19 induced coagulopathy may cause thrombosis leading to hypoxia [

 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additionally, which patients often present electrolyte abnormalities that may precipitate/exacerbate cardiac arrhythmias [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 itself has been shown to cause cardiac injury signified by increase in cardiac biomarkers [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. After activation of the viral surface spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 by the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), the virus binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which has high affinity to the human receptor [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The aforementioned enzyme is highly expressed in cardiac pericytes [
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], infection, and subsequent immune response may cause damage to the heart. Myocardial inflammation, ion channel dysfunction, electrophysiological and structural remodeling associated with viral myocarditis has been shown to cause life-threatening arrhythmias [
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Evidence shows that the rise of troponin is accompanied by increased inflammatory biomarkers, indicating the possible role of cytokine storm in cardiac injury [
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Systemic inflammation has been shown to prolong ventricular action potential duration through disturbance of the potassium channel [
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-1 may prolong the action potential duration through interplay with cardiomyocytes ion channels [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Elevated interleukin-6 during systemic inflammation may cause QT prolongation, which increases the risk for torsades de pointes [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].
