<p id="p0080">In 2018, Murphy et al. examined the efficacy of GS-441524 against FIP in 12 experimentally infected cats [
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Controls were not included, as historical data on untreated cats were available, demonstrating a mortality rate close to 100% [
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. After experimental challenge with the FIP virus, 2 cats did not develop FIP-related signs and remained untreated [
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the 10 infected cats, treatment was initiated upon onset of FIP-associated clinical signs (~10–18 days post infection), and continued for 2 weeks. Of these cats, half (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) were treated with a 5 mg/kg dose of GS-441524 administered subcutaneously once per day, and the other half (n = 5) were treated with 2 mg/kg daily. If disease recurred after initial treatment, cats were re-treated using the same regimen for another 2 weeks. Follow-up continued for 8 months. All treated cats demonstrated favorable responses to GS-441524 treatment within 24–48 h, regardless of dose, and were still alive and clinically unremarkable 8 months post infection. Two cats (one from each dose group) experienced disease recurrence at 4 weeks and 6 weeks after initial treatment and were re-treated. Adverse events related to treatment, other than temporary discomfort at the injection site, were not observed. This study was based on a small number of animals, and it is unclear whether experimental infection is a relevant representation of naturally-occurring FIPV infection in cats. Future studies with additional follow-up time would be helpful for assessing whether unexpected long-term sequelae are observed in the cats, since such information on surviving animals is sparse given the high fatality rate.
