<p id="p0110">Overall, past studies on other CoVs may have limited generalizability to the virus underlying the current pandemic because of the high genetic diversity of the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family, although broad-spectrum drugs tend to be directed at well-conserved targets [
 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In addition to this issue, there are a number of factors that can impact how predictive findings from 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> or 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> models may be of clinical efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. For example, drugs that may be effective 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> may not have clinical utility if the therapeutic dose induces severe adverse events in the patient. Alternatively, if the treatment dose does not attain an effective serum concentration in patients, or if EC
 <sub>50</sub> is greater than the achievable maximum serum concentration (C
 <sub>max</sub>), then the drug is less likely to have therapeutic utility. With regard to animal models, how closely the model represents disease pathogenesis and drug metabolism in humans can be challenging to gauge.
