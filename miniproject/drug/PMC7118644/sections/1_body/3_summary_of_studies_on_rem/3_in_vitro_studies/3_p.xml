<p id="p0050">In studies of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in human respiratory epithelial cell cultures, remdesivir has demonstrated strong antiviral activity (EC
 <sub>50</sub> ≈ 0.07 μM for either virus) with relative consistency, and has been shown to be capable of inhibiting MERS-CoV replication at levels below those that would result in unacceptable cytotoxicity [

 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Interestingly, a study published in February 2020 by Wang et al. was the first, to our knowledge, to examine the effect of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2, the HCoV involved in the current pandemic [
 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This study investigated the impact of seven different drugs on viral titers, cytotoxicity, and infection rates, using Vero E6 cells (a cell line originating from African green monkey kidney epithelial cells). They found low potency of most of these drugs for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. EC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranged widely from 109.5 μM for ribavirin to 1.13 μM for choloquine and 0.77 μM for remdesivir, which were the two drugs that required the lowest concentrations for blocking viral infection.
