<p id="p0060">Further, this study detected a weaker antiviral effect against porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV; 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), particularly when tested in porcine cell lines. Among currently known CoVs, PDCoV has the least similar RdRp sequence compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (only 67–69% similarity in amino acid sequence) [
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In fact, the RdRp of PDCoV has a different amino acid at a specific site (phenylalanine to leucine at residue 483), a dissimilarity that has been previously associated with increased resistance to remdesivir in other CoVs [
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, it was important to attempt to disentangle whether the lower antiviral activity observed could be related to a viral characteristic of PDCoV or if it could be attributable to differences in the cell lines used. While diminished potency of remdesivir against PDCoV was noted in cultures of porcine kidney epithelial cells (LLC-PK1), in a human liver cell line (Huh7), the EC
 <sub>50</sub> was relatively low (EC
 <sub>50</sub> not reached in LLC-PK1 
 <italic>vs.</italic> EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.02 μM in Huh7; 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Similarly, the EC
 <sub>50</sub> was substantially higher for antiviral activity against an endemic HCoV (229E) in the porcine cell line (3.8 μM compared to 0.02 μM in Huh7), again indicating the likely lower potency of the drug in this context. Thus, the observed variations in remdesivir potency against the same viruses in the different cell lines may imply that there is some factor associated with the cell line, rather than the virus, that may be affecting the drug's antiviral activity. In fact, the authors state that these findings may imply that LLC-PK1 cells lack a cellular process necessary for remdesivir antiviral activity, which could also support the hypothesis that remdesivir may have another mechanism of action that is not presently understood.
