<p id="p0130">Nonetheless, there are hundreds of clinical trials ongoing internationally on different drugs that utilize various mechanisms of action [

If the trial findings are ultimately positive, it will be imperative to ensure that the drug is produced on a commercial scale capable of meeting the demand generated by both the current pandemic and future outbreaks. Such a change in production may also allow for the added benefit of the drug becoming more available for agricultural and veterinary use for relevant indications.
