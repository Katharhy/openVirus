<p id="p0020">Viruses classified under the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family are enveloped positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that exhibit high genetic diversity [
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Within the 
 <italic>Orthocoronavirinae</italic> subfamily, there are four genera: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus, and deltacoronavirus. Viruses in this family can infect a wide variety of host species, such as birds, humans, and non-human mammals, including dromedary camels, alpacas, domestic pigs, dogs, cats, ferrets, minks, and bats [

 <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, only viruses of the alpha- and betacoronavirus genera infect humans [
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], though those in the gamma- and deltacoronavirus genera have indirect effects through economic impacts on the agricultural production of poultry and pigs [
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Host specificity is believed to be largely dependent upon variation in the CoV spike attachment glycoprotein [
 <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although the infectivity of most strains is host species-specific, host range is wide across different CoVs, and some bat CoVs rely on the same host receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme-2; ACE-2) as human CoVs to facilitate entry into cells [

 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It has been hypothesized that the CoV propensity for host-switching may partly be attributable to recombination events that alter the spike protein, which, in turn, affects interactions with host receptors (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, ACE-2) [
