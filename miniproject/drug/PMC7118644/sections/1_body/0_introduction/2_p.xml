 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and for the majority of the past six decades, HCoVs have generally maintained a relatively innocuous reputation as a cause of the common cold [
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, public perception and awareness of HCoVs has shifted considerably in the last twenty years, with the onset of three high profile outbreaks that have garnered international attention and have subsequently led to renewed interest in potential therapeutic options for HCoV-related illnesses. In 2002–2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infected more than 8000 people, reaching 26 countries and resulting in a 10% case fatality rate [
 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the ~7 years between April 2012 and November 2019, there were 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that reached 27 countries and had a mortality rate of approximately 34% [
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], though serologic studies have implied that the prevalence of MERS-CoV may have been underestimated [
 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Most recently, the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 in Wuhan and its subsequent spread to over 160 countries across the world has generated intense interest in vaccine development and treatment options for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [
