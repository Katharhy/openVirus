<p id="Par3">In a very recent work by a research team led by Drs. Gengfu Xiao, Wu Zhong and Zhihong Hu, the antiviral efficiency of the FDA-approved drugs including ribavirin, penciclovir, nitazoxanide, nafamostat, chloroquine (CQ) and two well-known broad-spectrum antiviral drugs remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734) and favipiravir (T-705) were evaluated against a clinical isolate of 2019-nCoV in a cell culture infection model (Wang 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020</xref>). The authors found that two compounds CQ (EC
 <sub>50</sub> value = 1.13 μmol/L; CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 μmol/L, SI &gt; 88.50) and RDV (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.77 μmol/L; CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 μmol/L; SI &gt; 129.87) potently blocked virus infection at low-micromolar concentration and showed high selectivity index (SI). From the
