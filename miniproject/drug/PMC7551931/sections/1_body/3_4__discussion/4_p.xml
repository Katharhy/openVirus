<p>Analysis of the potential binding sites on the viral particle suggests that PSSNa may bind with the fusion loop of E protein dimer, as it has been shown that the ZIKV fusion loop of E protein dimer is positively charged and is likely to interact with anionic compounds [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00926" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In all assays, the superiority of high molecular weight PSSNa compared to the ones with lower MW was observed. One may speculate that such an activity may result from the interaction between the polymer and several concatamerically distributed E protein molecules on the virus sphere. In such a mechanism, a single, long, flexible polymer chain simultaneously blocks many potential sites of virus protein responsible for binding to cell attachment factors or entry receptors. Furthermore, similarly, as we described earlier for the HTCC molecule antiviral activity directed against corona viruses we speculate that the “mechanism of the zipper”, where the sum of weak interactions results in effective and selective inhibition [
