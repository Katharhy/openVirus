<p>Natural and synthetic polymers play a crucial role in pharmaceutical research and the development of new drugs. Currently, polymers are most often used as inactive carriers of low molecular weight drugs, increasing their bioavailability and stability. However, increasing evidence suggests their possible use as drugs. Unlike low molecular weight drugs, polymers exhibit multivalency of interactions with their molecular target, often mimicking natural processes such as attachment of viruses to the surface of a host cell. This is a mechanism absent in the case of low molecular weight drugs that can bring major therapeutic benefits. Despite the skeptical approach to the results of research conducted since the 1960s, new methods of design and synthesis, characterization of polymers enable the production of polymers with precisely defined biological functions and properties. For this reason, new synthetic polymers are likely to be used as drugs in many areas of medicine, including antiviral drugs.</p>
