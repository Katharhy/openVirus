<p>In this work, we have shown that a negatively charged polymer, poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSSNa) can efficiently hamper ZIKV infection in vitro by directly binding to the virus and preventing the attachment of the virus to the host cell. PSSNa vastly decreases the viral replication in vitro in a number of cellular models, indicating broad specificity regardless of the model. The low toxicity of this synthetic polymer is also advantageous. Importantly, PSSNa can effectively treat ongoing infections, without loss in antiviral activity over time, as indicated in Assay IV. Importantly, we showed that PSSNa inhibits different ZIKV strains derived from various host species including humans, rhesus monkey, and mosquito. Further studies, however, are required to find out if PSSNa can permanently inactivate ZIKV virions or produce a stable virus–PSSNa complex. Therefore, another possibility is to utilize PSSNa as an “active antiviral platform” for low molecular weight drugs, peptides or neutralizing antibodies. Such combination may improve the effect of low molecular weight inhibitors, reduce their toxicity, or reduce their effective virus inhibitory doses.</p>
