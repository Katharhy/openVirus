<p>In summary, for the first time, we presented a systematic study on the inhibitory action of PSSNa on the ZIKV entry. Poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) is an already FDA approved drug (Kayexalate) for treating hyperkalemia as a potassium binder administered orally. Tolevamer, a soluble anionic poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate), was developed for the treatment of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. It did not pass Phase III clinical trials due to poor response to therapy (47%) [

Meticulous in vivo and clinical studies will allow exploring the potential of PSSNa in the treatment of Zika virus infections. Our study proves that high activity and low toxicity, as well as simple chemical structure and an array of possible modifications indicate the high potential of PSSNa as an anti-ZIKV agent.
