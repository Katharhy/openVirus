<p>XTT Cell Viability Assay kit (Biological Industries Cromwell, CT, USA) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were incubated with PSSNa at different concentrations of for three (Vero cells), four (U251), or seven days (HSF cells) at 37 °C. After incubation, the medium was discarded, and 100 μL of fresh medium was overlaid on cells. Then, 50 μL of the activated 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulphenyl)-(2H)-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) solution was added, and samples were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The absorbance (λ = 450 nm) was measured using Spectra MAX 250 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Data were presented as the ratio of signal from the tested sample and the control sample (solvent-treated cells) × 100%.</p>
