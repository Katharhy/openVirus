<p>ZIKV stock (100 μL) was mixed with 1 mg/mL PSSNa or H
 <sub>2</sub>O at room temperature for 1 h. Then, RNase (A&amp;A Biotechnology, Gdynia, Poland) was added to the final concentration of 100 µg/mL and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. We used 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma–Aldrich, Poznan, Poland) as a positive control. Then, RNA isolation and RT-qPCR analyses were performed as described above. To ensure that a high concentration of PSSNa does not affect RNA isolation and analyses, PSSNa control samples without RNase were included.
