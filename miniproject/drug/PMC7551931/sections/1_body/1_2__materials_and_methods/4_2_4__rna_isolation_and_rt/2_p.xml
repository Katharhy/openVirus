<p>The RT-qPCR reaction was carried out using 3 μL of isolated viral RNA, which was reverse transcribed and amplified in a 10 μL reaction containing 1 × GoScript ™ RT Mix for 1-Step RT-qPCR, 1× GoTaq Probe qPCR Master Mix with dUTP, 300 nM specific probe labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) (5′ FAM–CGG CAT ACA GCA TCA GGT GCA TAG GAG-TAMRA-3′), and 450 nM of each primer (5′ TTG GTC ATG ATA CTG CTG ATT GC 3′ and 5′ CCT TCC ACA AAG TCC CTA TTG C 3′). The reaction was carried out in a thermal cycler (CFX96 Touch Real-197 Time PCR Detection System, Bio-Rad) under the following conditions: 45 °C 15 min (reverse transcription), 95 °C 2 min, then 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 60 °C. Appropriate standards were prepared to evaluate the number of viral RNA molecules in the sample.</p>
