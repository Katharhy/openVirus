<p>Isolation of viral RNA was carried out using a commercially available RNA isolation kit (Viral DNA/RNA Isolation Kit, A&amp;A Biotechnology, Poland) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Isolated RNA was subjected to reverse transcription (RT) and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) using the GoTaq
 <sup>Â®</sup> Probe 1-Step RT-qPCR System Protocol kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Due to the well-known ability of highly charged polymers to affect the RNA isolation process, the supernatants were diluted 1000-fold prior to isolation [
