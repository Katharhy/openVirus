<p>The assay was performed as described before with some modifications. To test whether virions bind to PSSNa, coverslips were placed in 12-well plates, overlaid with 40 μg/mL bovine type I collagen (PureCol, Advanced BioMatrix, US) in PBS and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Then, coverslips were washed twice with PBS, and tested compound or control (PBS) were added. Coverslips were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and washed with PBS. Subsequently, a virus or mock samples were applied. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Then, coverslips were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, and immunostained as described in confocal microscopy section. The number of virions for each focal plane was assessed using the ImageJ Fiji software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).</p>
