<p>Assay III, “Virus attachment assay”, allowed examining if tested polymers block the attachment of virus particles to the host cell. Cells were pre-cooled at 4 °C, overlaid with 100 µL of PSSNa (500 µg/mL) and ZIKV (TCID50 = 400/mL). Cells were incubated at 4 °C to allow the virus attachment, but not internalization to the host cell. Next, cells were washed thrice with PBS, and 100 µL of fresh media was added. Cells were incubated for four days at 37 °C, and supernatants were collected for RT-qPCR analyses.</p>
