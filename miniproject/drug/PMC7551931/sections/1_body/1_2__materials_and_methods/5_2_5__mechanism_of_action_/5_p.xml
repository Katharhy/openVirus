<p>Assay IV, “Virus replication, assembly, and egress assay”, examined whether compounds hamper late stages of ZIKV replication. Cells were infected with 100 µL ZIKV (TCID50 = 400/mL) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C to allow the virus to enter the cells. After incubation, cells were rinsed thrice with PBS, and 100 µL of PSSNa polymers in the growth medium was applied. Cells were incubated for four days at 37 °C, and supernatants were collected for RT-qPCR analyses.</p>
