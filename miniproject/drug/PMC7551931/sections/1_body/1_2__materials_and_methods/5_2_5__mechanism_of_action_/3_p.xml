<p>Assay II, “Cell protection assay”, verified if polymer interacts with the host cell and protects it from the infection. Cells were incubated with 100 µL of PSSNa (500 µg/mL) in growth media for 30 min at 37 °C. Then, cells were washed thrice with PBS and infected with 100 µL ZIKV (TCID50 = 400/mL). After four days of infection at 37 °C, supernatants were collected, and the number of ZIKV RNA copies was assessed using RT-qPCR.</p>
