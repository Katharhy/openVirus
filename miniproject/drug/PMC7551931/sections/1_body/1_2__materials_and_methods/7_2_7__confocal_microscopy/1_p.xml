<p>Cells were seeded on coverslips in 12-well plates (TPP, Trasadingen, Switzerland). After infection, cells were fixed using 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1 Triton X-100, and non-specific binding sites were blocked by incubation with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Bioshop Burlington, ON, Canada) in PBS for 2 h. Subsequently, cells were incubated for 2 h with 1 μg/mL rabbit anti-ZIKV envelope antibody (GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA). After three PBS washes, cells were incubated for 1 h with 2.5 µg/mL of Atto 488 goat anti-rabbit antibody and phalloidin conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 (0.2 U/mL, Invitrogen, Warsaw, Poland). Subsequently, cells were washed thrice with PBS and nuclei (DNA) were stained with DAPI (0.1 μg/mL, Sigma–Aldrich, Poznan, Poland) for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS and coverslips with immunostained cells were mounted on glass slides in ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant medium (Life technologies, Eugene, OR, USA) and sealed. Fluorescent images were acquired using Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany) and processed using ImageJ (ver. 1.52b) Fiji software (Madison, WI, USA) [
