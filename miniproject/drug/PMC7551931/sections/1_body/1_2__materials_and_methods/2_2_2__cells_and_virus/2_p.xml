<p>Zika virus strains, H/PF/2013, MR-776, PRAVABC59, Human/2015/Honduras and Mosquito/1966/Malaysia, were acquired from BEI Resources (Manassas, VA, USA). Stocks of ZIKV were obtained by infecting 90% confluent Vero cells with TCID50 = 400/mL. The cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed 3–4 days post-infection. Cells were lyzed by three consecutive freeze–thaw cycles, and the supernatant was collected, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. The TCID50 value of the stock was measured using Reed and Muench method [
