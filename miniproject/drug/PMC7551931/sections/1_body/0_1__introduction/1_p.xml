 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00926" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The ZIKV is a mosquito-borne arbovirus, for which Aedes mosquitoes are competent vectors. The virus is transmitted mainly by Aedes aegypti, known to be active during the morning hours, but other Aedes species, including Aedes albopictus, has also been reported. The Aedes mosquitoes are amongst the invasive species, expanding its geographic range which consequently brings the threat of arboviral infections also to the temperate zones [
