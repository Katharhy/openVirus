<p>We and others found highly charged polymeric compounds as effective replication inhibitors of human and animal viruses. These include natural and synthetic polymers and their derivatives. Both cationic and anionic macromolecules were shown to be effective, including carrageenans, heparan sulfate, and sulfate derivatives of cellulose and lignin, dextran, chitosan, curdlan, xylan, and fucoidans and synthetic polymers such as sulfonated derivatives of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (NSPAHs), dendrimers containing sulfonic groups, poly(sodium styrenesulfonate) and its copolymer with maleic acid, poly(methacrylic acid) functionalized with ribavirin, telomerized Ï‰-acryloyl anionic surfactants and poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(3-(methacryloylamino)propyl trimethylammonium chloride) (PEG-b-PMAPTAC). These and many other polymers hamper a variety of pathogenic viruses, such as influenza A and B virus [
