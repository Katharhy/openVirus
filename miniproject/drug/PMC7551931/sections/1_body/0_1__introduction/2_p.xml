<p>The infection is frequently asymptomatic (80% of cases), and the disease associated with the virus is mild-to-moderate [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00926" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For that reason, the disease was neglected for years, and it was not considered to be a healthcare threat. After the epidemic spread in 2016, however, it was noted that, in some cases, it had severe sequelae. The most striking effect is observed in pregnant women if the mother is infected with ZIKV during the first trimester of pregnancy, as congenital malformations of the fetus occur in about 11% of cases [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00926" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00926" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The symptoms include increased muscle tone, hyperreflexia, spasticity, paroxysmal cramps, brain calcification, brain atrophy, and enlarged brain chambers [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00926" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. No defects have been observed in neonates born to mothers infected in the second or third trimester of pregnancy [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00926" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Less severe, but also notable consequences of the infection were observed in adults and included Guillain–Barré syndrome and other neurological disorders. Up to four weeks after the infection, neurological symptoms may occur in the form of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and approximately 50% of patients with neurologic sequelae experience bilateral facial palsy [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00926" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The pathomechanism leading to this syndrome is not yet fully understood. It is suspected that it may be related to the direct effect of the virus on nerve cells or excessive immune response to infection. Until now, no vaccine or drug is available to prevent or treat ZIKV infection.
