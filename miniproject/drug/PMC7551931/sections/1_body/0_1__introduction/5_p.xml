<p>The current work aimed to examine the inhibitory properties of poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSSNa) on the ZIKV replication in vitro. Antiviral properties of PSSNa have already been described for both human and animal pathogenic viruses [

 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00926" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Here, we show very potent inhibition of ZIKV by PSSNa in different cell systems. Studies on the mechanism of action revealed that PSSNa interacts directly with ZIKV, preventing its attachment to the host cell. Showing low cytotoxicity towards different cells, very potent anti-ZIKV properties, and beneficial physicochemical properties, PSSNa is a promising drug candidate for treating ZIKV infections.
