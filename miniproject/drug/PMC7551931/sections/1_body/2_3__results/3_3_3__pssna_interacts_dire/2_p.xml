<p>To further study the mechanism of action of PSSNa, an RNA digest assay was performed to study whether the interaction between ZIKV and PSSNa disrupts virion integrity, resulting in the release of the vRNA from the virus particle. The obtained results indicate only minor, non-significant drop in ZIKV RNA copies in PSSNa samples compare to Triton X-100 control, suggesting that PSSNa doesnâ€™t disrupt ZIKV particle integrity (
