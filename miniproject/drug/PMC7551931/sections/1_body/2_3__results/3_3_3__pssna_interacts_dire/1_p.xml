<p>To further explore the mechanism of action, four functional Assays (I-IV) were performed on U251 cells. The results suggest that PSSNa inactivated ZIKV particles and prevented their interaction with the host cells. Assay I showed that the preincubation of the virus with PSSNa restricted ZIKV viability (

Some inhibition was also observed in other assays where the polymer is present during the early stages of viral infection, but the effect was non-significant or mild (Assays II and III). While one cannot exclude an additional secondary mechanism of action, we believe that the observed effect also results from the virusâ€“polymer interaction. The polymers did not inhibit virus replication as shown in Assay IV, where polymers were incubated with cells after the infection. In order to avoid multiple cycles of infection, assay IV was carried out using ZIKV at TCID50 of 10,000 per mL, and cells were incubated for 12 h, which corresponds to the reported Flaviviridae replication cycle [
