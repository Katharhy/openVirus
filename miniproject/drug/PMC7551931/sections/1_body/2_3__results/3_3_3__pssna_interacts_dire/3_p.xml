<p>The E protein dimer displayed on the surface of mature ZIKV virions is responsible for the host cell entry factor binding and fusion [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00926" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Confocal images confirmed that PSSNa prevents the virus attachment to the cell. At low temperature blocking the virus internalization, PSSNa decreases the number of viral particles attached to the cell (
