<p>In addition to U251 cell line, virus inhibition assay was also carried out in Vero and HSF cells to ensure that the antiviral effect is not cell-dependent. Experiments showed a similar pattern of inhibition in Vero and U251 cells (

However, in the case of U251 cells a dose-dependent virus inhibition was noted only for PSSNa 29.1 and 3160 kDa, with IC50 of 14.3 and 8.8 µg/mL, respectively. In Vero cells, all tested PSSNa polymers hampered ZIKV infection in a dose-dependent manner. Low cytotoxicity and strong inhibition of ZIKA replication is expressed as a selectivity index (SI). The calculated SI values were high for U251 and Vero cells and are listed in
