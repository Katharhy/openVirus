<p>We also study whether the observed inhibitory effect of PSSNa would be observed in the case of other ZIKV strains. Cells were infected with four ZIKV strains of both Asian and African lineage and isolated from different host species (MR 766 (Rhesus/1947/Uganda), PRAVABC59 (Human/2015/Puerto Rico), Human/2015/Honduras, Mosquito/1966/Malaysia) in the presence of 250 Âµg/mL PSSNa. Obtained results indicate that PSSNa strongly suppresses the replication of all tested ZIKV strains. As before, it was observed that the PSSNa inhibitory properties depend on the length of the polymer chain. The strongest effect was observed against the human Asian PRAVABC59 strain, where all tested polymers except for 1.1 kDa inhibited the ZIKV replication below the detection limit of RT-qPCR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00926-f004">Figure 4</xref>). PSSNa hampers the replication of African lineage strain MR766. The molecular weight correlated with the PSSNa inhibitory activity. While polymers with shorter chaining decreased the virus yield 100 times, for PSSNa of 3160 kDa 1000 reduction in virus yield was recorded. Weaker inhibition was observed for strains Human/2015/Honduras and Mosquito/1966/Malaysia strains. The differences observed may be due to variability within the E protein between the strains. However, advanced comparative genetic studies are needed to test that hypothesis.
