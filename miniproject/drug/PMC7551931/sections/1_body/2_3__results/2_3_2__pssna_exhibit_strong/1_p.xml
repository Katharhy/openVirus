<p>In Assay I, U251 cells was infected with ZIKV in the presence or absence of each of 19 tested PSSNa polymers of different MW. RT-qPCR analyses showed potent inhibition of ZIKV replication at 0.5 mg/mL. Also, results indicate that in many cases PSSNa at this concentration limited ZIKV replication below the RT-qPCR detection threshold (1000 RNA copies per mL). We also observed that the inhibitory activity correlates, to some extent, with the MW of the polymer. As indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00926-f002">Figure 2</xref>, PSSNa polymers of higher MW exhibit a more substantial inhibitory effect (&gt;4 logs inhibition), while polymers of lower MW showed weaker inhibition (2â€“4 logs inhibition). However, this correlation had to be tested later using lower PSSNa concentrations. Therefore, for further studies, four polymers with MWs covering a broad range (1.1, 20.7, 29.1, and 3160 kDa) were selected.
