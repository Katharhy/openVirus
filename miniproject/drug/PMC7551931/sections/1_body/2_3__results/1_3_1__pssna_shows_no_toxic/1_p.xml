<p>XTT assay was carried out to assess the cytotoxicity of PSSNa. Confluent cells were incubated with solutions of PSSNa of different molecular weights (MW; 19 compounds) at various concentrations for three (Vero cells), four (U251 cells), or five days (HSF cells), reflecting the ZIKV replication time for each cell type. Our results indicate moderate cytotoxicity towards all tested cell lines only at very high doses of PSSNa (&gt;2 mg/mL) of high MW (

For the intermediate dose of 1 mg/mL the cytotoxicity could not be monotonically correlated to their MW, but PSSNa of &gt;105 kDa were amongst the most toxic ones. For PSSNa of lower MW we did not observe any marked cytotoxicity at any concentration.
