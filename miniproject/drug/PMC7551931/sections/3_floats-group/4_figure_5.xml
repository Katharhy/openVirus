  <p>PSSNa interacts with ZIKV particles and blocks their interaction with the receptor. Inhibitory activity of PSSNa of different MW at different stages of ZIKV infection cycle. Functional Assays Iâ€“IV were carried out on U251 cells as described in the Materials and Methods section using H/PF/2013 strain after the virus inactivation Assay I (Assay I, (
   <bold>A</bold>)), where the virus was pre-incubated with polymers, diluted and titrated on U251 cells. Modulation of virus yield as determined by RT-qPCR after the Cell protection assay (Assay II, (
   <bold>B</bold>)); Attachment assay (Assay III, (
   <bold>C</bold>)); or Virus replication, assembly, and egress assay (Assay IV, (
   <bold>D</bold>)). The inhibition of the infection was evaluated using RT-qPCR. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The results are presented as average values with standard deviations (error bars). An asterisk (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) indicates values that are significantly different from the control.
