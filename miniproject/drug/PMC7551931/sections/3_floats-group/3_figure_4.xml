  <p>Inhibition of different strains of ZIKV replication cycle by PSSNa. U251 cells were infected with the virus in the presence of different polymers for four days. Inhibition of the infection was evaluated using RT-qPCR. Data are shown as virus yield (copies of viral genome per milliliter). The results are presented as average values of at least three replications.</p>
