  <p>PSSNa blocks the attachment of ZIKV to host cells. Vero cells were inoculated with ZIKV H/PF/2013 (TCID50 = 10,000/mL) in the presence of 250 µg/mL PSSNa of 1.1 or 3160 kDa or control buffer. Cells were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h, fixed, and confocal images were collected. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Cell nuclei are denoted in blue, β-actin in red, and ZIKV E protein is denoted in green (indicated by arrows). Scale bar = 100 µm. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Confocal microscopy analysis of the number of particles on the surface of cells treated with PSSNa. The number of particles and the number of cells was assessed using ImageJ Fiji 3D Objects Counter tool. Each set shows data from a minimum of 45 fields of view registered from 7 different samples prepared in three independent experiments. An asterisk (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) indicates values that are significantly different from the control.
