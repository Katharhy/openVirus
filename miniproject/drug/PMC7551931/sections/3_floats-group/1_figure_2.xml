  <p>PSSNa inhibition of ZIKV replication correlates with the MW of the polymer. The assay was carried out in the U251 cells, infected with the ZIKV H/PF/2013 virus in the presence of different polymers at the concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. Inhibition of the infection was evaluated using RT-qPCR. Data are shown as virus yield (copies of viral genome per milliliter). All experiments were performed in triplicate. The results are presented as average values with standard deviations (error bars). An asterisk (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) indicates values that are significantly different from the control.
