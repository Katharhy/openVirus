  <p>PSSNa does not disrupt ZIKV particle integrity. ZIKV H/PF/2013 stock was incubated with 1 mg/mL PSSNa, then released RNA was digested with 100 Âµg/mL RNase. 1% Triton X-100 was used as a positive control. Results show RT-qPCR analyses (copies of viral genome per milliliter). The results are presented as average values with standard deviation (error bars) of at least three replications. An asterisk 
   <italic>(p</italic> &lt; 0.05) indicates values that are significantly different from the control.
