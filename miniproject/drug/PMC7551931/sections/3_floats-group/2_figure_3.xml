 <caption>
  <p>The inhibition of ZIKV H/PF/2013 replication cycle by PSSNa in different cell types. Inhibition of the infection was evaluated using RT-qPCR. U251 (
   <bold>A</bold>) and Vero (
   <bold>B</bold>) cells were infected in the presence of appropriate PSSNa concentrations for three and four days, respectively. Data are shown as logarithmic values of ZIKV RNA copy number per milliliter with standard deviation (error bars). The results are presented as average values of at least three replications.
