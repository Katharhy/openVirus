 <p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne pathogen associated with microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities in newborns as well as neurologic complications in adults. The explosive transmission of the virus in the last ten years put it in the limelight and improved our understanding of its biology and pathology. Currently, no vaccine or drugs are available to prevent or treat ZIKV infections. Knowing the potential of flaviviruses to broaden their geographic distribution, as observed for the West Nile virus, it is of importance to develop novel antiviral strategies. In this work, we identified poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSSNa) as a new polymeric ZIKV inhibitor. We demonstrated that PSSNa inhibits ZIKV replication in vitro both in animal and human cells, while no cytotoxicity is observed. Our mechanistic studies indicated that PSSNa acts mostly through direct binding to ZIKV particle and blocking its attachment to the host cells.</p>
