<p>After the 2003 SARS epidemic, the Chinese government realised the severe deficiency in the primary level and recognised the failure in controlling the epidemic at the source. Since then, a great deal of attention is given to primary-level emergency responses in public health emergencies. In May 2003, the first official document, the Regulation on the Urgent Handling of Public Health Emergencies [
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], was issued. Relevant policies were gradually refined during the 17 years of development. Regarding organisational systems, the General Office of the State Council issued the Opinions on Strengthening Primary-level Emergency Management in July 2007 [
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] that clarified the division of responsibilities for primary-level emergency management. According to this policy, districts and counties were required to set up emergency committees, and subdistrict offices and township governments were made responsible for preventing and responding to various public emergencies within their respective administrative areas. Primary-level autonomous organisations such as neighbourhood committees and village committees were made responsible for mobilisation of resources. Regarding operational mechanisms, China launched the Contagious Disease National Direct Reporting System in early 2004 [

 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], stipulating that the primary-level organisations shall formulate emergency plans that conform to their local conditions. Regarding emergency assurance, the Law of the People's Republic of China on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases was promulgated in December 2004 [
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; it stipulated that various levels of local governments shall guarantee funds for the prevention of infectious diseases in urban communities and rural units. Regarding healthcare support, the former Ministry of Health issued Several Provisions on the Construction of the Disease Prevention and Control System in January 2005 [
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], requiring medical institutions in townships to conduct regular training and to establish long-term collaborative relationships with urban medical institutions. Regarding manpower support, the State Council issued Opinions on Strengthening the Construction of Primary-level Emergency Response Teams in October 2009 [
