<p>This epidemic demonstrated the challenges faced in primary-level disease prevention and control. First, the primary-level early warning and detection mechanism is not sound, and the Contagious Disease National Direct Reporting System for public health emergencies did not effectively perform its functions. Second, there are great differences in planning and functions among various communities, making control difficult. In addition, primary-level organisations have limited public resources at their disposal, have insufficient capability for performing emergency responses and administrative staff lack professional guidance on epidemic prevention and control. Third, the primary medical institutions did not play the role of safeguarding the social welfare of the people, as fever outpatient clinics in some institutions did not meet requirements, pre-screening and triage awareness was low and there were insufficient personal protective equipment, resulting in large gatherings of patients at hospitals at the early stages of the epidemic. In addition to gaps and deficiencies in epidemic control measures, the long-term effects of these shortcomings are also worthy of our consideration. The closed-off community management policies adopted by primary-level organisations in China resulted in severe inconvenience to residents, particularly among the elderly, handicapped and other special populations; additionally, it hindered the daily work of relevant service industries. In order to overcome the shortcomings of the primary-level prevention and control mechanism, we have proposed a few universal recommendations to guide future epidemic prevention and control: 
 <list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
   <p>Determining the responsible entities for the establishment of primary-level plans. During development of primary-level emergency response plans, focus should be at the county and township levels, communities (villages) and industries should be relied upon and the development of plans for communities, villages, schools and companies should be strengthened. Attention should be focused on the participation of experts and autonomous organisations in the development of emergency response plans and advocacy, and education on primary-level response to emergencies among residents should be strengthened to achieve positive effects.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Reconstruction of the joint prevention and control mechanism. The primary-level public health emergency command teams should include the leaders of neighbourhood committees, business associations, property management companies, government agencies in communities and various resident autonomous organisations as team members. Simultaneously, the responsibilities and tasks of all personnel in emergency response should be defined. We should have a deep grasp of the situation and the characteristics of different regions, actively establish partnerships with various parties, establish a comprehensive regional emergency material reserve system and strengthen emergency support.</p>

  <list-item>
   <p>Strengthening the infrastructure of the primary health service system. A system of initial visits at primary medical institutions should be effectively established to function on the long-term, that include pre-screening triage and construction of fever outpatient clinics. We should include the maintenance of protective gear reserves in the jurisdiction areas in the procurement and reserve plan of primary medical institutions. In order to increase the utilisation of health insurance policies, the construction of ‘hospital alliances’ and ‘medical cooperatives’ in China can be used as a reference [

    <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the roles and responsibilities of each medical unit in public health emergencies and routine health services in medical cooperatives should be defined, the division of labour and cooperative mechanism in medical units should be improved, a risk-bearing insurance system with full prepayment, surplus retention and reasonable above-quota sharing facilities should be established, and the proactiveness of primary medical personnel should be utilised.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Improving the information disclosure system. During public health emergency management, primary-level units should focus attention on information collection, management and interpretation, and disseminate relevant information to residents through bulletin boards, leaflets, telephone calls, social media and other media in a timely manner to prevent panic in residents.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Encouraging social agencies to participate in epidemic control and prevention. The setting up of volunteer teams should be improved so that volunteers are integrated to various aspects of emergency management. Emergency awareness should be integrated into the daily work of the government from the primary-level to the higher levels, and the efficiency of primary-level emergency response mechanism should be continuously improved.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Utilising information technology to provide primary-level support and assurance. Primary-level units should utilise information technology to construct data platforms for epidemic prevention and control and perform epidemic monitoring and management of key populations, enable access to epidemic management measures, perform information delivery, promote advocacy and education, promote environmental remediation, provide difficulty assistance, etc. [
    <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We recommend developing and using early warning technology that are better suited for villages and townships, so that the primary-level units can conduct real-time monitoring of the risks and hidden threats of public health emergencies and issue warning information such as warning level in a timely manner.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Establishing a sound care system for vulnerable populations. During public health emergencies, while providing rescue services, psychological intervention and counselling services to the affected residents, primary-level units should also provide special care services to patients with refractory and complicated diseases, patients with mental illness, bedridden patients, the elderly, the disabled, women and children according to relevant information obtained during daily work of these units to provide targeted humanistic care.</p>
