<p>This previously constructed primary-level disease prevention and control mechanism was utilised in the COVID-19 epidemic control. With regards to the prevention and control system, the primary-level units have established a joint prevention and control mechanism (a multi-ministerial coordination platform that was launched in response to the epidemic) to achieve disease prevention and control through multi-departmental involvement. For example, a community in Futian District of Shenzhen City established the ACT community prevention and control model (‘A, administration’, ‘C, community health service centre’, ‘T, trinity mechanism’) and constructed a community-wide joint prevention and control system. Regarding financial support, the central government allocated 60.33 billion RMB to fund basic public health services and primary-level epidemic prevention and control [

Regarding preventive and control measures, primary-level units implemented a grid-like prevention and control mechanism and community closure management and divided counties into low-, medium- and high-risk levels to prevent the coronavirus from spreading within the city/region or beyond [

Residents who required a physical examination were asked to make prior appointments at the hospitals at fixed time periods, so as to reduce patients from aggregating in hospitals leading to a risk of contact with infected patients. Simultaneously, primary medical institutions included the care of all cured patients with COVID-19 into the scope of GP services and implemented the ‘14 + 14 management’ for them (i.e. 14 days of centralised quarantine and rehabilitation management at a rehabilitation centre and 14 days of home rehabilitation management if no problems occurred). Regarding information management, various communities conducted prevention and control advocacy through push notifications in public WeChat official accounts [
