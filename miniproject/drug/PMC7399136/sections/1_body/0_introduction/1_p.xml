<p>In December 2019, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic began; it rapidly spread globally and has become a global public health emergency that severely threatens human health and social development. As the origin of the epidemic, China adopted epidemic prevention and control measures for several months before achieving phased results and effectively controlling the epidemic. The WHO–China Joint Mission on COVID-19 found that China had employed unprecedented public health response measures [

Primary-level organisations played an important role in the prevention and control of the epidemic as personnel from these organisations conducted data screening, material distribution and dissemination of knowledge on disease prevention and control and played a positive role in maintaining social stability and reducing social and economic losses. Primary-level epidemic control is the first line of epidemic control and is an effective barrier for the prevention of the spread of coronavirus within the city/region or beyond. Hence, China's primary-level epidemic control experience is worth learning from.
