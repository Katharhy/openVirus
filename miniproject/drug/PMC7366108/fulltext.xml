The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the sequence similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with other SARS-like bat viruses. The primary source and intermediate host are not yet confirmed, although transmission from human to human is universally confirmed. The new SARS-CoV-2 virus reaches cells via ACE-2 and subsequently down-regulates ACE-2, leaving angiotensin II unbalanced in affected organs primarily in the lungs, heart, brain, and kidneys. As reported recently, numerous secondary complications i.e., neurological, nephrological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, immune, and hepatic complications, are associated with COVID-19 infection along with prominent respiratory disease including pneumonia. Extensive research work on recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 is in the pipeline to clarify pathogenic mechanisms, epidemiological features, and identify new drug targets that will lead to the development of successful strategies for prevention and treatment. There are currently no appropriate scientifically approved vaccines/drugs for COVID-19. Nonetheless, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, azithromycin were tested against COVID-19 in clinical trials, and finally, FDA approved emergency use of remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Additionally, administration of convalescent plasma obtained from recovered COVID-19 patients to infected COVID-19 patients reduces the viral burden via immunomodulation. This review analysis therefore concentrates primarily on recent discoveries related to COVID-19 pathogenesis along with a full description of the structure, genome, and secondary complication associated with SARS-CoV-2. Finally, a short and brief clinical update has been provided concerning the development of therapeutic medications and vaccines to counter COVID-19.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="ab0010"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p><fig id="f0025" position="anchor"><alt-text id="al0045">Unlabelled Image</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="ga1_lrg"/></fig></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0015"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="l0005"><list-item id="li0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0005">COVID-19 is an emerging viral pandemic with no specific clinical treatment available.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">COVID-19 induces respiratory, neurological, cardiovascular, renal, and hepatic complications.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">USFDA authorizes Remdesivir for emergency use in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Convalescent plasma is another clinically used, practical approach to combat COVID-19.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">The immunomodulatory effect of convalescent plasma helps in reducing the SARS-CoV-2 viral load.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>ARI, acute renal injury</kwd><kwd>ANG-I, angiotensin I</kwd><kwd>ANG-II, angiotensin II</kwd><kwd>ACE-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2</kwd><kwd>CRI, chronic renal injury</kwd><kwd>CVD, cardiovascular diseases</kwd><kwd>CTD, C-terminal domain</kwd><kwd>ERGIC, endoplasmic reticulum-golgi intermediate compartment</kwd><kwd>NTD, N-terminal domain</kwd><kwd>MERS-CoV, middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus</kwd><kwd>RBD, receptor-binding domain</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2</kwd><kwd>TMPRSS, transmembrane protease serine protease-2 (TMPRSS-2)</kwd><kwd>5&#x02019;-UTR, 5&#x02032;-untranslated region</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group id="ks0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>Anti-viral drugs</kwd><kwd>Convalescent plasma</kwd><kwd>Vaccines</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0030">According to the World Health Organization (WHO), viral infections are widespread infectious diseases that cause serious public health concerns, resulting in thousands of deaths worldwide [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. There have been three zoonotic outbreaks caused by coronaviruses (CoVs) since the beginning of this century, i.e. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002, middle-east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, followed by the recent ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019. [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Numerous patients with baffling pneumonia secondary to an unknown virus emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and later the virus was identified as a new beta coronavirus and officially recognized as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. On 11th February 2020, the WHO named this disease as &#x0201c;COVID-19,&#x0201d; and subsequently, on 11th March 2020, the WHO declared the &#x0201c;COVID-19&#x0201d; a pandemic [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Currently, the outbreak has spread globally with approximately 10 million confirmed cases, 0.5 million confirmed deaths, and 5 million total worldwide recoveries as of 30th June 2020. Numerous pieces of evidences suggest that person-to-person transmission is an expected path for spreading of COVID-19 infection; primarily occurs via direct interaction or via microdroplets propagated by coughing or sneezing from an infected COVID-19 individual [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>]. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 vary from asymptomatic or symptomatic to clinical conditions marked by respiratory distress to systemic effects of sepsis, shock, and multiple syndromes of organ failure [<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The typical clinical highlights include headache, fever, sore throat, cough, fatigue, breathlessness [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>] and have a strong prognosis in general. A considerable number of COVID-19 cases, however, have progressed rapidly to severe forms, especially among older men with underlying diseases. Significant cases may involve dyspnea, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute heart injury, acute kidney injury, acute liver injury, neurological injury, gastrointestinal injury, immune failure, compromised coagulation and even death [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p id="p0035">CoVs belong to a large family of single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) and are broadly classified into four categories, alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. CoVs can infect humans as well as animals and can cause varieties of infections, including respiratory, enteric, renal, and neurological diseases [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. CoVs occupy a crown-like presence under an electron microscope due to the existence of spike-like glycoproteins on the viral envelope [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to &#x003b2;-coronavirus category, which contains shrouded and non-segmented single-stranded RNA virus [<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has shown 96.2% overall similarity with a bat CoV RaTG13 and 79.5% uniformity to SARS-CoV [<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. CoVs have been shown to penetrate the host cell via different mechanisms, which includes an endosomal and non-endosomal entry with the help of proteases [<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is well established now that SARS-CoV-2 makes use of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), the similar receptor used by SARS-CoV, to enter or to infect humans.</p><p id="p0040">Along with ACE-2, SARS-CoV-2 has shown to take the help of transmembrane protease serine protease-2 (TMPRSS-2) as the critical protease assisting their entrance into the human cell [<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This receptor (ACE-2) is widely expressed in pulmonary tissues as well as in some immune cells, including monocytes and macrophages [<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 virus entry into the human body stimulates the release as well as activation of monocyte, macrophage, and dendritic cell along with the release of cytokines (Interleukins). Further, IL-6 initiates an intensification cascade resulting in cis signaling with activation and differentiation of TH<sub>17</sub>, lymphocytic changes, and trans-signaling in endothelial cells [<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>].

This augmented systemic cytokine storm seen in SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed patients underwrites the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19 and known as the &#x0201c;cytokine storm&#x0201d;. Extreme COVID-19 patients show strong inflammatory response and transcriptomic RNA-seq reviews of COVID-19 patients showed that several immune pathways and pro-inflammatory cytokines CXCL, CCL2, CXCL2, CCL8, IL33 and CCL3L1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and TNFSF10, CXCL10, IL10, TIMP1, C5, IL18, AREG and NRG1 in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) were induced by SARS-CoV-2; suggesting a sustained inflammation and cytokine storm. Besides this, excessive apoptotic cell death of T cell resulting from flawed stimulation by dysfunction of dendritic cell might be a contributing factor to the COVID-19 immunopathology [<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Fortunately, 80% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic or suffer from mild symptoms due to the activation of the body's innate immune system by triggering the body's antiviral defense mechanisms, including natural killer cells and antiviral T cells, and interferon induction. Unfortunately, 20% of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals are the immune-compromised, aged, patients with underlying health conditions will experience more severe illness characterized by substantial respiratory symptoms leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and even death. Several epidemiological, genetic, and clinical elements of COVID-19 infection resemble previous SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection [<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Ironically, even after the frequent re-emergence of CoVs infections and after several years of research, we still lack vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat CoV infection, which further climaxes an unmet need to develop effective drugs/vaccines to prevent re-emergence of future CoV epidemics. Here, in this review, we have discussed about etiology, epidemiology, the structure of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, induced COVID-19 infection. Besides, a brief dialogue has been made on secondary complications associated with COVID-19. Lastly, we have reviewed current clinical therapy, potential therapeutic intervention followed by drugs and vaccines currently in clinical trials for COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Genome and structure of SARS-CoV-19</title><p id="p0045">Based on the taxonomic classification of viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is classified under the order Nidovirales, family <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>, and genus Betacoronavirus (&#x003b2;-CoV). All the viruses from this genus have a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA besieged by a lipid envelope. A phosphorylated capsid protein shields this single strand of RNA and both RNA &#x00026; capsid together form a nucleocapsid. This nucleocapsid is hidden within the phospholipid bilayers and coated by spike glycoprotein trimer (S) and probably the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein. Due to spike protein on the lipid envelope, SARS-CoV-2 holds the classic coronavirus structure with crown-like spikes (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a). The membrane (M) protein and the envelope (E) protein are sited among the spikes in the envelope. Apart from spike protein, it also expresses other proteins such as helicase, RNA polymerase, papain-like protease, 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, glycoprotein, and some other accessory proteins [<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. As mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 shows a 96% nucleotide identity with a coronavirus isolated from a bat (BetaCoV RaTG13), suggesting it as a bat origin virus [<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Two theories have been put forward to clarify the cross-species transmission of this virus. First, there might be an intermediate host between bats and humans. Most likely, it is pangolin as their genome is approximately 90% similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating two sub-lineages of this virus in the phylogenetic tree. As per the second theory, the rich genetic diversity and frequent recombination ability of SARS-CoV-2 might enhance the possibility for cross-species spread [<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The 29.9&#x000a0;kb genome of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank no. MN908947) encodes 9860 amino acids which include the 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (5&#x02019;-UTR), replicate open reading frame (orf) 1a/b, structural proteins, other orf such as 3, 6, 7a, 7b, 8 and 9b and the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (3&#x02019;-UTR) (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b). The 5&#x02019; UTR is 265&#x000a0;nt long, whereas 3&#x02019; UTR is 229&#x000a0;nt long. SARS-CoV-2 contains at least ten ORFs, including ORF1a/b, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and some other accessory genes, such as ORF3b and OFR8 [<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Almost two-third of viral RNA houses the first ORFs (ORF1a/b), which are further translated into two big polyproteins i.e. pp1a and pp1ab. These polyproteins are finally processed by different proteases into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1- nsp16) to produce the replicas-transcriptase complex. Moreover, the other ORFs, present on the other one-third part of the genome encode for four main structural proteins (S, E, M and N) proteins, as well as some accessory proteins with unknown functions [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The S, ORF3a, E, M, ORF8 and N genes are 3822, 828, 228, 669, 366 and 1260&#x000a0;nt in length, respectively.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>(a).

Each monomer of trimeric S-protein is about 180&#x000a0;kDa and contains a cleavable N-terminal signal peptide, a heavy N-glycosylated ectodomain, a transmembrane region and one cytoplasmic tail with lots of S-acylated C residues. The proteases cleave N-glycosylated ectodomain into two domains: the variable S1 and the more conserved S2 domains (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>
). In general, the S1 domain is associated with receptor-binding events, whereas S2 is involved in membrane fusion [<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Structurally, N- and C- terminal of S1 fold as two separate domains: N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD). The CTD contains a loosely attached receptor-binding domain (RBD) to bind with the host cell receptor i.e. ACE2 promptly (refer article by [<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] for detailed information). Homology modeling between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV has shown that both have a similar RBD formation. The SARS-CoV-2 RBD has a twisted five-stranded antiparallel &#x003b2; sheet (&#x003b2;1, &#x003b2;2, &#x003b2;3, &#x003b2;4 and &#x003b2;7) with small connecting helices and loops forming as the core.

They function as viroporins by modifying the host cell membranes and thus facilitates the release of virus from the infected cells. The M protein provides a distinct shape to the viral envelope by interacting with the nucleocapsid and by specific packaging of the viral genome into the virion. Generally, M proteins in different coronaviruses display variable amino acid contents; however, all contain the same 3-D structure with a small N-terminal, three transmembrane domains, and a long C-terminal. The N protein is multi-functional protein as it is involved in complex formation with single-stranded RNA, enabling M-N protein interactions during the packaging of virion particles, and augmenting the transcription process of the viral genome. N protein is also made up of three conserved domains- an N-terminal domain (NTD), a linker region, and a C-terminal domain (CTD). The highly variable NTD interacts electrostatically with the 3&#x02032; end of the viral RNA. Similarly, the serine and arginine-rich LKR region also interacts with viral RNA in vitro<italic>.</italic> However, its main role is in signal transduction, where it acts as an antagonist to attenuate the antiviral responses of the host (for e.g. Interferon, RNAi) [<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><label>3</label><title>Pathogenesis of COVID-19: human-virus interaction with specific focus on ACE-2 receptor</title><p id="p0060">At the molecular level, the virus-human interaction starts with the binding of S-protein to the ACE-2 receptor, followed by the fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane. S-proteins are activated by priming cleavage (between S1 and S2) and activating cleavage (on S2&#x02019; site) by one or several host proteases. Depending on the sequence of the S1/S2 cleavage site, the priming cleavage can be done by different host cell proteases, including furin, transmembrane protease serine protease-2 (TMPRSS-2), TMPRSS-4, cathepsins, trypsin, or human airway trypsin-like protease [<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, the accessibility of a particular protease in the host cell cannot be a regulating factor for the pathogenicity of SARS-Cov-2, because S-proteins are well-known to modify protease cleavage sites so that different proteases can perform the cleavage of S. This is one of the mechanisms adopted by SARS-Cov-2 to infect and fuse with different host cell membranes [<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Apart from this, SARS-CoV-2 encodes several proteins to attenuate the innate immune responses, especially the activation of type 1 interferon in host cells, ultimately leading to an enhanced immunopathogenesis. The nsp15 (also known as endoribonuclease EndoU) is vital for restraining the detection of viral RNA by specific cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors [<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p id="p0065">The NTD of S1 displays a galectin (galactose-binding lectins) structural fold to get attached to the sugar on the surface of the host cell. On the other hand, binding to the ACE-2 is assisted by the CTD of S1.

Since both FP and IFP are essential for the virus entry into the host cell [<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], S protein is required to be cleaved by proteases at both priming and activating cleavage sites to release out these peptides [<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

In physiological conditions, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a master regulator of the renin-angiotensin system and one of best in target enzymes for the treatment of hypertension. The protease renin converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (ANG I), which is consequently transformed to ANG II by ACE.

One possible mechanism of renal impairment may be due to hypoxia, shock, and rhabdomyolysis exerted by cytokine storm. Also, dehydration resulting from fever or decreased fluid intake has various impacts on the kidney, ranging from the reduction of glomerular filtration rate to ARI.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA presence was detected in stools of 15.3% of patients on hospital presentation, including patients without any GI symptoms. In addition, patients with presenting diarrhea had higher stool RNA presence and viral load than patients with no diarrhea. Due to 80% similarity to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 persuaded GIT infection is not surprising and is specified to be mediated through the ACE2 cell receptors. ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the small intestine, especially in proximal and distal enterocytes, and the binding affinity of ACE2 receptors determines infectivity. Since ACE2 modulates bowel inflammation, SARS-CoV-2 can disrupt ACE2 &#x02018;s function and lead to diarrhea [<xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].

These processes may constitute the underlying mechanism for higher mortality and morbidity in COVID-19 patients with diabetes.

Therefore, it can be concluded that though pre-existing diabetes worsens the consequences in COVID-19 patients, but the predisposition of the diabetic population to SARS-CoV-2 infection may not be higher as compared to healthy people.</p><p id="p0145">A previous study of SARS-CoV patients without pre-existing diabetes (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;39) has reported that 20 of the 39 SARS-CoV patients developed diabetes during hospitalization because immunostaining of ACE-2 in the pancreatic tissue suggested that SARS-CoV might have damaged pancreatic islets and caused acute Type I diabetes mellitus like condition [<xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Whereas in the case of SARS-COV-2, evidence is still lacking to confirm that pancreatic destruction in COVID-19 patients. The development of a viral infection in diabetic patients renders them harder to treat due to oscillating blood glucose levels and the presence of other secondary diabetic complications. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that the treatment of COVID-19 cum diabetic patients with ACE-2 stimulatory drugs might increase the risk of acquiring more severe and fatal COVID-19. Another component that should be considered is the existence of ACE-2 polymorphisms in Asian populations, which is further linked to diabetes mellitus and hypertension, genetically predisposes towards increased risk of SARS-COV-2 infection [<xref rid="bb0490" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. In a nutshell, intake of ACE inhibitors may lead to the upregulation of ACE-2 receptors in diabetic patients, binding of spike (S) glycoprotein to the ACE-2 is a vital step for virus entry into human cells. Additionally, some other notions have been proposed that the immune system is exceedingly compromised in diabetic subjects, which render them harder to combat the virus and likely result in a more extended recovery period. Secondly, the virus can flourish for a longer time in an atmosphere of high blood glucose ([<xref rid="bb0385" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://diabetesvoice.org/en/news/covid-19-and-diabetes/" id="ir0485">https://diabetesvoice.org/en/news/covid-19-and-diabetes/</ext-link>).</p><p id="p0150">Pregnant females are exceptionally predisposed to viral pathogens and pneumonia since a lot of physiologic alterations takes place in the respiratory, cardiac and immune systems (for e.g. diaphragm gets elevated, oxygen demand increased, along with edema of the upper respiratory tract), [<xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="bb0465" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>].

Despite having a limited sample size, the study concluded zero cases of intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from moms with COVID-19 to their fetuses/neonates [<xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. In April 2020, a study from around 25 different hospitals in China has been published with clinical records of pregnant women (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;116) with COVID-19 pneumonia between January 20 and March 24, 2020. The median gestational age of all pregnant women was 36&#x000a0;weeks, and common symptoms observed were fever (50.9%,) and cough (28.4%,); whereas 23.3% women were without symptoms. The proof of maternal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in nasopharynx, amniotic fluid and blood of neonates. The authors concluded that the observed clinical symptoms of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia are identical to those of non-pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. Currently, there is a paucity of data to confirm that pregnant women with COVID 19 are more susceptible to severe pneumonia and vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to fetus during the third- trimester of pregnancy [<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although these two recent studies are of the same viewpoint, but the maternal-fetal transmission cannot be ruled out. Most recently, a systematic review has been published with data of 172 pregnant women and 162 neonates from 23 studies conducted in different countries to examine the risk or occurrence of maternal-fetal SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The authors have concluded that in pregnant women infected with COVID-19, diabetes and hypertension are among the top associated comorbidities and there is a risk of pre-mature fetal delivery. Moreover, the newborn child to COVID-19 mothers have displayed the occurrence of respiratory distress syndrome as well as pneumonia and some proof of vertical maternal-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref rid="bb0405" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>].</p><p id="p0155">A recent study on pediatric patients with COVID-19 (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2143) observed that marginally more boys (56.6%) are influenced in the COVID-19 outbreak as compared to girls (43.4%) but with non-significant gender difference.

Moreover, the children's COVID-19 cases were less severe as compared to adults' cases, and this is somewhat perplexing. This difference may be associated with exposure time as well as host factors.

Furthermore, the immune system of children is in the developing phase and might react to pathogens differently in contrast to adults.

Apheresis is the safest advised technique to acquire plasma, and this technique first involves the collection of blood from COVID-19 survivors, followed by plasma separation from blood cells. The same separated plasma is then infused into the circulation of severely ill COVID-19 patients [<xref rid="bb0445" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. In this context, Chinese authorities were the first to have reported success in treating COVID-19 infected patients with contributed plasma from survivors of the illness, the intended benefit being shielding antibodies formed in the blood of the survivors [<xref rid="bb0445" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Currently, convalescent plasma administration to COVID-19 patients has been shown to lessen viral burden and enhance clinical status [<xref rid="bb0450" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The likely mechanisms of action of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 patients may be attributed to the immediate neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, decrease in the intensity of the hyperactive immune system, decrease in cytokine storm, Th1/Th17 ratio, decrease complement system activation and alteration of a hypercoagulable state [<xref rid="bb0450" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. During plasma transfusion, in addition of transfer of neutralizing antibodies, some immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM), anti-inflammatory cytokines, anti- clotting factors, defensins, pentraxins are too transferred to COVID-19 patients, which might confer additional health benefits and fasten the recovery [<xref rid="bb0450" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. In a nutshell, the transfer of numerous aforementioned blood factors during the transfusion process might account for some inhibition of excessive inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients. Though this technique is not approved by the FDA as a novel therapy, neither can be considered the best treatment option but can be considered as a possible emergency treatment for fulminant COVID-19. In the context of plasma therapy, FDA has released guidance to health care providers and investigators regarding use as well as the study of investigational convalescent plasma (COVID-19 convalescent plasma) [<xref rid="bb0455" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>].

There have been numerous warnings to glean from the worldwide response to the SARS-COV-2 threat. The nonexistence of a trustworthy, reliable, early alert and response system, failure to mount containment actions, a paucity of community commitment for self-isolation, and overdependence on quarantining measures have uncovered the clefts in the competence of health systems worldwide. The COVID-19 outbreak has clearly shown the anemic preparation against evolving and re-emerging dangerous pathogens across the world. The source of the outbreak, the intermediate host, an effective treatment regimen, tools for early diagnosis in asymptomatic patients, and tools to predict the emergence of novel pathogens all remain elusive. It is now well established that SARS-CoV-2 enters cells by attaching to specific ACE-2 receptors, which are widely expressed in the respiratory tract, brain, liver, bile duct, lower GIT, and kidney. Thus, all these organs remain on the verge of damage by COVID-19. Keeping in view the global threat to public health instigated by SARS-CoV-2, an efficient prevention system as well as medication for COVID-19 pneumonia is instantly required. Even though the development of COVIS-19 therapeutics and vaccines is in its childhood stage, but still researchers across the globe have met with some substantial progress starting from elucidating out structure, full genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2, pathogenesis of COVID-19 and up to the commencement of clinical trials with COVID-19 drugs and vaccines.</p><p id="p0185">Nevertheless, the development of medication for SARS-CoV-2 is still a prime dilemma for humans, and there is currently no clinically approved drug to combat COVID-19 except remdesivir (recently approved by FDA for emergency use in and only severely ill hospitalized patients). Health care professionals are making use of the repurposed drugs (drugs with limited proof for containing COVID-19) to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, in addition to clinical trials of new drugs and testing repurposed drugs, an exceptional strategy is urgently required for the development of new vaccines for COVID-19. Knowledge gained from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreak implies that SARS-CoV-2 research in the future should emphasize mainly on the creation and development of animal models that summarize and replicate the various clinical facets of COVID-19 and act as contributing factor of development of safe and efficacious drugs/vaccines.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Schlipk&#x000f6;ter</surname><given-names>U.</given-names></name><name><surname>Flahault</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Communicable diseases: achievements and challenges for public health</article-title><source>Public Health Rev.</source><volume>32</volume><year>2010</year><fpage>90</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/BF03391594</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">32226190</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0010"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Guarner</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Three emerging coronaviruses in two decades: the story of SARS, MERS, and now COVID-19</article-title><source>Am.
