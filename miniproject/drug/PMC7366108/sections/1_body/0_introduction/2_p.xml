There have been three zoonotic outbreaks caused by coronaviruses (CoVs) since the beginning of this century, i.e. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002, middle-east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, followed by the recent ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019.

Numerous patients with baffling pneumonia secondary to an unknown virus emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and later the virus was identified as a new beta coronavirus and officially recognized as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [

Currently, the outbreak has spread globally with approximately 10 million confirmed cases, 0.5 million confirmed deaths, and 5 million total worldwide recoveries as of 30th June 2020. Numerous pieces of evidences suggest that person-to-person transmission is an expected path for spreading of COVID-19 infection; primarily occurs via direct interaction or via microdroplets propagated by coughing or sneezing from an infected COVID-19 individual [

A considerable number of COVID-19 cases, however, have progressed rapidly to severe forms, especially among older men with underlying diseases. Significant cases may involve dyspnea, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute heart injury, acute kidney injury, acute liver injury, neurological injury, gastrointestinal injury, immune failure, compromised coagulation and even death [
