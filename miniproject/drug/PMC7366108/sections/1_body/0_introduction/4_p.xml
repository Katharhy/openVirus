<p id="p0040">Along with ACE-2, SARS-CoV-2 has shown to take the help of transmembrane protease serine protease-2 (TMPRSS-2) as the critical protease assisting their entrance into the human cell [
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This receptor (ACE-2) is widely expressed in pulmonary tissues as well as in some immune cells, including monocytes and macrophages [
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 virus entry into the human body stimulates the release as well as activation of monocyte, macrophage, and dendritic cell along with the release of cytokines (Interleukins). Further, IL-6 initiates an intensification cascade resulting in cis signaling with activation and differentiation of TH
 <sub>17</sub>, lymphocytic changes, and trans-signaling in endothelial cells [

 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 infection cause final release and increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukins, TNF-α, GCSF, and MCP [

This augmented systemic cytokine storm seen in SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed patients underwrites the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19 and known as the “cytokine storm”. Extreme COVID-19 patients show strong inflammatory response and transcriptomic RNA-seq reviews of COVID-19 patients showed that several immune pathways and pro-inflammatory cytokines CXCL, CCL2, CXCL2, CCL8, IL33 and CCL3L1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and TNFSF10, CXCL10, IL10, TIMP1, C5, IL18, AREG and NRG1 in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) were induced by SARS-CoV-2; suggesting a sustained inflammation and cytokine storm. Besides this, excessive apoptotic cell death of T cell resulting from flawed stimulation by dysfunction of dendritic cell might be a contributing factor to the COVID-19 immunopathology [
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Fortunately, 80% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic or suffer from mild symptoms due to the activation of the body's innate immune system by triggering the body's antiviral defense mechanisms, including natural killer cells and antiviral T cells, and interferon induction. Unfortunately, 20% of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals are the immune-compromised, aged, patients with underlying health conditions will experience more severe illness characterized by substantial respiratory symptoms leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and even death. Several epidemiological, genetic, and clinical elements of COVID-19 infection resemble previous SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection [
 <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Ironically, even after the frequent re-emergence of CoVs infections and after several years of research, we still lack vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat CoV infection, which further climaxes an unmet need to develop effective drugs/vaccines to prevent re-emergence of future CoV epidemics. Here, in this review, we have discussed about etiology, epidemiology, the structure of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, induced COVID-19 infection. Besides, a brief dialogue has been made on secondary complications associated with COVID-19. Lastly, we have reviewed current clinical therapy, potential therapeutic intervention followed by drugs and vaccines currently in clinical trials for COVID-19.
