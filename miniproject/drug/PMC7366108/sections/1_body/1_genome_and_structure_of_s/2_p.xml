<p id="p0045">Based on the taxonomic classification of viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is classified under the order Nidovirales, family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>, and genus Betacoronavirus (β-CoV). All the viruses from this genus have a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA besieged by a lipid envelope. A phosphorylated capsid protein shields this single strand of RNA and both RNA &amp; capsid together form a nucleocapsid. This nucleocapsid is hidden within the phospholipid bilayers and coated by spike glycoprotein trimer (S) and probably the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein. Due to spike protein on the lipid envelope, SARS-CoV-2 holds the classic coronavirus structure with crown-like spikes (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a). The membrane (M) protein and the envelope (E) protein are sited among the spikes in the envelope. Apart from spike protein, it also expresses other proteins such as helicase, RNA polymerase, papain-like protease, 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, glycoprotein, and some other accessory proteins [

 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Two theories have been put forward to clarify the cross-species transmission of this virus. First, there might be an intermediate host between bats and humans. Most likely, it is pangolin as their genome is approximately 90% similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating two sub-lineages of this virus in the phylogenetic tree. As per the second theory, the rich genetic diversity and frequent recombination ability of SARS-CoV-2 might enhance the possibility for cross-species spread [
 <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The 29.9 kb genome of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank no. MN908947) encodes 9860 amino acids which include the 5′-untranslated region (5’-UTR), replicate open reading frame (orf) 1a/b, structural proteins, other orf such as 3, 6, 7a, 7b, 8 and 9b and the 3′-untranslated region (3’-UTR) (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b). The 5’ UTR is 265 nt long, whereas 3’ UTR is 229 nt long. SARS-CoV-2 contains at least ten ORFs, including ORF1a/b, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and some other accessory genes, such as ORF3b and OFR8 [
 <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Almost two-third of viral RNA houses the first ORFs (ORF1a/b), which are further translated into two big polyproteins i.e. pp1a and pp1ab. These polyproteins are finally processed by different proteases into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1- nsp16) to produce the replicas-transcriptase complex. Moreover, the other ORFs, present on the other one-third part of the genome encode for four main structural proteins (S, E, M and N) proteins, as well as some accessory proteins with unknown functions [
 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The S, ORF3a, E, M, ORF8 and N genes are 3822, 828, 228, 669, 366 and 1260 nt in length, respectively.
