<p id="p0170">Plasmapheresis, also known as therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), has been suggested as an alternative therapy to treat COVID-19 patients. Apheresis is the safest advised technique to acquire plasma, and this technique first involves the collection of blood from COVID-19 survivors, followed by plasma separation from blood cells. The same separated plasma is then infused into the circulation of severely ill COVID-19 patients [

In this context, Chinese authorities were the first to have reported success in treating COVID-19 infected patients with contributed plasma from survivors of the illness, the intended benefit being shielding antibodies formed in the blood of the survivors [

The likely mechanisms of action of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 patients may be attributed to the immediate neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, decrease in the intensity of the hyperactive immune system, decrease in cytokine storm, Th1/Th17 ratio, decrease complement system activation and alteration of a hypercoagulable state [

During plasma transfusion, in addition of transfer of neutralizing antibodies, some immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM), anti-inflammatory cytokines, anti- clotting factors, defensins, pentraxins are too transferred to COVID-19 patients, which might confer additional health benefits and fasten the recovery [
 <xref rid="bb0450" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. In a nutshell, the transfer of numerous aforementioned blood factors during the transfusion process might account for some inhibition of excessive inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients. Though this technique is not approved by the FDA as a novel therapy, neither can be considered the best treatment option but can be considered as a possible emergency treatment for fulminant COVID-19. In the context of plasma therapy, FDA has released guidance to health care providers and investigators regarding use as well as the study of investigational convalescent plasma (COVID-19 convalescent plasma) [
 <xref rid="bb0455" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Till date, a total of 97 clinical trials for the use of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 has been registered with
