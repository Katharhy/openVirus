Recent clinical reports have documented the negative impact of SARS-CoV-2 on other organs like liver, kidneys and intestine in COVID-19 patients, which can lead to a higher incidence of hepatic or renal injury and even worsening of the health status of patients who are already suffering from hepatic disorders, GIT disorders, ARI (Acute Renal Injury) or CRI (Chronic Renal Injury) and thus results in higher mortality rate [

It has been reported that ARI and liver dysfunction are the main complications, along with acute respiratory distress syndrome, arrhythmia, acute cardiac injury, shock, and other secondary infections. Studies also revealed that ARI is one of the severe symptoms of COVID-19, generally in the case of critical patients [
