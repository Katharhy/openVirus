Various possible explanations have been reported for SARS-CoV-2 induced CNS damage including entry into the brain through blood circulation, by infecting the sensory and motor nerve endings and some indirect mechanisms like hypoxia or loss of oxygen also cause decrease supply of oxygen in brain tissue cause acute or permanent changes in the brain areas [

Viruses may penetrate the brain and exacerbate infections by activating neuroinflammation. i.e. excessive activation and release of interleukins, TNF-Î± and other markers, which ultimately leads to free radical generation, excitotoxicity, and neuron death [
