<p id="p0160">A recent study assessed data from eight countries and four USA cities which remain epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic. The risk of death is 13- to 73-fold higher in elderly individuals (&gt;65 years age) as compared to non-elderly individuals (&lt;65 years age). The age-dependent threat is moderately stronger in European countries in contrast to US cities. The finding disclosed that 5–9% and &lt; one-third of all COVID-19 deaths in European countries and 4 USA cities, respectively, are from non-elderly age groups having &lt;65 years of age. Moreover, the bulk of deaths in this age group take place in the age of sub-group 40–65 that covers 36 to 48% of the total population in the 0–65 years old category. Additionally, the majority of the fatalities in the non-elderly population occur in those COVID-19 patients who have any pre-existing or underlying diseases [

Based on current evidences, CVD, hypertension, COPD, asthma, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, hepatic disorder, cancer, and immunocompromised status are some of the pre-existing diseased states in COVID-19 which confer an enhanced threat. Overall, half of the dead victims from COVID-19 in European countries and 4 USA cities are at least 80 years old. Most of these COVID-19 patients were suffering from one of the comorbidities above which result in fatal consequences during the COVID-19 pandemic [
