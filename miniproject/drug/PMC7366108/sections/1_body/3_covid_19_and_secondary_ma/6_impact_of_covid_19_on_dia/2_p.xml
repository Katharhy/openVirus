<p id="p0135">COVID-19 is emerging as a double edge sword for the population suffering from diabetes. Diabetes is a significant risk factor for hospitalization and mortality due to COVID-19 infection. The severity of COVID-19 in with diabetic patients is two-fold higher as compared to mild and severe patients with COVID-19 [

Indeed, it is well established that diabetic population is at high-risk group for viral infection due to hyperglycemia-induced increased oxidative stress as well as synthesis and release of advanced glycation end products and pro-inflammatory cytokines [
