<p id="p0150">Pregnant females are exceptionally predisposed to viral pathogens and pneumonia since a lot of physiologic alterations takes place in the respiratory, cardiac and immune systems (for e.g. diaphragm gets elevated, oxygen demand increased, along with edema of the upper respiratory tract), [

 <xref rid="bb0465" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Earlier, viral pneumonia in pregnant women was shown to be correlated with an increased risk of premature fetal birth, decreased fetal growth and perinatal mortality [

 <xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. In this context, a study published in March 2020 revealed the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on pregnant females (
 <italic>n</italic> = 38) infected with COVID-19 as well as on their neonates in China. Despite having a limited sample size, the study concluded zero cases of intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from moms with COVID-19 to their fetuses/neonates [

 <italic>n</italic> = 116) with COVID-19 pneumonia between January 20 and March 24, 2020. The median gestational age of all pregnant women was 36 weeks, and common symptoms observed were fever (50.9%,) and cough (28.4%,); whereas 23.3% women were without symptoms. The proof of maternal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in nasopharynx, amniotic fluid and blood of neonates. The authors concluded that the observed clinical symptoms of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia are identical to those of non-pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. Currently, there is a paucity of data to confirm that pregnant women with COVID 19 are more susceptible to severe pneumonia and vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to fetus during the third- trimester of pregnancy [
 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although these two recent studies are of the same viewpoint, but the maternal-fetal transmission cannot be ruled out. Most recently, a systematic review has been published with data of 172 pregnant women and 162 neonates from 23 studies conducted in different countries to examine the risk or occurrence of maternal-fetal SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The authors have concluded that in pregnant women infected with COVID-19, diabetes and hypertension are among the top associated comorbidities and there is a risk of pre-mature fetal delivery. Moreover, the newborn child to COVID-19 mothers have displayed the occurrence of respiratory distress syndrome as well as pneumonia and some proof of vertical maternal-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection [
