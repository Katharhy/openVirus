<p id="p0080">COVs such as SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, have mainly been associated with the number of cardiovascular complications such as myocarditis, myocardial injury, cardiac shock, cardiac arrhythmia, heart failure [
 <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Although. the dominant clinical feature of COVID-19 is considered to be respiratory dysfunction, but some patients showed severe damage to the cardiovascular system. Recent reports suggested that patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) have been at increased risk of death [

 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In 2006, a study conducted on SARS patients showed that out of 121 patients, 12 patients had cardiovascular complications with tachycardia and hypotension were the most common finding reported besides with the other complications such as bradycardia, transient cardiomegaly [

Recently, the clinical report of COVID-19 revealed that 7.2%, 8.7%, and 16.7% of patients with acute cardiac injury, shock, and arrhythmia, respectively, required immediate hospitalization and intensive care [

The overall mortality rate remains minimal at 2.3%; though, it bounces to 6% in hypertensive patients, 7.3% in diabetic patients, 10.5% in CVD patients, and 14.8% for very older patients (&gt;80Â years of age). The point to be noticed that the mortality rate for CVD (10.5%) is bigger as compared to patients with chronic respiratory disease (6.3%) [
