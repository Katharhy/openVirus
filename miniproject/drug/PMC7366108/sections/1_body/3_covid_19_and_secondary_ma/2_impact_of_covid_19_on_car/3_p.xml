In physiological conditions, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a master regulator of the renin-angiotensin system and one of best in target enzymes for the treatment of hypertension. The protease renin converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (ANG I), which is consequently transformed to ANG II by ACE. ANG II then unites to the ANG II type 1 receptor (AT1R) to promote inflammation, oxidative stress, and increase in blood pressure.
