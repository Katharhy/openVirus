<p id="p0130">In addition, several people with COVID-19 had gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as vomiting and nausea, before showing signs and symptoms of fever and lower respiratory tract. A meta-analysis of COVID-19 patients (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4243) from 6 countries reported prevalence of all GI symptoms, including loss of appetite, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain [

In addition, patients with presenting diarrhea had higher stool RNA presence and viral load than patients with no diarrhea. Due to 80% similarity to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 persuaded GIT infection is not surprising and is specified to be mediated through the ACE2 cell receptors. ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the small intestine, especially in proximal and distal enterocytes, and the binding affinity of ACE2 receptors determines infectivity. Since ACE2 modulates bowel inflammation, SARS-CoV-2 can disrupt ACE2 ‘s function and lead to diarrhea [

Because of the similarity of SARS and COVID-19 infection, currently, various alternatives and therapies which were earlier used for the treatment of SARS such as anti-biotics, anti-viral, and steroidal drugs are widely being used for the treatment of COVID-19 [
