<p id="p0120">The liver is the vital metabolic organ with numerous physiological roles and play a significant function in immunity and detoxification of xenobiotic. The liver is a highly sensitive organ that can be easily influenced by the presence of viruses, bacteria, and other harmful pathogens. In 2003, during the SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV reportedly caused atypical pneumonia and served as a contributing factor in liver impairment in up to 60% of SARS patients [

 <xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Several studies documented that during the initial stage of SARS, there was a mild to moderate rise of ALT and AST levels, decrease in serum albumin, and an increase in serum bilirubin levels in the patients [

 <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. It has been reported that the severity of liver damage was directly proportional to the severity of cases of SARS patients [

 <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>]. Several studies on SARS patients, reported that the SARS-CoV genome was identified in hepatocytes by RT-PCR technique, which establish a significant relationship between SARS-CoV and hepatic damage [

 <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Endothelial cells of the liver have an abundance of ACE 2. Therefore, it served as a potential target for the cellular entry of SARS-CoV [

 <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Several in-vitro studies reported that SARS-CoV-specific protein 7a posses' ability to cause apoptosis in the lung, kidney, and liver through a caspase-dependent mechanism and confers the relative potential of SARS-CoV in liver injury [
