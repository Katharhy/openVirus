<p id="p0060">At the molecular level, the virus-human interaction starts with the binding of S-protein to the ACE-2 receptor, followed by the fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane. S-proteins are activated by priming cleavage (between S1 and S2) and activating cleavage (on S2â€™ site) by one or several host proteases. Depending on the sequence of the S1/S2 cleavage site, the priming cleavage can be done by different host cell proteases, including furin, transmembrane protease serine protease-2 (TMPRSS-2), TMPRSS-4, cathepsins, trypsin, or human airway trypsin-like protease [

However, the accessibility of a particular protease in the host cell cannot be a regulating factor for the pathogenicity of SARS-Cov-2, because S-proteins are well-known to modify protease cleavage sites so that different proteases can perform the cleavage of S. This is one of the mechanisms adopted by SARS-Cov-2 to infect and fuse with different host cell membranes [

Apart from this, SARS-CoV-2 encodes several proteins to attenuate the innate immune responses, especially the activation of type 1 interferon in host cells, ultimately leading to an enhanced immunopathogenesis. The nsp15 (also known as endoribonuclease EndoU) is vital for restraining the detection of viral RNA by specific cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors [
