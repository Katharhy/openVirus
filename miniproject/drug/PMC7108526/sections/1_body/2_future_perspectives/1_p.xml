<p>After the discovery of SARS-CoV, research studies by several groups have been focused on identifying and characterizing animal CoVs, with the aim to evaluate their zoonotic potential. The high diversity between CoVs detected in bats and the genetic mechanisms to increase their genomic variability increase the risk of interspecies transmission. In agreement, the emergence of the 2019-nCoV highlights the importance of bats as a reservoir for new viruses capable of infecting humans, but also serves as an excellent model to design studies and strategies to prevent future emergence of new zoonotic agents. In this regard, it is important to increase the efforts aimed at the characterization of the virome of different animals to study the viral evolution and adaptation to their natural hosts (Holmes, Rambaut and Andersen

The combination of the new molecular/bioinformatics technologies with the classical virological techniques applied to viral models can provide knowledge to prevent new dangerous spillover events. In particular, the possibility to predict the interspecies transmission, can facilitate the planning of specific surveillance programmes to identify outbreaks as soon as they start. Finally, the establishment of platforms to optimize vaccine development is crucial, as vaccines represent the best measure to avoid spread of infection. In this regard, the possibility to rapidly sequence viral genomes combined with synthetic biology approaches, could speed up the procedures for the identification of vaccine against emerging viruses.
