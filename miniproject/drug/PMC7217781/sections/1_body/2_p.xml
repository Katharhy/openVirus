 <italic>Drug Discovery Today</italic> in 2014 
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, for precisely this type of pandemic scenario. The platform screens and ranks every existing human use drug for every disease/indication through large scale modelling and analysis of interactions between comprehensive libraries of drugs/compounds and protein structures. The interaction may be determined by any screening or docking method but the built-in ones using a fast bioinformatic docking protocol and the hierarchical fragment-based docking with dynamics protocol CANDOCK 
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> are prioritized. The drug-proteome signature comparison and ranking approach used by the CANDO platform yields benchmarking accuracies of 20–40% for ∼1500 indications relative to random control accuracies of 2–15%. Across twelve prospective 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> validation studies, 58/163 (35%) top ranking predictions made using the CANDO platform had comparable or better activity relative to existing drugs across ten indications, and represent potential novel repurposed therapies for indications such as dengue, dental caries, diabetes, herpes, lupus, malaria, and tuberculosis
