<p id="para120">To give our bodies a better chance, drug researchers are pursuing three main strategies. The first is to use antiviral medications to stop or slow the virus's ability to make copies of itself and tip the balance in favour of the immune system. A

This suggests that reducing the amount of virus could make symptoms less severe. The second strategy is to identify antibodies – the proteins our immune systems produce in response to an infection – that work against the virus and deploy them against it. And the final one is to stop the immune system spinning out of control. The goal, says Manson, isn't to switch it off, which would leave a person unable to fight off the virus, but to dial it down a bit.
