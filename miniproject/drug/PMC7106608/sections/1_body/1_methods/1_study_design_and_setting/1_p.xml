The BRAVO trial enrolled people with HIV and moderate-to-severe opiate use disorder to receive either methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) or buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP/NX) at six Vietnamese HIV clinics between 2015 and 2019. The study clinics were chosen in the epicenter of Vietnamâ€™s HIV and opiate epidemics; four clinics are located in Hanoi, one in Tanh Hoa Province, and one in Bac Giang Province. Clinics were selected based on the high prevalence of untreated opiate use disorder among newly engaging people with a history of intravenous drug use, ability to enroll sufficiently for the study, availability of MMT, and support of local authorities.
