<p id="Par27">We assessed bivariate associations (t-tests, Pearson’s chi-squared tests, and Fisher exact tests) of participant characteristics and separately, ART initiation and HIV viral suppression. Potential covariates were selected based on a priori hypotheses and previous studies. We then conducted bivariate analyses among those covariates and the study outcome (viral suppression). We chose to include covariates in our model that had 
 <italic>p</italic>-values of &lt; 0.10 in bivariate analyses. Regardless of statistical significance, we retained age and years since HIV diagnosis each final model. Two separate multivariable logistic regression models estimated the relationship of baseline participant characteristics with study outcomes. We used an estimated 10 events per degree of freedom ratio to estimate the number of covariates we could include to avoid overfitting [

 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) to evaluate model goodness of fit. We dropped participants missing both age and gender, and replaced the three participants missing viral load at baseline as non-suppressed.
