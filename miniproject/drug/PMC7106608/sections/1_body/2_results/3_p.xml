<p id="Par31">After adjusting for covariates, both years since HIV diagnosis (aOR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.06, 1.19) and being married (aOR = 2.83, 95% CI 1.51, 5.34) were associated with increased odds of being on ART at baseline. A higher DASS depression score was negatively associated with being on ART (aOR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.94, 0.9963). In the HIV viral suppression model, only current ART use remained associated with viral suppression (aOR = 25.9, 95% CI 12.5, 53.8) after adjusting for covariates. None of the sensitivity analyses identified changes in magnitude or direction of associations.</p>
