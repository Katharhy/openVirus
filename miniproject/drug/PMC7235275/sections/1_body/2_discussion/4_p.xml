<p>Preliminary data from China indicate that patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 have reduced or very reduced (&lt;200/Î¼L) numbers of CD4 cells (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Theoretically, this would put untreated HIV-infected patients with low CD4 cell numbers at particularly high risk of superimposed opportunistic infections during COVID-19. They might also be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 acquisition. Higher serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, are found in severe cases of COVID-19, and thought to contribute to a fatal outcome (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Elevated IL-6 levels are associated with older age, higher body mass index, higher viral replication and low nadir CD4+ cell count in HIV-infected patients, and predicts poor CD4 cell recovery in subjects starting ARVs (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Whether pre-existing elevated levels of IL-6 will lead to a worse outcome for HIV-SARS-CoV-2 coinfected patients remains to be established.
