Four patients were on ARVs, and had CD4 cell counts higher than 400/μL and undetectable HIV-RNA; one patient was ARV-naïve, had 13 CD4 cells/μL and HIV-RNA 45,500 copies/mL. Two patients were admitted to intensive care (one of them being the ARV-naïve patient), four had been discharged, and one (with CD4 cell count &gt;400/μL) remained in intensive care at the time of submission of the manuscript (
