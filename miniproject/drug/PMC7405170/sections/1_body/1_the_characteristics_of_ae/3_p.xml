<p>In 1934, Wells pioneered the concept that airborne infections can be transmitted either as droplets or as aerosols.

 </xref> According to his work, droplets are defined as those with particle sizes &gt; 5 μm and typically carried on heavy colloids like mucus or saliva. Droplets cannot remain suspended in air for long or travel long distances, hence, they are spread by close contact with (typically 1 m ) and in the presence of, the host. However, according to Wells, droplets &lt; 100 μm dry out before falling ≈2 m to the ground. When these droplets evaporate, they can be carried on airborne vectors and become aerosols. He estimated the particle size in aerosols to be &lt; 5 μm (sometimes called droplet nuclei) and stated that these particles can stay airborne for long periods of time, carry viable pathogen as payload and settle on surfaces distant from the source (which is then referred to as a fomite). The vectors can be natural, namely, mist, fog, and vapor or anthropogenic, for example, smoke, dust, smog, and of particular importance to us, dental aerosol. However, in certain cases, for example, high ambient temperature or high airflow, large droplets can evaporate and acquire aerosol‐like properties. Because of their size, they can carry larger payloads than droplet nuclei (see below).
