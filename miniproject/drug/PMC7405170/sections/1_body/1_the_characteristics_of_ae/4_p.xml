<p>Aerosols have also been classified based on their deposition patterns. For example, using a semi‐empirical model, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) estimated that particles between 1to 10 μm or &lt; 0.5 μm are most likely to deposit in the tracheobronchial and pulmonary regions of the lungs, whereas particles ≤5 μm have the highest probability of entering the lower airways of the average adult during oral inhalation.

 </xref> Because the nose offers a greater filtration efficiency than the mouth, only particles ≤3 μm have a high probability of entering the lower airways during nose breathing. Particles with diameters between 1 and 3 μm or &lt;0.5 μm have the greatest probability of entering the lung, thereby the highest potential of initiating an infection at this site. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has defined “respirable particles” as having a diameter of ≤10 μm and “inspirable particles” as having a diameter between 10 μm and 100 μm, nearly all of which are deposited in the upper airways.

 </xref> Other studies on infectious disease transmission indicate that droplets &gt;5 μm are trapped in the upper respiratory tract whereas droplets ≤5 μm can be inhaled into the lower respiratory tract.

 </xref> In this review, we will use the 10 μm diameter to distinguish between aerosolized and non‐aerosol particles, because they have important implications for time of settling, penetration depth into airways and requirements for PPE.
