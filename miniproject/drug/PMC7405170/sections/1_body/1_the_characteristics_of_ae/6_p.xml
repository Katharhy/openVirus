<p>When vector particles and aerosol droplets collide with each other, they might coalesce or coaggregate, changing the particle size, in which case, the classifications described above do not apply anymore. In certain situations, these aggregates break down into numerous smaller conglomerates, generating a new generation of payload. Together, these collisions randomly create a heterogeneous mixture of large and small particles with highly variable electrical charges, aerodynamic diameter, diffusion dynamics, and terminal velocity.

 </xref> It is therefore unsurprising that, in real life scenarios, each aerosol responds in a highly variable manner to gravitational forces. Temperature and humidity of the environment, and the superimposition of new aerosol further impact aerosol dynamics.
