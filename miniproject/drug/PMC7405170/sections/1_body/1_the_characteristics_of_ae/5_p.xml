<p>Another important characteristic of aerosolized particles that impacts their definition is settling time. In still air, it has been estimated that particles 0.5 μm take 41 hours to settle over a distance of 5 feet, and that the time exponentially decreases as the size increases. For example, 1 μm sized particles take 12 hours to settle whereas 10 μm take 8.2 minutes and 100 μm take a mere 5.8 seconds.

 </xref> However, this characteristic is heavily influenced by the direction and velocity of air currents (such as those created by foot traffic, opening of doors, position and setting of room air circulation systems etc.), humidity, the forces of attraction/repulsion between aerosolized particles and the size of the agglomerates/coaggregates (see below). In the presence of turbulence, particles nearer the floor continue to follow the settling times described above, but other factors begin to influence those that are two feet or more above the surface, for example, particle impaction, electrostatic forces etc.
