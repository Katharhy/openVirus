<p>The characteristics and behavior of aerosolized particles are important determinants of defining an aerosol, and for this reason, definitions have to be contextualized. For example, size and penetrability‐based definitions have important implications for selecting appropriate face masks, while settling‐characteristics‐based definitions are impactful in deciding nature and time of surface decontamination. Hence, studies on aerosol transmission must account for these confounding variables in order to be interpreted in the appropriate clinical context. As we shall see below, most studies on aerosol generating medical/dental procedures (AGM/DP) have used simplistic calculations, for example, estimating particle size to compute aerodynamic diameter (this has limited use outside of regular sized particles such as inhalable drugs) and applying Stokes’ law to calculate terminal velocity of a particle in a fluid (the assumptions of Stokes’ law fail for particles &lt;1 μm).
