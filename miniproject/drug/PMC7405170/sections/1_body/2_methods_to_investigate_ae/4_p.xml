<p>Thus, any investigation of aerosol characteristics must use well‚Äêvalidated methods of aerosol capture, incorporate appropriate positive and negative controls to allow standardization of microbial payload, and be sufficiently powered to reduce the ''noise'' generated by random behavior of aerosol particles. Most importantly, they must be quantitative, because pathogen dose is an important element of infectivity. As we will see in the next few sections, much of what we currently know about dental aerosols falls far short of the most basic principles of scientific rigor and reproducibility.</p>
