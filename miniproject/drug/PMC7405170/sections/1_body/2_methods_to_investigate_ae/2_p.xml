<p>One of the most important considerations in any study is the investigational methodology. Early studies employed impaction on solid and liquidized interfaces to measure aerosol volume and properties.

 </xref> Advances in visualization technology have enabled greater temporal and spatial visualization of aerosol generated particles and their trajectories. Among the various methodologies used to visualize aerosols, laser capture imaging, particle counters, air samplers, and droplet capture methods are the most popular.
