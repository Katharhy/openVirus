<p>Although every single study to date has demonstrated that all forms of mechanical instrumentation in the oral cavity create aerosols and spatter with a significant bioload, critical gaps in knowledge still exist. The first of these is the source of the aerosolized microbiota. It is easy to point to saliva as a source. If this were indeed true, then one would expect a high degree of variability in the clinical studies because of differences in salivary volume, flow rate and composition between patients. However, all the literature detailed in this review report remarkably homogeneous findings in terms of aerosol volume, quantity of contagion, and distance and time of spread. This is in spite of variability in operators, instruments, procedures, subject characteristics, and data collection methods.</p>
