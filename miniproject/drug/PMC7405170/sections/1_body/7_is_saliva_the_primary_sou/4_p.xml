<p>This plausibility is further supported by the fact that ultrasonic devices and high‐speed handpieces use water as a coolant with a typical flow rate of 10 to 40 mL per minute,

 </xref> Thus, the dilution ratio varies between 1:20 to 1:100. That is not to say that saliva does not contribute to the microbial payload in aerosols. In fact, a strong correlation was observed between the number of decayed teeth in a patient and the levels of beta hemolytic streptococci on the operator's mask,

 </xref> However, as described above, most the culturable bacteria identified thus far in dental aerosols are of environmental origin, bacterial profiles in aerosols demonstrate remarkably low ''noise'' between studies and the dilution factor because of water coolants is very high. In the absence of evidence demonstrating a salivary source for these bacteria, the microbial similarities between water lines and aerosols is the only evidence that can be brought to bear upon this argument.
