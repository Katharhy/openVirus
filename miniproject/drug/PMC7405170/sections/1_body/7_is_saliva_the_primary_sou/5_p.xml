<p>Although the amount to effort invested in studying dental aerosols is commendable, these studies suffer from critical flaws in design and methodology that preclude robust decision making.

 </xref> For instance, none of the studies used a control group where the aerosol was generated in the absence of a patient. This would provide invaluable information on the source of the microbial payload. There is also incredible diversity in the methodologies used. For instance, several studies originating from the Indian subcontinent and South East Asia have not used any form of aspiration of oral fluids, whereas most studies from Europe and the United States have used high or low volume aspirators. Because the amount of aerosol directly correlates with the partial pressure of fluid in the mouth, this important variable does not allow for comparisons to be made between studies. Perhaps the most important gap in knowledge stems from the use of rudimentary cultivation‚Äêbased approaches to characterize microbiota. Such approaches have created very simplistic views of the microbial contaminants (e.g. gram positive versus gram negative, gross counts of CFU, catalase activity, and other such basic characterizations), have hampered our ability to pinpoint the source of the aerosol and completely ignored the viral, fungal and other constituents of the microbial payload. Hence, these studies have allowed room for liberal interpretation of the data, and in some instances, this has served to create a certain level of misinformation.
