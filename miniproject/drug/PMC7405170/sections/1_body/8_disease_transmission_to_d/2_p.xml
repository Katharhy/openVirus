<p>Before we examine the statistics on cross‐infection in dental settings, it must be acknowledged that lack of reporting poses a huge barrier to obtaining accurate data. An excellent review by Volgenant et al.

Several instances of transmission of blood‐borne pathogens to patients and health‐care personnel have been documented. These are attributable both to poor infection control practices,
