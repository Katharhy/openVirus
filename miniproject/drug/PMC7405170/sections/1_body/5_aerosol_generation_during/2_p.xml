<p>Although AGM/DP have been implicated in spread of viral contagion, it must be remembered that aerosols are generated during normal physiological activities such as breathing, talking, coughing, and sneezing. Studies on healthy volunteers have demonstrated that mouth breathing produces 1‐98 particles per liter,

 </xref> Sneezing can expel nearly 40,000 droplets between 0.5 to 12 μm at speeds of almost 100 m/sec, while coughing may generate up to 3000 droplet nuclei.

 </xref> Collectively, studies such as these demonstrate that healthy individuals generate particles sized between 0.01 and 500 μm, underlining the fact that dispersal of expelled particles does not occur exclusively by airborne or droplet transmission but by both mechanisms concurrently.
