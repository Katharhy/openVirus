<p>During dental procedures, the “wet environment” created by saliva and water coolant combined with high‐speed instrumentation generates a large spray which disperses in many forms as dictated by the physics of aerosol creation (see section on characteristics of aerosols, above). Thus, the spray can initially take the form of spatter, droplets, droplet‐nuclei, a true aerosol, or some combination thereof; and continue to evolve based on room temperature, humidity, airflow dynamics, electrostatic forces etc. The term “dental aerosol”, therefore, is somewhat of a misnomer, because it does not encompass the various airborne particles that can be created during an AGDP. To avoid confusion, we will use the word spray unless the study specifically measured aerosols.</p>
