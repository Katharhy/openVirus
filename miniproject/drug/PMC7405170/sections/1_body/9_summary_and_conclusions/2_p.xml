<p>A careful and contextualized review of the currently available evidence on dental aerosols reveals the following: 
 <list list-type="order" id="jper10596-list-0001">
  <list-item>
   <p>Viral shedding occurs in saliva during acute phases of all respiratory diseases, and influenza viruses have been reported in post‐recovery and asymptomatic patients.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Respiratory bacterial pathogens are present in saliva of asymptomatic individuals; however, their relative abundances are very low.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Aerosols are generated by all individuals during all times of the day during all types of activities.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>The microbial payload in physiological aerosols correlates with disease severity for respiratory diseases.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Aerosols are created during most dental procedures. The four main aerosol emitting devices are ultrasonics, handpieces, air‐water syringes, and lasers.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>There is little evidence to definitively implicate saliva as the primary source of bacteria in these aerosols. Although absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, the available evidence currently points to environmental sources, particularly dental unit water lines, as a major basis of aerosol bacteria in the dental environment.</p>
