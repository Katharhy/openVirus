<p>The replication cycle of alphaviruses is initiated by virion attachment to cells, followed by clathrin-mediated endocytosis leading to internalization of the viral particle. Particle uncoating exposes the viral genome to the cytoplasm [

Virus particle formation then takes place when structural proteins encapsulate the nascent genomic RNA and finally egress by budding from the cells [
