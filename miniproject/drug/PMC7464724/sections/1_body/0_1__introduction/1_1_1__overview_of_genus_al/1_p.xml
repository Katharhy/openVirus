<p>The genus 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> is comprised of over thirty viral species that can be divided into eight complexes based on antigenic characteristics [

 <xref rid="B2-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. With the exception of two species, southern elephant seal virus (SESV) and salmon pancreatic disease virus (SPDV), all members of the 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus are maintained in transmission cycles between specific hematophagous mosquito vectors and susceptible vertebrate reservoirs [

In addition to the eight antigenic complexes, the alphaviruses can be divided into two larger groups based loosely on geographic location. The Old World alphaviruses (Sindbis (SINV), chikungunya (CHIKV), oâ€²nyong-nyong (ONNV) and Ross River viruses (RRV)) are found predominantly or originated in Africa, Europe, and Asia and are often characterized as causing febrile illnesses, with rash and debilitating arthralgia as common symptoms. Conversely, the New World alphaviruses (Venezuelan, Eastern and Western equine encephalitis (V/E/W/EEV) and related viruses, Una (UNAV) and Mayaro viruses (MAYV)) are mainly found in the Americas and are largely characterized as causing encephalitic disease. Interestingly, UNAV infections are associated with arthralgia as opposed to encephalitic disease much like other Old World alphaviruses [
