<p>Chikungunya virus is the etiologic agent of chikungunya fever (CHIKF), a rapid-onset arboviral disease characterized primarily by debilitating arthralgia. The percentage of those infected who are symptomatic is higher than for other arboviruses [
 <xref rid="B189-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>], allowing the identification of cases to be relatively easier than other infections with more asymptomatic cases. Following an incubation period of 3–6 days, CHIKF occurs rapidly with greater than 90% of patients experiencing fever, myalgia and arthralgias, particularly in the extremities such as feet and hands [

 <sup>9</sup> PFU/mL, is roughly concurrent with symptom onset and lasts from 5–7 days [

 <xref rid="B191-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. The antibody response also begins in the first week of acute infection and neutralizing IgG is believed to provide life-long immunity to second infection. Typically, CHIKF is self-limiting and acute disease resolves within two weeks.
