<p>Not all populations are affected similarly with the elderly and immunocompromised being more susceptible to severe disease. Fortunately, the case fatality rate for CHIKF is extremely low, especially among young adults without co-morbidities; the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) reported only 101 deaths in over 123,000 confirmed cases in 2017 [
 <xref rid="B192-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>]. This rate is similar to the approximately 0.1% rate reported in other outbreaks and areas [
 <xref rid="B193-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>]. For the older population, or those with underlying health concerns, the case fatality rate rises significantly and mortality correlates with disease severity [

 <xref rid="B194-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>]. Likely in part due to the large number of worldwide CHIKV infections, rare complications and unusual disease outcomes during CHIKF have been observed. For example, neurological disease may not be as rare as initially thought; encephalitis, myelitis, Guillain-Barr√© syndrome and ocular involvement including uveitis and retinitis have been reported [

 <xref rid="B196-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>,
 <xref rid="B197-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>]. Mother-to-fetus perinatal transmission was also observed [
