<p>The chance of CHIKV continuing to cause outbreaks is high. Since humans are amplifying hosts, a few infected individuals in the context of competent mosquito vectors can potentially initiate an epidemic. Despite millions of infections to date, it is highly unlikely seroconversion in the population has reached levels to sustain herd immunity. No vaccine is currently available to halt transmission, although many candidates are in clinical trials, none are commercially available. Moreover, IOL strains in Asia have already been introduced into other areas of the world multiple times with little reason to suggest it will not happen again in the future. Without a worldwide and sustained vector eradication program, new epidemics are all but certain. Such eradication efforts have had success in the past with 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in the Americas, but failure to maintain them and prevent re-introductions leads to re-infestation [
 <xref rid="B228-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>]. Widespread vector control, therefore, cannot be the solution to prevent CHIKV spread. Furthermore, CHIKV has already demonstrated the ability to mutate to take advantage of new vectors. Currently, Asian lineage viruses do not harbor the A226V mutation, thereby limiting their spread by 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. However, other point and/or epistatic mutations may occur which could allow for efficient spread by 
 <italic>Ae albopictus</italic>, thereby resulting in enhanced spread. The only methods that will work to prevent future outbreaks will be the widespread deployment of a vaccine that can block CHIKV viremia in vaccinated individuals, thereby halting the spread of virus to feeding mosquitoes.
