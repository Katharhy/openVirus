<p>Outside of Africa, however, anthropophilic 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> are the main vectors for urban transmission (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B191-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]). These mosquito species are well-adapted to live alongside humans and are capable of transmitting many pathogens of human importance, including dengue and Zika viruses. Moreover, the widespread geographic distribution of these mosquito vectors has made them ideal vectors for explosive outbreaks of CHIKV. This is particularly when modern human travel methodologies are taken into consideration, as an individual infected during an outbreak originating in one part of the world can easily transport the virus to any other locale with competent 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and/or 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> where an outbreak can be initiated. Asian and IOL lineage viruses in Asia, India and the Americas are primarily associated with this urban spread and epidemics.
