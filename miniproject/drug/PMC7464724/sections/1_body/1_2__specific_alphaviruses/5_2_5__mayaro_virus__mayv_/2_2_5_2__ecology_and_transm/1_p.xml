<p>The MAYV enzootic cycle consists of mosquitoes of the genus 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic>, which are considered the primary vector, and several mammalian species, primarily nonhuman primates [
 <xref rid="B236-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">236</xref>]. More research is needed to determine whether other vectors, host and reservoirs could play a role. 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> spp. mosquitoes found to transmit MAYV during its largest outbreak in Belterra, Brazil [
 <xref rid="B237-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">237</xref>]. Although mosquitoes of the genus 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> can also be productively infected and shed virus in their saliva in laboratory settings [
 <xref rid="B238-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">238</xref>,
 <xref rid="B239-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">239</xref>], MAYV was only isolated once from these mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="B240-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">240</xref>], and human transmission was not observed. Long and collaborators found that at least 5.34 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/ ml can be found in the blood of infected humans after testing the blood of 25 symptomatic patients [
 <xref rid="B239-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">239</xref>]. These titers are borderline sufficient for infection of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes in a laboratory setting [
 <xref rid="B239-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">239</xref>], and more research needs to be done to accurately determine peak viremia. The fact that no urban outbreaks of MAYV have been reported suggests that these urban and peri-urban 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes likely do not play a major role as vectors.
