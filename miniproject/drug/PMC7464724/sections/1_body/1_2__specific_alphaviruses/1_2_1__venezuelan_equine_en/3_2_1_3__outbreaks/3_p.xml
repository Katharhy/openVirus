<p>Less than a decade later, a large outbreak occurred in 1979 in Mexico and Texas [

Because the VEEV clinical picture is indistinguishable from that of other common arboviruses, cases are likely to be frequently misdiagnosed as being other more common arboviruses, since the molecular or serological diagnosis is rarely done [
