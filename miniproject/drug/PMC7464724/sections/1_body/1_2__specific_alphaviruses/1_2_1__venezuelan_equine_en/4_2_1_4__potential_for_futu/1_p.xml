<p>Based on the episodic timing of VEEV outbreaks in the past, outbreaks of VEEV will almost certainly happen. To predict and understand the characteristic of these outbreaks, it is paramount that additional studies are done to understand the interaction of VEEV with different hosts, vectors and reservoirs, as well as virus evolution and phylogenetics. Several mechanisms were proposed for the emergence of VEEV epidemics. The most prominent hypothesis is that periodic evolution of IAB and IC VEEV strains facilitate for these epizootics. This is supported by phylogenetic studies [
