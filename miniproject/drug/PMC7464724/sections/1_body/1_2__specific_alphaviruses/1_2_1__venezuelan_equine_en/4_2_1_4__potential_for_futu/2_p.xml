<p>To predict and prepare for future outbreaks, it is important to determine mutations affecting vector competence as well as viremia in the hosts. Mutations in the envelope glycoproteins, for example, have been linked to changes in both of these parameters, and could be used to monitor viral population and determine whether epizootics are likely to occur. Monitoring virus in mosquitoes, as well as viremia in equines and wild animals, could also be an effective method to predict the imminence of an outbreak. Development of new therapies and safer and more effective vaccines are also key strategies to prepare for future outbreaks and protect against a potential deliberate release of the virus.</p>
