<p>VEEV equine infection results in a range of clinical manifestations from inapparent infection and seroconversion to systemic disease with lethargy, fever, tachycardia, depression and anorexia to signs of clinical encephalitic; oftentimes detectable VEE in horses is fatal [

 <xref rid="B22-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This difference appears to be largely mediated by the specific sequence of the envelope protein of epizootic strains. In experimental infections with viruses containing the envelope proteins of an epizootic virus, most horses exhibit fever within 36 h of virus infection, followed by lethargy and anorexia. Approximately 75% of the horses develop clinical signs of encephalitis starting at days 6 to 8 post infection [
