<p>Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus is the etiologic agent for both human and equine Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE). VEEV was first recognized as an equine disease during the 1930s [
 <xref rid="B5-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and later identified as a human pathogen in the 1940s [
 <xref rid="B6-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In humans, VEEV has an incubation period of 1–5 days, which is nearly always followed by rapid onset of symptoms including fever, headache, myalgia, ocular pain, nausea, back pains, vomiting and diarrhea [

 <xref rid="B9-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This initial clinical picture is similar to that of many viral infections, but in 4–14% of the cases, it can progress to a more serious encephalitic disease characterized by photophobia, confusion, seizures, convulsions, stupor, behavioral changes, alterations of consciousness, unilateral paralysis and coma [

 <xref rid="B12-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Laboratory exams may show leukopenia, lymphopenia and elevated transaminases [
 <xref rid="B14-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], renal failure [
 <xref rid="B13-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and cerebrospinal fluid may show elevated proteins and increase in lymphocyte counts [
 <xref rid="B14-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The case fatality rate in adults is lower than 1% and varies based upon the viral subtype, but serious neurological disease can occur in up to ~15% of infected people [
 <xref rid="B11-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Interestingly, young children have a higher disease burden and fatality rate [
 <xref rid="B16-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Pregnant women with VEE are at risk of abortions, preterm deliveries, congenital disabilities and stillbirths [
 <xref rid="B18-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Infection with VEEV can also cause sequelae in survivors, and 25% of the hospitalized patients were reported to have long-lasting neurological problems, including headaches, severe fatigue and depression [
 <xref rid="B19-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Humans are susceptible to infections with both enzootic (constantly circulating in nature) and epizootic (epidemic or outbreak) strains [
 <xref rid="B9-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The majority of VEEV infections occur following the bite of an infected mosquito. However, the virus is highly infectious by the aerosol route and manipulations with samples containing the virus may result in virus aerosolization. In laboratory settings, most accidential VEEV infections occur from inhaling aerosolized particles [
