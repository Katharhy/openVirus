<p>Subtype I is implicated in numerous equine and human epidemics. VEE antigenic subtype I is divided into epizootic subtypes IAB and IC, and well as enzootic subtypes ID and IE. It has been found in multiple locations across the Americas; the most common epidemic viruses found belong to the subtype IAB, and have been isolated in South, Central and North America; IC has been identified in South America; ID is found in South and Central America; and IE is located in Central and North America [
