<p>The SINV infection is usually self-limited or subclinical and, therefore, largely undiagnosed [

 <xref rid="B264-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">264</xref>]. Serological surveys in Finland [
 <xref rid="B264-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">264</xref>] and Sweden [
 <xref rid="B261-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">261</xref>] indicate that as much as 95% of all SINV infections may not be diagnosed. After an incubation period of four days (2–10 days range) approximately [
 <xref rid="B265-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">265</xref>], patients develop some signs and symptoms that are similar to other arthritogenic alphaviruses. The main symptoms experienced by patients with the disease are rash, arthralgia, and fever [
 <xref rid="B266-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">266</xref>]. However, reports show that a wider range of symptoms is observed. Frequent symptoms and signs are papular rash, arthritis or arthralgia, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, fever, itching, and upper respiratory symptoms. Nausea, dizziness, enlarged lymph nodes, diarrhea, and photophobia have also been shown, though less frequently [

 <xref rid="B267-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">267</xref>]. Most of the patients recover completely from muscle and debilitating joint pain over time [
 <xref rid="B257-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">257</xref>], with a median duration of nine days, though it can last for up to 80 days [
 <xref rid="B265-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">265</xref>]. A small percentage of patients require hospitalization, but severe complications are rare and fatalities have not been reported [

 <xref rid="B265-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">265</xref>]. The most striking impact of the SINV infection is that several patients can experience joint symptoms for months or even years [

 <xref rid="B267-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">267</xref>]. Kurkela et al. [
 <xref rid="B268-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">268</xref>] investigated a cohort of patients in Finland and found that 24.5% of the patients experienced joint manifestations three years after SINV infection. A similar observation was made by Niklasson and Espmark in the 1980s, when 27 out of 86 patients (31.4%) complained about arthralgia 3–4 years after SINV infection [
 <xref rid="B269-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">269</xref>]. Arthralgia lasting for 5–6 years has also been described [
 <xref rid="B270-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">270</xref>]. Since these symptoms can heavily impact the life of the affected patients, the economic and public health burden can be considerable in endemic areas [
 <xref rid="B257-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">257</xref>]. Additionally, patients who have joint tissue damage as an underlying condition may be at increased risk of developing SINV infection-associated severe symptoms [
