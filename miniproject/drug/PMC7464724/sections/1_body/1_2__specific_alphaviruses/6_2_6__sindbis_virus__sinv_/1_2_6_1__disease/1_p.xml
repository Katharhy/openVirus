<p>The Sindbis virus is the causative agent of Sindbis disease and belongs to the arthritogenic group of alphaviruses [

 <xref rid="B257-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">257</xref>]. The disease caused by the SINV infection is named differently according to the region affected: Pogosta disease (Finland), Karelian fever (Russia), and Ockelbo disease (Sweden) [
 <xref rid="B257-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">257</xref>]. There are five different genotypes (SINV-I to SINV-V) comprising the SINV complex and they display significant genetic variability among them, reaching 28.2% on the nucleotide level and 22.2% on the amino acid level [
 <xref rid="B258-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">258</xref>]. These strains can be found in specific regions of Africa, Europe, Asia, and Oceania and their location is probably related to the dissemination by migratory birds [

 <xref rid="B259-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">259</xref>]. Additionally, human outbreaks are primarily associated with SINV-I [
 <xref rid="B260-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">260</xref>]. Despite this wide distribution of the SINV, the most affected regions are South Africa and countries in Northern Europe [
