<p>South Africa is another country significantly affected by SINV; however, epidemiological data and public health burden in South Africa are still quite vague [

A retrospective study of suspected arbovirus infections has indicated that an outbreak of SINV and Rift Valley virus occurred in 2010, which was preceded by the yearly detection of a small number of SINV infection cases between 2006â€“2009. While a total of 21 samples were seropositive for SINV from 2006 to 2009, 208 cases were anti-SINV IgM positive in 2010 [
