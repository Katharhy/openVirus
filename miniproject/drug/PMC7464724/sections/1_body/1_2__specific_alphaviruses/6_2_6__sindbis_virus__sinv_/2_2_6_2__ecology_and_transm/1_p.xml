<p>The SINV is a mosquito-borne avian virus, similar to some members of the alphaviruses [
 <xref rid="B259-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">259</xref>]. Hence, the SINV transmission involves an enzootic cycle between primary hosts (birds) by mosquitoes and an eventual spillover to humans, also via mosquitoes, may result in disease development [
 <xref rid="B257-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">257</xref>]. Indeed, SINV was first isolated from mosquitoes and a juvenile hooded crow (
 <italic>Corvus corone sardonius</italic>) during an epidemic in Cairo, Egypt [
 <xref rid="B271-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">271</xref>]. SINV replicates within mosquitoes, birds, and humans, however, the latter does not produce the required viremia for mosquitoes to become infected during a blood meal. Hence, humans are considered dead-end hosts of SINV transmission, which precludes a human–mosquito–human urban cycle [
