<p>Similar to other arthropod-transmitted virus, SINV outbreaks could occur when enzootic vectors and reservoir birds are infected with SINV-I and the virus is transmitted from birds to humans by bridge-vector mosquitoes [

Since countries in which these hosts can be found are at risk of human infections, mosquito and viral surveillance in such regions are recommended as public health measures to detect potential outbreaks of SINV infection and reduce their impact on the population. Nonetheless, as potential SINV vector and host populations may reflect on the geographic limitation of SINV outbreaks, this needs to be further investigated [
