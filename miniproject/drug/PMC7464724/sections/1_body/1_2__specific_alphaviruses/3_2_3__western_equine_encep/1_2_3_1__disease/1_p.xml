<p>Western equine encephalitis virus is the etiologic agent of Western equine encephalitis (WEE). WEEV infection can result in a broad spectrum of disease outcomes ranging from subclinical, febrile symptoms, to encephalitis/encephalomyelitis [
 <xref rid="B139-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. The ratio of inapparent infection to disease symptoms is dependent on age and is skewed strikingly toward infants: 1:1 in infants less than one-year-old, 58:1 in children between one and four-years-old, and 1150:1 in people greater than 14-years-old [
 <xref rid="B140-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Signs and symptoms manifest suddenly and include fever, chills, headache, nausea, and vomiting [
 <xref rid="B139-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. After initial onset of illness, neurological signs and symptoms, including lethargy, drowsiness, neck stiffness, photophobia, vertigo, and mental status changes can manifest within a few days [
 <xref rid="B141-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Infants are particularly prone to irritability, convulsions, upper motor neuron deficits, and tremors, though these signs can appear in older patients as well [
 <xref rid="B142-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. Case-fatality ranges between 3 and 15% [

 <xref rid="B143-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. Neurological sequelae is often seen in patients recovering from neurological complications associated with the disease and is also skewed toward younger individuals [
