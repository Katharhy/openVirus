<p>The specific reason for WEEV′s submergence may never be completely understood. Though it does provide valuable insight regarding the significance viral ecology has on the health of the viral population. Because the specific ecological factors that precipitated WEEV′s submergence are not understood, it is unclear whether the virus is capable of reemerging. However, this scenario remains unlikely due to the reductions in virulence seen in the Group B viruses and near non-existent detection of the virus in nature, though it cannot be completely ruled out.</p>
