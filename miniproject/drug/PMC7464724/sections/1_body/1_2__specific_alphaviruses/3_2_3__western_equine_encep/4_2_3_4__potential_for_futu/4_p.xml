<p>The reverse genetic and phylogenetic data paints an odd picture where WEEV circulation has reduced in nature, with the viral population having undergone reductions and become less diverse, and yet evolved to become more fit in enzootic hosts and vectors. The specific factors that precipitated this evolutionary trajectory are ultimately unknown. Certainly, this putative downward evolutionary trajectory was precipitated by specific ecological events, though they remain cryptic. Hypotheses include horses participating to some extent in the transmission and their reduction over the 20th century removed an important amplifying host; improved vector control methods for 
 <italic>Cx. tarsalis</italic>, though transmission of West Nile virus is facilitated through this vector currently, or some other relevant changes in the enzootic hosts or vectors.
