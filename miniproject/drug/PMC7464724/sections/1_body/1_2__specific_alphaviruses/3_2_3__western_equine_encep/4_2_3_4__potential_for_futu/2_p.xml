<p>Phylogenetically, WEEV clusters into two main groups: Group A and Group B [
 <xref rid="B186-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. Group A viruses became extinct with the emergence of the Group B lineage around 1946 [
 <xref rid="B181-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. Furthermore, Group B viruses subsequently underwent a pattern of emergence and purification resulting in the subgroups B1, B2, and B3. This pattern persisted to the point where after 1993, Group B3 was the only circulating linage attendant with a putative reduction in population size [
 <xref rid="B181-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. Virulence for Group A viruses may be partially explained by a glutamine residue on position 214 of the E2 glycoprotein, when this residue is replaced with an arginine, the residue present on Group B viruses, a reduction in murine neurovirulence is observed [
 <xref rid="B187-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. Group A viruses typically have multiple laboratory amplification cycles (passages) in suckling mice or some other murine passage model due to their age and the standard virological practices at the time of their isolation. A direct result of numerous passage history of Group A viruses is the inability to determine whether the E2-Q214R mutation arose in nature or passage in murine models. Furthermore, the E2-Q214R mutation is not the sole determinant of virulence as several Group B1 isolates are highly virulent with their residue at E2â€“214 being an arginine [
 <xref rid="B181-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. Group A viruses are also less fit in 
 <italic>Cx. tarsalis</italic> than Group B viruses [
