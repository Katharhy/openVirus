<p>Given growing urbanization driving increased human contact with previously undisturbed biomes, global trade/travel driving the spread of invasive mosquitoes and viruses outside their historical sites, and climate change, it is likely that both EEEV and MADV will continue to present threats to human and equid health in the coming years [

 <xref rid="B138-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. This is particularly concerning due to the potential introduction of invasive mosquitoes that can serve as efficient bridge vectors for either virus. Vaccines to prevent disease in humans are currently unavailable. Equine vaccination is effective at preventing EEE, although evidence indicates there are windows of susceptibility following vaccination [
