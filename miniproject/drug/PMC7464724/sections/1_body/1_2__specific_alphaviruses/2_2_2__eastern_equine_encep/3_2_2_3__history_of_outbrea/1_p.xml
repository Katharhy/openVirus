<p>Evidence indicates that EEEV has caused outbreaks in North America in equines as early as 1831 [

 <xref rid="B121-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. The causative agent was ultimately isolated from the brain of an infected horse in New Jersey during a large scale (&gt;1000 horses), multistate (Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, New Jersey) epizootic outbreak in horses in 1933 [

 <xref rid="B121-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Subsequently, additional equine epizootics took place in the states of Virginia and North Carolina in 1934 and 1935, respectively, during which the role of birds in the ecology of EEEV was first proposed [

 <xref rid="B122-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>], although this would not be confirmed until 1950, when the virus was isolated from the blood of a seemingly healthy purple grackle in Louisiana [

 <xref rid="B123-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. The largest reported epizootic took place in southern Louisiana and eastern Texas in 1947 with an estimated 14,334 infections in horses and mules and over 11,000 deaths [

 <xref rid="B124-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Human infection by EEEV was confirmed in 1938, when the virus was isolated from post-mortem brain samples taken from a fatal pediatric case in Boston [

Since then, multiple outbreaks in the eastern United States have occurred, with 112 human cases identified between the years of 1938–1965, 99 cases between 1961–1985, 121 cases between 2003–2016, and 49 cases from 2017 to present [
