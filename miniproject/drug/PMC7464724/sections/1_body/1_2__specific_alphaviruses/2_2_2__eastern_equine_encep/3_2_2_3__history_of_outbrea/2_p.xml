<p>Epizootics of MADV were reported as early as 1908. Although the virus was isolated in horses in Argentina in 1930, it not identified as South American EEEV/MADV until 1953 [

 <xref rid="B85-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Of the 19 hospitalized patients diagnosed with encephalitis in Panama in 2010, seven of these patients were confirmed to be infected with MADV and one patient was co-infected with MADV and VEEV. Community based surveillance identified 99 additional patients with alphavirus infection, of which 13 were found to be infected with MADV and one to be infected with both MADV and VEEV [

Similarly, in 2016, a single adolescent patient in Venezuela was diagnosed with MADV after demonstrating signs of a nonspecific febrile illness that was hypothesized to be due to recent travel to a locale that reported an equine epizootic of MADV [
