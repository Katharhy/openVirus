<p id="par0055">An 80-year-old tourist originating from Hubei Province, with a past medical history of thyroid cancer, presented on January 25 with fever and diarrhoea of 4-day duration. A chest X-ray showed bilateral alveolar opacities, but he did not fulfil the COVID-19 case definition at that time. Airborne and contact precautions were observed and the diagnosis of COVID-19 was eventually made 3 days later. On January 26, acute respiratory failure with multiple organ failure triggered his admission to the ICU. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was started and adapted for co-infection with a susceptible 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> (diagnosed by multiplex PCR and confirmed by tracheal aspirate culture) and 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> (tracheal aspirate culture). Remdesivir was started on January 29, but was discontinued on January 31, as the patient needed renal replacement therapy. The nasopharyngeal VL decreased from a Ct value of 21.0 before infusion to 28.9 on day 2 of infusion. A CT scan performed on January 31 showed bilateral alveolar condensations, ground-glass opacities, and pulmonary cysts. On February 5, because of the disease severity and the persistence of viral detection, remdesivir was re-initiated. Multiple organ failure persisted without any other co-infection identified. He died on February 14.
