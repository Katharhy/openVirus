   <bold>Discovery of novel and potent DHODHi and their anti-influenza A virus activities</bold>. (A) The discovery and design of S312 and S416. The detailed descriptions of the discovery workflow are in Method. Binding analysis of S312 (B) and S416 (C). Thermodynamic analysis of the binding of S312 and S416 to DHODH was carried out at 25 °C on a MicroCal iTC200 instrument. Kinetic analysis of the binding of S312 and S416 to DHODH was performed with a Biacore T200 instrument. (D) Inhibitory activities of DHODHi against influenza A virus (A/WSN/33 [H1N1]). MDCK cells were infected with WSN virus (20 TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/well) in the presence of increasing concentrations of DHODHi (Teriflunomide, Leflunomide, S312, and S416) for 72 h. Inhibition potencies (EC
   <sub>50</sub>) of these four compounds against the WSN virus and their cytoxicities (CC
   <sub>50</sub>) were all determined using cell viability assay. (E and F) Antiviral activities of DHODHi against influenza A virus H3N2 and H9N2. The experimental procedure and the detection method were the same as shown in (D). The results (D–F) are presented as a mean of at least three replicates ± SD. (G) Observation of virus morphology in the presence of the indicated compound. MDCK cells were treated with 5EC
   <sub>50</sub> of S312 or Oseltamivir (EC
   <sub>50</sub> = 0.64 μmol/L) in the meantime of WSN infection. Cells were fixed and stained after 48 h.p.i., Upper well, Control (DMSO); Centre well, Oseltamivir (3 μmol/L, ~5EC
   <sub>50</sub>); Bottom well, S312 (12.5 μmol/L, ~5EC
   <sub>50</sub>)
