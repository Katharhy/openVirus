   <sup>−/−</sup> A549 cells. (B) The growth curve of the WSN virus with or without treatment of S312 on A549 (WT and DHODH
   <sup>−/−</sup>) cells. The A549 cells (WT and DHODH
   <sup>−/−</sup>) were infected with WSN virus (MOI of 0.01) and treated with S312 at a final concentration of 12.5 μmol/L (~5EC
   <sub>50</sub>). The supernatants were assayed for viral titers at 2 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-infection by plaque assay. (C) The statistic analysis for (B). (D) The 293FT cells were co-transfected with the influenza virus minigenome plasmid system (PB1, PB2, PA, NP, pPoII-NP-luc, and pRLSV40). After 12 h.p.i., cells were treated with 2-fold serial dilutions of Oseltamivir, S312, S416, and Brequinar respectively. The luciferase activities were measured 24 h of post-treatment. (E) Effects of nucleosides addition on the antiviral efficacies of S312, S416, and Brequinar. Around 10-fold EC
   <sub>50</sub> of S312 (24 μmol/L) or S416 (0.6 μmol/L) or Brequinar (2.5 μmol/L) and 50 μmol/L four nucleosides (Adenosine, Uridine, Cytidine, Guanosine) were added at the same time on 293FT cells. The luciferase activities were measured 24 h post-treatment. (F and G) Effects of addition of dihydroorotate (DHO) or Orotic acid (ORO) on the antiviral efficacies of S312 and S416. The luciferase activities were detected as above after treating with indicated concentrations of DHO or ORO. All results are presented as a mean of three replicates ± or + SD. Statistical analysis, two-way ANOVA for (B) and (C). One-way ANOVA for (D–G). ns,
