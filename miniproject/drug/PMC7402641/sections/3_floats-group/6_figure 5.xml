   <bold>S312 is more effective at the late and severe infection phase as compared to DAA drug Oseltamivir</bold>. (A) Diagram of the experimental procedure. (B–D) BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with 4000 PFU of WSN virus and then i.p. with S312 (10 mg/kg), Oseltamivir (20 mg/kg), or S312 + Oseltamivir (10 mg/kg + 20 mg/kg) once per day from D3-D7 (B), D5-D9 (C), D7-D11 (D). Another groups of S312 (5 mg/kg), Oseltamivir (20 mg/kg) or S312 + Oseltamivir (5 mg/kg + 20 mg/kg) were given i.p. once per day from D6 to D13 in (E). The green bars indicate the period of drug administration. The body weight and survival were monitored until 14 days post-infection or when the body weight lost more than 25%. (B and C) 
   <italic>n</italic> = 4 per group; (D) S312 (10 mg/kg) 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3, the other groups 
   <italic>n</italic> = 4; (E) S312 (5 mg/kg) 
   <italic>n</italic> = 4, the other groups 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3. The dotted lines indicate initial weight and endpoint for mortality (25% weight loss) separately. The body weights are present as the mean percentage of weight change ±SEM and survival curves were shown. Asterisks (*) indicate significance when the indicated group compared with the non-treatment group, and pound signs (#) indicate significance between single treatment and combined treatment. *#
