<p id="Par25">Many different RNA viruses had caused epidemics and pandemics in the past 20 years, from avian influenza virus (AIV) H5N1 in 1997, SARS-CoV in 2002, pandemic H1N1 in 2009, MERS-CoV in 2012, AIV H7N9 in 2013, Ebola virus in 2013, Zika virus in 2016, to SARS-CoV-2 in 2019. Many of them are still prevalent in certain countries and SARS-CoV-2 currently continues to cause huge devastation worldwide. The conventional one-bug-one-drug paradigm is insufficient to deal with the challenges of these emerging and re-emerging pathogenic viruses (Zhu et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2015b</xref>), moreover, it is too late to develop drugs against each virus behind epidemics (Debing et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2015</xref>). Thus, it is imperative to develop new ideas, highly effective, broad-spectrum antiviral agents, that can treat various viral infections. In this study, we applied DHODHi including a computer-aided designed compound S312 into viral infectious disease. We found that direct-targeting DHODHi are broad-spectrum antiviral both in cell culture and
