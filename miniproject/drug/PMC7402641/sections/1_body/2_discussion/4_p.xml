<p id="Par28">Acute viral infections usually cause severe complications associated with hyper induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which is also known as “cytokine storm” firstly named in severe influenza disease (Yokota, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2003</xref>; Yuen and Wong, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2005</xref>). Several studies showed that seriously ill SARS patients expressed high serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, and TGFβ) and chemokines (CCL2, CXCL10, CXCL9, and IL-8) compared to uncomplicated SARS patients (Wong et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2004</xref>; Zhang et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2004</xref>; Wang et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2005</xref>; Chien et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2006</xref>). Similarly, in severe COVID-19 cases, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, GSCF, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα compared to non-ICU patients (Huang et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2020</xref>). Moreover, A clinical study of 123 patients with COVID-19 showed that the percentage of patients with IL-6 above normal is higher in the severe group (Wan et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2020</xref>). In terms of treatment, immunomodulatory agents can reduce mortality and organ injury of severe influenza. However, these immunomodulatory are mostly non-specific to viral infection but rather a systemic regulation, such as corticosteroid, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or angiotensin receptor blockers (Luke et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2006</xref>; Liu et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>; Gao et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2013</xref>; Hung et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>). Leflunomide and its active metabolite Teriflunomide have been approved for clinical treatment for excessive inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis (Munier-Lehmann et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2013</xref>). Our data once again proved that DHODHi could further reduce cytokine storm over DAA drugs when using influenza A virus-infected animal as a model. We believe that a similar immune-regulating role of DHODHi will exist in COVID-19 patients.
