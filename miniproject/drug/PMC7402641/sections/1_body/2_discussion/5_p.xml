<p id="Par29">The active metabolite A771726 (Teriflunomide) of Leflunomide inhibited the proliferation of PHA mitogen-stimulated human lymphocytes with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 46 µmol/L (Fox et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1999</xref>). The recommended dosage of Leflunomide in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is loading 100 mg/day for 3 days, and subsequently administering 10 mg or 20 mg once daily. Thus, the blood concentration of this clinical dose is 66.62 ± 35.53 µmol/L (18 ± 9.6 mg/L) (Rozman, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2002</xref>), which could be sufficient to afford its therapeutic concentration of anti-RA (46 µmol/L), as well as anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Teriflunomide: EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 26.06 μmol/L at MOI = 0.05; EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6.00 μmol/L at MOI = 0.03). As Leflunomide has been widely used and proved to treat RA with clinical safety and efficacy, it could be also feasible for the clinical trial for the treatment of COVID-19.
