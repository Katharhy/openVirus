<p id="Par26">DHODH is a rate-limiting enzyme catalyzing the fourth step in pyrimidine 
 <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis. It catalyzes the dehydrogenation of dihydroorotate (DHO) to orotic acid (ORO) to finally generate Uridine (U) and Cytosine (C) to supply nucleotide resources in a cell. Under normal conditions, nucleotides are supplied via both 
 <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis and salvage pathways, the latter of which is a way of recycling pre-existing nucleosides from food or other nutrition. However, in virus-infected cells, a large intracellular nucleotide pool is demanded by rapid viral replication. It is therefore reasonable that 
 <italic>de novo</italic> nucleotides biosynthesis rather than salvage pathway is more critical for virus replication. Our data indeed show that virus replication is largely restricted when the DHODH gene was knocked out even with a complete culture medium. By contrast, cell growth was not affected by lacking DHODH at all, indicating that 
 <italic>de novo</italic> nucleotides biosynthesis is not indispensable in normal cell growth without infection at least for days. More interestingly, we notice that compared with DNA viruses, RNA viruses need unique UMP but not TMP in their genomes. UMP is the particular nucleoside produced by DHODH, which means RNA viruses might be more sensitive to DHODH activity. SARS-CoV-2, for instance, has around 32% of UMP in its genome explaining why DHODHi are effective and superior to SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, the comparison between different viruses is worth to be studied in the future.
