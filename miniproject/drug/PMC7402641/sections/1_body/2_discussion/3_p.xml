<p id="Par27">Although several DHODHi have been documented to be antiviral by high-throughput screening (Harvey et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2009</xref>; Wang et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2011</xref>; Adcock et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2017</xref>; Cheung et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>). Most of these compounds are investigated at cell culture level with unknown 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacies. Therefore, the development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents targeting DHODH is still an exciting avenue in antiviral research. S312 and S416 present more potent inhibition and favorable pharmacokinetic profiles, moreover, the half-lives of S312 and S416 (8.20 h and 9.12 h, respectively) are much shorter and more appropriate than that of Teriflunomide, indicating that they may have less possibility to bring toxic side effects from drug accumulation in the body. Strikingly, S312 showed active effects 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> in lethal dose infection of influenza A viruses not only when used from the beginning of infection but also in the late phase when DAA drug is not responding anymore. Another surprise is the high SI value of S416 against Zika (SI = 2 880.53), Ebola (SI = 4 746.11), and the latest SARS-CoV-2 (SI &gt; 12,757.14). These data interpreted that S416 is highly promising to develop further as it should be to S312. The extremely high SI of S416 may be due to its high binding affinity and favorable occupation of the ubiquinone-binding site of DHODH with faster-associating characteristics (

 <sub>on</sub> = 1.76 × 10

 <sup>−1</sup>) and slower dissociating binding characteristic (
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>off</sub> = 2.97 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup>), which will reduce the possibility of off-target 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of S416 against the tested viruses are also lower than S312 at the double-digit nanomolar range (13–61 nmol/L). Unlike S312, the C
 <sub>max</sub> of S416 is &gt;1,000-fold of its antiviral EC
 <sub>50</sub>s at the cellular level. Considering the complexity of the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antiviral experiments, the similar chemical structure, and the same target of S312 and S416, S416 was not enrolled as much as S312 in this study but will be in our future work.
