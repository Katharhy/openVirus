<p id="Par2">Acute viral infections, such as influenza virus, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola virus, Zika virus, and the very recent SARS-CoV-2 are an increasing and probably lasting global threat (Gao, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2018</xref>). Existing direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs cannot be applied immediately to new viruses because of virus-specificity, and the development of new DAA drugs from the beginning is not timely for outbreaks. Broad-spectrum antivirals (BSA) are clinically needed for the effective control of emerging and re-emerging viral infectious diseases. However, although great efforts have been made by the research community to discover therapeutic antiviral agents for coping with such emergencies, yet specific and effective drugs or vaccines with low toxicity have been rarely reported (Ianevski et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2019</xref>). Up to now, unfortunately, there are still no effective drugs for the cure of individuals who are infected with the novel coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV-2, in which an unprecedented outbreak of this virus had occurred in December 2019. This coronavirus was firstly identified in early January 2020 (Chen et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>; Wu et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2020</xref>; Zhou et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2020</xref>) and now has quickly spread throughout the globe, infected more than 10 million individuals and taken the lives of 512, 842 among them as of July 3, 2020.
