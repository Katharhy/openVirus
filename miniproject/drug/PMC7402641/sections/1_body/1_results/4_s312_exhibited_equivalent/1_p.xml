<p id="Par15">In all the previous studies, inhibitors to DHODH or pyrimidine synthesis pathway were only active 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> at low efficacies showing no obvious superior to DAA drugs. To test whether our potent DHODHi could refresh the important role of targeting DHODH in viral diseases, we next explored 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of S312 by intranasal infecting BALB/c mice at a lethal dose of WSN (2 LD
 <sub>50</sub> = 4,000 PFU) or 2009 pandemic H1N1 (A/Sichuan/01/2009, SC09) (2 LD
 <sub>50</sub> = 300 PFU) virus. Treatment of S312 or Osel or combined treatment of “S312 + Osel” was given by the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route around 3 h before infection once per day from D0 to Day 13 to determine body weight change and mortality (experimental procedure shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). The data in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B showed that the body weights of mice from the non-treatment infected group all dropped more than 25% and died at D8 p.i. DAA drug of Osel could indeed totally rescue all the mice from body weight loss and death. Equivalently, S312 (5 mg/kg, red line) was also able to confer 100% protection and little body weight loss similar to Osel. S312 at 2.5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg could confer 75% protection and 50% protection, respectively. The results suggest that S312 of a modest dose (5 mg/kg) would achieve the equivalent 100% protection to DAA drug when used from the beginning of the infection. According to the pharmacokinetic data of 10 mg/kg S312 (C
 <sub>max</sub> = 5 310.50 μg/L = ~14.84 μmol/L) (Table S3) which is sufficient to afford all of the effective concentrations in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> (especially EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.37 μmol/L against the WSN), we mainly used 10 mg/kg and the modest dose of 5 mg/kg in the following experiments.
