<p id="Par16">To further prove S312 is also effective to treat a natural-isolated H1N1 virus, the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain, SC09, was used to infect mice. The data in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C showed that even though SC09 is less sensitive to either Osel (40% protection) or S312 (20% protection) compared to WSN, 100% protection could still be achieved in combined treatment of S312 + Osel, indicating that HTA and DAA drug combination can augment therapeutic effects.
