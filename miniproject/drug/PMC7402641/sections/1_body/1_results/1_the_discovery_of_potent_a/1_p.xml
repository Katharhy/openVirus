<p id="Par5">By virtual screening, we identified two molecules with the same novel scaffold, which is obviously different from those of Leflunomide/Teriflunomide or Brequinar. The X-ray crystal structure of DHODH in complex with S416 (Fig. S1A; Table S1) further verified the binding mode of S416 at the ubiquinone-binding site of DHODH that is similar to S312. Compared to S312, the addition of the methyl group of S416 can perfectly occupy the small hydrophobic subsite formed by residues Met43, Leu46, and Gln47 on DHODH to form favorable Van der Waals interactions, contributing to the enhanced binding affinity of S416. The binding free energies for S312 and S416 were −45.06 kJ/mol and −46.74 kJ/mol, and the binding equilibrium dissociation constants (
