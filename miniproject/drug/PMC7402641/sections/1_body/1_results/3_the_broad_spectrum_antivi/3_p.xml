<p id="Par14">We further did immuno-florescent assay to visualize the drug potencies against SARS-CoV-2. The data in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B clearly showed that all DHODHi including Leflunomide (200 μmol/L), Teriflunomide (67 μmol/L), Brequinar (10 μmol/L), S312 (50 μmol/L), S416 (0.37 μmol/L) exhibited similar inhibitions on SARS-CoV-2, corresponding to the strength of their EC
 <sub>50</sub> values. By contrast, even 200 μmol/L of Favipiravir only inhibited partial SARS-CoV-2 infections, indicating that DHODHi are more efficient inhibitors over Favipiravir to SARS-CoV-2 in this assay. Again, S416 turns to be the best efficient chemical so far against SARS-CoV-2 at the cellular level.
