<p id="Par22">It is known that severe acute infections, including influenza and COVID-19, always induce pathogenic immunity as cytokine/chemokine storms. Leflunomide and Teriflunomide are already clinically used in autoimmune disease to inhibit pathogenic cytokines and chemokines. We, therefore, suspected that DHODHi should also prevent cytokine-storm in viral infectious disease. BALF from either Osel- or “S312 + Osel”-treated mice were collected at D14 in an independently repeated severe late-phase treatment with a lower infection dose (1 LD50, 2000 PFU) to allow partial survival from Osel-treatment. Comparable body weights of the survival mice could exclude the differences in virus load (Fig. S6A). The data in Fig. S6B showed that the pathogenic inflammatory cytokines in “S312 + Osel”-treated group was largely reduced as compared to Osel-treated mouse in the levels of IL6, MCP-1, IL5, KC/GRO (CXCL1), IL2, IFN-γ, IP-10, IL9, TNF-α, GM-CSF, EPO, IL12p70, MIP3α and IL17A/F (listed in the order of reducing significance).</p>
