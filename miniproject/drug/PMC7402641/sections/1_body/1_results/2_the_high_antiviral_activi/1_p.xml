<p id="Par10">To examine the antiviral activities of these DHODHi, we use the influenza A virus as a model virus. The 20 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of a labor stain of A/WSN/33 (H1N1, WSN) was applied to infect MDCK cells, and serial dilutions of drugs (DMSO as controls) were added at the same time when the cells were infected. Drug effects were evaluated by quantification of cell viability in both infected and non-infected cells, and the half-maximal effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) and the half-cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) of the indicated drug were obtained accordingly. The selectivity index (SI) was calculated by CC
 <sub>50</sub>/EC
 <sub>50</sub>. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D, the antiviral effect of Leflunomide is hardly detectable at the cell culture level (EC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 25 μmol/L). However, Teriflunomide, the active metabolite of Leflunomide, exhibited a clear antiviral effect against the WSN virus (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 35.02 μmol/L, CC
 <sub>50</sub> = 178.50 μmol/L, SI = 5.10). As compared to Teriflunomide, the potent DHODHi S312 is ~15-fold stronger (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.37 μmol/L) and S416 is ~574-fold stronger (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.061 μmol/L) than Teriflunomide in their antiviral activities. We also tested different influenza A virus subtypes of H3N2 and H9N2 (summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The antiviral effective curves of Teriflunomide, S312, and S416 to H3N2 and H9N2 were shown also in MDCK cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E and 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>F). The antiviral activity of S416 was again the highest, followed by Teriflunomide and S312. When we compared the drug effects by virus plaque assay, the results in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>G showed that the positive control DAA drug Oseltamivir (Osel) could reduce the plaque size to needlepoint size. However, the virus plaque in equivalent S312-treatment was not observable at all, indicating that S312 is more efficient in inhibiting virus replication than Osel.
