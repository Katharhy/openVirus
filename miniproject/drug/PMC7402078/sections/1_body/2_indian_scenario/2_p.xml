<p id="Par8">The study of microbiology, and especially virology, is time-consuming, with many steps involved. The isolation, identification, preservation, characterisation, screening of antimicrobial activity (Parija 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2016</xref>, and studying the behaviour of viruses in different laboratory conditions is both challenging and risky (Earnest Gould 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1999</xref>). The challenges in developing new generations of vaccines are substantial at the levels of basic biology and efficacy. The greater challenges, however, arise when introducing vaccines to the public (Rauch et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2018</xref>). Communities at large will resist any change in the natural system. For example, when family planning was introduced, people had misconceptions regarding different methods (Khan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1980</xref>). Similarly, acceptance of the polio vaccine by the population took several months before it became a routine procedure to eradicate polio (Chowdhary et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2011</xref>). There were continuous struggles for HIV/AIDS programs in India to bring about changes in public attitudes (Satyajeet and Pramanik 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2009</xref>). It is not uncommon for India to experience sudden and rapid outbreaks of epidemics and pandemics. Studies have reported that outbreaks in developing countries are caused by malnutrition, lack of sanitation and proper public health systems, and unavailability of ready-made vaccines (Ergunay 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>; Rice et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2000</xref>; John et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>; Sivabakya and Srinivas 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2020</xref>). It is also a sad truth that India will have to be ready to face several more such outbreaks in the days to come (Mishra 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2015</xref>). Thus, preparedness has to be given immense importance, and control of spread should be the number one priority of the government, doctors and other health care workers, and the general public.
