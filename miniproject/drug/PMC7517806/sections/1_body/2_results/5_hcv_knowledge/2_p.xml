<p id="Par37">The multivariate analysis (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) showed that knowledge of HCV was independently associated with membership of a harm reduction organization (aOR = 5.5, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001), and previous voluntary participation in a drug rehabilitation programme (aOR = 4.3, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.015), while Lahu ethnicity was negatively associated (aOR = 0.3, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.038). However, after adjustment, education and history of incarceration did not remain significantly associated with HCV knowledge.
