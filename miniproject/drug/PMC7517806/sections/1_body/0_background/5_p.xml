<p id="Par15">The prevalence of HCV in the general population in Thailand is estimated, based on scant data, at 1–3% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], representing around 350,000 individuals with active HCV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Several studies have identified injection drug use as the main risk factor of new infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The estimated number of PWID ranges from 40,300 to 160,500 individuals in Thailand [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and from 3000 to 4000 individuals in Chiang Mai [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], with estimated HCV prevalence ranging from 44 to 86% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This extremely high HCV prevalence among PWID concurs with global and regional estimates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The few studies estimating HCV screening uptake among PWID in Thailand found low rates coupled with low awareness of the disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], suggesting that most PWID infected with HCV do not know their status. This lack of awareness is correlated with difficulties in accessing healthcare generally [
