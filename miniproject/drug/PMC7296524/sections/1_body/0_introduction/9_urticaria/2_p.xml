<p id="Par68">Omalizumab, the first available humanized monoclonal anti-IgE in the pediatric population, is recommended as a treatment for children older than 12 years with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) unresponsive to 2nd-generation H1-antihistamines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. This therapy is recommended to be administered as a subcutaneous injection at 300 mg every 4 weeks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. During COVID-19 pandemic and consistently with health conditions, patients with CSU should be advised to continue to use their routine treatment, including omalizumab, to prevent disease exacerbations, unnecessary visits to physicians, and hospitalization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In this regard, patients can be trained to self-inject omalizumab and stay at home if they are competent and confident enough [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Follow-up appointments should be scheduled if needed. New patients should receive the first two injections of omalizumab in the hospital due to the minor risk of anaphylaxis; then, they can continue treatment at home [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Delaying the beginning of omalizumab treatment is not suggested as giving long-term high corticosteroid doses or using other immunosuppressive drugs could increase the vulnerability to COVID-19 [
