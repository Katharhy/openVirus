<p id="Par70">Cyclosporine A has shown an excellent clinical efficacy when administered in combination with 2nd-generation H1-antihistamine in treating children with CSU. However, due to a higher incidence of adverse effects, cyclosporine A is not recommended as a standard treatment in CSU. On the other hand, in children and adolescents with CSU unresponsive to 2nd generation H1-antihistamines and omalizumab, cyclosporine A is suggested as a therapeutic option [

Similar to patients undergoing immunosuppressive treatment, cyclosporine A should not be stopped during COVID-19 pandemic and consistently with health conditions; however, the administration of the lowest possible doses (≤1 mg/kg/day) is suggested due to a minor increased risk of viral infections, mainly respiratory tract infections [
