<p id="Par72">The use of immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclosporine, for dermatologic diseases is contraindicated in patients with active infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Since available data suggest multiple cytokine axis activations in the viral immune response in patients with COVID-19, broad immunosuppression may have the potential to increase susceptibility, persistence, and reactivation of the viral infection. Immunosuppressive agents may decrease cytokines that recruit and differentiate immune cells needed to clear the infection. Also, inflammatory mediators may become hyperactivated, resulting in a “cytokine storm,” which has been demonstrated to be involved in severe and life-threatening COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Biologic agents are targeted therapies that tend to be less involved in the previously mentioned components of the viral immune response. Whether biologic agents may increase the risk of infection or cause a severe disease is unknown.
