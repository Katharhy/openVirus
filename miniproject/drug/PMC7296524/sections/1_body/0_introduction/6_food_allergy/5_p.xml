 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Several studies highlight the role of micronutrients (trace elements, minerals, and vitamins) in the immunological mechanisms involved in response to infections. Therefore, recent studies recommend their regular intake, especially in preschoolers. The diet should be varied and complete to assure the right intake of macro and micronutrients. In particular, supplementation of Vitamin D at a dose of 600–1000 IU/day during meals would be advisable in this pandemic period that requires staying at home with a consequent reduction in exposure to sunlight. More generous dosages would be appropriate in the presence of risk factors, such as obesity, anti-epileptic therapy, and dark skin.
