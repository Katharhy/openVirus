<p id="Par50">Patients affected by some kind of food allergy (e.g., peanut allergy) may benefit from oral immunotherapy (OIT) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. OIT requires many in-hospital visits for a gradual increase of allergen dose ingestion. Allergen dose increases should be carried out under medical supervision because of the risk of potentially severe systemic reactions. Therefore, the initiation of OIT should be postponed. If a patient is undergoing OIT, we suggest maintaining the same daily dose of allergen at home until new medical indications are given.
