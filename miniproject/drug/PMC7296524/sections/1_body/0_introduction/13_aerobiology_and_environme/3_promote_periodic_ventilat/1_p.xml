<p id="Par100">The size of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is within a range of 50–200 nm, falling within the nanoparticle range, which, especially in indoor environments, can reach high degrees of diffusion [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Indeed, the SARS-CoV-2 virus produced an aerosol from expectoration, respiration, and vocalization that can remain in the atmosphere for a period of between 3 and 16 h as bioaerosol, constituting a potential danger. Therefore, extensive ventilation in domestic and community environments in the allergic child could help in reducing exposure to indoor allergens and SARS-Cov-2 as well [
