<p id="Par85">Immunoglobulin replacement therapy represents a life-saving treatment for many primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs), including hypo/agammaglobulinemia and immunodeficiencies characterized by combined or complex phenotypes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The safety of immunoglobulins against virus contamination is also ensured through multiple virus inactivation and removal steps during manufacturing processes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Therefore, immunoglobulin replacement therapy should be continued in PID patients, without changing the timing and the dose of administration unless clinically indicated. The use of home services (IV/SC) is therefore encouraged, provided that proper training procedures have been ensured [
