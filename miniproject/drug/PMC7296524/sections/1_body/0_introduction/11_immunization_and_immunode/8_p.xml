<p id="Par84">The American Academy of Pediatrics, unless specific contraindications exist, recommended routine influenza immunization in all children starting at 6 months of age during the 2019–2020 season with greater emphasis in high-risk groups [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Nevertheless, some primary immunodeficiency (PID) patients, especially those with chronic lung disease, might have a more severe clinical course [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, reinforcement of influenza immunization programs has also been suggested for 2020–2021 by the Italian Pediatric Society, with particular consideration for children under 6 years of age and patients with chronic underlying conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The use of airborne precautions in the office for both children and healthcare operators is recommended during immunization procedures. Annual immunization with a nonviable influenza vaccine is also recommended in all PID patients if the patient is considered to be capable of mounting an effective immunological response unless medical contraindications exist [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Nonviable influenza vaccination is also strongly recommended in household contacts of PID patients.
