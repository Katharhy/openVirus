<p id="Par87">Some PID patients, especially those associated with chronic lung disease, might be at higher risk for a more severe course of COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Stratification of risk has also been proposed by some immunological societies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. However, very few data exist on the clinical course and phenotype of COVID-19 in PIDs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. It is also conceivable that some immunosuppressive therapies (e.g., corticosteroids) can attenuate some clinical symptoms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Investigation for SARS-CoV-2 is recommended after public exposure in severe forms of PIDs and when acute respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms occur, according to also to health authorities guidelines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It must be remembered that in some patients, the viral shedding could be prolonged because of a slow clearance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. After SARS-CoV-2 exposure, the decision to continue immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies should be discussed with the immunologist [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Drug interactions must also be carefully considered.
