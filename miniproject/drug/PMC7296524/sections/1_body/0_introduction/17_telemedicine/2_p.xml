<p id="Par135">In the COVID-19 era, telehealth medicine could play a key role in delivering immunological and allergological consultations and ensuring the need to keep social distancing. Activating virtual consulting practices by the opportunities offered from free access web-based communication platforms may be beneficial for both first consultations and follow-up visits in patients with suspected or ascertained allergy or immunodeficiency. Sharing between families and allergy or immunology specialists clinical materials, such as images, investigations, or laboratory data, may help manage many simple immune-mediated diseases like urticaria or recurrent respiratory infections. Indeed, history plays a pivotal role in establishing when parents’ perception of hypersensitivity or immune-mediated symptoms fit with a defined allergic or immunodeficiency condition or an exacerbation of a previously diagnosed immunological disease occur. At the same time, specialists must not overlook some crucial symptoms when an overt emergency occurs. As an example, in the table (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) are reported some “red flags” which could help the clinician in establishing if a child with the suspected allergic or immune-mediated disease need for an urgent hospital-based consultation, with the possible hypothesis of symptom-related underlying clinical conditions.
