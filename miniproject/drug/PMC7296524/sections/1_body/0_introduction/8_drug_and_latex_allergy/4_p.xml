<p id="Par60">The diagnostic accuracy of skin tests to Azithromycin, Hydroxychloroquine, and Tocilizumab [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] is low, and to Remdesivir is unknown [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A confident diagnosis of drug hypersensitivity can be reached by performing a drug provocation test (DPT) with the culprit drug. Anaphylaxis or severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) represent a contraindication to DPT with the culprit. So, children with a history of severe reaction to the drugs should undergo skin tests when DPT is contra-indicate. In all the other cases, a DPT should be promptly performed in a hospital setting by qualified personnel with emergency facilities available to treat any reaction. In those cases, with confirmatory diagnosis and an absolute indication of treatment, a desensitization protocol can be settled down with the culprit.
