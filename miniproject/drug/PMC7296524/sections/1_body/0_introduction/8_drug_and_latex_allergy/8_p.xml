<p id="Par64">Chlorhexidine is used as disinfectant and antiseptic, but it is indicated only for children older than 2 months. Allergic reactions are triggered by skin, mucous membrane (oral, conjunctiva, transurethral, rectal, vaginal), and parenteral exposure [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Higher concentrations of chlorhexidine irritate the skin and increase the risk of sensitization [

The use of low concentrations of chlorhexidine (0.5–2% weight/volume) is suggested to prevent sensitization.
