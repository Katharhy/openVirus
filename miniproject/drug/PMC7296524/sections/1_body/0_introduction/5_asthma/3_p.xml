<p id="Par34">Ensure that all patients have a written action plan with instructions on how to increase the dosage of the controller drug (“step-up”) and the use of bronchodilator drugs and OCS, in case of reappearance or worsening of symptoms. If possible, avoid the use of nebulizers (nebulizers increase the risk of spreading the virus to other subjects and health professionals) and prefer the administration of bronchodilators and ICS through a metered dosed inhaler (MDI) with the help of a spacer. Ensure patients or their parents know when to contact their doctor and/or medical Emergency helpline or go to the Emergency Room for acute worsening of asthma. Always prescribe asthma medications in more significant quantities to make up for the lack of supplies.</p>
