<p id="Par41">Cigarette smoke, always and in any case harmful, causes an increase in the expression of ACE2 receptors, present mainly in the lower respiratory tract [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. ACE2 is the coronavirus receptor: through binding with it, coronavirus penetrates the pulmonary alveolus and thus infects the individual. Therefore, an increased expression of ACE2, induced by smoking, means increased susceptibility to contract the COVID-19 infection and potentially to develop a more severe form.
