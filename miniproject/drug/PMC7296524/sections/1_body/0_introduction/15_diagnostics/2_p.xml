<p id="Par112">So far, scientific societies and researchers have not expressed real recommendations concerning what kind of allergic procedure should be assured during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the recommendations here listed are therefore issued from the experts’ opinion. Specialists should evaluate the risk/benefit ratio in each patient to decide which tests should not be delayed, even during the pandemic context, still trying to reduce as much as possible the risk of spreading the viral infection. In general, not deferrable clinical patterns requiring a fast allergy workup should include:
