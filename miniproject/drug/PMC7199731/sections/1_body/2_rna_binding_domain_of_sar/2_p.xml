<p id="p0055">SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus with single-stranded RNA genomes, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. The first two-thirds of viral 30Â kb RNA genome, mainly named as ORF1a/b region, translates into two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) and encodes most of the non-structural proteins (nsp) [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The rest parts of the virus genome encode accessory proteins and four essential structural proteins, including spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein, matrix (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein [

 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] Current antiviral drugs developed to treat coronavirus (CoV) infections primarily target S protein, the 3C-like (3CL) and papain-like (PLP) proteases [

 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Because mutant viruses in the S protein is prone to escape the targeted therapeutic with different host-cell receptor binding patterns [
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], as well as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effects of S protein antibodies are found in MERS coronavirus [
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], there are several limitations on targeting S protein for antiviral approaches. Antiviral protease inhibitors may nonspecifically act on the cellular homologous protease, resulting in host cell toxicity and severe side effects. Therefore, novel antiviral strategies are needed to combat acute respiratory infections caused by this novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (
