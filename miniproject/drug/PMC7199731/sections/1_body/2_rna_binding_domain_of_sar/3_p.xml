<p id="p0060">The CoV N protein is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein necessary for viral RNA transcription and replication [
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. It plays many pivotal roles in forming helical ribonucleoproteins during packaging the RNA genome, regulating viral RNA synthesis during replication, transcription and modulating infected cell metabolism [
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The primary functions of N protein are binding to the viral RNA genome, and packing them into a long helical nucleocapsid structure or ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex [

 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].

 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments revealed that N protein bound to leader RNA, and was critical for maintaining highly ordered RNA conformation suitable for replicating, and transcribing the viral genome [

 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. More studies implicated that N protein regulated host-pathogen interactions, such as actin reorganization, host cell cycle progression, and apoptosis [
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The N protein is also a highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed protein during infection, capable of inducing protective immune responses against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [

 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>]. The common domain architectures of coronavirus N protein are consisting of three distinct but highly conserved parts: An N-terminal RNA-binding domain (NTD), a C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD), and intrinsically disordered central Ser/Arg (SR)-rich linker. Previous studies have revealed that the NTD are responsible for RNA binding, CTD for oligomerization, and (SR)-rich linker for primary phosphorylation, respectively [

 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>]. The crystal structures of SARS-CoV N-NTD [
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) N-NTD [
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], HCoV-OC43 N-NTD [
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) N-NTD [
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] have been solved. The CoVs N-NTD have been found to associate with the 3â€² end of the viral RNA genome, possibly through electrostatic interactions. Additionally, several critical residues have been identified for RNA binding and virus infectivity in the N-terminal domain of coronavirus N proteins [

 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>]. However, the structural and mechanistic basis for newly emerged novel SARS-CoV-2 N protein remains largely unknown. Understanding these aspects should facilitate the discovery of agents that specifically block the coronavirus replication, transcription and viral assembly [
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Kang et al. [
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] reported the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid N-terminal domain (termed as SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD), as a model for understanding the molecular interactions that govern SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD binding to ribonucleotides. This finding will aid in the development of new drugs that interfere with viral N protein and viral replication in SARS-CoV-2, and highly related virus SARS-CoV [
