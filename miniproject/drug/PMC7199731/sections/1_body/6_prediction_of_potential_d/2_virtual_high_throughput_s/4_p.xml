<p id="p0135">The recent availability of the genomic sequence of the virus responsible for COVID-19, as well as the experimentally determined three-dimensional structure of the Mpro was utilized as the target for virtual high throughput screening [
 <xref rid="bib120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>], indicating that the results confirm earlier preliminary reports based on studies of homologs that some of the drugs approved for the treatment of other viral infections also have the potential for the treatment of COVID-19. Therefore, approved anti-viral drugs that target proteases were ranked for potential effectiveness against COVID-19 and novel candidates for drug repurposing were identified.
