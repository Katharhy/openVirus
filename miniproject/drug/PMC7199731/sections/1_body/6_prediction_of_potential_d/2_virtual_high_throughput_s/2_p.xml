 <xref rid="bib121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. The low time requirements of computational methods are conducive for high throughput screening of available drugs to identify potential drugs for novel diseases as well as to predict the adverse effects of novel drugs [
 <xref rid="bib122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Development of novel drugs is a time-consuming process and generally, several years of work are required for clinical approval [
 <xref rid="bib121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Drug repositioning, also known as repurposing, is an effective strategy to combat novel diseases caused by infectious agents that spread rapidly [
 <xref rid="bib123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Drugs that have been approved for some disease, are safe for human use, and only their effectiveness against the disease of interest needs to be established [
 <xref rid="bib124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. In life-threatening cases, where there is no alternative medicine or vaccine, such a drug repurposing strategy is particularly attractive. However, clinical trials are necessary to ensure that such treatment is better than a placebo [
