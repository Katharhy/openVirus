 <xref rid="bib120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. To explore suitable natural inhibitors for the N-terminal receptor-binding domain of spike protein, the spike protein sequences were collected from a protein database. And also they were analyzed with various bioinformatics tools, attempting to identify suitable vaccine candidates by identifying B-Cell and T-cell epitopes [
 <xref rid="bib137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. In the drug design, the tanshinone Iia and methyl Tanshinonate were identified as natural inhibitors based on the docking score [

FVFLVLLPL of MHC class-I allele and FVFLVLLPL of MHC class-II allele were identified as best peptides based on several alleles and antigenicity scores [
