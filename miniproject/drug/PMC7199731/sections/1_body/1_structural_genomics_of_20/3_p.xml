<p id="p0050">By providing a comprehensive structural genomics and interactomics road-maps of Sars-CoV-2 and using this information to infer the possible functional differences and similarities with the related SARS coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2 has 16 predicted non-structural proteins constituting a polyprotein, followed by 13 downstream ORFs: Surface, ORF3a, ORF3b, Envelope, Membrane, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, Nucleocapsid, ORF9a, ORF9b, and ORF10. The three viral species whose proteins shared the highest similarity were consistently the same: human SARS (SARS- Cov), bat coronavirus (BtCoV), as well as another bat betacoronavirus (BtRf-BetaCoV) [
