 <xref rid="bib110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Morgenstern et al. [
 <xref rid="bib111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] had reported that ribavirin and interferon-β synergistically inhibited the replication of SARS-associated coronavirus in animal and human cell lines. Given adverse reactions and the lack of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> efficacy, the use of ribavirin should be seriously considered for the treatment of COVID-19, even in combination with other antiviral drugs. The combination of lopinavir (LPV) with ritonavir (RTV) is widely used as a boosted protease inhibitor in the treatment of HIV infection [
 <xref rid="bib112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="bib113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>] had also reported a successful case of MERS-CoV disease treated with triple combination therapy LPV/RTV, ribavirin, and IFN-α2a. Remdesivir (RDV), a nucleoside analog GS-5734, had been reported to inhibit human and zoonotic coronavirus 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and to restrain severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Recently, the antiviral activity of RDV and IFN-β was found to be superior to that of LPV/RTV–IFN–β against MERS-CoV 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Therefore, the use of RDV with IFN-β could be a better choice for the treatment of COVID-19 comparing with that of the triple combination of LPV/RTV–IFN–β. However, randomized and controlled trials are still needed to determine the safety and efficacy of remdesivir. Yamamoto et al. [
 <xref rid="bib116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>] had found that nelfinavir could strongly inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV.
