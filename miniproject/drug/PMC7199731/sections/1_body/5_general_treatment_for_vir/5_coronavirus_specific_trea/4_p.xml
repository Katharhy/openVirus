<p id="p0110">Chloroquine has many interesting biochemical properties including antiviral effects. In addition, it had been used against viral infection [
 <xref rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Emodin is an anthraquinone compound derived from genus Rheum boosted protease inhibitor in the treatment of HIV infection. Lopinavir (LPV) is usually combined with ritonavir (RTV) to increase and Polygonum and it is also a virucidal agent [

 <xref rid="bib107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. As compared to emodin, promazine exhibited potent inhibition of the binding of S protein to ACE2. These findings suggested that emodin and promazine might be able to inhibit SARS-CoV infectivity by blocking the interaction of S protein and ACE2. Therefore, the monoclonal antibody (scFv80R), chloroquine, emodin, and promazine could be used as choices for the treatment of COVID-19. Nicotianamine is an important metal-ligand in plants [
