Papain-like protease (PLP) of human coronavirus is a novel viral-encoded deubiquitinase and is an IFN antagonist for inhibition of host innate antiviral immune response. Diarylheptanoids is a natural product and is extracted from the stem bark of Alnus japonica. It was able to inhibit papain-like protease of SARS-CoV [
