<p id="p0080">However, we and others found that ACE2 is lowly expressed, especially in the lung (the main target organ of nCoVs), raising the possible existence of co-receptors facilitating nCoV infection. It is well recognized that ssRNA viruses tend to have multiple receptors [
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. For example, ACE2, CD209 (Dendritic Cell-Specific ICAM-3-Grabbing Non-Integrin 1), CLEC4G (C-type lectin domain family 4 member G) and CLEC4M (C-type lectin domain family 4 member M) are receptors of SARS-CoV [

 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Also, other membrane proteins may also assist virus entry [
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Since the viral receptors and co-receptors should be co-expressed on the same cell types, single-cell co-expression patterns covering 400 membrane proteins and 51 known viral receptors was analyzed [
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. After calculating gene expression similarity, they found ANPEP, ENPEP and DPP4 are the top three genes correlated with ACE4 (R &gt; 0.8). Interestingly, both ANPEP and DPP4 are viral receptors of human coronaviruses [
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], while ENPEP is also a peptidase, despite that its involvement in virus infection is unclear. For mysterious reasons, human coronaviruses use peptidases as their receptors [
 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. In addition, Li et al. [
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] showed co-expression profiles of these molecules, indicating that different human CoVs target similar cell types across different human tissues.
