<p id="p0075">The viruses target host cells via binding host receptors before engaging the infection cycle. ACE2 was proved to be the cell receptor of Sars-CoV-2, the same receptor as SARS-CoV [

 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The expression profiles of ACE2 across different cell types of different organs will reveal clues of the virus transmission routes and its potential pathogenesis. In previous studies, ACE2 was found to express in the esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells, absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon, alveolar type II cells in the lung, liver cholangiocyte and kidney proximal tubules [

 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. These findings suggested that the clinical symptoms of hepatic failure, respiratory injury, acute kidney injury or diarrhoea may be associated with the pervasive ACE2 expressing cells in these tissues.
