<p id="p0035">Nevertheless, in the past two decades, a massive amount of work has been done to understand the molecular basis of the coronavirus infection and evolution, develop an effective treatment in forms of both vaccines and antiviral drugs, and propose efficient measures for viral detection and prevention [

 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>]. Structures of many individual proteins of SARS, MERS, and related coronaviruses, as well as their biological interactions with other viral and host proteins, have been explored along with the experimental testing of anti-viral properties of small compounds [

 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>]. In this context, the use of bioinformatics approaches may help fill the gap of missing data and improve the process of knowledge discovery by elucidating molecular mechanisms behind virus replication, the process of viral attachment to the host cells and the effect on the host molecular pathways [
