<p id="p0165">As noted before, COVID-19 has become a global concern, due to widespread outbreaks and lack of treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to find and evaluate treatment methods more quickly in this case computer methods are very effective and helpful. The predicted binding and ranking of drugs will also be useful to interpret the results of ongoing clinical trials that are testing existing drugs for effectiveness against COVID-19. Notwithstanding the limitations, it has been described several diseases and traits which may be causally related to ACE2 expression the lung, which in turn may mediate susceptibility to Sars-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the proteome-wide MR analysis revealed proteins that could lead to changes in ACE2 expression. Subsequent drug repositioning analysis highlighted several candidates that may warrant further investigations. We stress that most of the findings require replications and validation in further studies, especially the part on drug repositioning. Nevertheless, it is believed that this work is of value given the urgency to address the outbreak of Sars-CoV-2.</p>
