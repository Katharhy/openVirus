<p>Several uncontrolled case series of convalescent plasma therapy for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 have suggested a possible benefit [

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The reports showed that convalescent plasma therapy induced reduction in viral loads and improvement of laboratory markers and clinical signs. Most studies were non-randomized, non-controlled studies, and the participants had severe or life-threatening disease. Given encouraging historical precedents and the lack of proven effective therapy for COVID-19, clinical studies on the use of convalescent plasma as a treatment option for COVID-19 are ongoing in many countries. As of August 3 2020, a total of 132 studies evaluating the role of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 are registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. The first randomized trial of convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 patients was conducted in China [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. To evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of convalescent plasma therapy for patients with COVID-19, an open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial was performed in seven medical centers in Wuhan, China. The study included 103 participants with severe or life-threatening COVID-19. To ensure the therapeutic potency of the convalescent plasma, only the plasma units with a spike protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD)-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer of at least 1:640 were used in the study. However, because the COVID-19 epidemic in China was contained while enrolment was in progress, the trial was terminated before it reached its targeted sample size of 200 patients. Hence, it was underpowered and many comparisons between the convalescent plasma group and the control group were not statistically significant. The primary endpoint of time to clinical improvement within 28 days (defined as being discharged alive or having a reduction of 2 points on a 6-point disease severity scale) was 2.15 days shorter (95% confidence interval [CI], −5.28 to 0.99 days; hazard ratio [HR]: 1.40, 95% CI: 0.79 - 2.49; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.26) in the intervention group compared to the control group, and 27 (51.9%) patients in the intervention group experienced a clinical improvement within 28 days, compared to 22 patients (43.1%) in the control group (difference: 8.8%; 95% CI: −10.4% to 28%; odds ratio [OR]: 1.20, 95% CI:0.80 - 1.81; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.37). In analyses stratified by disease severity, among patients with severe disease (23 in the convalescent plasma group and 22 in the control group), the time to clinical improvement was 4.94 days shorter (95% CI: −9.33 to −0.54 days; HR: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.07 - 4.32; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.03, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.03) in the intervention group, and clinical improvement at 28 days occurred in 21 patients (91.3%) in the intervention group 
 <italic>vs.</italic> 15 patients (68.2%) in the control group (OR:1.34, 95% CI: 0.98 - 1.83; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.07). Although the study was underpowered, the study results showed convalescent plasma therapy was associated with some clinical improvement in severely ill patients, but not in critically ill patients. Because antibody therapies generally work when administered earlier stage of disease, the efficacy might be better in patients with severe (respiratory distress and/or hypoxemia) than life-threatening (shock, organ failure, or requiring mechanical ventilation). Some of the patients with life-threatening disease might have had irreversible disease at the time that plasma therapy was initiated.
