<p>In the early twentieth century, convalescent sera were used to stem epidemics of viral diseases such as poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, and influenza [

A study with 93 participants showed that treatment of severe H1N1 2009 infection with convalescent plasma reduced respiratory tract viral load, serum cytokine response, and mortality. During the 2013 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, a nonrandomized study showed significantly longer survival for those treated with convalescent whole blood compared to those who received standard treatment [
