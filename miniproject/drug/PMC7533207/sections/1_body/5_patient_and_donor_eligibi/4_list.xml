  <p>(1) Evidence of COVID-19 documented by a laboratory test either by a diagnostic test (
   <italic>e.g.</italic>, nasopharyngeal swab) at the time of illness or a positive serological test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after recovery, if prior diagnostic testing was not performed at the time that COVID-19 was suspected.

  <p>(2) Either one of the following (i) Complete resolution of symptoms at least 28 days prior to donation; or (ii) Complete resolution of symptoms at least 14 days prior to donation, and negative results for COVID-19 either from one or more nasopharyngeal swab specimens or by a molecular diagnostic test from blood.</p>

  <p>(3) Male donors, or female donors who have not been pregnant, or female donors who have been tested since their most recent pregnancy and results were interpreted as negative for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies.</p>

 <list-item>
  <p>(4) SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers, if available (when measurement of neutralizing antibody titers is available, the US FDA recommends neutralizing antibody titers of at least 1:160. A titer of 1:80 may be considered acceptable if an alternative matched unit is not available. When measurement of neutralizing antibody titers is not available, it is suggested that a retention sample from the convalescent plasma donation be stored so that the antibody titers can be determined at a later date.</p>
