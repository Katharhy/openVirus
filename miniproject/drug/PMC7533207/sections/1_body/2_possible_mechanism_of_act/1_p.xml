<p>Convalescent plasma therapy is a passive antibody therapy that involves the administration of antibodies against a given pathogen to a susceptible individual for the purpose of preventing or treating an infectious disease. Neutralizing antibodies have been considered essential in the effects of convalescent plasma therapy, and the efficacy of this therapy was associated with the titer of neutralizing antibodies in the convalescent plasma [
