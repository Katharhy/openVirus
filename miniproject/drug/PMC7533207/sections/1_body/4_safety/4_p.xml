<p>A United States (US) study of 5,000 hospitalized adults with severe or life-threatening COVID-19, with 66% in the intensive care unit, provided safety data on convalescent plasma therapy [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The incidence of all serious adverse events (SAEs) in the first four hours after transfusion was &lt;1%, including a 0.3% mortality rate. Of the 36 reported SAEs, 25 were assessed as possibly or definitely transfusion related, including mortality (4 cases), TACO (7 cases), TRALI (11 cases), and severe allergic transfusion reactions (3 cases). However, only 2 (of 36) SAEs were judged as definitely related to the convalescent plasma transfusion by the treating physician. The study suggested that convalescent plasma therapy for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was relatively safe.
