<p>TACO and TRALI are the leading causes of transfusion-related fatalities, and specific therapies are unavailable [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. TACO and TRALI are syndromes of acute respiratory distress that occur within 6 hours of blood transfusion. The pathophysiology of both syndromes is not fully understood. In TACO, cardiac or renal impairment and positive fluid balance may precede circulatory overload. TRALI often presents as bilateral pulmonary edema with little evidence of circulatory overload. TRALI may be caused by preceding inflammation, antileukocyte antibodies, and biological response modifiers. Because COVID-19 itself can induce lung injury, the underlying lung injury associated with COVID-19 further complicates the differential diagnosis of TACO and TRALI, and may increase the risk of TACO and TRALI in critically ill patients.
