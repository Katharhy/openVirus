<p>To perform convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19, development of a system with an adequate infrastructure is required. A population of donors who have recovered from the disease and can donate convalescent serum need to be recruited. Blood banking facilities to process apheresis are necessary. Essential assays, including serological assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum, and virological assays to measure viral neutralization, should be performed. To perform the assays for neutralization antibodies, the necessary laboratory support to perform these assays should be implemented. Protocols for safe collection and use of convalescent plasma should be developed. Clinical trials to assess the efficacy, safety, and immunologic responses should be combined with clinical use. Regulatory review and approval should be performed in a timely manner. Pharmaceutical companies should try to develop highly purified preparations containing a high titer of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which is preferable to convalescent plasma. The preparation may be safer and have higher neutralization activity; however, the development of the hyper-immunoglobulin preparation takes many months.</p>
