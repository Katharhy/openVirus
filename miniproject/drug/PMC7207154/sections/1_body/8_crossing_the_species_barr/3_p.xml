   <p>The virus is ill‐equipped and has little capacity to mutate and therefore to adapt and stabilize in the new species. Human infection is abortive as the virus is not able to establish human‐to‐human transmission. Still, under this scenario, the disease can be very severe as was the avian influenza H5N1 caused by direct bird‐to‐human transmission, reaching ˜60% mortality, but for which limited, if any, human‐to‐human transmission was reported (Wang

   <p>The virus is better adapted to its new host, thus better able to cross the species barrier, and its adaptation is facilitated by further mutations due to poor fidelity of the enzyme that replicates the positive strand of viral RNA. This is what happened with SARS‐CoV‐2, which jumped relatively easily from bats to humans via an intermediate mammal reservoir. The disease caused by SARS and MERS was more serious, and the mortality rates were higher (10% and 35%, respectively). SARS‐CoV‐2 however is often associated with milder pathologies. This is a typical trade‐off: less virulent, but more transmissible versus more virulent but less transmissible. This balance is extremely important and defines the disease profile.</p>
