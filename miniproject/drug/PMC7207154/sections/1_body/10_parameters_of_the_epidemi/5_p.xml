 <italic>The mortality rate</italic> is relatively low. When we will be able to get a full picture of this pandemic, we will most likely notice that it was between 1 and 2%. It seems higher during periods of exponential spread as is currently the case in the USA, France, Spain, or Italy. Not necessarily because the disease is more severe during this period, but likely because death count is indisputable, while it is difficult to assess the number of infections, which is always higher than observed. Undoubtedly, the majority of infected people develop a mild form of this disease, which makes accurate calculation of the mortality rate difficult at present. At the time of publication, mass serological testing is being rolled out in countries such as Germany, particularly in hotspot areas, which will give a much more accurate estimate of mortality rates. But the mortality rate increases due to the stress on the healthcare system and the availability of hospital beds. 1% mortality, 10% of severe cases, those are not large numbers statistically speaking, but compared to the number of infections, and taking into account the transmissibility and infectivity of the virus, we are reaching a situation that endangers our healthcare system. This is what legitimizes the flatten‐the‐curve policy. Yet, one good news: children younger than 10 years‐old are mostly not ill even though they can get infected and transmit the virus.
