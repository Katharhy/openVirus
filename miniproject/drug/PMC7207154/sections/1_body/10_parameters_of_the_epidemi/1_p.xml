 <italic>R0 (basic reproduction rate)</italic> is the average number of secondary infections produced when an infected individual is introduced into a population where all individuals are susceptible. If the R0 is less than 1, there is no epidemic situation; as soon as it is greater than 1, there is an epidemic. In the case of COVID‐19, this number is between 2 and 3. This is therefore a typical epidemic situation. For the Spanish flu of 1918–1919, the R0 was 2.3; tuberculosis is 10 and therefore extremely contagious; and for measles, R0 ranges between 12 and 18.
