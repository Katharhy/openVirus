<p>Coronaviruses are a huge family of single‐stranded positive RNA viruses. Alpha‐coronaviruses are endemic and infect mammals including humans and cause, for example, mild respiratory and intestinal diseases in children. Beta‐coronaviruses like SARS‐CoV‐2 (the official name of COVID‐19 virus) on the other hand are well adapted to their reservoir, the bat, but not to humans, which explains why human infections are so damaging. Other members of this family, the gamma‐ and delta‐coronaviruses infect birds and fish and, at least for the time being, have not been associated with human disease.</p>
