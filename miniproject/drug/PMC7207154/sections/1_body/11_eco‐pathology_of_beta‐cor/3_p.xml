<p>The adaptive immune response specific to the virus is still poorly understood. We know that this virus affects IFN‚Äêdriven immunity, but we do not know why, or which effectors blunt this immune response. It is possible that the virus has acquired this strategy in bats that express constitutively low level of IFN. Further work is urgently needed to learn to control the disease efficiently and sustainably.</p>
