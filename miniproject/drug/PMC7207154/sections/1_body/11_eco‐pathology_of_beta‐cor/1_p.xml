<p>The receptor for SARS‐CoV‐1 and SARS‐CoV‐2, angiotensin II converting enzyme (ACE2), is an enzyme attached to the surface of cells, including lungs, pneumocytes and endothelium, endocardium, kidney, liver, and intestine. It came as a surprise that the virus binds to an important enzyme for the regulation of blood pressure. This could explain the severity of the disease in the respiratory tract with instances of pneumonia and ultimately, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) observed in elderly subjects or individuals with chronic co‐morbidities (i.e., diabetes, hypertension, cardio‐respiratory insufficiency, chronic immunosuppression). The virus targets the blood–lung barrier, affecting the oxygen exchange zone.</p>
