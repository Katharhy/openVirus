<p id="para0085">It has been recommended that patients with COVID-19 who are suffering from refractory hypoxemia should be managed with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). ECMO is a form of cardiopulmonary bypass machine which has been used in patients with refractory respiratory or cardiac failure. In this approach, oxygen would be supplied and carbon dioxide would be removed from the blood. Results revealed that ECMO could reduce the mortality rate in patients with ARDS, just like severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia. But the exact efficacy of ECMO in COVID-19 management is still unknown. In critically ill COVID-19 patients with refractory hypoxemia and/or refractory multi-organ failure and those with underlying cardiac diseases such as ischemic heart disease or heart failure, ECMO might be considered as a potential option especially in patients who develop cardiac arrhythmia and septic shock during COVID-19 pneumonia.
