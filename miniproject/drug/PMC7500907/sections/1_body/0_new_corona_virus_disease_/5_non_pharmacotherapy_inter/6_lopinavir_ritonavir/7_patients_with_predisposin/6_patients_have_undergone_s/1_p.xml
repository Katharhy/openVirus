<p id="para0073">Immunosuppressive agents are critical drugs in patients undergone solid organ transplantation. Lopinavir/ritonavir cannot be administered in combination with immunosuppressive agents because of the occurrence of strong drug interactions. Lopinavir/ritonavir can enhance the plasma level of immunosuppressive agents such as calcineurin inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors. So if co-administration is essential, immunosuppressive agents dose reduction and therapeutic drug monitoring, to maintain optimum immunosuppressive plasma level, is highly recommended. It has been suggested that during COVID-19 treatment, calcineurin inhibitors (ex. cyclosporine and tacrolimus) and mTOR inhibitors (ex. sirolimus and everolimus) could be discontinued and replaced with lopinavir/ritonavir but it seems that the benefit of this drug discontinuation could not overlay the risk of allograft transplant rejection.
