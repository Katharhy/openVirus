<p id="para0064">Since lopinavir undergoes hepatic metabolism through CYP3A4 enzyme, potential drug-drug interactions could occur with all drugs that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 enzyme and P-glycoprotein inhibitors. Also, ritonavir has hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Ritonavir has serious and life-threatening drug interactions with sedative-hypnotic agents, antiarrhythmic drugs, and ergot alkaloid agents because of the effect of ritonavir on their hepatic metabolism through CYP3A4 AND CYP2D6. Concurrent use of these agents with ritonavir is absolutely contraindicated and should be avoided.
