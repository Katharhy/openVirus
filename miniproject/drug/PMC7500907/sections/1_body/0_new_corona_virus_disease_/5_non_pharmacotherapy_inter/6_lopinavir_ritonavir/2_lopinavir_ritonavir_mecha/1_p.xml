<p id="para0062">Lopinavir/ritonavir are protease inhibitor, anti-retroviral agents. The potential antiviral mechanism of lopinavir/ritonavir is inhibition of viral protease, which is a critical enzyme in viral maturation and infectivity. Low dose ritonavir in combination with lopinavir act as a pharmacokinetic enhancer by inhibition of lopinavir inactivation metabolism.
