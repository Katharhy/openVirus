 </xref> Ritonavir can enhance lopinavir's elimination half-life (t ½) by inhibition of CYP450. Lopinavir itself showed antiviral effects against MERS-CoV.

 </xref> Also, results revealed that lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with ribavirin and IFN-α could promote viral clearance and enhance patients’ survival. The results of a recent clinical trial revealed that the addition of lopinavir/ritonavir to the standard supportive care was related to neither clinical improvement nor mortality rate reduction in patients with COVID-19 infection. But the most important limitation of this study was the heterogeneity of the sample population according to disease severity and duration of the COVID-19 course.

 </xref> So further larger clinical trials are required to confirm lopinavir/ritonavir's clinical efficacy against COVID-19 infection. The recommended daily dose of lopinavir /ritonavir is 400 and 100 mg respectively twice daily. Another report from Korea showed that lopinavir/ritonavir administration in patients with COVID-19 could improve clinical symptoms and reduce viral load. Lopinavir/ritonavir would be a promising agent in high-risk patients, such as elderly groups and patients with the underlying disease who are infected with COVID-19.

 </xref> Also, lopinavir would be a promising drug of choice in children with COVID-19.
