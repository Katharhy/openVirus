<p id="para0067">Ritonavir also has high protein binding (about 98 to 99 %) and undergo hepatic metabolism through CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Low-dose of ritonavir in combination with lopinavir as a fixed-dose agent (1:4 ratio) acts as a pharmacokinetic enhancer by inhibition of lopinavir inactivation metabolism through inhibition of liver and intestinal CYP3A4 and inhibition of P-glycoprotein efflux pump.

 </xref> Ritonavir could induce high serum and lymph node concentration with a volume of distribution of 0.41Â±0.25 L/kg. It has an elimination half-life of 3 to 5 hours. Ritonavir's absorption and oral bioavailability are highly affected by fasting or fed state, its absorption, bioavailability, and peak level (C
 <sub>max</sub>) could be significantly increased with food. But food can delay T
 <sub>max</sub> from 2 hours in fasting state to 4 hours in the fed state. Ritonavir also has small renal elimination so dosage adjustment is not required in patients with underlying kidney disease.
