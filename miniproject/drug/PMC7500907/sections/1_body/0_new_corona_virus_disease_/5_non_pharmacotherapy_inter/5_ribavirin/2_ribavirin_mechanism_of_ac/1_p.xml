<p id="para0050">Ribavirin is a nucleoside analog that has antiviral action against a variety of RNA and DNA viruses. The potential antiviral activity of ribavirin is inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) cellular protein and therefore intracellular GTP would be diminished which inhibits RNA replication of viral genomes, so viral growth might be stopped. Another possible antiviral activity of ribavirin is its immunomodulatory effects by suppression of IL-10.

 </xref> Ribavirin also could inhibit RNA polymerase activity and therefore inhibition of RNA fragmentsâ€™ initiation and elongation, so viral protein synthesis could be inhibited.
