<p id="para0026">Recently published studies revealed that chloroquine could highly reduce COVID-19 replication with an acceptable effective concentration (EC
 <sub>90</sub>) value of 6.90 Î¼M which could be easily achieved with standard doses of 500 mg twice daily. The most important advantage of chloroquine in COVID-19 treatment is good penetration to tissues especially lungs which are highly affected in COVID-19 pneumonia. Chloroquine could stop viral infection by enhancing the pH of endosomes which is required for virus-cell fusion and interfering with COVID-19 cellular receptor glycosylation which could interfere with post-translation modification of COVID-19 viruses (inhibition of entry and post-entry stages).

 </xref> Chloroquine is a weak base that could be entrapped in organelles that are membrane-enclosed and have low-pH, so interfering with their acidification process. Therefore chloroquine could inhibit pH-dependent viral fusion and replication. Also, it might inhibit viral assembly in endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate like structures.

 </xref> Another possible antiviral mechanism of chloroquine is its immunomodulatory effect through cell signaling pathways and regulating the action of pro-inflammatory cytokines that can enhance its antiviral effect synergistically

 </xref> Hydroxychloroquine can enhance intracellular pH and avoid lysosomal activity in antigen presenting cells containing B cells, also they can avoid antigen processing and MHC-II presentation to T cells. So, T cell activation could be reduced by the action of hydroxychloroquine. It can suppress the cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is a result of immune system over-activation, caused by COVID-19. According to this mechanism, hydroxychloroquine could alleviate symptoms of mild to severe COVID-19 pneumonia.
