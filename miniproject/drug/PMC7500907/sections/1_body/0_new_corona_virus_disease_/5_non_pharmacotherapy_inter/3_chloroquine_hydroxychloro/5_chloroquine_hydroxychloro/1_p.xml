<p id="para0029">Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can distribute widely in the whole body after oral administration. Hydroxychloroquine has incomplete and variable (about 70%) absorption, while chloroquine has rapid and almost complete absorption. Both have moderate plasma protein binding. Both have hepatic metabolism. Chloroquine has an elimination half-life of 4 to 5 days while hydroxychloroquine has an elimination half-life of about 40 days. The main route of drug excretion for both of them is renal excretion, which could be increased with urine acidification.
