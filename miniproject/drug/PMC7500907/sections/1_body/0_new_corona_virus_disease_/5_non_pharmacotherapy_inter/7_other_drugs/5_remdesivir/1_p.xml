<p id="para0078">Remdesivir is a new antiviral agent that is effective against RNA viruses such as COVID-19. Its potential effects on SARS/MERS coronaviruses are just confirmed in cell culture and animal models (mice), still no clinical data available on its efficacy against COVID-19. Remdesivir is an adenosine analog with antiviral activity. A possible mechanism of antiviral action of remdesivir is its incorporation into the nascent RNA chain of the virus and causing premature viral cycle termination, but this stage is a post virus entry stage. A recent publication showed the efficacy of remdesivir in cell culture in the inhibition of COVID-19 infection.

 </xref> On 1
 <sup>st</sup> May 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the emergency use of remdesivir for the treatment of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients both in adults and children with severe disease. While there is limited information about the safety and clinical efficacy of remdesivir in the management of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, but according to the latest clinical trial results, this drug could shorten the recovery time of COVID-19 patients and received FDA approval for management of severe cases.

 </xref> Although this preliminary and observational study revealed the reduction in recovery time of some patients receiving remdesivir, but still there are controversies about its safety and efficacy. Results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-control clinical trial in China, from the 6
 <sup>th</sup> February to 12
 <sup>th</sup> March 2020, revealed that remdesivir administration in adult COVID-19 patients with severe disease was not significantly associated with shorter recovery time and clinical benefit.

 </xref> Also results of a United States clinical trial on remdesivir have not been published till now for further evaluation of remdesivir efficacy in severe cases of COVID-19. Although the results of a previous cohort study on compassionate-use of remdesivir in patients with severe COVID-19 revealed that remdesivir therapy could cause clinical improvement in about 68% of the patients who were recruited in this study. The authors suggested that prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials are essential in order to evaluate the efficacy of remdesivir therapy in severe cases of COVID-19.
