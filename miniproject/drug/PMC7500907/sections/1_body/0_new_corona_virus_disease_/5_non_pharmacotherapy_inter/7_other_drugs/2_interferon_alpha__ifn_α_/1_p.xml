<p id="para0075">IFN-α is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent that is commonly used in hepatitis management. After the confirmation of the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> efficacy of IFN-α against COVID-19, it has been recommended by the Chinese Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus-induced Pneumonia. The route of administration of IFN-α in COVID-19 patients is vapor inhalation with an adult dosage of 5 million U twice daily.

 </xref> Subcutaneous administration of pegylated IFN-α-2a and pegylated IFN-α-2b would be beneficial in patients with COVID-19 by stimulation of innate antiviral responses. Since IFN-α has many adverse reactions, close patient monitoring is required during IFN-α therapy.

 </xref> IFN-α, in dosage form of nebulization or oral/nasal spray, is a drug of choice which has been recommended in children with mild symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia. The recommended dose in children is 200000 to 400000 U/kg twice daily for up to 5 to 7 days. IFN-α overdosing in children could cause elevated liver enzyme levels, bleeding, acute kidney injury and renal failure, etc. Another concern about the administration of IFN-α in combination with ritonavir in children is inhibition of development and growth which also should be considered by clinicians and experts. IFN-α could also enhance suicidal ideation in children and there is a warning/caution in co-administration of IFN-α with sedative-hypnotic agents.
