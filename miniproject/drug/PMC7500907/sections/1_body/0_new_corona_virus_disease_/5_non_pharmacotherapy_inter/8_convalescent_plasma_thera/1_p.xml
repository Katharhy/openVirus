<p id="para0082">Convalescent plasma or immunoglobulins would be a promising therapy in COVID-19 patients. Previous results revealed that convalescent plasma therapy during viral infection outbreaks, could improve patientsâ€™ survival rate, shorten the duration of hospitalization, reduce viral load, and reduce the mortality rate. A potential mechanism of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 is that the antibodies which are present in convalescent plasma could avoid viremia. Viremia could reach its peak state during the first week of viral infection, so convalescent plasma therapy should be done at the early stages of COVID-19 infection to reach its most efficacy. According to the recent evidence, convalescent plasma from patients who are recently recovered from COVID-19 would be a promising option in COVID-19 infection treatment. This approach has been considered safe with no severe adverse reactions.

 </xref> A recent pilot study reported that transfusion of a dose of 200 ml convalescent plasma, from patients recently recovered from COVID-19, in addition to antiviral therapy and supportive care, could improve clinical symptoms (such as fever, cough, chest pain, etc.), improve pulmonary abnormalities on chest CT, and normalize laboratory data (such as C-reactive protein (CRP) level and lymphocyte counts) within three days. Also, results of this study revealed that convalescent plasma therapy would be a safe method in COVID-19 management which could reduce viral load. So, convalescent plasma therapy has been suggested as a well-tolerated and feasible approach in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia through neutralizing of viremia.
