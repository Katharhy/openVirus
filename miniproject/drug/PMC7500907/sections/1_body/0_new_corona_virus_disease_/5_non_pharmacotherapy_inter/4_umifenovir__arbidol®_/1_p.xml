<p id="para0043">Umifenovir is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent which is effective against enveloped and non-enveloped RNA or DNA viruses especially against influenza virus type A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV, adenovirus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), etc. Umifenovir was first developed in Russia and now its usage is more common in Russia and China and is less common in western countries. Its possible antiviral mechanism is the inhibition of viral fusion with targeted membrane and preventing from the viral entrance to targeted cells.
