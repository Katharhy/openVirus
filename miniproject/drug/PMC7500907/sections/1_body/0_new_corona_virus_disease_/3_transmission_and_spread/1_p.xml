 </xref> This virus could be transmitted between humans during the epidemic and then pandemic of COVID-19. Human-to-human transmission could highly accelerate the spread of this virus around the world. This type of transmission among humans is restricted to close contact and through sneezing or coughing of the infected patients who are capable to spread the respiratory droplets. Then these respiratory droplets could settle in oral mucosa and lung of the people who inhaled the contaminated air near (about 6 feet) to the infected patients.

 </xref> Although some researches have been focused on the airborne transmission of this virus but this route of transmission has not been approved yet and further studies are required. Researches revealed that COVID-19 could also be transmitted through asymptomatic carriers with an incubation period of 1 to 19 days.

 </xref> In order to prevent spreading of this new virus: hands should be washed frequently, the face should not be touched with unwashed hands, regular surface disinfecting is required, social distancing from people with respiratory symptoms is essential, sneezing or coughing should be done into the elbow or soft tissue if available.
