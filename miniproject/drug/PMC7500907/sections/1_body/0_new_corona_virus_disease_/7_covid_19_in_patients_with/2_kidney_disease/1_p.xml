<p id="para0093">Most of the hepatic metabolites of drugs considered in COVID-19 treatment such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir would be found in urine due to renal elimination. So in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the accumulation of drug metabolites would be expected if administered in routinely recommended doses for the normal population. Therefore, individualized dose adjustment based on kidney function is required for each drug as mentioned above.

 </xref> A small study on COVID-19 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who undergone hemodialysis, revealed that the number of total T cells (cytotoxic and helper T cells), natural killer (NK) cells, and inflammatory cytokines were significantly lower than these levels in non-hemodialysis patients with COVID-19. This study revealed that ESRD patients with hemodialysis who infected with COVID-19 had a good prognosis and they had mild symptoms of pneumonia, it might be related to the fewer number of inflammatory cytokines and reduced immune function which can avoid CRS but further studies are required to confirm this hypothesis.
