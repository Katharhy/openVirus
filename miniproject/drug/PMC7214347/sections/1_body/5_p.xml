<p id="p0030">When referring to the initial cases recorded in Lazio and in Lombardy, the epidemic has consistently followed parallel trends in the North (quite turbulent) and in the Center-South of Italy (much slower) and now, when freezing the official picture derived from data of the Ministry of Health processed by the Istituto Superiore di Sanit√† (ISS) as of April 18, 2020 (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ), we detect a huge difference between the two regions. Demographic data is quite different and strongly in favor of Lombardy in terms of number of provinces, municipalities, inhabitants, geographical surface and population density (people/km
 <sup>2</sup>) 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In greater detail, when looking at results from the two regional capitals, accounting 
 <italic>per se</italic> for the highest population density and consequently most relevant contagion spread risk, a paradox becomes immediately apparent: despite having fewer inhabitants than Rome (1,352,000 versus 2,873,000), Milan has suffered from a five-fold infection rate so far (see 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> ).
