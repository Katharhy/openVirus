 <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In animal models, structural lung changes have been related to diabetes, such as augmented vasculature permeability and collapsed alveolar epithelium 
 <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Finally, abnormal delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction and complement activation dysfunction 
 <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> have been reported in patients with DM. All of the above suggests that the greatest possible attention should be paid to the high risk for more severe lung involvement pending on people with DM during COVID-19 infection, due to a significantly lower forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) in the presence of raised glucose levels
