At this point we also feel like underlining that some hypoglycemic treatment strategies might turn out to be protective. Dipeptidyl-dipeptidase-4 (DPP-4) was shown, in fact, to be the primary receptor of MERS-CoV 
 <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>: the possibility that DPP-4 also acts as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 warrants investigation and, should this be the case, in agreement with the hypothesis put forward by Iacobellis 
 <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, DPP-4 inhibitors, well-renowned treatment tools in T2DM, should be explored for their anti-viral potential in the human

Opposite to that, it has been recently hypothesized that Sodium-Glucose-Transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i), Glucagon-Like-Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1RAs), Pioglitazone and even Insulin might induce an over-expression of the ACE2 receptor which was also found to bind to coronaviruses in the alveoli
