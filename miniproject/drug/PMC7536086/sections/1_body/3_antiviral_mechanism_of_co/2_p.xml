<p>Neutralizing antibodies play a crucial role in the elimination of viral infection and are believed to be essential in prevention from viral illnesses [
 <xref rid="RSOB200174C71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Neutralizing antibodies that prevent these infections are provided by passive immunity, impelled by CP. The efficiency of this therapy is primarily influenced by the amount of neutralizing antibodies in the plasma obtained from the recuperated donors [

In the case of MERS and SARS-CoV, it was found that the neutralizing antibodies inhibit the viral amplification by binding to the N-terminal domain of S1, receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 and S2 domains of S protein, and thereby help in controlling the infection [
