<p>This is also known as a severe respiratory symptomatic stage with high viral load. In this stage, the virus is able to impair the immune response, which leads to the multiplication of the virus, which further results in enormous obliteration of the affected tissues, especially the organs which have a high level of expression of hACE2 receptors [
