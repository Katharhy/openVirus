<p>SARS-CoV-2 was found to enter the host cell by using their S protein [
 <xref rid="RSOB200174C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptors present on the epithelial surface of several organs like lungs, heart, kidney, brain and small intestine, and thereby several organs are found to be infected in the course of illness [

 <xref rid="RSOB200174C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is highly complex due to the binding of S protein to the hACE2 receptor present on the several organs. It has also been reported that SARS-CoV-2 damages several organs, including the alveoli of the lungs [
 <xref rid="RSOB200174C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The crystal structure of S protein reveals that it has two main globular domains: S1 and S2 [
 <xref rid="RSOB200174C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The attachment of the S protein to the hACE2 receptor is facilitated by the receptor-binding domain present in the S1 subunit of S glycoprotein [

 <xref rid="RSOB200174C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The host cell enzymes like TMPRSS211, a serine protease, and lysosomal protease cathepsins facilitate the invasion of the virus inside the host cell by cleaving the S protein at the junction of S1–S2, resulting in the conformational changes in the S2 domain, which is necessary for fusion of the virus to the host cell membrane [

 <xref rid="RSOB200174C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 also damages several immune cells, which leads to the activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). The hyperactivation mechanism of NF-κB by STAT3 leads to the activation of the interleukin-6 amplifier (IL-6 Amp), resulting in multiple inflammatory and autoimmune diseases [
