<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family of Coronaviridae, subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, order Nidovirales, and the subfamily includes α-coronavirus, β-coronavirus, γ-coronavirus and δ-coronavirus [
 <xref rid="RSOB200174C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the past few decades, several findings reported these viruses crossing the species barrier, consequently infecting humans as well. Many human or animal CoVs have been seen to have originated in bats [

 <xref rid="RSOB200174C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The genome size of the novel SARS-CoV-2 was found to be 30 kb long [

 <xref rid="RSOB200174C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The microscopic images of CoV show that the virions consist of nucleocapsid core covered by an envelope, which is made up of three membrane proteins, such as membrane (M), spike (S) and envelope (E) proteins. These membranous proteins are highly conserved in the CoVs. The genetic material (i.e. RNA) is packaged by the nucleocapsid (N) and other accessory proteins. The non-structural protein-encoding genes are also present at the genome's 5′-end [
