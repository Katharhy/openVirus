<p>After the emergence of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, scientists across the world started looking for specific suitable treatments and prevention strategies. Around 69 studies are registered on clinicaltrials.gov that focus on dealing with the COVID-19 crisis with the help of CP therapy. The study entitled ‘Convalescent Plasma as Therapy for COVID-19 Severe SARS-CoV-2 Disease (CONCOVID Study)’ (clinical trial no. NCT04342182) is a randomized comparative trial which aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CP from COVID-recovered donors as a cure for symptomatic patients of COVID-19 in the hospital. In another study entitled ‘Early Transfusion of Convalescent Plasma in Elderly COVID-19 Patients to Prevent Disease Progression’ (clinical trial no. NCT04374526), the investigators hypothesize that the transfusion of CP, comprising the neutralizing antibodies, at an early stage of COVID-19 infection can prevent the inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2. The main objectives of this trial include the prevention of pneumonia progression in elderly COVID-19 patients (more than 65 years of age), raising anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres in recipients and decreasing the viral load using the CP therapy, along with standard therapy.</p>
