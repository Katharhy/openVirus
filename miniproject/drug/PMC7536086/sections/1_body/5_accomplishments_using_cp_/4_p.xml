<p>Another study involved five patients, 36â€“65 years of age, of which two were female. The prime objective of the study was to determine whether the transfusion therapy of the CP was advantageous for the severely sick patients of SARS-CoV-2 infection, who were suffering from critical respiratory ailments. The patients were subjected to transfusion with CP, which consisted of a SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody (i.e. IgG). A neutralization titre greater than 40 (endpoint dilution titre) along with IgG-binding titre greater than 1:1000 (endpoint dilution titre), which was derived from five donors who successfully recovered from COVID-19 earlier, was administered to the patients between 10 and 22 days after they were admitted. During the treatment, all five patients were provided with mechanical ventilation along with methylprednisolone and other antiviral agents. The normalization of body temperatures was observed within 3 days in four of the five patients. The patients tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 within 12 days after CP transfusion, and the titres of neutralizing antibodies were also increased. The study concluded that the administration of CP consisting of the SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies in critically ill patients might have improved their clinical symptoms, and suggested that CP infusion could be a potential therapeutic strategy against COVID-19 [
