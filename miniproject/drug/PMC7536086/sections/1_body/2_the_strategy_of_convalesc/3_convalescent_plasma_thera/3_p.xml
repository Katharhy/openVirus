<p>A standard pre-donation assessment of the convalescent donors is done as it is essential to adhere to the current plasma donation regulations [

They should be COVID-19 negative after 14 days and should not display any infective symptoms. These tests must be conducted again after 48 h and at the time of donation [

Apart from medical examinations and molecular evaluations, it is also very important to identify the emotional conditions of the donor in order to ensure they do not feel exploited during the donation [

The recommended procedure for plasma extraction is apheresis, which involves continuous centrifugation of blood obtained from the donor in order to allow a selective collection plasma. The efficacy of this technique ranges from 400 to 800 ml from a single apheresis donation. For its use in future transfusions, the plasma is stored in units of 200 or 250 ml and is frozen within 24 h of collection to retain its potency [
