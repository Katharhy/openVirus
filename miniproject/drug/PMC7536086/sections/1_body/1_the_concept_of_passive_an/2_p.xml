The active immune response develops against any diseases either due to infection from a pathogen or due to the administration of specific vaccine against the disease that triggers the immune response. The active immune response takes time for the generation of antibodies, and the time differs depending on the immune system of the recipients [

Therefore, passive antibody administration is the only technique to provide immediate immunity to vulnerable individuals in a short span of time. The passive antibody therapeutic strategy dates back to the late nineteenth century. During the 1890s, in order to treat certain diseases that were transmissible or infectious, passive antibody therapy was used [
