  <p>Schematic of plasma therapy. When the COVID-19-infected individuals recover, their blood plasma contains antibodies against the COVID-19 causing SARS-CoV-2 virus. The recovered individuals donate their blood, from which the plasma containing the required antibodies is extracted. This plasma is then administered to the infected individual(s) via transfusion.</p>
