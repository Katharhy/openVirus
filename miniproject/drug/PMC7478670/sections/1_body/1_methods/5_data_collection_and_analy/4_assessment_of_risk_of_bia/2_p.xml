<p>The quality assessment of RCTs adopts the risk of bias (ROB) assessment tool provided by the Cochrane Handbook. The following seven items, such as random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other bias, are evaluated by three grades of “low bias,” “high bias,” and “unclear bias.” The discrepancies will get a consistent conclusion by discussing between both reviewers or seeking the third-party consultation.</p>
