<p>Import all literatures that meet the requirements into Endnote X8 software. First of all, two independent reviewers initially screened the literatures that did not meet the pre-established standards of the study by reading the title and abstract. Second, download the remaining literatures and read the full text carefully to further decide whether to include or not. Finally, the results were cross-checked repeatedly by reviewers. If there is a disagreement in the above process, we can reach an agreement by discussing between both reviewers or seek a third party's opinion. Flow chart of the study selection (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) will be used to show the screening process of the study.
