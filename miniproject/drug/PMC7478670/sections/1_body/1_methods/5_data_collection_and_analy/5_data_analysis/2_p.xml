<p>Different evaluation methods are selected according to the different efficacy indicators. For the dichotomous data, we will choose the effect scale indicator relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) to represent. While the continuous data is expressed as mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI depending on whether the measurement scale is consistent or not. Review Manager software version 5.3 provided by the Cochrane Collaboration will be performed for data synthesis and analysis. The dichotomous data is represented by RR, continuous data is expressed by MD or SMD. If there is no heterogeneity (
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> &lt; 50%, 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.1), the data are synthesized using a fixed effect model. Otherwise (
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 50%, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.1), a random effect model is used to analyze. Then subgroup analysis will be conducted basing on the different causes of heterogeneity. If a meta-analysis cannot be performed, it will be replaced by a general descriptive analysis.
