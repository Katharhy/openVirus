<p>According to the characteristics of the study, we prepare an excel form for data collection before data extraction. Outcome indicators for eligible studies were independently extracted and filled in the data extraction form by two reviewers. The main data extracted are as follows: title, author, year, fund source, sample size, age, sex, duration of disease, interventions, outcome measures, adverse reactions, etc. If there are something unclear, you can not hesitate to contact authors of more detailed information. The above information was finally cross-checked by two reviewers.</p>
