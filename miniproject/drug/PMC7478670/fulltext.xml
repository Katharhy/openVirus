Due to the complicated Pathogenesis, high infectivity and high fatality rate of COVID-19, there is currently no effective treatment for such epidemic disease. Traditional Chinese medicine has a long clinical history for the prevention and treatment of this kind of acute infectious disease. Qingfei Paidu Decoction (QFPD) is widely used in treating COVID-19 in China. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive and systematic evidence on the effectiveness and safety of Qingfei Paidu Decoction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods:</title><p> We will search each database from the built-in until May 2020. The English literature mainly searches Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science, while the Chinese literature comes from CNKI, CBM, VIP, and Wangfang database. Simultaneously we will retrieval clinical registration tests and grey literatures. This study only screen the clinical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about QFPD for COVID-19 to assess its efficacy and safety. The two researchers worked independently on literature selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. The dichotomous data is represented by relative risk (RR), and the continuous is expressed by mean difference (MD) or standard mean difference (SMD), eventually the data is synthesized using a fixed effect model (FEM) or a random effect model (REM) depending on whether or not heterogeneity exists. Total clinical effective rate, improvement rate of lung CT, adverse events were evaluated as the main outcomes. Effective rate of clinical symptoms, treatment time were secondary outcomes. Finally, meta-analysis was conducted by RevMan software version 5.3.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results:</title><p> The results of our research will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion:</title><p> This systematic review aims to provide new evidence of QFPD for COVID-19 in terms of its efficacy and safety.</p></sec><sec><title>PROSPERO registration number:</title><p> CRD42020200894.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>meta-analysis</kwd><kwd>protocol</kwd><kwd>Qingfei Paidu decoction</kwd><kwd>systematic review</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1" award-type="Fundref"><funding-source>Sichuan Provincial Science and technology department</funding-source><award-id>2020YFS0012</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Chunguang Xie</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award2" award-type="Fundref"><funding-source>Sichuan Provincial Science and technology department</funding-source><award-id>2020YFS0013</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Chunguang Xie</principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Coronavirus disease 2019 is an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by the new coronavirus type 2 acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> COVID-19 patients usually present with respiratory symptoms, such as fever, coughing, sneezing, fatigue, etc. Nearly one-third of patients suffer from at least one coexisting disease.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Since the first outbreak of the COVID-19 in Wuhan, it has become a key issue that has seriously threatened the public health of people around the world.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> As this corona virus has the typical characteristics of highly contagious and high fatality rate, until March 2020, the novel coronavirus disease has spread in more than 100 countries around the world.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> According to reports, a total of 531,630 people worldwide have been infected with the virus, and the death toll is as high as 24,065.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup></p><p>There is no effective treatment to control the new coronavirus disease 2019 according to the World Health Organization (WHO) commentary.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> According to clinical experience, antiviral drugs and symptomatic and supportive treatment are often used.

Review Manager software version 5.3 provided by the Cochrane Collaboration will be performed for data synthesis and analysis.

It not only has obvious advantages in effective treatment, but also has fewer side effects. During the prevalence of the coronavirus, the clinical efficacy data of the traditional Chinese medicine compound QFPD showed that it has the effect of reducing patient mortality and improving respiratory symptoms. Therefore, this study intends to comprehensively evaluate the safety and safety of the efficacy of QFPD in COVID-19 patients through systematic reviews and meta-analysis. In other words, it can also provide new therapy for early control of the virus and defeat epidemic.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p><bold>Conceptualization:</bold> Yuan Zhang, Hongyan Xie.</p><p><bold>Data curation:</bold> Yan Li, Tianhao Li.</p><p><bold>Funding acquisition:</bold> Chunguang Xie.</p><p><bold>Methodology:</bold> Yuan Zhang, Yan Li.</p><p><bold>Project administration:</bold> Chunguang Xie.</p><p><bold>Software:</bold> Haipo Yuan, Hongyan Xie.</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold> Xiaoxu Fu.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; original draft:</bold> Yuan Zhang.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing:</bold> Chunguang Xie.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease 2019, FEM = fixed effect model, MD = mean difference, PRISMA-P = Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocol, QFPD = Qingfei Paidu Decoction, RCT = randomized controlled trial, REM = random effect model, RR = relative risk, SMD = standard mean difference.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>How to cite this article: Zhang Y, Xie H, Li Y, Li T, Yuan H, Fu X, Xie C.
