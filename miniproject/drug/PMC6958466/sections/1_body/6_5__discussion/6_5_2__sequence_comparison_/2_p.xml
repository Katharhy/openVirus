 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-12-00157-f002">Figure 2</xref>), although not many sequences can be aligned at a time because of computational issues. However, what these results imply is that the space of numerical descriptors fairly well reflects the changes in base distributions in the viral sequences and can be adapted for monitoring sequence shifts and drifts, some of which may herald increased virulence and pathogenicity.
