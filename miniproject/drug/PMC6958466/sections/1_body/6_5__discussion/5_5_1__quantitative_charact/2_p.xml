<p>Besides SIR-type models, public health management in the case of emergence of epidemics/pandemics can benefit from the application of discrete mathematics models of the isolated sequences and associated computational tools. Because viruses are very complex (e.g., ZIKV has around 11,000 bases in its RNA), the sequences can be converted to real numbers or vectors using methods of graph theory, information theory etc. [
