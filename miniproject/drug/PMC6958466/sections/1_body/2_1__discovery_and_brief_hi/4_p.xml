<p>Concerning this Africa to Asia spread, these authors observed the following: “Relatively few studies on the origin of the South Pacific Rim lineage had been reported in the literature. The tMRCA for South Pacific Rim was estimated to be 1947 (95% HPD interval 35 to 1966) in our study. Coincidentally, during the Second World War in south-eastern Asia, around 100,000 East and West African soldiers were brought into combat in the Burma Campaign from January 1942 to July 1945. Specifically, the British Empire colonial unit 11th (East Africa) Infantry Division comprised troops from East and West African countries such as Kenya, Uganda, Nyasaland, Tanganyika, and Rhodesia (Burma Star Association—The 11th East African Division). During those three years’ conflict, both sides suffered heavy casualties, including at least 20,000 Japanese soldiers who died because of disease in the battle of Imphal. It is also noteworthy that Thai army was also involved in this campaign and that after the Japanese surrendered, troops were continued to be deployed to the then Malaya. The whole campaign could serve as a possible portal of entry for the transmission of ZIKV from Africa to south-eastern Asia during that wartime period.”</p>
