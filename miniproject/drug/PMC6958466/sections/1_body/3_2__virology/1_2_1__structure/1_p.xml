<p>ZIKV is a member of the Flavivirus genus that is part of the Flaviviridae family. Some important disease-causing viruses of this genus are Dengue fever virus, Tick-borne encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Zika virus [

 <xref rid="B11-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The RNAs of such viruses can be directly translated into a large polyprotein that is subsequently converted by viral and host cell proteases into two sets of proteins: structural proteins and nonstructural proteins. The three structural proteins are: envelope (E), membrane precursor (PrM), and capsid (C) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-12-00157-f001">Figure 1</xref>). These are critical for the formation of the capsid and envelop of the mature virus. The seven non-structural (NS) proteins, on the other hand, have important roles in the replication of the virus. The NS group of proteins include: NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, and NS5 as shown in
