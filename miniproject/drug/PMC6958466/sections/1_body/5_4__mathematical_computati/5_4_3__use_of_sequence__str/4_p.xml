<p>Thus, a graphical representation of the Zika virus whole genome sequence would look like the one shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-12-00157-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The figure gives an overview of the base distributions along the whole Zika virus genome. It shows that while the structural genes at the beginning of the sequence have a good homogeneous mixture of the four bases, the non-structural genes that make up the bulk of the genome have a GC-rich texture; it is an overall information we get of a sequence through the 2D graphical representation method. Assigning x and y co-ordinates to each vertex in the 2D graph, one can define the distance, 
 <italic>gR</italic>, from the origin to the center of mass of the plot [
 <xref rid="B77-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The 
 <italic>gR</italic> turns out to be a very sensitive measure of the base distribution in the sequence and therefore is taken as an index, a descriptor of the sequence. 
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-12-00157-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows the 
 <italic>gR</italic> values of the Zika virus genomic sequences in Africa, Asia, and South America from selected hosts, all of same length (10272 nt) for easy comparison; the change in 
 <italic>gR</italic> values as we move from Africa to Asia to the Americas indicates (in %) an overall estimate of how much changes in absolute terms have taken place in base distribution and composition of the average genome sequence collected from these continents. It can be seen that the sequence base distribution is becoming more set and compact with time. A phylogenetic tree of Zika virus sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-12-00157-f002">Figure 2</xref>) also shows clear separation between the three groups, less so between Asia and America than between Africa and Asia as also seen quantitatively through the 
 <italic>gR</italic> values.
