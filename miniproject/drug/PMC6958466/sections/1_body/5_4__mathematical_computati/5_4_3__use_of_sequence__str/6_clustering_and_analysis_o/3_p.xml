 <xref rid="B82-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. The data set consists of 310 genome sequences of ZIKV hosted in different species (83% in Homo sapiens, 17% in Simiiformes, Aedes, Macaca or tissue culture cells), and 53 sequence neighborhood descriptors. Most of the genomes with less bases stem from Africa, perhaps because of the fact that the Africa samples are older than Asia and South America ones. Further details are available in [
