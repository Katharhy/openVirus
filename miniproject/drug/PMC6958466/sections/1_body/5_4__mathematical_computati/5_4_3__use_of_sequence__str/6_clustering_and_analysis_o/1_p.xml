<p>Clustering (grouping) and classification (categorization) of objects are two fundamental principles often applied in various fields of research. In such approaches, one collects the objects, which are in “some manner similar” and orders them into categories expecting that the objects in the same category possess in “some manner similar” properties. In the case of ZIKV, the objects are RNA sequences, which encode the structure (sequence) of the virus, identified from different areas of the globe (Africa, Asia, South America). Comparison of ZIKV sequesters using calculated sequence descriptors follows the sequence (structure)-property similarity principle [
