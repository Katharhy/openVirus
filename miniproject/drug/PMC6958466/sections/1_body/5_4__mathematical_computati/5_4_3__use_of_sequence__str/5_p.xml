<p>In the Vracko and Randic approach [
 <xref rid="B78-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], DNA/RNA sequences were represented by four neighborhood matrices. The first matrix counts the four bases (A, T, C, G). The next matrix counts the neighboring pairs, AA, AT, AC, AG, TA, TT, TC, TG, CA, CT, CC, CG, GA, GT, GC, and GG while the next two matrices consider the second and third neighbors. Further details of this representation and the application are given in [
