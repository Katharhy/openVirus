<p>Currently, there are a broad range of experimental and computational methods available to the scientists and the public health managers worldwide which can be used for the effective management of emerging diseases. In a recent treatise [
 <xref rid="B28-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the authors of this review article proposed a “generic approach” of surveillance, mitigation, and vaccine, as well as drug design for emerging pathogens, the four pillars of which may consist of:

   <label>(a)</label>
   <p>Epidemiological approaches for the characterization of reservoirs of next possible emerging pathogens;</p>

   <p>Fast computational sequence comparison methods for the characterization of the emerging pathogens to understand how novel or severe they could be;</p>

   <p>Once the sequences of the dominant strains have been determined, computer-aided vaccine design (CAVD) methods can be used to produce a set of probable vaccine candidates for quick synthesis/production and testing in the laboratory;</p>

   <p>Computer-assisted design of novel therapeutics and testing of new drugs or repurposing already existing FDA-approved drugs.</p>
