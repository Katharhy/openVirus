<p>The newest addition to the repertoire of vaccinology are peptide vaccines which encompasses the application of informatics in life sciences like bioinformatics and immunoinformatics in designing individualized vaccines. Essentially, epitopes from conserved regions among proteins with high solvent accessibility are selected for the antiviral vaccine. Such epitopes are then tested for population HLA sensitivity and autoimmune risks. Finally, rank-based epitopes are chosen for further experimental analyses like efficacy, longevity, range, side effects, etc. Based on this workflow, there has been a number of research articles that have predicted a variety of suitable and effective epitopes observed in the capsid, envelope, NS2A, NS3, NS4B, and NS5 proteins of Zika virus [
