However, this quiescence should not be taken as a sign of the end of the epidemic since dormant viruses have been known to resurge at opportune moments. The experience of space travel has shown that many dormant viruses reactivate during the space travel and can lead to severe physiological disorders such as compound organ infections and organ failures, believed to arise from the severe stresses of space travel [

At a more down-to-earth level, there can be extreme stresses experienced by the people especially in poor, underdeveloped, and developing countries, which may lead to a resurgence of viruses that are relatively dormant at the present time. Surveillance and monitoring of the viruses in the wild as well as continuing research in development of drugs and vaccines therefore should be conducted at as much an urgent level as possible under the circumstances.
