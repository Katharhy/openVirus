<p>Despite the varied advantages offered by peptide vaccines, the requirements for adjuvants and carrier proteins, and the low intensity of immune response among many others [

 <xref rid="B64-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], it was observed that mice which had been previously exposed to a virus, died during the second exposure to peptide vaccines derived from the original virus because of over-stimulation of antibodies and excessive cytotoxicity levels by T-cells. Thus, an optimum dosage is critical for peptide vaccines. Some of this slack is being taken up by an exciting new approach to vaccinesâ€”in silico antibody design by reconstructing antibody structures through parts of other antibody structures available in the databases which augments the antibody effectiveness manifold. This is discussed in a later section (
