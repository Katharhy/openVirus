<p>Live attenuated vaccines (LAV) consist of the whole pathogens that are weakened by serially diluting the wildtype pathogen in vitro [

 <xref rid="B44-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] or by introducing single nucleotide mutations. Entire pathogens that have been inactivated, i.e., their proliferative mechanism removed, by means of chemicals like detergents, heat or radiation also serve as vaccine candidates. Surface proteins of the causative agents are also potent in eliciting immune responses [
