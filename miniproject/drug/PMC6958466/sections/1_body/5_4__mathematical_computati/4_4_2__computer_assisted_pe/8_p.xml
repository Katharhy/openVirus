<p>Despite the advancement of vaccine over the last century, there are still significant logistic hurdles in the developmental process that need to be refined including preserving the longevity of the attenuated live pathogens, sustaining the immunogenicity of the strains that have been rendered inactive, maintaining the integrity of the carrier proteins without interfering in the immunogenic property of the purified polysaccharides, and the possibility of relapse of vector-based vaccines leading to unforeseen genetic response; these are some of the primary challenges that are met in the vaccine production industry. A major setback posed is by the short efficacy of one of the largest productions of antiviral vaccine—the annual flu vaccines. Because of the rapidity and high frequency in the genetic mutation in RNA viruses, flu shots need to be manufactured every year incurring massive production and distribution costs. Hypothetically, a Zika virus would mutate at the rate of 0.12–0.25% [
