<p>Additional in silico approaches include de novo design of humanized monoclonal antibody regions by targeting a specific antigen epitope. Since monoclonal antibodies as therapeutic agents are increasingly becoming important for the treatment of cancers, infectious diseases, and autoimmune disorders, the approach may also be worthwhile for developing anti-ZIKV agents. A promising work to this end was reported recently by developing a technique known as optimal method for antibody variable region engineering with the OptMAVEn-2.0 software [
