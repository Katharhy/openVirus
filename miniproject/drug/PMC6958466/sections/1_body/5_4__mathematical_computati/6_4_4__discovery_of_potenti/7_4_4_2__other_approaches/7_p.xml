<p>Since screening for compounds by pharmacophore is essentially a knowledge-based approach, it implicitly provides certain information about the nature of the receptor-binding site or the nature of the ligand expected to bind at the active site. Therefore, it can serve as a complimentary tool to high-throughput screening (HTS) for rapid and effective experimental assay from a large pool of compounds in a short time. This approach thus cannot only provide useful insights about active site binding interactions but also can facilitate interdisciplinary discussions with medicinal chemists, synthetic chemists, toxicologists, and pharmacologists for a successful anti-ZIKV drug discovery program [
