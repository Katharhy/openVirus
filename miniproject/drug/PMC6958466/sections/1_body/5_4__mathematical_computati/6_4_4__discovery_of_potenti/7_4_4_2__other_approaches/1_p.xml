<p>Although no drug has yet been approved by FDA for the treatment of ZIKV infection, numerous small molecules have been identified that have shown anti-ZIKV activity [
 <xref rid="B99-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>,
 <xref rid="B112-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>,
 <xref rid="B142-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. However, most of these anti-ZIKV small molecules are shown to be only active in in vitro cell assays. But the good news is that 20 of these compounds were evaluated in vivo, and three reached phase I clinical trials [

 <xref rid="B142-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. The current stage of anti-ZIKV drug discovery demands novel approaches to identify new inhibitors which may provide completely new class of antiviral drugs including Zika drugs. The approaches should include knowledge-based drug repurposing [
 <xref rid="B143-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>], RNA interference [
 <xref rid="B144-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>], long noncoding RNAs [
 <xref rid="B145-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>], interfering peptides [
 <xref rid="B146-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>,
 <xref rid="B147-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>], compounds targeting viral RNA [

 <xref rid="B149-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>,
 <xref rid="B150-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>], and computer-assisted molecular design including pharmacophore modeling [
 <xref rid="B93-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Repurposing approach of old drugs allows to focus on certain types of candidates, such as kinase inhibitors and antimalarial drugs. Literature searching should include hidden or overlooked candidates. For example, the EGR1 target derived cell penetrating peptide was initially identified as an HIV inhibitor [
 <xref rid="B151-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>] and had been overlooked. However, later on this peptide was found to exhibit anti-ZIKV activity in Vero cells at EC50 of 0.1–0.4 μM (unpublished data). Natural products derived from plants have been successfully used to treat a variety of vector borne diseases, such as malaria. Natural products fundamentally differ from synthetic compounds in both chemical scaffolds and mechanisms of 370 action, and have great potential for the development of antiviral agents [

 <xref rid="B153-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. Oxidative stress has also been reported to play an important role in the pathogenesis of both RNA and DNA viruses [
 <xref rid="B154-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. Compounds known to exert oxidative stress may also be tried against ZIKV.
