 <italic>Viral proteins as ZIKV drug targets</italic>: Viral glycoproteins play important roles for virus infection and replication processes as it is involved with virus adsorption, internalization, and fusion with the host cell, as well as with the development of neutralizing immunity. In general, small molecules interfering with the function of any ZIKV viral proteins should have the potential to restrict virus replication and prevent from progress of ZIKV related pathogenesis and diseases. Envelope glycoprotein inhibitors too are well documented for anti-ZIKV activity [

Several inhibitors targeting viral proteins that have been identified from high-throughput cell-based screening, in-silico docking, and compound library screening. Some of them have even undergone in vivo testing, for example, EGCG (epigallocatechingallate), a polyphenol present in green tea has exhibited inhibition to the entry of ZIKV into the host cell [
