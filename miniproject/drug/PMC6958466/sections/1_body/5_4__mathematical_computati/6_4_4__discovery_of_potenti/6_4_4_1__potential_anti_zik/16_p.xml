<p>Another recent reported study suggested that Axl receptor (a tyrosine kinase, originated from a Greek word anexelekto, meaning uncontrolled) to be a target for discovery of compounds against ZIKV infection [

Sarukhanyan et al. experimentally validated the hypothesis by demonstrating anti-ZIKV activities of compounds such as warfarin and a few similar structural analogues identified using in silico methods [
