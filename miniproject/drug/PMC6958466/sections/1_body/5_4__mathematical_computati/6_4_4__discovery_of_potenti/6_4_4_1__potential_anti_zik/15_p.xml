Using a two-step approach of drug repurposing screen by measuring the caspase-3 activity and cell viability with primary hits, Xu et al. were able to discover PHA-690509, a cyclin- dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKi), that inhibited ZIKV infection with an EC50 value of 1.72 mM [

Among these inhibitors, seliciclib (a purine analog, also known as roscovitine) and RGB-286147 were found to inhibit ZIKV infection at sub micro molar concentrations [
 <xref rid="B95-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. From these results, the authors remarked that one or more host CDKs might be important for ZIKV replication process as flaviviruses are not known to encode any CDK [
 <xref rid="B91-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Therefore, study on known CDK inhibitors could be useful for discovery of anti-ZIKV therapeutics. It may be worthwhile to mention that an earlier reported malarial CDK (pfmrk) pharmacophore model [
 <xref rid="B136-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>] could be useful for virtual screening from a database of antimalarial CDK (pfmrk) inhibitors to identify potential antiâ€“ZIKV compounds. The CDK pharmacophore model on malaria allowed identification of several new antimalarial CDK inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B136-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. Thus, search for additional CDK inhibitors using pharmacophore modeling could be attempted for discovery of potential anti-ZIKV drugs.
