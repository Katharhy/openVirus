 <xref rid="B133-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. Cholesterol is found to modulate the host response of several flaviviruses. Although the exact mechanism of this modulation process is yet unclear, inhibition of the biosynthesis pathway of cholesterol could be an attractive therapeutic approach for ZIKV drug discovery.
