These pandemic influenza strains then persistently circulate in the human population and cause seasonal epidemics. For example, H3N2 viruses have continuously circulated in human population since the 1968 pandemic. Influenza A viruses contain eight gene segments, which include PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M, and NS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Antigenic shift is caused by reassorting of gene segments while antigenic drift is caused by an accumulation of mutations in genes during virus evolution. Under the pressure of host immunity and the environment, viruses which can survive with new mutations, may keep circulating and potentially become a major public health threat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Consequently, although specific anti-viral drugs as well as vaccination strategies have been developed and applied, annual seasonal epidemics still result in millions of severe cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Thus, it is essential to better understand the evolutionary mechanisms of influenza A viruses.</p><p id="Par16">Replication and transcription of influenza viruses rely on the functional unit, ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex structure, in which viral RNA is encapsidated by viral polymerase PB2, PB1, PA and NP. In the RNP complex, NP in homo-oligomer form not only stabilizes this structure but also modulates viral RNA transcription and replication through interaction with viral polymerase PB2 and PB1. It has been reported that NP is also crucial in RNA elongation during viral RNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that the homo-oligomer formation and RNA binding are crucial for virus replication and a single amino acid mutation can reduce the polymerase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In regards to function, NP contains an RNA binding domain, a PB2 binding domain, a homo-oligomer binding domain and a nuclear localization signal domain (NLS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Many studies further observed that NP interacts with many host factors to promote viral replication, escape immunity, or regulate apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Most previous studies on influenza A have focused on the change of viral surface proteins, HA and NA. For instance, A(H3N2) viruses have been monitored for antigenic variants and different vaccine strains have been selected based on their novel antigenic characteristics that can be mapped by hemagglutination inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and also identified by their HA gene sequences. However, the evolution of internal genes, such as NP, also plays an important role in viral fitness and pathogenicity, but has generally lacked attention. We hypothesized that in the evolutionary history of a relatively conserved protein, mutations arising over time might also be meaningful. Thus, we evaluated the influenza virus NP, a major multi-functional protein in the virion, to identify novel evolutionary or functionally important determinants of viral replication. Previous studies have shown that the evolution rates of viral genomes in influenza A are different with the rate in H3N2 greater than in H1N1 and also than influenza B viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Clinical reports also showed that the H3N2 viruses led to high mortality in the 1991&#x02013;1998 and 2003&#x02013;2004 influenza seasons, in which the latter was associated with an unusually high number of fatalities in children. In addition, several studies also demonstrated that the H3N2 caused more severe diseases than H1N1 and influenza B viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In Taiwan, H3N2 influenza viruses were monitored as the main circulating subtype, its epidemic rate was higher than H1N1, and the HA gene was consistent phylogenetically with H3N2 viruses reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Thus, in our study, clinical isolates of H3N2 viruses that were kept from surveillance samples at the National Cheng Kung University Hospital were used to examine novel determinants on NP that may play a role in influenza virus evolution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell lines and virus isolates</title><p id="Par18">MDCK and A549 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2% Penicillin/Streptomycin (P/S); 293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2% P/S and 1X sodium pyruvate.

The A/Hong Kong/68 H3N2 virus strain, isolated in the 1968 pandemic was used as the ancestral strain. Vaccine strains after 1997 were also included as reference strains. The NP gene did evolve over time, as shown by the progressively increasing distance from the ancestral strain. Moreover, this tree separated into various clades that we further termed clades 1&#x02013;6 according to their amino acid substitutions. By phylogenetic analysis, we demonstrated that NP gene had accumulated many genetic changes and evolved into several clades with amino acid changes in protein (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Some substitutions were only observed during a specific time interval, for example, 27S, 103R, and 480E substitutions were identified in five of eight isolates in 2002; 77R and 425V substitutions before 2004. Some substitutions accumulated were more durable, for instance, 136I was first found in 2002, and conserved since 2003; 52H, 280A, and 312I changes were identified in 2004 and stayed conserved since 2007; 131S first appeared in 2005 and since then has been conserved until 2017 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

Therefore, substitutions at residues 31, 377 or 450 that appeared to have had a higher frequency in NP evolution history were further investigated.

To examine whether genetic variations at these three positions altered polymerase activity, A/Taiwan/3446/02 NP (31&#x02009;K-377S-450S) was used as a backbone to generate mutations for analysis. Polymerase genes from A/Taiwan/3446/02 strain were used as backbone for this assay. By site-directed mutagenesis, single, double and triple mutations at residues 31, 377 and 450 of NP were generated. The relative polymerase activity pattern between different NPs were similar both at 33&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a and b).

The single substitution at residue 377 (when comparing KSS with KGS, and RSG with RGG at both temperatures; KSG with KGG at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and RSS with RGS at 33&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) did not result in a significant change of activity. Although it showed no significant difference when comparing KSS with RSS, polymerase activity between KSG and RSG as well as between KGG and RGG showed statistical differences that demonstrated the effect of substitution at residue 31 (from K to R). Thus, we concluded that residues 31 and 450 modulated the polymerase activity and NP with 450G had a higher activity while 31R downregulated polymerase activity. To further investigate the role of residues 31, 377 and 450 of NP on polymerase activity, alanine substitutions were analyzed. Both 31A and 450A, but not 377A, statistically decreased polymerase activity when compared with A/Taiwan/3446/02 NP both at 33&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c and d). Thus, we suggest alanine substitution at 31 and 450 of NP dramatically decreased the RdRP activity. Because either mutation in residues 31 or 450 would significantly decrease the polymerase activity, except residue 377, both residues 31 and 450 were critical in regulating the polymerase activity.

To examine the viral growth properties of viruses with variant residues at 31 and 450 of NP, one-step replication and multi-step replication cycles in A549 cells were examined at a MOI of 1 and a MOI of 0.01, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a and b).

These findings demonstrated the substitutions found in the NP evolution changed viral growth properties that may act via regulation of the polymerase activity. Reverse genetics viruses with alanine mutation at residues 31, 377 and 450 were also analyzed.

Moreover, we identified fifteen sporadic substitutions and those who had higher frequencies (31R, 377G and 450S) were further analyzed by in vitro and in vivo assays. The 31R and 450S were confirmed to reduce viral replication while the dominant circulating residues (31&#x02009;K and 450G) were beneficial to viral replication properties. In this study, we evaluated NP substitutions in evolution and demonstrated amino acid changes in 31 and 450 of NP could modulate virus replication.</p><p id="Par40">To understand the basic functions of NP, many studies have paid attention to residues of the conserved region and defined several domains on NP, such as RNA binding, PB2 binding, oligomerization (NP-NP interaction) and NLS. However, crucial residues may exist at sites that have yet to be identified. Via alanine mutation and reverse genetics system, 74 conserved residues among influenza viruses were analyzed and their impact on virus replication or RNA incorporation were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For example, R208A and R416A, which served as negative control in the mini-genome assay were shown to have very low polymerase activity and failed to rescue as reverse genetics viruses. There have been several evolutionary analyses focused on the NP gene segment in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and by phylogenetic analysis, separate clades from human, avian or swine origins can be identified. Some positive selection sites on NP were found, one of which was residue 450 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The 31R substitutions identified here was also observed by the Centers for Disease Control of Taiwan, however, the effects of substitution have not been investigated until now [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Owing to the multiple roles of NP, there is no specific assay for analyzing the functional variability or the effect of mutations in NP. The mini-genome assay is used widely to investigate the impact on virus replication, and the major role of NP in virus infection and replication. Therefore, we applied this assay to screen the evolution of genetic variations and further demonstrated their effects on virus replication by examining these changes in viruses generated by reverse genetics. In this study, genetic variations of NP observed in evolution were further analyzed and we demonstrated that NP-31 and NP-450 may have important effects on virus replication.</p><p id="Par41">Specifically, we found that NP with 450G significantly enhanced viral growth in vitro, also prolonged virus shedding in vivo slightly. In our ferret study, neither the body temperature change nor the weight loss showed any comparative differences. The rgNP-31K-450G virus-infected ferrets did however show slower gain in weight post-challenge and shed virus for a day longer compared to the rgNP-31K-450S virus challenged ferrets. To investigate whether this enhancement of viral properties correlated with larger influenza outbreaks or disease severity, we looked at the human seasonal influenza (H3N2) epidemiology for Taiwan. Notably, viruses with NP-450G was the dominant circulating strain since 1968, whereas in the 2006&#x02013;2007 influenza virus season, NP-450S appeared temporarily in Taiwan (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The excess morbidity of H3N2 was reported as being low in 2006&#x02013;2007, with only 0.98 per 100,000 population, compared to 2003&#x02013;2005 with an average range value of 3.06&#x02013;6.01 per 100,000 population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Thus, the effect of the evolutionary variations that we investigated in vitro can also reflect on the ferrets in vivo study, which can also in turn reflect on human epidemiology. Here, we tried to correlate with epidemiology reports, whereby NP-450S reduce morbidity in the 2006&#x02013;2007 influenza virus season, however, there are still many concerns and/or parameters that could not exactly be filtered out, therefore, further study is required.</p><p id="Par42">Other studies have shown the influence of NP on virulence and pathogenicity. Amino acid differences at residues 50 and 98 on NP have shown to result in high intracerebral pathogenicity in chicken by a duck origin, low pathogenic H7N1 influenza virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Positions 105 and 184 of NP contribute to virus replication and pathogenicity of avian H5N1 influenza virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The substitution NP-D375N of 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus resulted in better adaption to mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. These studies indicated that genetic variations on NP affect not only the pathogenicity but also host adaptation. In other studies, the changes in pathogenicity by NP-D101G and NP-N109T substitutions resulted in the modulation of polymerase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Thus, in addition to NP residues identified to date, more work is required to better understand the role of NP in human influenza evolution and fitness. Avian influenza infection is a great threat to humans and it is important to understand the mechanism of host adaptation. The E627K substitution of PB2 is a well-known case where a single mutation contributes to enhancing replication of avian influenza in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The NP-N319K mutation affects the interaction of NP with host factor importin-&#x003b1; and leads to an increase in virus replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Although there were a few adaptive mutations identified to date, further investigation of NP may reveal more novel aspects that NP plays in host adaptation since NP has multiple roles in virus replication and interacts with various host factors.</p><p id="Par43">Increasingly more studies have focused on the viral whole genome sequence analysis and have tried to understand the complicated mechanisms of influenza virus evolution and clinical outcome. For instance, the severe H3N2 epidemic of the 2003&#x02013;2004 flu season led to high mortality, especially in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The study observed many more amino acid substitutions not only on the HA but also in the other seven gene segments from the dominant strain of previous season. Analysis of the human H3N2 whole genome sequences from databases revealed that there are evolutions in codon usage and frequent reassortment events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. A Previous study showed that reassortment occurred whereby A/Sydney/5/97 converted to A/Fujian/411/02 strain, and A/Fujian/411/02 converted to A/California/7/04 strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In our phylogenetic data, clade 1, where sequences were similar to A/Sydney/5/97, there was a clade separated from the other clades 2&#x02013;6. In clade 6, progressive drift from A/California/7/04 was observed, in contrast to clades 2 to 5. This demonstrates that the NP genetic variations observed in our and other studies come from not only the RNA genome mutations but may also involve the reassortment mechanism.</p><p id="Par44">In this study, substitutions of NP analyzed by mini-genome assay demonstrated NP-31 and NP-450 are important determinants in NP activity. Though NP-377, which we also found in the evolutionary history of influenza, did not affect polymerase activity significantly, a recent study had demonstrated that NP-377 is a phosphorylation site in the H1N1 WSN strain. Amino acids sequence alignment of WSN and our A/Taiwan/3446/02 strain showed that NP had an 89.3% identity and NP-377 was conserved. A previous study showed that mutated phosphorylated residues reduced viral titer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and the same effect was observed in our study whereby 377G slightly decreased the polymerase activity. Thus, the post-translational modification may also have some functions and participate in NP&#x02019;s evolution.</p><p id="Par45">Epistasis, which is a term used in genetics and evolution, is defined as some mutations being tolerated only after the occurrence of others that can have either positive or negative effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In evolution, epistasis may play a key role in immune escape and drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Epistasis was found in the NA protein of influenza H1N1 virus and contributed to the emergence of resistant strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Gong and Bloom predicted the evolution trajectory of H3N2 viruses from Aichi/1968 to Brisbane/2007 strain by computational analysis and found that the epistatically constrained variations were destabilizing and had required another mutation to stabilize the NP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. They demonstrated three single mutations (L259S, R384G, and V280A) which decreased polymerase activity, but the gain of other mutations before these mutations had occurred can rescue their deleterious effect. Some of the residues of NP backgrounds before and after 2004 that we had identified by the global evolution were included in their predicted trajectory and the V280A was demonstrated to be under the control of epistasis. In this study, we focused on those sporadic substitutions which were not analyzed by previous studies and showed that 31R and 450S decreased polymerase activity and they may need other mutations to stabilize and to support conservation through evolution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par46">Instead of analyzing surface proteins of HA and NA of influenza A(H3N2) viruses, we analyzed the NP gene of human influenza A H3N2 viruses that have circulated from 1999 to 2018. NP-31 and NP-450 were identified as possible sites that affect polymerase activity and also had an effect on viral replication, transcription, translation, growth kinetics, and in a ferret infection study. In conclusion, we demonstrated that two NP protein substitutions acquired from evolution appear to have an impact on some influenza viral properties. Hence, we suggest that the evolutional genetic variations of NP should be continuously monitored, and their effects determined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec23"><p>
