<p id="Par44">In this study, substitutions of NP analyzed by mini-genome assay demonstrated NP-31 and NP-450 are important determinants in NP activity. Though NP-377, which we also found in the evolutionary history of influenza, did not affect polymerase activity significantly, a recent study had demonstrated that NP-377 is a phosphorylation site in the H1N1 WSN strain. Amino acids sequence alignment of WSN and our A/Taiwan/3446/02 strain showed that NP had an 89.3% identity and NP-377 was conserved. A previous study showed that mutated phosphorylated residues reduced viral titer [
