<p id="Par42">Other studies have shown the influence of NP on virulence and pathogenicity. Amino acid differences at residues 50 and 98 on NP have shown to result in high intracerebral pathogenicity in chicken by a duck origin, low pathogenic H7N1 influenza virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Positions 105 and 184 of NP contribute to virus replication and pathogenicity of avian H5N1 influenza virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The substitution NP-D375N of 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus resulted in better adaption to mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. These studies indicated that genetic variations on NP affect not only the pathogenicity but also host adaptation. In other studies, the changes in pathogenicity by NP-D101G and NP-N109T substitutions resulted in the modulation of polymerase activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Thus, in addition to NP residues identified to date, more work is required to better understand the role of NP in human influenza evolution and fitness. Avian influenza infection is a great threat to humans and it is important to understand the mechanism of host adaptation. The E627K substitution of PB2 is a well-known case where a single mutation contributes to enhancing replication of avian influenza in mammals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The NP-N319K mutation affects the interaction of NP with host factor importin-Î± and leads to an increase in virus replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Although there were a few adaptive mutations identified to date, further investigation of NP may reveal more novel aspects that NP plays in host adaptation since NP has multiple roles in virus replication and interacts with various host factors.
