<p id="Par40">To understand the basic functions of NP, many studies have paid attention to residues of the conserved region and defined several domains on NP, such as RNA binding, PB2 binding, oligomerization (NP-NP interaction) and NLS. However, crucial residues may exist at sites that have yet to be identified. Via alanine mutation and reverse genetics system, 74 conserved residues among influenza viruses were analyzed and their impact on virus replication or RNA incorporation were identified [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For example, R208A and R416A, which served as negative control in the mini-genome assay were shown to have very low polymerase activity and failed to rescue as reverse genetics viruses. There have been several evolutionary analyses focused on the NP gene segment in recent years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and by phylogenetic analysis, separate clades from human, avian or swine origins can be identified. Some positive selection sites on NP were found, one of which was residue 450 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The 31R substitutions identified here was also observed by the Centers for Disease Control of Taiwan, however, the effects of substitution have not been investigated until now [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Owing to the multiple roles of NP, there is no specific assay for analyzing the functional variability or the effect of mutations in NP. The mini-genome assay is used widely to investigate the impact on virus replication, and the major role of NP in virus infection and replication. Therefore, we applied this assay to screen the evolution of genetic variations and further demonstrated their effects on virus replication by examining these changes in viruses generated by reverse genetics. In this study, genetic variations of NP observed in evolution were further analyzed and we demonstrated that NP-31 and NP-450 may have important effects on virus replication.
