<p id="Par45">Epistasis, which is a term used in genetics and evolution, is defined as some mutations being tolerated only after the occurrence of others that can have either positive or negative effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In evolution, epistasis may play a key role in immune escape and drug resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Epistasis was found in the NA protein of influenza H1N1 virus and contributed to the emergence of resistant strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Gong and Bloom predicted the evolution trajectory of H3N2 viruses from Aichi/1968 to Brisbane/2007 strain by computational analysis and found that the epistatically constrained variations were destabilizing and had required another mutation to stabilize the NP [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. They demonstrated three single mutations (L259S, R384G, and V280A) which decreased polymerase activity, but the gain of other mutations before these mutations had occurred can rescue their deleterious effect. Some of the residues of NP backgrounds before and after 2004 that we had identified by the global evolution were included in their predicted trajectory and the V280A was demonstrated to be under the control of epistasis. In this study, we focused on those sporadic substitutions which were not analyzed by previous studies and showed that 31R and 450S decreased polymerase activity and they may need other mutations to stabilize and to support conservation through evolution.
