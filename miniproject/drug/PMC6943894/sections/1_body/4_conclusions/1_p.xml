<p id="Par46">Instead of analyzing surface proteins of HA and NA of influenza A(H3N2) viruses, we analyzed the NP gene of human influenza A H3N2 viruses that have circulated from 1999 to 2018. NP-31 and NP-450 were identified as possible sites that affect polymerase activity and also had an effect on viral replication, transcription, translation, growth kinetics, and in a ferret infection study. In conclusion, we demonstrated that two NP protein substitutions acquired from evolution appear to have an impact on some influenza viral properties. Hence, we suggest that the evolutional genetic variations of NP should be continuously monitored, and their effects determined.</p>
