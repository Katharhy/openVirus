<p id="Par15">Influenza A viruses are common respiratory infectious pathogens which cause severe epidemics and occasional pandemics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These pandemic influenza strains then persistently circulate in the human population and cause seasonal epidemics. For example, H3N2 viruses have continuously circulated in human population since the 1968 pandemic. Influenza A viruses contain eight gene segments, which include PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M, and NS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Antigenic shift is caused by reassorting of gene segments while antigenic drift is caused by an accumulation of mutations in genes during virus evolution. Under the pressure of host immunity and the environment, viruses which can survive with new mutations, may keep circulating and potentially become a major public health threat [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Consequently, although specific anti-viral drugs as well as vaccination strategies have been developed and applied, annual seasonal epidemics still result in millions of severe cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Thus, it is essential to better understand the evolutionary mechanisms of influenza A viruses.
