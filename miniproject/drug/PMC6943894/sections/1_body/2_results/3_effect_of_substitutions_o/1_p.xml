<p id="Par36">After examining the effect of these residues by mini genome assay, we next aimed to investigate whether they affected virus replication. To achieve this goal, a reverse genetics system was used to produce viruses with specific mutations on NP. In this system, the A/Taiwan/3446/02 strain served as genetic backbone that provided the other seven gene segments to rule out other gene effects on virus replication. To examine the viral growth properties of viruses with variant residues at 31 and 450 of NP, one-step replication and multi-step replication cycles in A549 cells were examined at a MOI of 1 and a MOI of 0.01, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a and b). The results indicated that viruses with 31K-450G had higher viral titers than 31R-450G, 31K-450S, and 31R-450S from 4 h post-infection in one-replication cycle as well as 24 h post-infection in multi-step growth curve. These findings demonstrated the substitutions found in the NP evolution changed viral growth properties that may act via regulation of the polymerase activity. Reverse genetics viruses with alanine mutation at residues 31, 377 and 450 were also analyzed. We observed that virus with 31A or 450A statistically decreased viral growth, whereas 377A had similar growth kinetics as rg-A/Taiwan/3446/02 virus (Fig.
