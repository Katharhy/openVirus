<p id="Par37">NP has a major role in RNP complex and can regulate polymerase activity which may change viral growth properties. To dissect the hypothesis that polymerase activity alteration can affect viral growth titer, we further investigated viral transcription, replication, and translation. A549 cells were infected with mutant viruses at a MOI of 1, and the viral RNAs were extracted. The level of M gene was normalized with the β-actin gene that was quantitated by qRT-PCR. Compared with the RNA level of NP-31K-450G, the 31R-450G and 31K-450S as well as 31R-450S substitutions decreased vRNA and mRNA levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Regarding translation, virus-infected cells were lysed and immunoblot analysis was performed to measure the amount of NP protein present. Similar patterns were observed whereby the virus rgNP-31K-450G expressed the highest protein levels, but viruses with substitutions showed slightly decreased protein levels (Fig.
