<p id="Par38">We next examined the effect of the substitutions in vivo. Ferrets were challenged with reverse genetics viruses with different amino acid composition in residue 31 and 450 of NP intranasally on day 0. The temperature of the ferrets showed no significant changes in any of the groups tested following challenge, and all ferrets showed weight gains post challenge but ferrets from the rgNP-31K-450G group had a slower rise in body weight gain for the first 4 days after virus challenge, whereas ferrets from the other groups all had similar weight gains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a and b). Viral loads in nasal washes were assessed daily following challenge (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c and d), with ferrets from the rgNP-31K-450G and rgNP-31R-450G groups shedding virus from day one post-challenge and achieving viral titers that were statistically higher than rgNP-31K-450S and rgNP-31R-450S groups. Noticeably, the viral titers of two ferrets in rgNP-31K-450S and one in rgNP-31R-450S were undetectable at day 1-post challenge. In addition, ferrets from the rgNP-31K-450G group continued to shed virus at low levels at day 6 post-challenge, while ferrets in all other groups had ceased shedding virus at this timepoint.
