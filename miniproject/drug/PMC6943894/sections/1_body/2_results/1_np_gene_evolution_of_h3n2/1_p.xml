<p id="Par32">To understand the evolution pattern of the NP gene, influenza H3N2 clinical isolates from 1999 to 2017 from the Virology Laboratory of NCKUH were analyzed. The epidemiology curve showed that the H3N2 subtype continuously circulated in Taiwan and caused epidemics throughout the years (Additional file

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The A/Hong Kong/68 H3N2 virus strain, isolated in the 1968 pandemic was used as the ancestral strain. Vaccine strains after 1997 were also included as reference strains. The NP gene did evolve over time, as shown by the progressively increasing distance from the ancestral strain. Moreover, this tree separated into various clades that we further termed clades 1–6 according to their amino acid substitutions. By phylogenetic analysis, we demonstrated that NP gene had accumulated many genetic changes and evolved into several clades with amino acid changes in protein (Additional file

Some substitutions were only observed during a specific time interval, for example, 27S, 103R, and 480E substitutions were identified in five of eight isolates in 2002; 77R and 425V substitutions before 2004. Some substitutions accumulated were more durable, for instance, 136I was first found in 2002, and conserved since 2003; 52H, 280A, and 312I changes were identified in 2004 and stayed conserved since 2007; 131S first appeared in 2005 and since then has been conserved until 2017 (Additional file
