<p id="Par33">To expand our findings and to overcome geography limitations focusing on a set of viruses from Taiwan, a total of 14,220 NP sequences of human H3N2 from the IRD were included to analyze the genetic variations of NP globally. The most dominant sequence in each year (the percentage showed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) was also included in the phylogenetic tree and showed similar time distribution among clades as Taiwan isolates. When comparing protein variations, the backbone of NP in majority showed significant change before and after 2004 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The 27S-77R-103R-146A-425V-480E backbone was the most dominant circulating type from 2001 to 2003 (41.67, 75.13, and 52.81% in 2001, 2002, and 2003, respectively) while the 52H-98R-136I-146A-197V-280A-312I-406T composition was identified and became dominant since 2004. The 52H, 280A and 312I were stably conserved since 2007 and the backbone further acquired 131S within the same year. Since 2015, this backbone has had minor changes in sequence, with 197I and 472A gradually becoming dominant.
