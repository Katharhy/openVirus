<p id="Par23">To evaluate NP genetic variations by mini-genome assay, point mutations were introduced into the NP gene of A/Taiwan/3446/02 strain by site-directed mutagenesis PCR with specific primer pairs. All of the mutations analyzed in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> were generated from the A/Taiwan/3446/02 NP backbone. Mutations in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>ab were arranged from KSG because of the dominant circulating sequence being KSG. The template plasmids were removed by DpnI. 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> containing NP mutation plasmids were amplified in LB broth and plasmids were extracted by Qiagen plasmid midi kit for further analysis.
