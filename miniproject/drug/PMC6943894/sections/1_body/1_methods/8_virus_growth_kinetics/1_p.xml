<p id="Par26">To analyze the viral growth kinetics, A549 cells were seeded in 24-well plates in the concentration of 1.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/0.5 mL. After 24 h of culture, cells were infected by 0.5 mL of virus with 1 MOI (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a) or 0.01 MOI (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b and c) in virus culture medium containing 1.5 μg/mL trypsin. Viruses were collected after 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h post-infection for one-step growth curve and 0, 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection for multi-step growth curve. Collected virus samples were titrated by plaque assay.
