<p id="Par24">For mini-genome assay, 293 T cells were seeded in 96-well plates in the concentration of 2.7 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/0.1 mL. After 24 h of culture, cells were transfected with influenza PB2, PB1, PA expression plasmids (A/Taiwan/3446/02 strain in pHW2000 vector) and different NP expression plasmids by Lipofectamine 2000. Dual-luciferase expression plasmids were co-transfected, whereby firefly luciferase acted as the reporter and renilla luciferase acted as the internal control. The reporter plasmid contains 3′ and 5′ noncoding region of the influenza virus and is under the control of Pol-I promoter as well as the Pol-I terminator. Transfected cells were cultured at 33 °C or 37 °C, which resembled the temperature of the human upper and lower respiratory tract respectively. Cell lysates were collected in 0.1 mL Passive lysis buffer. Luciferase activity of cell lysate was analyzed with dual-luciferase assay kit (Promega) and detected by VICTOR 1420 microplate reader.
