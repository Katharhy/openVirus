<p id="Par27">MDCK cells were seeded in 12-well plates in the concentration of 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL. After 24 h of culture, cells were infected with 200 μL of ten-fold serially diluted viruses. Virus adsorption was carried out for 1 h at 35 °C and medium-agarose mixture were added to a total volume of 2 mL per well. Three days post-infection, cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde and stained with 1% crystal violet.
