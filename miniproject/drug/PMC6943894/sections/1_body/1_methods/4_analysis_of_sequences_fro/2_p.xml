<p id="Par22">The residues in bold in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> defined as sporadic substitutions because they only existed in dominant types in several years and did not become conserved. The number of any amino acid sequence type with a sporadic substitution was calculated and the percentage in total sequence number was obtained (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> showed the dominant sequence types with their percentage, while Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> showed the amount of sporadic substitutions in each year, which may be identified in various sequence types even in those that were not listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> (&lt; 5%).
