<p id="Par28">To evaluate vRNA and mRNA in virus-infected cells, A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plates in the concentration of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/2 mL. After 24 h of culture, cells were infected with viruses at an MOI of 1. Total RNAs were extracted at 6 h post-infection and treated with DNase. Oligo-dT and influenza universal primer, uni-12, for mRNA and virus vRNA, respectively, were used in the RT reaction. For quantitative PCR, cDNAs were treated with RNase H, then amplified both influenza virus M gene (GACCRATCCTGTCACCTCTGAC and AGGGCATTYTGGACAAAKCGTCTA) and β-actin (CCAACCGCGAGAAGATGA and CCAGAGGCGTACAGGGATAG) with specific primers in the Roche Light Cycler 2.0. M gene probe (FAM-TGCAGTCCTCGCTCACTGGGCACG-BBQ) was used to detect viral mRNA and vRNA. β-actin (Universal ProbeLibrary probe #64, Roche) expression was also examined for each sample for normalization of gene expression between different samples.
