  <p>Two substitutions affected viral replication, transcription and translation. 
   <bold>a</bold> Virus RNA level in A549 cells at 6 h post-infection was investigated. Levels of M genes were estimated by qRT-PCR and normalized with the β-actin genes of cells. Negative-sense viral vRNA and positive sense viral mRNA were compared. The one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-test was performed; *
