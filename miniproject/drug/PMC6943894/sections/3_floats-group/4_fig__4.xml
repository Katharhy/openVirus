  <p>Variations on NP-31 and NP-450 residues affected viral growth kinetics. A549 cells were infected with reverse genetics with different amino acid composition as indicated at (
   <bold>a</bold>) MOI of 1 and (
   <bold>b</bold>)(
   <bold>c</bold>) MOI of 0.01 at 37 °C. At the selected time points, viruses were harvested and examined by plaque assay in MDCK cells. The one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-test was performed; *
