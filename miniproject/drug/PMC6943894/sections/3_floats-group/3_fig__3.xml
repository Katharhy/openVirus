  <p>Variations on NP-31 and NP-450 residues affected polymerase activity. The mini-genome assay was carried out to analyze the polymerase activity with various point substitutions on NP at (
   <bold>a</bold>) 33 °C and (
   <bold>b</bold>) 37 °C. Polymerase activity with alanine point substitutions was also analyzed both at (
   <bold>c</bold>) 33 °C and (
   <bold>d</bold>) 37 °C. The X-axis showed the NP origins and the Y-axis showed the relative polymerase activity where firefly luciferase was normalized with renilla luciferase, internal control. The t-test value was calculated; *

   <sub>377</sub>S-NP
   <sub>450</sub>G, and in (
