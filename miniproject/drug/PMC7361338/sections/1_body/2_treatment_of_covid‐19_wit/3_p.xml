<p>On March 24, the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a recommendation with the “COVID‐19 Convalescent Plasma Research ‐ Emergency” declaration. FDA stated that certain standards have been established for donation and that CP use is allowed for patients under certain conditions. Of note, FDA does not allow the use of CP for prophylaxis. With the “Blood Regulatory Network”, WHO suggested using CP when vaccines and anti‐viral drugs are not available in the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID‐19.
