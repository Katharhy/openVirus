 </xref> Therapeutic apheresis centers licensed by the Ministry of Health and Turkish Red Crescent carry out activities for obtaining CP from donors. In Turkey, multidisciplinary working groups which have been attended by a large number of scientists were formed. These groups provide information and experience sharing among themselves by following donor selection, product standard, treatment management, patient‐donor follow‐up, and scientific developments in the world. CP administrations are carried out under the control of intensive care, infectious disease specialists and pulmonologists.
