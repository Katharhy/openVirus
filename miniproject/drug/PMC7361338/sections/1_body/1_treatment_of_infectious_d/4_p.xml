<p>CP was also used in the West African Ebola epidemic in 2013. Eighty‐four patients received 500 mL of CP. When compared to the historical control group, the CP group had a shorter duration of symptoms than did the control group. From day 3 to day 16 after diagnosis, the risk of death was 31% in the CP group and 38% in the control group. Even though the transfusion of up to 500 mL CP improved the symptoms, no significant survival benefit was observed.

 </xref> Treatment with CP was also reported in three patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in South Korea. In this study, 3 of 13 MERS patients with respiratory failure received 4 CP infusions from recovered MERS‐CoV‐infected patients, and only two of them showed neutralizing activity. After the infusion of CP with a neutralizing activity titer of 1:80, serological response was achieved but no response was achieved after the infusions of CP with a neutralizing activity titer of 1:40.
