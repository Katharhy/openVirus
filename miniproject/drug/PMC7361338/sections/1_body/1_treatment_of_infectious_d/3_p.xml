<p>Experience in the use of CP against coronavirus was obtained from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 1 (SARS‐COV‐1) outbreaks in 2003. In the retrospective non‐randomized study conducted by Soo et al, 40 SARS patients refractory to ribavirin and 1.5 g of pulsed methylprednisolone received either 200‐400 mL CP (n = 19) or a further dose of pulsed methylprednisolone (n = 21). In patients who received CP, higher discharge rate up to 22 days from the hospital (77.8% vs 23%; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .004) and lower mortality rate (0% vs 23.8%; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .049) was observed compared to the patients who received steroids. The authors also observed that patients receiving CP after day 16 had a poor clinical response and concluded that CP administration was more effective when given early in the course of the disease.

 </xref> In Taiwan, Yeh et al reported three healthcare workers with SARS‐COV‐1, who had failed to respond to steroids, ribavirin, intravenous immunoglobulin and protease inhibitors, were treated with 500 mL CP. All of the patients survived after CP transfusion.
