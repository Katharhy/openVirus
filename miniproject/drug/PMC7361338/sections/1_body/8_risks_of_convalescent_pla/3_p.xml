<p>In conclusion, SARS‐CoV‐2 continues to spread worldwide. The exact treatment of COVID‐19 disease is currently unknown. Even though limited published studies are not prospective or randomized, until the development of vaccines or therapeutics, CP seems to be a safe and probably effective treatment for critically ill patients with COVID‐19. At least preliminary results of multicentre randomized controlled clinical trials should be waited. Meanwhile, in this pandemic, scientists should be encouraged to collaborate on common research protocols, rather than conducting independent researches. International multicenter randomized controlled trials are needed. CP use should be encouraged to be made within the scope of clinical trials in cooperation with national and international health authorities.</p>
