<p>Passive antibody therapy involves administering antibodies against a particular agent to a susceptible individual in order to protect or treat an infectious disease associated with this agent. On the contrary, active vaccination requires stimulation of an immune response that takes time to develop. Therefore, passive antibody administration is the only way to immunize susceptible people immediately. Passive antibody therapy has a history going back to the 1890s and was the only method of treating some infectious diseases before the development of antimicrobial therapy in the 1940s.
