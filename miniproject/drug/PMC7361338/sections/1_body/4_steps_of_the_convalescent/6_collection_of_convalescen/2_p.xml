<p>Donors who have successfully completed pre‐donation evaluation are directed to the apheresis centers. CP should be collected by apheresis to take larger volumes in short intervals. Approximately 200‐600 mL plasma can be collected with apheresis devices depending on the total blood volume of the donor. The collected plasma volume (excluding the anticoagulant solution) should not exceed 750 mL for each procedure. With the consent of the donor, an appointment can be arranged for plasma donation again. The donation interval may vary between countries. CP is stored by freezing or applied within 6 hours without freezing. Freezing should be started within the first 6 hours after the apheresis process is completed. Plasma components should be labeled using the ISBT128 coding system for traceability. The collected products can be individually labeled as 200 mL of divided ingredients and defined as 1 unit. Barcoded products should be stored at or below minus 18/25° in a separate storage cabinet. Appropriate patients can be given 200‐400 mL of CP in accordance with the clinical research protocol. ABO blood group should preferably be compatible. For pathogen inactivation process; amotosalen + UV light, riboflavin + UV light, methylene blue or a solvent/detergent may be used. But we would like to highlight that there has been no study that compared Anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 CP that had undergone pathogen inactivation process to those of not. In order to maximize transfusion safety, it is recommended that the CP should undergone pathogen inactivation process. It should be irradiated if it will be given to the patient without being frozen within 6 hours after the plasma collection. Otherwise, the frozen plasma does not need to be irradiated.</p>
