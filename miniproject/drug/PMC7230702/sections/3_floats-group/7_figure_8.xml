  <p>Mechanisms of rhamnan sulfate (RS) and heparin on inhibition of blood coagulation in the presence or absence of antithrombin (AT). (
   <bold>a</bold>) Effect of RS (2 μg/mL) and heparin (2 μg/mL) on inhibition of thrombin (2.5 nM) in the presence or absence of AT (5 nM). (
   <bold>b</bold>) Effect of RS (2 μg/mL) and heparin (2 μg/mL) on inhibition of factor Xa (12.5 nM) in the presence or absence of AT (25 nM). Significant difference in values between the sample with thrombin alone or factor Xa alone and the sample of thrombin or factor Xa with AT, heparin, or RS is shown as *
