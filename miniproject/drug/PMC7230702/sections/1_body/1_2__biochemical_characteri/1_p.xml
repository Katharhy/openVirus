<p>Cell walls of 
 <italic>M. nitidum</italic> contain a large amount of rhamnan sulfate (RS), a sulfated polysaccharide [

 <xref rid="B5-marinedrugs-18-00228" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although this macromolecule is poorly soluble in water, it can be solubilized and decomposed into smaller molecules by treating 
 <italic>M. nitidum</italic> with hot water. The obtained extract is purified by anion-exchange resin column chromatography; sulfated substances bind to the column and are subsequently eluted from the column by increasing the concentration of sodium chloride. This method produces a highly purified RS [
