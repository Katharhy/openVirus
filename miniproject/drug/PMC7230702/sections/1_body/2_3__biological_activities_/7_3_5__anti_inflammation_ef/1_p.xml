<p>It is important to prevent the endothelial inflammation to regulate the onset of thrombotic disorders. To identify the differences between RS and heparin in their effects on inflammation of endothelial cells, we examined whether RS regulates the expression of TF, a trigger of blood coagulation and inflammation, and the platelet aggregating factor VWF in bacteriogenic LPS-induced inflammation of endothelial cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-18-00228-f009">Figure 9</xref>a, adding LPS induced a marked elevation in TF expression in the endothelial cells, while the TF expression was significantly (

 <xref rid="B14-marinedrugs-18-00228" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, RS itself significantly suppressed (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) the TF expression in endothelial cells not stimulated with LPS in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-18-00228-f009">Figure 9</xref>b, LPS significantly induced the expression of VWF in the endothelial cells, and the VWF expression was significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) suppressed in the presence of RS in a concentration-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B14-marinedrugs-18-00228" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, RS significantly suppressed (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) the VWF expression in the endothelial cells not stimulated with LPS in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of heparin was analyzed under the same conditions, and the results showed that, although heparin did not affect the TF expression in the endothelial cells stimulated with LPS, it significantly suppressed (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) the TF expression in the endothelial cells not stimulated with LPS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-18-00228-f009">Figure 9</xref>c). Unlike RS, heparin enhanced VWF expression in the endothelial cells both in the presence and absence of LPS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-18-00228-f009">Figure 9</xref>d). Likewise, RS suppressed significantly the elevation of TF and VWF expression in TNF-Î±- or thrombin-induced inflammation of endothelial cells, whereas heparin did not show such a suppressing effect (data not shown here) [
 <xref rid="B14-marinedrugs-18-00228" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Overall, unlike heparin, RS was shown to strongly attenuate inflammatory injury in cultured vascular endothelial cells. RS is suggested to be a novel anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory substance for vascular endothelial cells.
