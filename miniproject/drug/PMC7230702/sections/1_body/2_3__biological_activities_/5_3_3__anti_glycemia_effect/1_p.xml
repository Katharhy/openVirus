<p>Kamimura et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-marinedrugs-18-00228" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] reported the effect of edible green algae 
 <italic>M. nitidum</italic> powder and RS on glycemic responses after oral administration of various saccharinity agents to rats. When rats were administered 2 g of glucose, sucrose, maltose, or soluble starch/kg body weight (b.w.) of rat with or without 
 <italic>M. nitidum</italic> powder (200 mg/kg b.w. of rat) or RS (approximately 50 mg/kg b.w. of rat), both 
 <italic>M. nitidum</italic> powder and RS significantly inhibited the increment of plasma glucose level, compared to the controlled group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, they evaluated the effects of 
 <italic>M. nitidum</italic> powder and RS on the postprandial increase in blood glucose level in healthy human subjects. The results showed the significant deduction of the blood glucose level at 30 min after the intake of 
 <italic>M. nitidum</italic> powder (500 mg) or RS (approximately 60 mg) compared to the controlled ones (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). These data suggest that the 
 <italic>M. nitidum</italic> powder and RS are useful for diabetes mellitus.
