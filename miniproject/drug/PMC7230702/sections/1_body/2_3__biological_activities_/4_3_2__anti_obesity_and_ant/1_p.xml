<p>Seaweed contains large amounts of dietary fibers and is reported to lower serum cholesterol levels and neutral fats through carrageenan [

Accordingly, to clarify whether the extracted RS, a soluble fiber, is effective for treating obesity and obesity-related diseases, including hepatic steatosis, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, the zebrafish was used to assess and examine its effects. The zebrafish is a model organism that has been used in recent years to identify and assess drug candidate agents for vertebrates. When zebrafish were rendered obese after being fed a high-fat diet, they doubled their weight compared to normal feeding in four weeks. When switching to a diet containing RS, the weight gain of these obese zebrafish was significantly attenuated [

The gene expression analysis showed that RS mainly inhibits lipogenesis. These results suggest that RS has anti-obesity effects. We conducted a clinical trial on 16 adult males with high cholesterol levels [

As a result, there was no change in serum HDL cholesterol level, but LDL cholesterol level in the RS-treated group was significantly (
