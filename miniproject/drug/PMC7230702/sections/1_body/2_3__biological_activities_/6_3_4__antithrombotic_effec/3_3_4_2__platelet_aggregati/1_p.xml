<p>Formation of thrombi due to enhanced platelet aggregation is known to cause artery thrombosis [

 <xref rid="B48-marinedrugs-18-00228" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. To identify the effects that RS has on platelet aggregation, the effects of RS on human platelet aggregation in whole blood induced by collagen, thrombin, or an antibiotic ristocetin (one of the activators of VWF) were examined. As a result, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-18-00228-f006">Figure 6</xref>aâ€“c, RS strongly inhibited collagen-, thrombin-, and ristocetin/VWF-induced platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner. RS has been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation in whole blood, and therefore is expected to be useful as a food for preventing arterial thrombosis.
