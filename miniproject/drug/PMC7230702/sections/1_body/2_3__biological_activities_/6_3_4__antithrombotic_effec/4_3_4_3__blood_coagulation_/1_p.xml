<p>The formation of a pathological coagulation thrombus due to activation of the blood coagulation system in blood vessels is thought to cause mainly venous thrombosis. To examine the effect of RS on blood coagulation, human blood plasma was used to examine the effect of RS on the prothrombin time (PT), which measures extrinsic coagulation ability, and on the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), which measures intrinsic coagulation ability. Heparin was used to compare the difference with RS. Heparin is one form of sulfated polysaccharides, and it has been used as an anticoagulant from old times [

However, the anticoagulation effect of RS was comparable to that of heparin at RS concentrations of approximately 10-fold the concentration of the latter. Thus, it can be inferred that the coagulation inhibitory effect of RS is about one-tenth that of heparin. It has been reported that intraperitoneally administered RS suppressed the PT and APTT in in vivo experiments using rats [
