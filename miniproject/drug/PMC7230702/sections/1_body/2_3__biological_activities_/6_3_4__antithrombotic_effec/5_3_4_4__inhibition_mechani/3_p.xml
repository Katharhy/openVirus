<p>To elucidate the coagulation inhibitory mechanism of RS, its inhibitory effects on thrombin and factor Xa in the presence or absence of purified AT were analyzed. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-18-00228-f008">Figure 8</xref>a, the thrombin inhibitory effect was not observed in RS itself. However, similar to heparin, it inhibited thrombin activity in the presence of AT [
 <xref rid="B14-marinedrugs-18-00228" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. While heparin completely inhibited the activity of factor Xa in the presence of AT, RS inhibited only around 30% of factor Xa activity; the inhibitory effect of RS was thus weak compared to heparin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-18-00228-f008">Figure 8</xref>b). The data show that RS strongly inhibits thrombin and weakly inhibits factor Xa in an AT-dependent manner. They also suggest that the anticoagulant effect of RS is driven by a molecular mechanism similar to that of unfractionated (polymeric) heparin.
