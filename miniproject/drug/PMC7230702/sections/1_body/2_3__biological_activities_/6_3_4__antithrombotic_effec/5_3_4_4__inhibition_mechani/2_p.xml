<p>In clinical practice, unfractionated (polymeric) heparin (molecular weight 5000–20,000; extracted mainly from porcine intestinal mucosa), low-molecular-weight heparin (molecular weight 4000–6000; prepared by processing unfractionated heparin, using a sugar-chain degradation enzyme), and fondaparinux (molecular weight 1728; an ultra-low-molecular-weight heparin consisting of five sugars obtained from further chemosynthesis) have been used. Unfractionated (polymeric) heparin not only promotes the inhibition of factor Xa via AT, but also greatly enhances thrombin inhibition by binding directly to both AT and thrombin. In contrast, low-molecular-weight heparin and fondaparinux cannot bind to thrombin. Thus, they only promote the inhibition of factor Xa via AT. </p>
