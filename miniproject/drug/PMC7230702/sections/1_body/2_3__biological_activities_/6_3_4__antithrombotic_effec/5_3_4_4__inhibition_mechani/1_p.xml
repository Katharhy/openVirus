<p>The anticoagulant heparin exists in animal mast cells, lung, intestine, spleen, and liver. The sugar chain components of heparin are structurally heterogeneous, in which glucuronic acid binds to uronic acid or N-acetylglucosamine binds to iduronic acid, and these are bound by a large amount of sulfate groups [

It has been revealed that the underlying mechanism of heparinâ€™s anticoagulant activity is not that heparin directly inhibits the coagulation factor, but that it first binds to antithrombin (AT) in the blood, to alter (activate) the three-dimensional structure of active site of AT, and this activated form of AT in turn binds to thrombin or factor Xa, to inhibit coagulation activity [
