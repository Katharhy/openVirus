<p>It has been recognized that the most important factors contributing to the formation of pathological thrombi in the blood vessels are pathological changes, such as inflammation of the vascular endothelium [

 <xref rid="B35-marinedrugs-18-00228" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Factors such as aging, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, various types of stress, and smoking induce chronic damage to the endothelium. In general, normal vascular endothelial cells express various molecules that inhibit thrombus formation. Examples include thrombomodulin (TM), heparan sulfate proteoglycan, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), and protein S, which inhibit blood coagulation; nitric oxide (NO), prostacyclin (PGI
 <sub>2</sub>), and ecto-ATP/ADPase, which inhibit platelet activation; tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), which enhances fibrinolysis; and anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-4, IL-10, NO, etc., as listed in
