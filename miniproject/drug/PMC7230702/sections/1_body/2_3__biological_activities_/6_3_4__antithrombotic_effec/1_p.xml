<p>Risk factors for the development of thrombosis include aging, various environmental factors, clinical conditions, and stress. Thrombosis is a clinical condition that occurs when a pathological thrombus develops in the blood vessel. Platelet aggregation, blood clotting, and vascular endothelial inflammation are alleged to be three major factors closely related to thrombus formation in blood vessels (Virchowâ€™s triad for thrombosis) (

Virchow in 1856 proposed that there are three essential factors contributing to the formation of arterial and venous thrombosis. They are pathological changes in (1) blood flow, such as abnormal increase and decrease of shear stress; (2) blood components, such as abnormal activation of platelets, blood coagulation, and fibrinolysis factors; and (3) vessel wall, such as abnormal vascular endothelial inflammation. Even today, these three factors are important in understanding the formation of arterial and venous thrombosis, and in developing medicines to treat and prevent thrombotic disorders [
