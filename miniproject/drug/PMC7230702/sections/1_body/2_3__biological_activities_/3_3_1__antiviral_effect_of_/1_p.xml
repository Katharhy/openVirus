<p>Medical researchers have hitherto developed various antiviral medications, including acyclovir, an inhibitor of DNA synthesis used as a medication for herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2, which cause strong inflammatory responses in the skin, mouth, lips (herpes labialis), eyes, and sex organs, and another medication called oseltamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor of the influenza virus. However, shortly after their commercialization, these antiviral medications were met with the emergence of drug-resistant viruses, posing a major challenge. It is known that, because these antiviral agents specifically inhibit enzymes of the viruses, they are more likely to induce mutations in the viral DNA or RNA. To overcome this problem, researchers sought to identify and analyze novel substances with antiviral properties that are extracted from naturally derived substances. RS was the outcome of one of those studies [
