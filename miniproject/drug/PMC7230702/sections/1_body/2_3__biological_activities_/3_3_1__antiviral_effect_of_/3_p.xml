<p>Wang, et al. have shown that intramuscular injection of RS into enterovirus-infected mice significantly improves their survival rate, and RS directly binds to viruses and thereby prevents viral absorption to tissue cells [

Terasawa et al. also showed that oral administration of RS in influenza A virusâ€“infected mice suppressed viral proliferation and weight loss and stimulated neutralizing antibody production in vivo. RS inhibited virus adsorption to the host cells. RS probably binds to the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), which is a glycoprotein on the viral envelope and important for host cell binding. Both antiviral and immune stimulating activities of RS may contribute to the suppression of viral proliferation in vivo [
