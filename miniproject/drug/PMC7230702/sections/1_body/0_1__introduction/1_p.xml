<p>Seaweeds have traditionally been consumed by people inhabiting coastal areas in East Asia. Seaweed is rich in vitamins and minerals and is known to have many favorable effects on human health. There are three groups of seaweed, namely green algae, red algae, and brown algae. Green algae contain large amounts of chlorophyll, or green pigments such as those found in terrestrial plants. In contrast, red algae contain, in addition to chlorophyll, plenty of red pigments called phycoerythrin and blue pigments called phycocyanin, giving them a red or purple color [

 <italic>Monostroma nitidum</italic> is often confused with a species of sea lettuces (
 <italic>Ulva</italic> Linnaeus). However, 
 <italic>M. nitidum</italic> and sea lettuce belong to a different order in biological classification. Many species in the group of sea lettuces have a double layer of cells, whereas 
 <italic>M. nitidum</italic> have a single layer of cell assemblies (

 <italic>M. nitidum</italic> Hitoegusa is derived from the fact that the leaf-like tissue is composed of a single layer of cells. 
 <italic>M. nitidum thallus</italic> consists of many cell aggregates (
