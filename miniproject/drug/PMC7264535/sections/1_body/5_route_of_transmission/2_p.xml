Person‐to‐person spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is believed to occur mainly via respiratory droplets, corresponding to the spread of the influenza virus. With the droplet transmission, the virus released in the respiratory secretions when an infected person sneezes, coughs, or talks can infect other people if it makes direct contact with the mucous membrane. The infection can also occur when a person touches an infected surface and later touches their nose, mouth or eyes. Droplets usually do not travel more than 2 m and do not linger in the air.
