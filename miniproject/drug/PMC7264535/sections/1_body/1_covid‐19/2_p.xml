<p>On 31st December 2019, Chinese health authorities investigated a cluster of atypical cases of pneumonia mainly occurring in individuals who visited Huanan seafood wholesale Market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. From 31st December 2019 to 3rd January 2020, a total of 44 patients developed symptoms like cough, fever, and chest discomfort or respiratory illness, being diagnosis of pneumonia constituted by chest radiographs and computed tomographic scans.

After testing for the causes of respiratory infection encode the negative result, an unbiased sequence of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid identified a β‐coronavirus variant with sequences similarity of 85% corresponding to a bat severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) like coronavirus (CoV).
