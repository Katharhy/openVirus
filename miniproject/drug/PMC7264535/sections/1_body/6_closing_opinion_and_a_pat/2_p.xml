<p>The SARS‐CoV‐2 outbreak has once again spotlighted the need to discover new vaccines, rapid development, and implementation of diagnostic tests against infectious diseases of the global health crisis. Indeed, further studies on COVID‐19 and its pathogenesis will provide some guidance to deal with this rapidly spreading pandemic infectious disease. Several challenges remain as key areas, including the recent people who have tested COVID‐19 positive. Can the cured patient be transmitted to others? All these indicate that more detailed criteria are needed for the prevention and control of SARS‐CoV‐2 virus and strong rigorous criteria to discharge patients after treatment. It is expected that the differences in the sequence of spike proteins between COVID‐19 virus and SARS‐CoV will enable scientists to identify epitopes in COVID‐19 virus for the development of monoclonal antibodies against this virus. Basic research studies on SARS‐CoV‐2‐host interactions is the key to several unanswered questions in the prevention and control of the disease. Many important questions about the identification and mechanism of interferon antagonists encoded by COVID‐19 yet to be answered.</p>
