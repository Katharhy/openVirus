 </xref> have recently published an article where they suggested a putative transcrbrial SARS‐CoV‐2 route to the brain and emphasized that SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA isolation in the cerebrospinal fluid would be the conclusive evidence to report the COVID‐19 neurovirulence. In SARS patients, the neuromuscular disorder has considered as a critical illness neuropathy and myopathy.

It is very important to note that the PCR amplification showed that the cerebrospinal fluid sample from the patient turned positive for SARS‐CoV‐2.
