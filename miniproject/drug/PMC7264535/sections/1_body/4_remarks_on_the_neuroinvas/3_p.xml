 </xref> thinks that an alteration in the dopamine synthetic pathway is possibly involved in the COVID‐19 pathophysiology. The mechanism implicit in the neurological symptoms is not clear which needs further studies, but the SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA isolation in the cerebrospinal fluid indicates that it might be naturally neuroinvasive in human beings. Since a clear understanding of SARS‐CoV‐2 is still missing, a high alert is needed for the possible involvement of CNS in COVID‐19 patients, despite only a few cases are being documented with encephalitis or meningitis related COVID‐19. Indeed, the role in the blood‐brain barrier comprising the virus and avoiding it for gaining access to the neural tissue needs to be explored further in COVID‐19 patients. Hence, the possible neuroinvasion may be a guiding significance to treat and prevent COVID‐19.
