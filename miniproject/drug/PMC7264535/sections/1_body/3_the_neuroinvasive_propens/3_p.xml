<p>Earlier studies on SARS patient samples have shown the presence of SARS‐CoV particles in the brain and located exclusively in the neurons.

 </xref> In‐vivo experiments using transgenic mice showed that, when SARS‐CoV or MERS‐COV has given intranasally, it can enter the brain via the olfactory nerve, and quickly spreads to certain specific brain regions like brainstem and thalamus.

 </xref> Among the infected brain areas, the brainstem has been heavily infected by SARS‐CoV or MERS‐CoV.

 </xref> The brain has expressed ACE2 receptors that have been detected over neurons and glial cells which makes them a potential target of COVID‐19. Another important observation was those mice infected with MERS‐CoV with less inoculum doses, virus particles were not detected in the lung, but only in the brain, which indicates that the CNS infection was more important for the high mortality.
