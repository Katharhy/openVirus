<p>Treating all patients with the same therapy regardless of stage of disease or clinical phenotype is also perilous, and properly conducted trials are necessary to select patient characteristics associated with a beneficial response. It is very clear that patients are presenting with different clinical phenotypes causing respiratory failure (

The recent report on compassionate use of remdesivir among 53 patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection showed an improvement in oxygen support in 36 (68%) whereas 8 (15%) showed worsening; clinical improvement was less frequent among intubated patients (hazard ratio, 0.33) and patients older than 70 years (hazard ratio, 0.29) (
