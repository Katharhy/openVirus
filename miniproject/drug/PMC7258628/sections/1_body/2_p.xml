<p>Many physicians across the world are recommending treatments even while researchers and regulators claim that the evidence of benefit is limited, and therapies should be tested in a randomized controlled trial. These physicians believe that the chance of potential benefit outweighs the chance of harm. However, safety concerns may be significantly underestimated since most of these drugs have never been properly studied in critically ill patients. For example, many of the experimental therapies used are potentially cardiotoxic, including hydroxychloroquine, ritonavir, lopinavir, IFN α-2-β, azithromycin, and methylprednisolone. As myocarditis is reported as a potential complication of SARS-CoV-2, if all these agents are used in combination, is it a surprise that very high rates of cardiac complications occur, such as the 60% incidence of arrhythmia reported in the case series from Du and colleagues (

Anti–IL-6 monoclonal antibodies have been associated with cytomegalovirus reactivation, episodes of bacterial septic shock, and bowel perforation, particularly when combined with high-dose corticosteroids (

Many of these experimental agents have pharmacologic interactions with a large list of drugs commonly used in critical care, hampering overall management and increasing the risk of toxicity. High-dose steroids, associated with superinfections, such as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, increased mortality in influenza pneumonia (

Like hydroxychloroquine, high-dose corticosteroids may be associated with delirium, agitation, and psychosis that often is complicating the weaning of intubated patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients and their families have a clear right to be informed of the risks of all these experimental therapies so they can provide informed consent for compassionate use. That this is routinely occurring seems unlikely.
