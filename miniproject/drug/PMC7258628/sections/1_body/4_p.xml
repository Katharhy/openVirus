<p>Another serious problem with routine use of unproven agents for SARS-CoV-2 is that clinical equipoise is lost and an experimental agent becomes 
 <italic>de facto</italic> standard of care, potentially seriously compromising the ability to do placebo-controlled trials. Inability to complete a controlled trial because of loss of clinical equipoise is a two-edged sword. Even if the intervention has true benefit, it is unlikely detractors will be convinced and lives will be lost because the treatment is still not given. If the intervention has adverse effects not revealed because of the absence of a placebo arm, then lives may be lost because it continues to be used. If experimental agents are given in combination, attribution of effects, both beneficial and adverse, to one of them becomes nearly impossible, given the significant variability in critical care outcomes as a baseline.
