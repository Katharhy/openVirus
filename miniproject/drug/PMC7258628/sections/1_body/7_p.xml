<p>In summary, we believe that the widespread use of clearly experimental therapies being reported in patients with SARS-CoV-2 is dangerous and unjustified. There is a real risk that mortality rates are higher than they need to be because of toxic, ineffective therapy. Clinicians must not succumb to the impulse to “do something else” but instead stick to evidence-based therapies and, if possible, enroll their patients into adaptive clinical trials. SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be a problem for years, and we need to develop precision approaches based on high-quality clinical data as fast as we can. Equally, and unfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 will not be the last serious viral pneumonia epidemic humanity faces, and only by having a scientific approach this time can we avoid going back to 1919-era desperation treatments the next time we are faced with this challenge.</p>
