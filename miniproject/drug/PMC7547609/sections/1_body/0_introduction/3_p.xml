<p id="par0015">The pandemic has challenged many of the principles of paediatric inpatient care that seemed unquestionable until now. A proactive approach is replacing the former “reactive” approach to ensure readiness and improve the efficiency of inpatient paediatric services in a crisis situation. We must use the lessons learned in this pandemic to establish a series of recommendations susceptible of revision based on current scientific evidence and good clinical practice standards. With its integral approach to the care of hospitalised paediatric patients, the speciality of inpatient paediatrics will play a prominent role in the development of the new model of inpatient care that will emerge from the incipient changes spurred by this crisis.</p>
