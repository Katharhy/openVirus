<p id="par0030">In the early phase of the pandemic, care delivery in paediatric units may have been affected not only by paediatric caseloads, but also by the redistribution of resources due to the saturation of hospital services, the considerable spread of the virus among health providers and the curtailment of what may be considered non-essential care. This situation, if sustained, may carry a high opportunity cost as regards other health problems, especially if measures are not taken to minimise its medium- and long-term impact. As paediatricians, we must ready ourselves to face a new scenario that will be more of a marathon than a second sprint.
