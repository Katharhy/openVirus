 </xref> include the creation of multidisciplinary teams of paediatricians and professionals in adult care to anticipate patient needs, create treatment plans and follow up cases. Depending on the circumstances, it may be appropriate to expand the admission criteria of paediatric units to include adult patients with COVID-19 aged up to 30 to 35 years without comorbidities or with chronic diseases with onset in childhood or adolescence. Another possibility would be to consider hospitalization of young adults with conditions commonly found in the paediatric population in paediatric care settings. Adults with COVID-19 are at higher risk of developing arrythmias, coronary artery disease and stroke, so older adults or adults with a previous history of these diseases should not be hospitalised in a paediatric setting. Intrahospital medical alert systems specific to the adult patient population must be set up along with the establishment of adult critical care rapid-response teams.
