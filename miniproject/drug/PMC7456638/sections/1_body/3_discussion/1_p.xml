<p id="Par23">The highly transmissible human pathogen IAV mainly attacks human respiratory epithelium with its hemagglutinin binding with sialic acid to initiate endocytosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Severe symptoms after IAV infection are commonly found in the infant, elderly, pregnant, as well as the immunocompromised populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. IAV can cause serious pandemics in a short time, with shocking and heart-wrenching facts in history, e.g., the 1918 Great Influenza killed almost 1/30 of the global population only in 1.5 years. Also IAV is capable of generating new strains adapted to human beings. That is the very reason that influenza vaccines have to be updated regularly. Also antiviral drugs have to be replaced as a result of the increasing drug resistance developed by viable IAV subtypes. Thus, it is urgent to explore novel anti-IAV drugs to enrich the available antiviral drug bank. This study investigated for the first time the possible role of olaparib on IAV infection in a murine model and found that PARP-1 inhibitor olaparib remarkably relieved IAV-induced lung injury and lung inflammation possibly via inhibition of PARP, as well as p65, and IκBα phosphorylation.
