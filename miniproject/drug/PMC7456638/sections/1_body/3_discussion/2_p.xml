<p id="Par24">PARP has been indicated to be the target of treatment strategy against cancers and inflammatory disorders [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The pro-inflammatory effect of PARP-1 has been highlighted in a variety of non-pulmonary and pulmonary inflammatory diseases, including arthritis, allergic encephalomyelitis, asthma, acute lung injury (ALI), and so on [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. PARP-1 is activated and involved in the lungs of allergen-induced asthma animal models via modulating immune cell recruitment, airway modeling, as well as cytokine production, mainly Th2 cytokines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. PARP-1 is reported to play a critical role in LPS-induced and mechanical ventilation-induced ALI in mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Hence PARP-1 might be a convincing target for the prevention and treatment of lung inflammatory injury.
