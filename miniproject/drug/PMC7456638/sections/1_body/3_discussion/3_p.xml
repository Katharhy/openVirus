<p id="Par25">Genetic as well as pharmacological measures modulating PARP-1 activity were proved to be effective to alleviate the lung inflammation and injury experimentally from the aspects of reducing neutrophil infiltration and macrophage accumulation [

Olaparib downregulates NF-κB-related genes including TNF-α and IL-1β, decreases neutrophil, and alleviates edema of LPS-stimulated murine lungs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Our study found that olaparib possesses protective effects against IAV-induced lung inflammation, suggesting that this drug might exert non-specific anti-inflammatory roles. As the outbreak of severe coronavirus infection since December 2019, it is urgent to explore the mechanisms of virus-induced damage to lung tissues or other organs, as well as develop more effective antiviral drugs or therapies to prevent related damages to patients. Our study explored the protective effects of olaparib in experimental virus-induced pneumonia, suggesting its possible application in viral pneumonia treatment in the future.
