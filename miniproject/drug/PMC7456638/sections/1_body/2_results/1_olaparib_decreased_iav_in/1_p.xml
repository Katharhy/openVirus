<p id="Par18">This study aimed to investigate whether olaparib (chemical structure in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) possessed protective effects against influenza virus challenge. From day 3 post-infection, the IAV-infected mice began to exhibit clinical symptoms, and on day 6 post-infection, the symptoms got worse, which included but not limited to the following, such as weight loss (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), inactivity, rapid shallow breathing, and poor appetite, indicating the successful construction of viral pneumonia model experimentally. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> showed that the IAV-only mice began to die on day 4 post-infection until day 12 post-infection. The positive control, oseltamivir, improved the survival rate of infected mice significantly compared with those in the IAV-only group. To the expectations, mice in the olaparib group showed higher survival rate compared with that in the IAV group in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that olaparib could powerfully protect against influenza virus challenge in mice. Additionally, olaparib-treated IAV mice exhibited lower weight loss compared with untreated ones, suggesting it might possess lighter side effects (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Also, the dose of 10 mg/kg olaparib was chosen for further investigation as a result of the highest survival rate among all olaparib groups.
