<p id="Par19">As olaparib treatment evidently reduced the virus-induced mortality, pathological changes were further explored to assess the influences of olaparib on the lung injury severity. In comparison with the control group, the lung index of mice in the IAV group was significantly higher than that in the control group, and olaparib treatment remarkably reduced the lung index, suggesting that olaparib could alleviate the pulmonary edema induced by IVA infection (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, higher mRNA expression of IAV was detected in IAV lungs, while no virus was detected in the control lung tissues, indicating the direct relationship between IAV infection and pathological manifestations of mice model. Unsurprisingly, less IAV was detected in the lungs of olaparib-treated IAV group, indicating the antiviral effect of this drug functions in the IAV model mice. Virus infection always correlated with leukocyte filtration to the target organs. We next determined the MPO levels and the marker of leucocytes, in lung tissues. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> showed that IAV infection elevated the MPO levels compared with that in the control group, whereas olaparib evidently reduced MPO levels, illustrating that olaparib reduced leucocyte infiltration to the lungs of IAV mice. Morphologic analysis was performed using H&amp;E staining of lung tissues. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, extensive inflammatory cell infiltration, especially around bronchioles, was presented in IAV lungs, signifying lung edema might lead to the breathing difficulty in infected mice. And olaparib treatment attenuated the pathological abnormalities in IAV lungs. Lung histopathological grading numerically pointed that olaparib rectified the lung injury caused by IAV infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>).
