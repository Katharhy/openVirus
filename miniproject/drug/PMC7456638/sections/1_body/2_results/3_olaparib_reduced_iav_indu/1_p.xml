<p id="Par20">Virus-infected pneumonia always comes along with abnormal release of inflammatory cytokines. Next the level of inflammatory cytokines in lung homogenate was detected to investigate whether olaparib could influence the release of inflammatory cytokines in lung tissue. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b, c, d, e</xref>, compared with those in the control group, pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-4, were significantly elevated, and anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, was remarkably descended in the IAV group, while olaparib treatment obviously rectified the abnormal release of the above inflammatory cytokines, meaning that olaparib might possess anti-inflammatory effect in murine lung tissue under the IAV context.
