<p id="Par7">Two grouping methods were applied in this study. For the part of survival rate analysis, mice were randomly divided into 5 groups, that is, the influenza A virus (IAV) group (H1N1 virus + normal saline), the Ola groups (H1N1 virus + 2.5, 5, 10 mg/kg olaparib), and the positive control group (H1N1 virus + 10 mg/kg oseltamivir). For the part of biochemical detection, mice were divided into 3 groups, the control group (normal saline), the IAV group (H1N1 virus + normal saline), and the IAV + Ola group (H1N1 virus + 10 mg/kg olaparib).</p>
