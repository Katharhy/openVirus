<p id="Par15">Viral load was determined by RT-qPCR according to previously described by Li Y et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] with slight modifications. The total RNA of isolated lung tissues at day 6 post-infection was extracted using TRIzol method (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then equal amount of RNA for each sample was transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using the First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) following the instructions. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using a SYBR Green suit (TaKaRa) to determine the mRNA expression levels of target genes, IAV M gene, and GAPDH, in an ABI real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, New York, NY, USA), with the following amplification procedures: 1-min preincubation at 98 °C, 40 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 56 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Each sample was performed in triplicate in one single technical repetition. The primer sequences used in this study were as follows: IAV M, 5’-AATGGTGCAGGCGATAGAG-3′ (forward) and 5’-TACTTGCGGCAACAACGAGAG-3′ (reverse); GAPDH, 5’-TGAGGTCAATGAAGGGGTCG-3′ (forward) and 5’-TGAGGTCAATGAAGGGGTCG-3′ (reverse). The relative quantitation of IAV was calculated using the comparative 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method. GAPDH was used as the inner control.
