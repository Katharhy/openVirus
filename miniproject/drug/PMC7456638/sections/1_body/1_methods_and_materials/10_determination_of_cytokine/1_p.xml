<p id="Par14">Cytokines and chemokines in lung homogenate and BALF samples were measured using commercial assay kits according to the recommended protocols. Interleukin-1 β (IL-1β), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (R&amp;D system, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), chemokine (C–X–C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), chemokine (C–X–C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10), chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 3 (CCL3), and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) were measured using a mouse multi-cytokine/chemokine magnetic bead panel (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and analyzed on a Luminex 100 system (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA). The level of target factors was expressed as pg/mg protein for lung homogenate detection and pg/ml for BALF detection.</p>
