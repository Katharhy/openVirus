<p id="Par6">The murine model of viral pneumonia was constructed by intranasal infection with H1N1 according to previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Briefly, ketamine (50 mg/kg weight) and pentobarbital (30 mg/kg weight) were intraperitoneally injected to induce the mild anesthesia in mice. Next, a 50-μl influenza virus in ice-cooled PBS, containing fifteen 50% mouse lethal challenge doses (MLD50), was infected intranasally. Mice were kept on a 37 °C thermal insulation blanket for 20 min to recover. The day of virus infection was defined as experimental day 1 and 0-days post-infection.
