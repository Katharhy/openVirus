<p id="Par27">The present study successfully constructed the pneumonia murine model using IAV. Olaparib decreased IAV-induced mortality in mice, lung injury, and cytokine production, possibly via modulation of PARP-1/NF-ÎºB axis. This study indicates the non-specific anti-inflammatory effect of olaparib in lung disorders and would shine light on the development for treatment against pneumonia infected by viable IAV subtypes.</p>
