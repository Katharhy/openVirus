<p id="Par51">Lopinavir/ritonavir are protease inhibitors that are approved for HIV-1 infection treatment. Prolongation of PR and QT intervals leading to high-grade AV blocks and rarely torsade de Pointes, are reported side effects. They can decrease serum concentration of the active metabolites of clopidogrel, prasugrel while increasing that of ticagrelor as well as increasing statins levels with risk of rhabdomyolysis. Lopinavir/ritonavir potentiates the effects of factor Xa inhibitors such as apixaban and rivaroxaban through the inhibition of CYP3A4, thereby increasing bleeding risk [

Researchers observed no survival benefit following treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 beyond standard care. Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit [
