<p id="Par50">Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which is the more potent synthetic form of chloroquine, is being used along with azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, for empirical management of COVID-19 based on a small French trial [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Chloroquine can cause atrioventricular (AV) block and, along with azithromycin, prolonged QT interval. Hydroxychloroquine can similarly produce conduction problems in the heart. Additive effects of concomitant use of beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers can induce severe bradycardia leading to cerebral hypoperfusion with syncope [
