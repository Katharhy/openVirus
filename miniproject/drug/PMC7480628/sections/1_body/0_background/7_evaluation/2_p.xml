Less common blood abnormalities may include thrombocytopenia, anemia, abnormal liver and kidney function, elevated creatine kinase and prothrombin time, increased lactate dehydrogenase and D-dimer. Inflammatory markers like serum ferritin and C-reactive protein can be elevated. Patients with cardiac involvement, troponin and brain natriuretic peptide can be elevated also [

Considering patients’ and laboratory safety, physicians should carefully evaluate the necessity of frequent blood sampling and conduct aspiration to prevent the risk of unexpected exposure. Huang C. et al. report a comparison between intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients, that plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL) 2, IL7, IL10, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), interferon (IP)10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α are higher in ICU patients than non-ICU patients [

 <bold>.</bold> These findings suggest that initiation of the immune response results in the production of chemokines and cytokines, which damage normal host lung. New studies are evaluating potential abnormal coagulation cascade in severe COVID-19 cases that may lead to microthrombi in many end organs. In those patients, high D-dimer is associated with poor prognosis and a high mortality rate [

In contrast to what was believed, the current recommendation of many learned societies and professional radiological associations is that imaging should not be employed as a screening/diagnostic tool for COVID-19, but reserved for the evaluation of complications [

According to a Fleischner Society consensus statement published on 7 April 2020: Imaging is not indicated in patients with suspected COVID-19 and mild clinical features unless they are at risk for disease progression. Imaging is indicated in a patient with COVID-19 and worsening respiratory status. In a resource-constrained environment, imaging is indicated for medical triage of patients with suspected COVID-19 who present with moderate-severe clinical features and a high pretest probability of disease [
