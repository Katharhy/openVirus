<p id="Par44">Myocardial damage caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 undoubtedly increases the difficulty and complexity of patient treatment. The reported common Cardiac complications of COVID-19 include; new or worsening heart failure (due to cardiomyopathy or right-sided heart failure caused by pulmonary hypertension), myocarditis, and arrhythmia. Myocardial injury associated with the SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 5 of the first 41 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Wuhan, which mainly manifested as an increase in hs-cTnI levels (&gt; 28 pg/ml)
 <sup>4</sup> In this study, four of five patients with myocardial injury were admitted to the intensive-care unit (ICU), which indicates the serious nature of the myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19. Blood pressure levels were significantly higher in patients treated in the ICU than in those not treated in the ICU [
