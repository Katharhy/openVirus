<p id="Par43">Detection of viral RNA using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is used to confirm the clinical diagnosis. For the most sensitive detection of 2019-nCoV, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens have the highest positive detection rate of 93%, followed by sputum 72%, and nasal swabs detection rate is 63%. Both fecal and blood specimens have positive rates in only 29 and 1% of diseased patients. Regardless the high detection rates in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommends collecting only the upper respiratory nasopharyngeal swab to decrease the risk of aerosol droplets exposure to healthcare workers [
