<p id="Par22">Many literature reported the clinical features, virology, pathophysiology, epidemiology, and radiology of COVID-19, but the comprehensive review is few. And although COVID-19 is predominantly a respiratory disease, some patients develop severe cardiovascular disease [

The purpose of this review is to summarize the current literature on COVID-19 disease, including pathogen, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment based on the current evidence, with emphasis on understanding the mechanisms of cardiac involvement, cardiac complications, so that treatment of these patients can be timely and effective and mortality reduced.
