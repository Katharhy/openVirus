The purpose of this review is primarily reviewing the COVID-19 disease, including pathogen, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment with particular attention to cardiovascular involvement based on the current evidence. COVID-19 remains a threat to global public health. The associated extra-pulmonary manifestations and their prolonged consequences are frequently overlooked. Pre-existing cardiovascular disease or acute cardiac complications may contribute to adverse early clinical outcome.

They can decrease serum concentration of the active metabolites of clopidogrel, prasugrel while increasing that of ticagrelor as well as increasing statins levels with risk of rhabdomyolysis. Lopinavir/ritonavir potentiates the effects of factor Xa inhibitors such as apixaban and rivaroxaban through the inhibition of CYP3A4, thereby increasing bleeding risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Cao B, et al. conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed severe COVID-19 disease. Researchers observed no survival benefit following treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 beyond standard care. Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">Remdesivir is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analogue that inhibits viral RNA synthesis with a broad antiviral spectrum including filoviruses, paramyxoviruses, pneumoviruses, and coronaviruses. There is limited information on adverse effects. However, hypokalemia is a common reported side effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and there was a patient who developed hypotension and bradycardia when this medication was used to treat Ebola [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The safety and efficacy of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated in multiple ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials. In a recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial at ten hospitals in Hubei, China, conducted on adult patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19 disease, remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits. However, the numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement in those treated earlier requires confirmation in larger studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">Tocilizumab an anti-IL-6R antibody is known for its potential efficacy in reducing inflammatory response including the cytokine storm contributing to ARDS and even death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

COVID-19, primarily a respiratory disease, is a rapidly evolving pandemic with uncertain pathogenesis and clinical characteristics. But the associated extra-pulmonary manifestations and their prolonged consequences are frequently overlooked. Pre-existing cardiovascular disease or acute cardiac complications may contribute to adverse early clinical outcome. At the moment, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19, but multiple RCT are being conducted. New supportive therapies are being evaluated with promising results.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>SARS-CoV</term><def><p id="Par2">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COVID-19</term><def><p id="Par3">Coronavirus disease-19</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p id="Par4">Randomized controlled trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MERS</term><def><p id="Par5">Middle East respiratory syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p id="Par6">World Health Organization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RO</term><def><p id="Par7">Reproductive number</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ACE</term><def><p id="Par8">Angiotensin converting enzyme</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CVD</term><def><p id="Par9">Cardiovascular disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICU</term><def><p id="Par10">Intensive care unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MR</term><def><p id="Par11">Mortality rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL</term><def><p id="Par12">Interleukin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GCSF</term><def><p id="Par13">Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IP</term><def><p id="Par14">Interferon</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TNF</term><def><p id="Par15">Tumor necrosis factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>rRT-PCR</term><def><p id="Par16">Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSAIDs</term><def><p id="Par17">Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ARDS</term><def><p id="Par18">Acute respiratory distress syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SIC</term><def><p id="Par19">Sepsis-induced coagulopathy</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>The authors co-edited the manuscript.
