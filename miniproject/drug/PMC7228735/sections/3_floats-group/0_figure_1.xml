  <p>Typical clinical course, viral PCR, and antiviral antibody detection and infectivity of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection</p>
  <p>The transparent red box shows the suggested window for tracheostomy, on ICU days 10–21, which corresponds with 16–30 days from symptom onset. The solid bars and curves represent the proportion of all cases. Time zero is symptom onset (the x-axis is not to scale). Timeline data are from authors' local data and published case series.
