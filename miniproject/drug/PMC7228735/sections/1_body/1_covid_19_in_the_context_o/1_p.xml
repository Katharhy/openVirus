<p id="para280">In response to the threat of Avian influenza, caused by the influenza A H5N1 virus, in 2005, a great deal of pandemic preparedness planning began, with a view not only to treating patients, but also to mitigating the spread of a lethal and easily transmitted respiratory infection. Some of these methods would only be required in worst-case scenarios, such as that seen during the influenza pandemic of 1918–19, because they are socially and economically disruptive. The hypothesis behind community mitigation has now become popularly known as “flattening the curve”.

 </xref> By delaying the peak of the epidemic, less strain is put on health-care capacity, and the burden on hospitals and infrastructure is reduced. In turn, the overall case numbers and health impacts might be reduced, allowing more time for the development of better medical therapies and preventive vaccines. An evaluation of these strategies in the context of the 1918–19 influenza pandemic indicated that cities that acted early had much lower morbidity and mortality than those that did not.
