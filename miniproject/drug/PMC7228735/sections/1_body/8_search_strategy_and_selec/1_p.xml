  <p id="para580">We searched PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and the internet (Google and Google Scholar from a UK-based connection), including grey literature, for papers published between Jan 1, and April 4, 2020, with no language restriction, using combinations of the search terms “coronavirus”, “COVID-19”, “tracheostomy”, and “tracheotomy”. Sources identified included statements and guidance retrieved from websites of hospitals or recognised national societies identified by the search strategy, or known by the authors, many of whom were either involved in or aware of the development of national, local, or specialty-specific guidance. When several overlapping data sources were retrieved, we prioritised selection of sources representing national groups, or the larger case series. The final reference list was generated on the basis of relevance to the topics covered in this Health-care Development paper, with the aim of providing a contemporaneous review of emerging data on COVID-19 with direct relevance to the planning, conduct, and subsequent management of tracheostomy during the pandemic.</p>
