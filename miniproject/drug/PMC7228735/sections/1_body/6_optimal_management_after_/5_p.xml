<p id="para530">Humidification and disposable inner cannulae are common strategies to safeguard against tube occlusion from respiratory secretions and reduce suctioning requirements.

 </xref> If an inner cannula is used, we suggest reducing the frequency of changing, and reviewing the situation daily. We recommend a simple heat and moisture exchange (HME) filter, which provides adequate humidification and does not generate aerosols.

 </xref> Active water-based humidification might be required if secretions are thick, but their use should be assessed on an individual basis. Nebulisers can improve secretion clearance but require additional handling of ventilator circuits and can waterlog HME filters; they should therefore be used only after careful consideration.
