<p id="para520">Tracheostomy to facilitate an extended period of ventilation support or weaning from ventilation initially requires a closed system to deliver pressure to the lungs. Strategies to minimise ventilator circuit disconnection and aerosol risks to staff include use of a cuffed non-fenestrated tube, use of in-line suction, and avoidance of unnecessary airway interventions.

 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Cuffs should remain initially inflated and pressures checked every 12 h, maintained at 20â€“30 cm H
 <sub>2</sub>O (or above ventilator peak inflation pressures). Water-filled cuffed tubes should be avoided and few leak tests should be done (to prevent aerosolisation) unless staff are wearing full PPE.
