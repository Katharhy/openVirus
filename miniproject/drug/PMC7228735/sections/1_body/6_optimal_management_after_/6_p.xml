<p id="para540">Weaning from mechanical ventilation is generally managed through gradual reductions in pressure support, periods of cuff deflation, use of vocalisation strategies, promotion of coughing, and rehabilitation of swallowing. Many of these activities involve the generation of aerosols, including ventilator-adjusted leak speech, above-cuff vocalisation strategies, and the use of one-way valves.

 </xref> The aerosol-generating potential of a patient with a tracheostomy and deflated cuff who is receiving positive-pressure ventilator support is probably similar to that of a patient receiving continuous positive airway pressure via non-invasive ventilation, although different ventilators generate different maximal flows.

 </xref> We suggest the use of face masks and tracheostomy shields to mitigate the risks from aerosols. An excessively cautious approach might disadvantage patients, slowing their recovery and limiting their ability to communicate. Creative methods of augmentative and alternative communication must be implemented to reduce potential feelings of isolation among patients and increase safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.

 </xref> Patients who are infectious and clinically ready to commence cuff deflation trials should be managed in locations dedicated to treatment of patients with COVID-19 by experienced staff who are protected with the appropriate PPE. Swallowing assessments should rely on clinical skills rather than the use of instrumental swallowing examinations. Decannulation should be considered as soon as safely possible, and managed by a multidisciplinary tracheostomy team.
