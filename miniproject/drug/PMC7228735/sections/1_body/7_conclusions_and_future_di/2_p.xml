<p id="para560">Many questions remain unanswered, and prospective data are needed to answer pressing questions around tracheostomy in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data on infectivity and persistence of viral RNA in patients who are critically ill are sparse, particularly at timepoints beyond 20 days after symptom onset, when tracheostomy is typically considered. The predictive value of peak viral load and antibody response for gauging infectivity and transmission risks associated with different strategies for tracheostomy insertion require further study. The experiences of European countries show that preparedness is a powerful determinant of patient outcomes. Delayed intubation and lack of ventilator availability contribute to poor outcomes. Robust data collection, analysis, and benchmarking are essential, such as the approach taken by the
