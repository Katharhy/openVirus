<p id="para320">The consensus working group recommendations in this Health-care Development paper are expert opinions (denoted by “we suggest” throughout the paper) informed by the best available evidence, or published supporting statements (denoted by “we recommend”). We used an iterative approach, adapted from the Delphi method, to prioritise topics for inclusion and to reach consensus on recommendations. The first round consisted of a core writing group (BAM, MJB, SJW, VP, AA, NT, and DJF-K) that drafted distinct statements as part of the paper, making recommendations on case selection, timing, performance of tracheostomy, and management after tracheostomy, on the basis of the primary data sources retrieved. These recommendations were circulated among all consensus working group members, inviting both opinion and any additional recommendations. The second round involved circulating all new recommendations received, along with those recommendations from the first round that had received favourable comment from the majority (over half) of the respondents (

A final review of the recommendations was made during a videoconference, which included 29 of the group members, followed by electronic correspondence and telephone discussions, facilitating iterative review and refinement over three rounds to achieve consensus agreement for the content of this paper.
