 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 4â€“7</xref>). We did a literature and internet search to identify and extract data from primary sources, and gathered first-hand accounts of tracheostomy during the current pandemic from discussion among working group members. We gathered additional information by dissemination of targeted questions and data collection forms, and a Qualtrics-XM survey (SAP Walldorf, Germany) that allowed for ranking, scoring, and free-text response completed by members of the consensus working group (the survey is registered with the Institutional Review Board in compliance with University of Michigan institutional policy [HUM00182021]).
