<p id="para400">Although delaying tracheostomy for patients with COVID-19 might reduce risks for staff, extended duration of translaryngeal intubation, sedation, mechanical ventilation, and ICU stay associated with such delays can lead to complications. We suggest that decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic reflect the range of applicable considerations (

Patient selection for attempted primary extubation should be based on established practice—ie, in those with improving cardiovascular and respiratory physiological parameters, reducing markers of infection and inflammation, and a successful spontaneous breathing trial.
