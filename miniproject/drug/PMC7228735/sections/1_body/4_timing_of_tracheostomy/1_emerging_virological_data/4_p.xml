 </xref> Pharyngeal viral RNA peaked during the first week of symptoms, reaching 7 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> copies per throat swab on day 4, persisting beyond the duration of symptoms. By cell culture, infectious viruses were present in samples from the throat and lungs, but not from stool (despite high viral RNA concentrations in faeces); infectious virus was never detected in blood or urine. Serum antibodies were detected after 7 days in half of cases, and in all individuals by day 14. All individuals had mild disease courses. The authors of this study predicted little residual risk of infectivity beyond 10 days after symptom onset, when the patient had less than 100 000 viral RNA copies per mL of sputum.
