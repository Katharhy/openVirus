<p id="para350">The median time from SARS-CoV-2 exposure to onset of symptoms (incubation period) is approximately 5 days (range 4–14).
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> SARS-CoV-2 is normally most abundant around the time of symptom onset, as determined by PCR of viral RNA from mucosal samples from the upper respiratory tract. After symptom onset, viral load typically decreases over the following 3–4 days.

 </xref> In most patients, samples from the lower respiratory tract remained PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 after samples from the upper respiratory tract had become negative, for up to 39 days.

 </xref> In patients with severe disease, the viral RNA load is significantly higher and decreases more slowly than in those with mild disease.
