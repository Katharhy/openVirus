<p id="para340">A systematic review comparing health-care workers who did an aerosol-generating procedure with those who did not during the 2003 SARS outbreak found an increased risk of contracting SARS in those who did a tracheal intubation (odds ratio 6·6 [95% CI 2·3–18·9]) and tracheostomy (4·2 [1·5–11·5]), and those who put patients on non-invasive ventilation (3·1 [1·4–6·8]) and manual ventilation before intubation (2·8 [1·3–6·4]).
