 </xref> The presence of antibody inhibits the infectivity of detectable virus. The presence of viral RNA detected by PCR (so-called viral shedding), does not necessarily indicate infectivity, especially in the presence of antiviral antibodies. True infectivity can only be assessed by viral culture in cells in vitro, or be inferred from clinical or epidemiological data.
