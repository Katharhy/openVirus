<p id="para450">The tracheostomy technique is determined by local expertise and resources. We suggest that operators continue to do tracheostomies using the techniques and equipment with which they are familiar, and confident and experienced in using. Strategies to minimise aerosol generation are well documented.

 </xref> Percutaneous tracheostomy usually involves opening the ventilator circuit more frequently than does surgical tracheostomy, and although ultrasound and bronchoscopy guidance might improve safety, the likelihood of aerosol generation is increased with percutaneous tracheostomy compared with surgical approaches. Surgical tracheostomies were generally favoured over percutaneous tracheostomies during the SARS outbreak;

 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> however, percutaneous techniques have subsequently advanced and no data are available to establish superiority of one approach over the other from the standpoint of infectious transmission or safety. Single-use bronchoscopes with a sealed ventilator circuit are preferable when doing percutaneous tracheostomies.
