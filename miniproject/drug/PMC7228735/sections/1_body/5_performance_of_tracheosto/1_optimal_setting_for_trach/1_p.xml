<p id="para430">A variety of logistical and practical considerations influence the optimal location for a tracheostomy procedure in patients who are critically ill, including operator training and expertise; hospital infrastructure, including provision of side rooms and negative pressure air flows; availability of staff and equipment; and the ability to transfer a patient who is critically ill to another setting.

 </xref> Tracheostomy can be done in the ICU (often with suboptimal equipment and lighting, restricted availability of assistants, and suboptimal positioning on wide ICU beds) or in the operating room (requiring transfer from the ICU, exposure risks to multiple staff, and associated logistics). Percutaneous, surgical, or hybrid approaches can be used in either location. Because tracheostomy is an aerosol-generating procedure,

We suggest that ICU and surgical teams review the optimal location for tracheostomy insertion during the pandemic, balancing the risks to patients and staff and appraising local facilities and expertise.
