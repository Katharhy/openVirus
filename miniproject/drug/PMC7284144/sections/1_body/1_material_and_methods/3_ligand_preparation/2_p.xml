<p>The 2 D structures of marine compounds (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) from PubChem converted to 3 D structure 
 <italic>via</italic> the Ligprep module in MOE. The protonation and ionization states of the compounds were corrected, and proper bond orders were assigned. Afterward, the tautomeric and ionization states were created for each ligand.
