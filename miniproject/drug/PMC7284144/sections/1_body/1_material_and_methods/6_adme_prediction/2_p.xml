<p>To analyze the pharmacodynamics of the marine compounds, Adsorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) is important which could be used as a drug. SWISS-ADME (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.swissadme.ch" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.swissadme.ch</ext-link>) allows the user to include SMILES data from PubChem and provides lipophilicity, water solubility, and drug likeness rules. SMILES files of all the marine compounds retrieved from the PubChem was entered into the search bar and the results were analyzed.
