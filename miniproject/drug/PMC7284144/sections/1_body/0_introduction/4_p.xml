<p>Unfortunately, the timeline for characterizing a typical drug discovery process badly couples with the urgency of finding a therapy. It is important to accelerate the early stages of the drug discovery for all possible future emergencies (Mani et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The early extraction of the COVID-19 genome to highlight sequence identity (∼80% of conserved nucleotides) with respect to the original SARS-CoV (Gralinski &amp; Menachery, 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) has paved the way for rapid research.
