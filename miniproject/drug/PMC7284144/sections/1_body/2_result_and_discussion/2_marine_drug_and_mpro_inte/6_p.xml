 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">3</xref>). Residues Thr24, Leu27, His41, Phe140, Cys145, His163, Met165, Pro168, and His172 are present in the active site and its surrounding (Wu etÂ al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The drug C1 shows good binding affinity, forming many hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions. Compound C2 also exhibited interactions with active site of M
 <sup>pro</sup>, creating a catalytic dyad, consist of Cys145 and His41, where the cysteine is a nucleophile in the proteolytic process (
