<p>In addition to hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions are also important. The hydrogen bonds may play as an ‘anchoring’ role, defining the spatial location of the druggable compounds in the binding pocket, facilitating the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. In rational drug design, it is equally essential to recognize the hydrophobic groups of the compound and receptor, facing to each other upon binding. These interactions have been detected while analyzing the Connolly surface (Connolly, 1993) of the complex of SARS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> and marine compounds. It is the steric complementarity between the ligand and receptor site that performs the role of the principal driving force for mechanical interlocking (Chou et al.,
