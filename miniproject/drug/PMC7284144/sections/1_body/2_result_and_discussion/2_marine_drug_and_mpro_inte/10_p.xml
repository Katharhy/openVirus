<p>RMSD and RMSF are calculated in MD simulations to infer the stability and flexibility, a fundamental property of biomolecules. High deviation and fluctuation of proteins during a simulation may show weak stability and stability in thermodynamics (Chen &amp; Shen, 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> in complexed with C1 exhibited a stable RMSD between 0.2 and 0.45 nm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref>) and the initial and final RMSDs during the whole simulation period were not found in the significance difference (0.2 and 0.3 nm). This shows a stable binding of C1 with M
 <sup>pro</sup> that might be a useful as a good inhibitor. Moreover, residues fluctuations were also observed, not too flexible in motion (0.05–0.36 nm). Both, RMSD and RMSF stabilities are essential to infer good binding affinities (Doniach &amp; Eastman,
