<p>In conclusion, marine natural product is the most diverse group, containing potential inhibitors against RNA viruses. Among marine natural products, C1 forming many interactions with Thr24, Leu27, His41, Phe140, Cys145, His163, Met165, Pro168, and His172, present in the active site and its surrounding. These compounds have been observed as best fitting in the binding pocket, that might be good inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> for better management of COVID-19.
