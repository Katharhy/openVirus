 <sup>pro</sup> (3CLpro) monomer has three domains: domain I, domain II, and domain III containing residues 8–101, residues 102–184, and residues 201–303 respectively, and a long loop (residues 185–200) connects domains III and II (Wu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The active site (Cys145 and His41) is located in the gap between domains I and II, while hydrophobic amino acids, T24, L27, H41, F140, C145, H163, M165, P168, and H172 also form a hydrophobic surrounding in the pocket (Yang et al., 2003). The identification of compounds fitting in the pockets is one of the fundamental step in structure-based drug design. The recent progress and developments of the computational analysis of pockets have been found useful to screen potent inhibitors (Zheng et al.,

 <sup>pro</sup> complex with C1 shows many hydrogen and hydrophobic interaction (

 <sup>pro</sup> from all sides, showing its best fitting in the pocket. Drug interactions and fitting in the pocket is essential for drug designing and lead optimization. it It is also important to identify the locations of binding sites to infer protein–ligand binding or protein–protein interaction.
