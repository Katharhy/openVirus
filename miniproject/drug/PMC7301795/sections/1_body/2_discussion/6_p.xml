<p id="par0055">The epidemiological situation in Italy in February 2020 and the recommendations in use at that time allowed a timely identification of our patient with a prompt hospitalization and subsequent diagnostic investigations. Therefore, the early antiviral treatments of both influenza and SARS-CoV-2, together with a brief steroid course and oxygen supplementation, had an impact on the patient’s outcome avoiding the progressive worsening and the evolution towards the severe ARDS phase. In conclusion, even in epidemic setting, the early and prompt identification of concurrent respiratory pathogens is important in order to improve etiological diagnosis, preventive measures and patients’ clinical management and outcome. Further studies are needed to better understand the pathogenic role of viral coinfections in respiratory diseases.</p>
