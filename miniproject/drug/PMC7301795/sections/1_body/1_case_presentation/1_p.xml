<p id="par0025">A 56 year-old male general surgeon was admitted to the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome, Italy, on March 6, 2020. He was a smoker, within the overweight range (29-body mass index), with a history of two episodes of acute myocardial infarction treated with coronary angioplasty and stenting, For 4 days, he had been complaining of fever, diarrhea and asthenia after winter ski week in Northern Italy. Two days after the onset of symptoms, a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 (genes E and S) and Influenza A. On March 6, a chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed bilateral and multiples peripheral ground glass opacities. Blood tests showed lymphopenia (lymphocyte and monocyte cell count: 0.67 and 0.09 Ã— 109/L respectively), C- reactive protein and serum fibrinogen levels were increased (43.3 g/L and 7980 g/L respectively). An arterial oxygen tension (PaO2)/fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) P/F Ratio was 320. Oral oseltamivir (75 mg twice per day for 5 days) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice per days for 14 days) were started together with antibiotic therapy (intravenous ceftriaxone 2 gr and oral azithromycin 500 mg per day) and intravenous methylprednisolone (40 mg twice daily for 5 days with tapered discontinuation). On day eight of hospitalization, he developed respiratory failure (P/F Ratio dropped to 202) and a second chest CT scan showed a worsening of the bilateral ground-glass opacities with fibrotic consolidation in both lower pulmonary lobes (

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and non-invasive ventilation through continuous positive airway pressure (C-PAP) mask was started with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 7.5 mmHg and FiO2 40%. After three days, he was re-admitted to the High Isolation Unit and discharged in good clinical conditions with persistently negative nasopharyngeal swabs. A SARS-CoV-2 serology by an in house indirect immunofluorescence assay (IgA 1:1280, IgM 1:320 and IgG 1:80) was positive (
