<p id="Par17">The availability of the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) test like the Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) has revolutionised the diagnosis of influenza. These are highly sensitive and specific and are regarded as the gold standard assays. Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification-Based Assay (LAMP) based approach have also demonstrated a very high sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 100% when compared to RT-PCR assays [
