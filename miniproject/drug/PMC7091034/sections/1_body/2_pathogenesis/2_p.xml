<p id="Par10">The HA attachment results in endocytosis of the virion and fusion with the endoplasmic membrane which in turn activates the matrix protein 2 (M2) ion channel. M2 facilitates the virion entry into the host nucleus for replication. The Influenza A viruses carry 8 negative sense RNA segments. These negative sense RNAs therefore require RNA polymerase carried with the virus into the cell to be copied onto the template. Viral replication includes the stages of assembly, budding and scission. NA helps to release these newly formed virions which are either expelled through the tract by droplet secretions or infect other cells. In this manner the virus spreads from cell to cell. The immune response of the hostâ€™s body to clear the virus can result in cell apoptosis. In severe cases necrosis of the alveolar epithelium can occur which clinically leads to acute respiratory distress. Either or both the impaired viral clearance and exaggerated host immune response can account for the severity of the illness [
