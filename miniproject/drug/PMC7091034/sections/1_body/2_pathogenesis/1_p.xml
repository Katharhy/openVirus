<p id="Par9">HA binds to the sialic acid residues expressed on the columnar epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and the alveolar type II cells. It is important to note that Avian influenza viruses preferentially bind to sialic acids 
 <italic>via</italic> alpha 2,3 linkages present on alveolar type II cells and ocular epithelium [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] while human influenza viruses bind to 2,6 linked sialic acids present in the upper respiratory tract epithelium. Due to localisation of the human influenza virus mainly to the upper respiratory tract, there is greater risk of transmission of human influenza viruses than Avian flu [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However strains that are able to infect the lower respiratory tract cause more inflammation and severe complications. For 
 <italic>example</italic>, H1N1 pandemic flu of 1918 was both highly transmissible as well as virulent, while the 2009 H1N1 was highly transmissible but had moderate virulence. As opposed, H5N1 and H7N9 have low transmissibility but high virulence [
