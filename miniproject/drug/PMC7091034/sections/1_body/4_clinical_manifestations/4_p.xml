<p id="Par15">It has been estimated that 3–5% of children suffer from influenza associated acute otitis media annually. Co-infection with bacteria increases the severity of the infection. Influenza associated myositis presents with severe bilateral myaligia in the lower limbs and reluctance to walk for about 2–3 d. The most common muscles affected are the gastrocnemius and soleus. In these children the creatinine phosphokinase can be high, myoglobinuria can also occur. Rarely rhabdomyolysis has been reported [

Influenza associated encephalopathy can occur due to direct infection of the central nervous system through viremia and presents as sudden onset of fever with convulsions and rapid progression into coma and can cause severe neurological deficits in survivors. Imaging may reveal bilateral thalamic necrosis and brainstem involvement. Fulminant myocarditis is a rare complication presenting with arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock. Hematological picture can vary from mild to severe leucopenia, thrombocytopenia including a serious complication of hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (HLH).
