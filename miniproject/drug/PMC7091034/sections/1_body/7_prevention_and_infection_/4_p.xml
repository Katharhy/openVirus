<p id="Par30">Annual influenza vaccination of health care workers is critical for protection and infection control. Cough and sneezing etiquettes and hand hygiene are important for control of influenza infection both in the community and the health care settings. Health education through local media or posters displayed at health care settings can help as reminders. Since influenza primarily spreads by large particle droplet transmission, about 6Â ft space surrounding the patient is considered infectious. All the body fluids of the patient are also considered infectious as indirect transmission through contact can also occur. In health care settings, patients can be cohorted or should stay in individual rooms. Droplet precautions and hand hygiene should be performed by attending health care workers and attendants. Gloves and gowns are required for personal protection if there is potential exposure to infected body fluids. Aerosol producing procedures should be minimized, ideally conducted in negative pressure rooms and protection with N95 mask is needed by the health care personnel conducting such procedures.</p>
