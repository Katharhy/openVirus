<p id="Par27">Annual vaccination against influenza remains the primary mode of prevention against influenza. The vaccines are effective only if there is antigenic matching of the vaccine strains with the circulating virus strains. After the matching is performed by the GISRS, the majority of commercially available vaccines are manufactured by propagation in embryonated chicken eggs. It takes at least 6–8 mo for production of these vaccines. Moreover, the flu seasons are different in both hemispheres 
 <italic>i.e</italic>., October–May in the northern hemisphere and May–October in the southern hemisphere. Therefore the matching process is completed twice a year, once each for the two hemispheres. Indian surveillance data suggest that, based on the geographical diversity of transmission dynamics, cities above 30° latitude (Srinagar) and those with late monsoon season (Chennai and Vellore) should have winter vaccination strategies, while rest of the country in May–June [
