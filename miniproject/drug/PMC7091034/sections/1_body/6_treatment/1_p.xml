<p id="Par22">The neuroaminase inhibitors like Oseltamivir and Zanamivir are the mainstay for treatment and help to inhibit the neuraminase which plays a critical role for cleavage of virion from infected cells and its spread to other host cells. Presently Oseltamivir is recommended as the first-line for treatment of influenza in children. It is less efficacious in treatment of Influenza B than A. The indications for initiating treatment are in those children with suspected influenza with high risk of complications or with severe illness requiring hospitalization. The dosage recommended are based on weight: 30 mg twice a day in less than 15 kg, 45 mg twice a day between 15 and 23 kg, 60 mg twice a day between 24 and 40 kg and 75 mg twice a day above 40 kg and in adults. In infants the recommended dose is 3 mg/kg twice a day while once a day dose is recommended in neonates less than 2 wk. The drug is best administered with food to reduce its gastrointestinal side-effects, commonest being vomiting. Dose modification is required in those with renal insufficiency. The treatment duration is five days, but longer duration can be given based on the clinical response. Such patients requiring longer duration of drug should be evaluated for antiviral resistance. Resistance should also be suspected in contacts of patients with Oseltamivir resistance who develop infection.</p>
