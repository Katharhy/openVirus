<p>The first recorded use of medical masks comes from a Polish surgeon Jan Mikulicz Radecki in 1897 with his assistant publishing the following year how the masks could reduce the spread of droplets from the user’s mouth [

By the 1930s, specific requirements were created for masks; 1) to be low cost and washable, 2) to be comfortable and cover the mouth and nose, and not to cause fogging of glasses and 3) they should not allow the transfer of organisms across the material. During this time, deflector style masks began development using different styles of material placed between gauze to enhance the mask [
