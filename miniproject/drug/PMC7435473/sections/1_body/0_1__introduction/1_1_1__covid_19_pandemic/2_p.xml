<p>Respiratory droplets and aerosols (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-03363-f001">Figure 1</xref>) are the main method of infection of COVID-19 with asymptomatic individuals capable of transmitting the virus unknowingly whilst breathing or speaking [
 <xref rid="B9-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The size of these droplets alters the method of infection, large droplets (&gt;20 µm) will fall onto objects easier than smaller droplets due to gravity while small droplets (&lt;5–10 µm) will evaporate midair allowing for airborne transmission [
 <xref rid="B12-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Droplets of 1 µm in size were reported to be capable of staying airborne for more than 12 h with strong coughs or sneezes capable of sending these particles over 20 feet [

A study found that 40% and 30% of aerosols and respiratory droplets from individuals with coronavirus tested positive for coronavirus respectively when the subjects were not using a mask. When the individual wore a face mask, however, they were unable to detect any coronavirus in either the aerosol or the droplets [
 <xref rid="B13-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This would indicate that the use of a face mask can help prevent the spread of the virus from infected individuals.
