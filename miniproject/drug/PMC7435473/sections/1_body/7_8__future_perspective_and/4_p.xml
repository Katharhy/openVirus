<p>Commonly used sterile surgical masks help in reducing via transmission by limiting airborne particles or body fluid droplets from sneezing or coughing. However, in the case of a pandemic situation, it is hard to differentiate the affected patients from others. To tackle this problem, they modified disposable surgical face masks with a temperature sensing material [
 <xref rid="B129-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. They patented the modification of surgical masks to detect infectious patients from non-infected using thermochromatic materials. Eisenbrey et al. used temperature-sensitive dyes in masks, which can change colour at 32–33 °C, even for a 1 °C change in temperature. Thus, by the colour change of the thermochromatic material, infected patients can be sorted from the public space. Additionally, adding multiple thermochromic dyes could be used to check the severity of temperature.
