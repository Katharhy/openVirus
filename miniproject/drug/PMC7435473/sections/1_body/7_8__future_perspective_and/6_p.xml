In daily life scenarios, messages to encourage wearing face masks in public by asymptomatic individuals have earlier raised resistance. The main reason for this reluctance of the public regarding universal mask-wearing is due to inadequate supply of masks to meet public demand. Another concern is either that people do not wear masks properly, or the possibility that they would become careless in maintaining other infection control measures if they were wearing masks. It is essential to maintain the supply-demand as well as to ensure that the pubic adhere to infection control measures using PPE effectively. Industry 4.0 technologies like Artificial intelligence (AI), 3D printing, Holography, and Virtual reality are being used to tackle this problem.
