<p>Wang et al. successfully synthesised a novel multifunctional material with rechargeable antibacterial efficiency and renewable filtering performance to use in the fabrication of respirators [
 <xref rid="B130-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. N-halmine structures were spun on PA nanofibrous membrane (NFM) using the electrospinning technique. The biocidal properties of the NFMs were induced by directly exposing the membrane into free chlorine media (sodium hypochlorite solution). The Nâ€“Cl bond formed during exposure will act as an oxidising agent during the contact with the pathogens, leading to the disinfection of materials. This property can be retained again by the exposure of materials to the chlorine solution. Even the 3D structure of the membrane stayed intact after multiple washes. The initial filtration efficiency value of 99.999% was achieved, which is far higher than the required efficiency of N100 face masks (&gt;99.97%). The antibacterial PA-6 NFM could maintain the N100 level even after 10 h. This gives a practical point to use these materials to fabricate face masks or respirators, where rechargeable biocidal property is essential.
