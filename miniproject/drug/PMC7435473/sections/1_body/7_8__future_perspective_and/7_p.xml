Designing and development of any medical part are done using advance designing software and digital manufacturing technologies like 3D printing. This provides a smart continuous supply chain of medical disposables and equipment during this crisis [
 <xref rid="B132-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. Swenn et al. developed a prototype of a reusable custom made three-dimensionally (3D) printed face mask that can be adopted and used globally. This prototype is created based on individual facial scanning, 3D modelling, and 3D printing [
 <xref rid="B133-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. Two components were printed: head fixation band and filter membrane, using polypropylene and polyamide composite as material. These masks are securely fitting around the mouth and nose and are also easy to disinfect for reuse. However, there was dermatological issue consideration of these masks as they made lesions in the nasal bridge after prolonged application.
