<p>Prolonged wearing of N95/N99 masks acts as a cause of contamination as bacteria or viruses are accumulated during the exposure. To solve the problem, Andrey et al. proposed a modification of the N95/N99 mask to provide additional filtration of air and to deactivate the pathogens using low- temperature plasma [

The low-temperature plasma layer is formed by dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) and its controlled by a switch, which is sensitive to the direction of airflow. Thus, it will discharge during the expiration, and disables it during the inspiration. Whereas, the dielectric layer helps in maintaining the gap and blocking the ultraviolet radiation of discharge for mask wearers. The active oxidising agents formed in plasma (O

 <sub>2</sub>O

Additionally, the microparticles from the air stream are removed by electrostatic precipitation. These modifications help to increase the service life and the effectiveness of the standard medical masks and to enhance the degree of protection for medical personnel.
