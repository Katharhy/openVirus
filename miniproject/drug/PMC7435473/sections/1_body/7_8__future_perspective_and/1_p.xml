<p>Research communities around the globe are making several efforts to contain and reduce the impact of COVID-19. Unlike the previous epidemics such as SARS and MERS, now the technologies are equipped to control this infection. This growth was seen by the quick actions like identifying the pathogen, rapid development of detection test kits, enhanced research for vaccines or drugs and introducing health care policies in a very short period [

However, these steps will not reduce the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus unless the air borne transmission of the virus is prevented. Use of PPEs is the basic and effective method to use to prevent the transmission. Studies have reported that the virus can remain viable and infectious for hours in aerosols and days depending upon the surfaces [

The asymptomatic behaviour of infected patients makes it worse to handle this problem. The spreading as well as inhaling of the respiratory droplets, can be drastically reduced by using face masks [
