Virtual reality and holograms are being used to create virtual clinics through the application of telemedicine consultations, which will help in reducing public crowding, thus delaying the virus spread. Using these technologies, the community can continuously monitor, collect data, and communicate with each other to develop and manufacture a vaccine, detection kits, healthcare equipment and decide on necessary actions with low human physical participation [
