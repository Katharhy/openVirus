<p>Several studies have been conducted to theoretically explain the process of filtration through electrostatic attraction and impaction by the fibrous medium [

 <xref rid="B54-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. An early study concluded that electret filters (non-woven fibres) hold high filtration efficiency with low air resistance and large dust holding capacity when compared to conventional fibrous filters [

The filtration works based on electrostatic forces of attraction between the masks matrix and the aerosol particles and depends on the dielectric property of the material. Hence, polymeric materials with high electrical resistance and stability, such as polypropylene (PP), polyethylene, polyacrylonitrile (PAN), etc., are the best choices for masks and respirators [
