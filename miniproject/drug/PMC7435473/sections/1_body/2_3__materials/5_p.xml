<p>There are three major layers in a mask which include i) spun-bond PP fabric, ii) interlayer with melt-blown PP and iii) external layer with spun bond PP fabric similar to layer (i). The middle layer comprises small voids compared to the other two layers and it acts as the filter, stopping the harmful particles from entering the body. A recent study compared three masks with different filtration efficiency, porosity and air flow resistance, Mask A with one filter screen, Mask B with two filters and a washable cloth Mask C [

Mask A possessed large voids, leading to reduced filtration efficiency whereas Mask C had the highest airflow resistance, leading to breathing difficulties (
