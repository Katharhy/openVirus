<p>The most studied materials in fabricating masks include non-woven fibrous substances such as polypropylene, glass papers, woolen felt. These materials have been used in manufacturing personal protection equipment (PPE) since the beginning of the 20th century. These materials have proven to be capable of withstanding high temperatures during autoclaving without any changes in the structure. Masks are fabricated via melt blowing technique, during which the charges are imparted to the material creating a quasi-permanent electric field providing an adequate filtration of particulate matters (PM) by electrostatic force. The filtration efficiency of the membrane depends upon the structure (pore size, fibre organisation), a charge of the fibres, fibre thickness and diameter, packing density, etc., of the material. It has been concluded that fibres with small diameter and a large surface area that forms small voids when compared to long fibres, leads to increased filtering efficiency.</p>
