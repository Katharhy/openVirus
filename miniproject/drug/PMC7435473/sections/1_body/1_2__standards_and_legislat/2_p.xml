<p>However, surgical masks are less effective when compared to respirators. Respirators comprise of tight-fitting protective devices or air purifiers that can prevent very small particles (&lt;5 µm) from passing through a person’s respiratory tract. This is achieved either by removing the contaminants or by providing an independent source of air to breathe. They are named differently in different countries. In the USA, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), determines the filtration efficiency of these respirators and they are classified into N-, R-, and P- series for not oil resistant, somewhat oil-resistant and strongly resistant, respectively [
 <xref rid="B32-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Each of the three series has three different filtration efficiencies at 95, 99 and 99.97%, namely N95, R95, P95, etc. (42 CFR Part 84).
