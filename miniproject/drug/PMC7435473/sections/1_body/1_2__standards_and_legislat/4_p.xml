<p>NIOSH conducts several precertification tests before legalising the use of a mask or respirator [
 <xref rid="B38-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These include NaCl aerosol challenge, dioctyl phthalate (DOP) test, valve leak and inhalation/exhalation tests to verify the standards (NIOSH Procedure No. RC-APR-STP-0057, 0058 and 0059). In the NaCl aerosol test, the samples are subjected to aerosolised NaCl and the amount of NaCl that passes through the sample determines the filtration efficiency. The DOP test evaluates particle penetration and air flow resistance where the samples are challenged with the particulates of the most penetrating size range (0.3 Âµm).
