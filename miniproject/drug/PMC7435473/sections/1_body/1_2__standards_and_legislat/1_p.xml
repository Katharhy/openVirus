<p>Medical/surgical masks provide an immediate barrier between the respiratory organs and the surrounding environment. The effectiveness of a face mask or a respirator is determined by two significant factors, the filtration efficiency and fit (facepiece leakage) [
 <xref rid="B28-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Filtration efficiency measures how well the mask filters particles in a specific size range, which includes viruses and other submicron particles, whereas fit measures how well the mask or respirator prevents the leakage around the facepiece. Based on the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) standards and filtration efficiency, medical masks can be categorised into different categories [
 <xref rid="B29-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These are divided into ASTM level 1, 2 and 3 based on the fluid resistance efficiency [
 <xref rid="B30-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Level 3 gives the highest bacterial filtration efficiency with high resistance to the penetration of body fluids. In Europe, medical masks comply with the requirements of European Standard EN 14683:2019 [
