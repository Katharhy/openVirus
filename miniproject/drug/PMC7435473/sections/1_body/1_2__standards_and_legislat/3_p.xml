With the emergence of a pandemic that significantly increased the high demand for face masks, there is a global shortage in the availability of medical face masks. In such a scenario, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that the public use cloth masks in a public setting to prevent the spread of the virus [
