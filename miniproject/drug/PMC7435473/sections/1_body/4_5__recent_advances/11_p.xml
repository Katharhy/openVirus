<p>Apart from this, other modifications such as thermal stability management, reusability, self-sanitising ability, were also investigated. A novel system of nanofibre/nanoporous polyethylene (fibre/nanoPE), which showed high particulate matter adhesion and capture efficiency was developed [
 <xref rid="B107-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Thermal management aims to enhance/suppress radiative dissipation in a high/low-temperature environment. This material showed an excellent radiative cooling effect owing to the high transmission dispersal of the human body temperature (2.1% for nanoPE, 89.3% for fibre/nanoPE). Incorporating a layer of Ag accommodated the heat loss in low temperatures. The IR transmittance rates were much higher when compared to commercially available masks (
