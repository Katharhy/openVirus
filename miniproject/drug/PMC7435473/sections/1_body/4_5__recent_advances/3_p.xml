<p>The introduction of another polymer layer could create excellent filtration media and hence compositing of materials in a filter media has gained much attention. Compositing another layer of filter material with the electret fibres improved the electrostatic charge retention, hence improving the overall filtration efficiency. An ultra-light weight binary structure of nylon 6-polyacrylonitrile nanofibre net (N6-PAN NNB) was fabricated by Wang et al. for the enhanced capture of fine particles with a diameter of 2.5 µm or less (PM 2.5) [

The composite showed 99.99% filtration efficiency when compared to the commercial fibres available and offered a deep bed filtration pattern in contrast to the surface filtration pattern of normal fibres. A 3D simulation of the structure was also formulated and an air flow resistance model was developed on the basis of the experimental data observed (

Sixteen per cent w/v of CA showed the largest first bubble point with a void size of 5.71 µm. The filtration efficiency was solely dependent on the air flow resistance and void faction. Sixteen CA-60 min and 15 CA-30 min samples were observed to meet the requirements of NIOSH for N95 respirators along with a better filtration efficiency. However, two-layer coatings of PVDF were required to meet the standards owing to its small void and thinner fibres.
