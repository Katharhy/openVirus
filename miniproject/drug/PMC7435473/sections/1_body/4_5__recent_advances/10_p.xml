<p>Graphene oxide (GO) has been considered as a promising material for the fabrication of antimicrobial surfaces due to its contact-based antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B104-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. A comparative study on the effect of size of GO sheets was conducted using Gram-negative 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria [
 <xref rid="B105-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. The findings concluded that smaller sheet size improved the activity and this was attributed to the high defect density of the smaller sheets and the associated oxidative mechanisms. The anti-viral activity of GO and GO with Ag was investigated against feline coronavirus (FCoV) with an envelope and infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) without an envelope [
 <xref rid="B106-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. GO-Ag was found to inhibit both FCoV and IBDV, whereas GO sheets could only inhibit IBDV. This was ascribed to the synergistic effect of GO sheets and Ag particles contributing to the anti-viral activity. It was concluded that the positively charged lipid membrane was attracted by the GO and this caused the membrane rupture.
