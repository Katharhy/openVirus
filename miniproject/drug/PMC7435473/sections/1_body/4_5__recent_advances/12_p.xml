<p>Few pieces of research were also conducted on developing self-sanitising and reusable masks, which work based on surface chemistry and roughness. Liu et al. developed a reusable bio-based polyamide-56 nano /nets (PA-56 NF/N) membranes composed of ultra-thin 2D nanonets with synchronised cavity structure [

 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles were used to demonstrate the reusability and dust-cleaning property of PA-56 NF/N compared to that of H&amp;V HB7613 filters commercially available. Although the filtration efficiency of both materials remained the same, PA-56 NF/N showed relatively less dust holding capacity after mechanical shaking. This was attributed to the cavity structures of nanonets and was consistent with the pressure drop variations during testing.
