<p>However, the improper disposal and reuse of the masks and respirators might increase the risk of secondary transmissions, especially in the current pandemic situations such as COVID-19. Although several sterilisation methods, such as UV, bleach, ethylene oxide, hydrogen peroxide treatment, have been used to recycle respirators, there had always been drawbacks [

Hence, the development of a universal virus decontamination system incorporated in a reusable face mask or respirator to potentially reduce the risk of infection and transmission is a key challenge which is yet to be addressed. Functionalisation of the fibrous filters with materials that possess disinfecting properties or modifying the filter surface with an antigen-specific antibody is the most commonly adopted technique to develop such virus-resistant masks. Metal nanoparticles, such as Cu and Ag, could act as reservoirs for the controlled filtering and will be beneficial for virus trapping [
