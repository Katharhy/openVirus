<p>Surgical masks modified using a fibrous filtration unit functionalised with sodium chloride (NaCl) were fabricated for virus deactivation [
 <xref rid="B95-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. The two major processes involved are i) dissolution of salts by the virus and ii) evaporation induced salt recrystallisation. The virus that is exposed to the supersaturated saline solution becomes inactivated during the drying and recrystallisation phase. This simple virus deactivation strategy could be effective in reducing the risk of transmission in an epidemic or pandemic scenario for PPEâ€™s. An anti-viral material constituting SiO
 <sub>2</sub>-AgNPs was generated, and was dry coated on a commercial air filter unit. The modified filter was then tested against aerosolised MS2 bacteriophage [

 <sub>2</sub>-AgNPs.
