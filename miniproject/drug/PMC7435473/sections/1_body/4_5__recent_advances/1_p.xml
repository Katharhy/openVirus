<p>Recently, several studies have been performed to improve the efficiency of the respirators and masks against ultra-fine particles such as viruses and other pathogens. These include employing modified filter materials such as nanofibres and nanofibre webs. Also, the virus disinfection capability can be improved by treating the filter surfaces with materials that possess antimicrobial properties. Use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) [
