<p>There is still a lot left to be explored in developing high filtration, efficient, reusable, anti-viral and thermally regulated face masks and respirators. Yet, when it comes to unexpected emergence of pandemics such as COVID-19, there would always be a high demand and shortage of surgical masks and respirators. This leads to an increased dependence on cloth-masks despite its low efficiency, especially in low economic countries. Hence, it is quite necessary to evaluate the filtration efficiencies of available fabrics that could provide significant protection from the pathogens. Several reports were already available that assesses the efficacy of cloth masks [
