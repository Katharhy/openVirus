<p>A novel anti-influenza copper oxide impregnated respiratory face mask was fabricated to protect the wearer from virus droplets [
 <xref rid="B76-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Copper oxide is believed to possess potential anti-viral and antibacterial properties. The filtration efficiency of both control and copper oxide incorporated face masks were found to be the same for both aerosolised viruses of human influenza A virus (H1N1) and avian influenza virus (H9N2) under simulated breathing conditions. The modified face masks showed zero retention of viral titers after 30 min in the case of H1N1, and five-fold times lower than control masks in the case of H9N2 viruses. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-03363-f011">Figure 11</xref> shows the four different layers of the masks, out of which both layer A, and D, consisted of spunbond polypropylene fabric containing 2.2% weight/weight (w/w) copper particles and the layer B with PP fibres coated with 2% w/w copper oxide particles.
