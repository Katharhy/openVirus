<p>Numerous studies have shown the use of silver ions and several silver-based compounds in developing antimicrobial coatings that are known to be highly effective against microorganisms. Although the precise mechanism of deactivation is unknown, most theories state that the positively charged silver ions disrupt the bacterial cell wall and membrane, resulting in an impaired metabolic pathway leading to the death of the cells [

 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> counts for the untreated face mask. The nanoparticles did not have any other side effects on the human skin such as inflammation or itching. Hiragond et al. studied the enhanced antibacterial property of commercially available masks by treating it with Ag nanoparticles [

The best results were obtained for face masks treated with 100 ppm Ag NPs that showed enhanced antibacterial activity of commercial face masks. The silver nanoparticles crossed plasma membranes as well as the lipid bilayer and entered into the cytoplasm, which eventually leads to the destruction of the bacterial cell [

However, more safety testing regarding the leakage of nanoparticles will be needed for practical applications.
