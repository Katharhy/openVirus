<p>Further studies were done on incorporating the strength of nanostructures on to the nanofibres to improve the filtration efficiency, reduce pressure drops whilst maintaining the 3D structure. A hierarchically structured fluidised bed filter with agglomerated CNTs was synthesised to filter the aerosol particles [
 <xref rid="B89-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. It was found that the manufactured material possessed an enhanced water repellency and high-Quality Factor (QF) when compared to regular filters. Further, a novel electret polyetherimide-silica (PEI-SiO
 <sub>2</sub>) fibrous membrane was fabricated via an electrospinning technique [
 <xref rid="B90-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. A filtration efficiency of 99.992% was obtained with a better self-cleansing property. It was proposed that the permanent dipole orientation of SiO
 <sub>2</sub> helps in trapping more charges and presents more stability, providing a chance to adsorb more target particles and pathogens. A recent study demonstrated the fabrication of novel PAN membranes loaded with ZnO, TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and AgNPs by electrospinning, and the filtration performances were assessed by NaCl filtration [
 <xref rid="B91-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. The TiO
 <sub>2</sub>_F filter displayed the highest filtration efficiency (≈100%), whereas the Ag_F filter showed the highest QF (≈0.06 Pa
 <sup>−1</sup>). This can be attributed to the smallest diameter and high surface charge of TiO
 <sub>2</sub>_F that improves the particulate attraction and the lower air pressure drop of Ag_F, respectively. The TiO
 <sub>2</sub>_F showed the formation of particle agglomerates owing to its large specific surface area and high interaction between TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NPs and PAN fibres. The Ag_F nanofibres also displayed an excellent antibacterial activity towards the gram-negative 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> suspension. Overall, the QF of the fabricated membranes were found to be higher than that of the commercially available nanofibre membranes.
