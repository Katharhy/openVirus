<p>A hybrid PVDF-Ag-Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> composite was synthesised and used to evaluate the antimicrobial deactivation as well as chemical detoxification [
 <xref rid="B100-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. The composite showed high surface-to-volume ratios and excellent antibacterial activity. However, with an increase in Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> concentration, the Ag NPs were less exposed and hence the zone of inhibition was also reduced. In addition to these, there are several studies on coating herbal extracts to the nanofibres, to develop antimicrobial filtration [
