<p>The use of nanofibres in masks and respirators has increased widely since the last decade. Nano-sized fibres offer a very high surface area per unit mass that can improve the capture efficiency as well as other surface areas dependent phenomena such as ion exchange and catalysis [

 <xref rid="B83-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Skaria et al. demonstrated that nanofibre filter incorporated surgical masks showed a decrease in air flow resistance and an improved filtration efficiency when compared to commercially available masks [
 <xref rid="B84-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. A recent study investigated the mask fit and usability of traditional N95 FFPR with the nanofibre N95 FFPR by analysing before and after nursing procedures [
 <xref rid="B85-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. It was concluded that the nanofibre FFR possessed a higher pass rate for the fit testing compared to 3M FFRs. It was also observed to possess a higher bacterial filtration efficiency than the commercially available version in the market. The nanofibre FFPR consisted of partially gelled submicron and nanofibres of PP, and a hydrophilic biocide layer that could effectively inactivate pathogens [
 <xref rid="B86-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. It was found that nanofibre FFPR demonstrated significantly better air permeability and higher antibacterial activities than normal N95 respirators and surgical masks.
