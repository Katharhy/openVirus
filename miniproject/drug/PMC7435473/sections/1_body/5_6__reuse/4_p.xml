<p>A study on the reuse of three different types of masks, N95, Gauze and Spunlace, that had a most penetrating particle size (MPS) of 118, 461 and 279 nm had penetration rates of 2.6%, 23.2% and 70.0%, respectively [
 <xref rid="B116-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. They compared five methods of decontamination using a rice cooker treatment, autoclave, bleach, ethanol and isopropanol. In this study, pressure drop (âˆ†p) and MPS were examined after the decontamination was performed on each type of mask with lower results for both being preferable. The MPS in N95 increased in all treatments with an almost four times increase in size except when using the rice cooker for decontamination. The Gauze saw no real significant change with a decrease seen in rice cooker treatment. The spunlace saw an increase across all the treatments in PMS by roughly 50%. The autoclave had other negative results on the N95 with folding being present in the fabric, this folding could result in changes in the density of the filters and can result in poor effectiveness of the filter. The use of decontamination could potentially be useful for the reuse, but the mask would only have the same protection as gauze with most treatments resulting in an increase in MPS to above 400 nm, which would not be suitable for certain environments.
