<p>A further study using rice cookers for decontamination of N95, cloth and surgical mask treated the masks for 13–15 min and compared the results to oven treatment at 100 °C for 15 min [
 <xref rid="B117-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Each mask had been inoculated with 10-µL of 10
 <sup>6</sup> colony forming units of MRSA and MS2. The rice cooker treatment obtained over a five-log decrease in MRSA and MR2 in comparison to under a three-log decrease with the oven treatment. This shows potential for the use of steam-based treatment in conjunction with the previous study showing the method can retain structural integrity of the mask whilst also disinfecting it.
