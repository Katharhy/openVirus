<p>An examination of the extended use and reuse of respirators found that reuse of respirators could be feasible for non-contact transmission. This was a result of the extended use of masks resulting in comfort issues, which would cause additional touching of the mask increasing infection possibility. Extended use could also allow for degradation of elements such as straps [

 <xref rid="B112-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. The study primarily focused on the effect of the treatments on the respirators, not the decontaminant effect they had on them. They found that UVGI, vaporised hydrogen peroxide and ethylene dioxide showed potential use for further studies. Treatment using bleach resulted in issues with odour from the mask and the production of low levels of chlorine gas was observed when the masks were hydrated. The microwave oven irradiation resulted in two models of respirators melting in the process and as a result was deemed unfit for use.
