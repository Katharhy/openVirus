<p>When N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) were treated with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) a greater than three log decrease of influenzas was observed in 80% of facepieces and 46.6% of straps. This method involved treating the equipment with 1 J/cm
 <sup>2</sup> of UVGI for 1 min [

 <sup>2</sup> were studied, an increase of up to 1.25% in penetration by particles was observed [
 <xref rid="B114-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. The main observed effect was on the structure of the mask, materials present saw their strength degrade by up to 90% with considerable variability seen in different brands of respirators. They conclude that the process could be used but would be heavily dependent on the model of the respirator and would have to have a limited number of disinfections for that model.
