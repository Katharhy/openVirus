<p>A study on the effectiveness of cotton and surgical masks [
 <xref rid="B118-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>] found that when patients with Covid-19 were instructed to cough five times on a petri dish while wearing a mask, masks saw very little reduction of viral load than without a mask being worn. The viral load in one patient only decreased from 3.53 to 3.26 log copies/mL and 2.27 log copies/mL when a surgical mask and cotton mask were used, respectively. They also found that there was no virus found on the inside of the masks in both cases, but 2.21 and 2.76 log copies/mL were found on the outside of the surgical mask and cotton mask, respectively. In conclusion they found that surgical and cotton masks were ineffective in the prevention of the spread of the virus. This study has received criticism for several aspects; the masks are designed to prevent the spread of the virus when an individual is singing, coughing, speaking, sneezing or breathing. When looking at just coughing it is still recommended that an individual covers their mouth, a further examination would need to be carried out under all the conditions above to find their true effectiveness. It was also noted that having an individual cough in a room first without a mask and then with a mask could lead to contamination of the room. This paper has since been retracted due to a low number of patients being used. A separate study modelling a patient coughing while wearing a face mask found that the mask had a 91% “initial efficiency”, droplets were capable of penetrating the mask and travelling over 1.2 m [

They also concluded that if a mask was not worn, droplets would travel at least 70 cm, with the mask the droplets would travel half this distance. This would indicate that the droplets were still capable of penetrating the masks, but their travel distance was limited. Once again, this study examines coughing only and examination of sneezing, breathing, singing and speaking to give a better understanding of their effectiveness. When a surgical mask was examined as an alternative to N95 masks during the SARS pandemic, it was found that surgical masks did not sufficiently filter “submicron-sized” particles [

Indicating they would not sufficiently filter the virus due to its size, however, they noted that surgical masks are not designed to protect the wearer from the virus but to protect the individuals around them if they have the virus. As surgical mask void spaces are designed to prevent particles of above 100 µm in diameter, their use for filtering of COVID-19 that can be up to 140 nm in diameter can be seen as negligible [
 <xref rid="B121-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. They have been found to be beneficial in reducing coronavirus transmission from “large respiratory droplets and in aerosols” [
 <xref rid="B13-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. N95 respirators are capable of filtering particles with a diameter of 100 nm, any virus smaller than that can pass through the filter [
 <xref rid="B122-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Like face masks, respirators will prevent the transference of droplets that are formed from sneezing (≈100 µm) and coughing (≈1 µm).
