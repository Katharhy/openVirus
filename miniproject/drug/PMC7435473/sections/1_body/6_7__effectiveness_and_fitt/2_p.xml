<p>Respirators are designed to have a tight fit so as the flow of air is coming through the mask and not the sides and each user should have a fit test [

 <xref rid="B124-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. A study examining how many individuals passed the fit test saw that N95 masks (ref1860), N95 masks (re9210) and N100 masks had pass rates of 69%, 55% and 70%, respectively. When the user seal check was examined, 71–75% of them passed, however when this was compared to a Quantitative fit testing, 18–31% of the user seal checks had been incorrectly passed. This would indicate that unless the respirator is fitted and worn correctly it will not give the correct level of protection required. The use of Quantitative fit testing (QNFT) was recommended instead of a user seal check to ensure the mask has a tight fit. Surgical masks were seen to have a very poor fit factor, when five masks were worn together they were only found to have a fit factor of 13.7, the lowest fit factor for a half face respirator is 100 [

When they were subjected to a QNFT, they obtained fit factors of between 2.5–6.9 when unaided and from 2.8–9.6 when aided [
