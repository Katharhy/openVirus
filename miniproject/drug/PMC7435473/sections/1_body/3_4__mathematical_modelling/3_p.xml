<p>Another SIR type model was deployed to determine who should wear masks against airborne infections, i.e., should it be infective or non-infected individuals [

Ordinary differential equations and probabilistic cellular automata were used to study how the removal of connections in the random complex network depicting the social interactions among people affects the progression of an infectious disease [
 <xref rid="B71-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The simulation model reveals that if there is a finite number of masks available, then the infective individuals should be those who wear masks [
