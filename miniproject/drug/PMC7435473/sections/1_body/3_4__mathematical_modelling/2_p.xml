<p>The application of an SIR modelling system was applied to estimate the vitality of face mask use by the general public during an influenza outbreak [
 <xref rid="B70-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Here, estimation of the effects of mask efficacy and coverage (whereby the fraction of population was wearing masks) on basic reproduction number and infection attack rate was used to generate the model. Results show that uncertified masks such as surgical and homemade masks may give an extensive reduction on the reproduction number of the attack rate of the virus. It was also reported that the use of face masks at a population level may delay an influenza pandemic, decrease the attack-rate of the virus and also may reduce transmission to a level where the pandemic may be contained.
