<p>The use of mathematical modelling has been significant in broadening the knowledge of transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases while providing theoretical information for the development of public health policy [

 <xref rid="B61-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Consider the COVID-19 pandemic; here, the majority of mathematical models used can be generally divided into two specific categories. The first category relates to population-based, Susceptible-Infective-Recovered (SIR)-type models, which are focused on potentially stochastic differential equations [

 <xref rid="B63-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], while the second category deals with agent-based models (ABMs) [

 <xref rid="B66-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], in which individuals often communicate on a network structure and transfer infection stochastically. There are certain difficulties posed with the use of both models. Population based models may be too crass to encapsulate specific real-world intricacies [
 <xref rid="B67-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] while agent-based models are often time-varying, which leads to difficulty in construction along with a loss of accuracy [
 <xref rid="B68-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Many of these models incorporate features of both entities. The correct sequence of dynamical, stochastic, data-driven, and network-based methods will always depend on the question that needs to be addressed [
