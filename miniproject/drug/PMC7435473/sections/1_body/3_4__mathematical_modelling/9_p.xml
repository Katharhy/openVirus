<p>While the majority of COVID-19 models are focused on population based SIR/SEIR systems [
 <xref rid="B74-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] have deployed a two model system for predicting the impact of universal mask wearing upon the spread of the SARS-COV-2 virus. The first model type involves a stochastic dynamic network based compartmental SEIR dynamic, which is comparable to previous studies while the second model deploys an individual Agent Based Model (ABM) Monte Carlo simulation [
 <xref rid="B74-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The models used were validated using an empirical data set which includes whether areas have deployed universal masking, daily growth rate and percentage reduction from highest daily growth rates. Results show an almost perfect correlation between early universal masking and successful reduction in daily death rates and daily growth rates [

The researchers have emphasised the use of universal masking as a non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) to impede the spread of the virus. Universal masking, in combination with social distancing and contact tracing, a “mouth and nose lockdown” may be more feasible than a “full body lockdown” [

 <xref rid="B74-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Without masking, even with continued social distancing, it is predicted that over half of the population accounted for will be become infected resulting in over a million deaths in a country the size of the UK [
