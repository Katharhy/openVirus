<p>As seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-03363-f007">Figure 7</xref>, as the mask effectiveness rises, the cumulative number of cases decreases. Also, the number of cumulative cases decreases as the percentage of the population wearing masks increases [
 <xref rid="B72-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Overall, mildly effective masks (20%) could cut the infection number in half. Also, if masks were 50% effective as a source control, the epidemic could be terminated if only 25% of the population wore masks. This being said, another report found that while mask use reduced infection rate, &lt;50% of those in a mask-wearing group reported wearing the mask most of the time [
 <xref rid="B73-materials-13-03363" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. It was found that household uses of masks is associated with low adherence and is limited in controlling seasonal influenza-like illness [
