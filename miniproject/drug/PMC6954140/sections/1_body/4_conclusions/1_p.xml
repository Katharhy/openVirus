<p id="Par31">Overall, this SSPâ€™s role in the collaborative effort led to early detection and suppression of a typically medically underserved and marginalized population, limiting the transmission of HIV to other individuals. Providing concentrated wrap-around services at an SSP including implementing routine screening and offering intensive linkage and patient navigation could be an effective model for identifying new transmissions, engaging individuals into care, achieving viral suppression in PWID, and working towards overall community harm reduction. Ultimately, to prevent HIV seroconversions, proven upstream interventions like clean syringe access and wrap-around PrEP access need to be implemented or expanded within these communities.</p>
