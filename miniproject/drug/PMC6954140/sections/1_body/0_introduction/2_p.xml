<p id="Par4">Evidence-based public health interventions can help mitigate disease transmission in these vulnerable populations. Yet, absence of interventions and delays in public health action have been connected with the incidence of IDU-associated HIV outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Considerable evidence has shown that one of the most effective interventions for reducing HIV transmission among PWID is the provision of sterile syringes through syringe services programs (SSPs) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The use of medication-assisted treatment for substance use and dependence, rapid access to antiretroviral therapies (ART) for those living with a diagnosis of HIV, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and other harm reduction methods are also effective at reducing HIV transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Greatest declines in the number of new HIV diagnoses following IDU-related HIV outbreaks were observed when SSPs were used in combination with other prevention interventions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].
