On February 19, 2018, the IDEA SSP implemented anonymous, opt-out, HIV/HCV rapid antibody screening of all participants at initial enrollment into the SSP, including ï»¿subsequent testing for those testing non-reactive every 3 months thereafter. On March 9, 2018, the IDEA SSP identified its first anonymous rapid reactive HIV test in a participant who had previously tested non-reactive. Following two subsequent anonymous rapid reactive HIV tests among previously HIV non-reactive participants, the program notified the Florida Department of Health (DOH) on April 13, 2018. In total, ten anonymous rapid reactive HIV tests were identified at the SSP among previously non-reactive participants, suspected individuals with HIV seroconversion, over a 6-month period.</p>
