<p id="Par7">In response, the SSP partnered with DOH to provide on-site confidential testing and rapid linkage to HIV care and treatment. DOH initiated an epidemiologic investigation and embedded a Disease Intervention Specialist (DIS) within the SSP to facilitate contact tracing. DOH analyzed HIV-1 nucleotide sequence data to determine if the suspected individuals with HIV seroconversion were genetically similar based on the close relatedness of mutations arising along the genome of the virus at a genetic distance threshold of 0.5%, indicating recent and rapid transmission [
