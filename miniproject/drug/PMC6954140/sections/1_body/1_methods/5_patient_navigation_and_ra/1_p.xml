<p id="Par13">Patients with a reactive rapid HIV test were linked to care at the Miami-Dade County safety-net hospital, Jackson Memorial, via the DOH “Test and Treat” program to provide individuals with rapid access to ART and HIV care following initial diagnosis or when returning to care. Bictegravir-tenofovir alafenamide-emtricitabine (BIC/FTC/TAF) was the prescribed combination pill in the DOH “Test and Treat” program. The patients received a 30-day supply of BIC/FTC/TAF and had up to 60 days to complete financial eligibility and enrollment into the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) to continue their prescribed therapies. To facilitate the linkage to care for this high-risk population, SSP staff engaged with case patients on the streets during outreach and accompanied them as they were seen by a Ryan White case manager, a clinician (physician or advanced practice provider), a phlebotomist for baseline laboratories, and a pharmacist for on-the-spot initiation of BIC/FTC/TAF.</p>
