<p id="Par14">Individuals with confirmed seroconversion were compared to their epidemiologic linkages and SSP participants with a previous HIV diagnosis. Demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, and housing), HIV exposure risk, and syringe sharing status were obtained from DOH surveillance systems for HIV reporting and case management (enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System and Patient Reporting Investigation Surveillance Manager [PRISM]). Clinical characteristics and outcomes including baseline viral load and CD4 count, time to linkage to care, time to viral suppression, and coinfection or prior infection with syphilis and HCV were obtained for all linked individuals. Time to linkage to care was defined as the number of days between anonymous reactive rapid HIV test and first visit to an HIV clinic with a reported initial viral load. Time to viral suppression was defined as the total number of days between anonymous reactive rapid HIV test at the SSP and the specimen collection date for the first reported viral load of less than 200 copies/mL. In-care time to viral suppression was defined as the number of days between the date of first reported viral load and the first reported viral load of less than 200 copies/mL. HIV diagnosis date was defined as the earliest specimen collection date for a reported reactive HIV confirmatory test.</p>
