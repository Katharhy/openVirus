<p id="Par21">Resistance interpretation patterns and specific virus mutations for 13 of the 17 persons with diagnosed HIV (includes individuals with seroconversion) in the network were obtained (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Two individuals with seroconversion (case 6 and 7) and one primary epi-linkage (case 13) linked molecularly at the 0.5% genetic distance and shared 33 out of the 36 (92%) mutations identified, demonstrating high agreement between HIV-1 nucleotide sequences and HIV-1 resistance patterns. Moreover, two of the seven individuals with seroconversion (cases 2 and 3) did not have a reported genotype at the time of diagnosis and were virally suppressed at the time of the investigation. In an effort to obtain resistance patterns to aid in treatment, a proviral DNA test was performed and resistance mutations obtained. Neither of their resistance patterns had high agreement with any of the other 13 persons with diagnosed HIV.
