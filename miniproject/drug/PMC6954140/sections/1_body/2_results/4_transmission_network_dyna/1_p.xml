<p id="Par19">Of the seven individuals with seroconversion, all are epidemiologically- and/or socially-linked (epi-linked) to at least two other individuals with seroconversion, with the exception of one individual who was only epi-linked to one other seroconversion (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Six of the seven individuals self-reported sharing syringes or works. Two individuals were epidemiologically-linked to individuals with previous HIV diagnoses through both syringe/works sharing and sexual contact. Two individuals with seroconversion and five individuals with primary epi-links self-reported exchanging sex for money or drugs. Resistance interpretations to HIV-1 antiretrovirals were obtained for all seven cases, but only five nucleotide sequences were able to be processed through Secure HIV TRACE for molecular linkage analysis.
