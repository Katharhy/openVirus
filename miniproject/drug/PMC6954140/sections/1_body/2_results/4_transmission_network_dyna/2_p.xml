<p id="Par20">Analysis of the five HIV genotypes revealed that two individuals with seroconversion (cases 6 and 7) were connected molecularly at 0.5% genetic distance, and another two individuals with seroconversion (cases 4 and 5) were molecularly linked at the 1.5% genetic distance (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Ten individuals were primarily epi-linked to the seven individuals with seroconversion, of which eight had previously diagnosed HIV (one negative and one of unknown HIV status). An additional nine risk partners of the seven were claimed but were not identifiable/investigated. In addition, eight of the ten epi-linked individuals were known IDEA SSP participants. Five of the eight previously diagnosed epi-linked individuals were missing genotype information (sequence or resistance interpretation), and of the remaining three, one (case 13) matched two individuals with seroconversion (cases 6 and 7) at the 0.5% genetic distance. Outside of the primary epi-linked network, two additional persons with diagnosed HIV (cases 16 and 17) matched two of the individuals with seroconversion (cases 6 and 7) and one epi-linked individual (case 13) at the 1.5% genetic distance, but had no reported epidemiological or social linkages to individuals in the risk network.
