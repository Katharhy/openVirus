<p id="Par16">From February 19, 2018 to December 20, 2018, seven individuals out of ten suspected patients with an HIV diagnosis met the case definition of an acute HIV seroconversion. The other three suspected cases had been previously diagnosed before implementation of the IDEA SSPâ€™s universal testing protocol. Another 32 individuals participating in the SSP who were previously living with an HIV diagnosis were also reviewed for molecular linkages, seven of whom were also primary epidemiologic links to a confirmed case. An embedded DIS was able to interview 15 of these individuals, eight of whom DOH was previously unable to locate for investigation.</p>
