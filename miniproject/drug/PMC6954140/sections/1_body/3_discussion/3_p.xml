<p id="Par24">The complex HIV transmission dynamics also highlighted the important role both traditional partner contact tracing and molecular data play to supplement information and build these epidemiological networks. Previous studies are in agreement that complementing traditional contact tracing with molecular HIV sequence data can confirm or refine transmission networks, and improve precision of HIV prevention activities [

Furthermore, we were able to use HIV-1 resistance patterns to supplement for two missing nucleotide sequences among individuals with recent seroconversion since we observed high agreement in the number of mutations present for individuals with seroconversion linked at 0.5% genetic distance. Pooled studies observe the mutation accrual rate for HIV to be between 0.014 and 0.039 mutations per month or 2% per year [
