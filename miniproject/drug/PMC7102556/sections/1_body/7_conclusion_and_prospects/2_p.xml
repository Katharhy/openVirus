<p id="p0110">Taken together, 2019-nCoV is a new coronavirus, and like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it belongs to 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were able to spread around the globe and posed a major challenge to clinical management and a great threat to public health. Similarly to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, based on the monitoring and scientific forecast, 2019-nCoV may cause a worldwide threat to public health. Over the years, research on CoVs has resulted in multiple strategies for diagnosis, prevention and treatment of CoV infection. This brief review has demonstrated that such an achievement could very well apply to 2019-nCoV, or indeed, any newly emergent CoV in the future. At present, many companies engaged in the development of biologicals have marketed nucleic acid detection kits for 2019-nCoV, such as the new coronavirus nucleic acid detection kit (double fluorescence PCR method) from Shuoshi Biotechnology. Currently, however, no diagnostic test kit is available for the detection of antibodies to 2019-nCoV.
