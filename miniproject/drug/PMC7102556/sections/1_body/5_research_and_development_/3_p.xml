<p id="p0055">As the major vaccine target, the S protein has been evaluated in different types of vaccines against infection by CoVs [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Apart from the inactive whole virus particle [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], live attenuated virus with gene deletion [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] , four more vaccines which mainly contain S protein were studied. These include a virus-like particle which incorporated S protein into hepatitis virus or influenza virus protein [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]; virus vectors, such as modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) or Adenovirus carrying S protein [
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]; S protein subunit vaccine, like RBD-based protein [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]; and DNA vaccine which encodes the full length or part of the S protein gene [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Most of them have been tested in mouse models and showed the ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies. The first SARS-CoV DNA vaccine was tested in humans only 19 months after the virus sequence was published [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], while the DNA vaccine GLS-5300, the first MERS-CoV vaccine, went to clinical trials in 2016 [
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In addition to these conventional vaccines, Liu etÂ al. analyzed the T cell epitopes of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, revealed the potential cross-reactivity of the coronaviruses, and assessed the possibility of developing universal vaccines against coronavirus infections [
