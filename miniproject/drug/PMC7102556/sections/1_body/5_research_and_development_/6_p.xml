<p id="p0070">Jiang and colleagues have demonstrated that RBD in the SARS-CoV S protein is the major target of neutralizing antibodies in SARS patients and is able to induce highly potent neutralizing antibody responses and long-term protective immunity in animal models. It contains 6 different conformational neutralizing epitopes, to which a series of mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with different neutralizing activity were generated. Interestingly, these mAbs exhibited cross-neutralizing activities against divergent SARS-CoV strains isolated from SARS patients at different stages of SARS epidemics in 2002–2004 and those from palm civets [

Most importantly, RBD-based vaccine could induce neutralizing antibody responses and protection against SARS-CoV infection in the immunized animals, while it did not elicit ADE or other harmful immune responses, unlike the virus-inactivated vaccines or full-length S protein-based vaccines as discussed above. Therefore, this RBD-based SARS vaccine is expected to be safer and more effective than the vaccines targeting other sites in S protein. Jiang and Du’s groups have collaborated with Hotez’s group at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and Tseng’s group at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Texas, USA in development of an effective and safe vaccine at the late stage of preclinical study [

If it is confirmed, this vaccine candidate has the great potential to be further developed promptly in clinical trials in both China and the United State through the continuous collaborations among the four groups of Drs. Hotez, Tseng, Du, and Jiang [
