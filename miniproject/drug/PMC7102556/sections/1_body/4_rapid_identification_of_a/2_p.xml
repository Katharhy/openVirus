<p id="p0030">Identification of pathogens mainly includes virus isolation and viral nucleic acid detection. According to the traditional Koch’s postulates, virus isolation is the “gold standard” for virus diagnosis in the laboratory. First, viral culture is a prerequisite for diagnosing viral infections. A variety of specimens (such as swabs, nasal swabs, nasopharynx or trachea extracts, sputum or lung tissue, blood and feces) should be retained for testing in a timely manner, which gives a higher rate of positive detection of lower respiratory tract specimens. Then, immunological methods – including immunofluorescence assay, protein microarray, direct fluorescent antibody assay, MAb-based rapid NP (nucleocapsid protein) detection, semiconductor quantum dots, and the microneutralization test – which measure binding between the antigen from the whole virus or protein of the coronavirus and corresponding antibody, are easy to operate rapidly but have a lower sensitivity and specificity [
