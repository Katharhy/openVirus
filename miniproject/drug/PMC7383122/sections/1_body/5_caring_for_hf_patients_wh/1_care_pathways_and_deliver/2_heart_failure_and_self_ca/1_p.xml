<p id="Par22">In the era of a pandemic, and with emphasis on social distancing, the importance of self-care for HF patients is more than ever. Hospitals confer a higher risk of infections, and hospitalizations for HF carry a worse long-term prognosis. Adherence to medications and low-salt diet can be the difference maker in this regard. Careful attention to symptoms as well as daily weights can alert patients, family members, and healthcare providers to early worsening of chronic HF, leading to early adjustments that can keep them safely out of the hospital.</p>
