<p id="Par24">Generally, infections are always a concern in post-heart transplantation given the need to use immunosuppression to prevent rejection and preserve graft function. While immunosuppression increases the likelihood of developing viral infections such as cytomegalovirus and herpes, acute respiratory viral infections are less pronounced [

It is very likely that the perceived risk of infection in these patients led them to proactively use measures that can limit the transmission of the virus, such as wearing a mask for example.
