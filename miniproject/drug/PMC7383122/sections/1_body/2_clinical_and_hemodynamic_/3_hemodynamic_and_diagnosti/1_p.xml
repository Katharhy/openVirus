<p id="Par10">Elevated natriuretic peptides suggest HF with a worse prognosis of COVID-19 and warrant at least an echocardiogram to further assess cardiac function [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. If HF is present as part of the infectious process, optimizing loading conditions is critical. Minimal or very cautious use of IV fluids as well as inotropes rather than vasopressors is examples of how management can differ in these cases. When uncertain, hemodynamics are best assessed through pulmonary artery catheterization, especially if the diagnosis will change the management.
