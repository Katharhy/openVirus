<p id="Par14">Furthermore, a careful clinical assessment of signs of hypervolemia or hypoperfusion is important in all COVID- 19 patients. In the case of cardiogenic shock requiring advanced therapy, it potentially means veno-arterial as opposed to veno-venous cannulation. Recently, cardiogenic shock was reported by Fried et al. as a complication during the treatment of COVID 19-related respiratory failure by veno-venous extra-corporeal membranous oxygenation (VV-ECMO), in which more advanced circulatory support with a low flow veno-arterial cannulation was required, highlighting the possible efficacy of such relatively low level of circulatory support without inducing LV distension in patients with COVID-19-related cardiopulmonary shock [

Most importantly, multi-disciplinary approach to these patients with collaboration between HF cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, and intensivists is invaluable. Finally, it is important to be aware of the risk of transmission and exposure at times of a pandemic and thus only perform imaging and laboratory testing when indicated.
