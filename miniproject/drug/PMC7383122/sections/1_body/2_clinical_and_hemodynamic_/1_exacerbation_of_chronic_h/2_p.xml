<p id="Par6">Acute infections result in the release of proinflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of proinflammatory macrophages and granulocytes, leading to a severe inflammatory storm which may exaggerate the initial injury [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In combination with the increased metabolic demand, this can lead to cardiac depression and either new-onset HF or acute decompensation of chronic HF [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Another contributor to cardiac depression could be the coagulation dysfunction induced by the sepsis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Intensive care studies with COVID-19 patients from multiple European centers have shown high rates of coagulation abnormalities and thrombotic events [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Close monitoring of anticoagulation in the LVAD population has also been recommended given the aforementioned high risk of thrombosis in this pandemic [
