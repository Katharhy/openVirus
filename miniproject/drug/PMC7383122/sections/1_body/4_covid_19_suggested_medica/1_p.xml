<p id="Par18">Based on in vitro data and a controversial recent trial, hydroxychloroquine has gained widespread adoption as part of institutional protocols to manage the COVID-19 infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine block a potassium channel that can prolong the QTc and has been implicated in cases of torsades de pointes (TdP) and sudden cardiac death. This will become particularly relevant if combined with the other currently suggested treatments including the QTc prolonging azithromycin and lopinavir/ritonavir (all three medications are on CredibleMeds QTc prolonging list) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. While favipiravir has only been associated with QTc prolongation at high doses used to treat Ebola virus and not the current doses used for treatment in this pandemic, careful monitoring is still warranted given the relatively inadequate clinical experience with this agent [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. HF patients can be at particular risk for sudden cardiac death in the setting of the structural heart disease itself. This is in addition to being on concomitant proarrhythmic agents in advanced stages, as well as the high prevalence of antiarrhythmics and other concomitant medications that can pause challenging drug-drug interactions and in some cases, increase the chances of QTc prolongation. In fact, many hospitalized HF patients are likely to be categorized as medium to high risk based on the Tisdale score, which is a validated risk score to predict drug-associated QTc prolongation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], this is due to several factors that include the disease state itself, being on a loop diuretic, frequent electrolyte abnormalities, and the aforementioned high prevalence of concomitant QTc prolonging medications. Moreover, heart failure patients on advanced therapies may also be on medications that interact with suggested COVID-19 regimens. For example, patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) are generally on anticoagulation therapy with a vitamin k antagonist (VKA) such as warfarin. This can pose a drug-drug interaction with the some of the COVID-19 antivirals. In addition, patients who are post-heart transplantation will also be on an immunosuppressive regimen that is metabolized through some of cytochrome p450 enzymes that are inhibited by the antivirals.
