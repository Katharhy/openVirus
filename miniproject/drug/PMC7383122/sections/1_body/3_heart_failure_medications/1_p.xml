<p id="Par16">COVID-19 mechanism of cellular entry has implicated an important class of medications that are part of the Guideline Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT) for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Similar to the previously known respiratory coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the cellâ€™s outer surface [

With the emergence of the current pandemic, this known pharmacology led to several editorials and media reports questioning the associated risks in patients taking ACEI/ARB or suggesting that patients should prophylactically stop taking these medications [
