<p id="Par17">The interplay of the virus with the ACE2 receptor and ACEI/ARB medications is rather more complex than a pharmacologically induced overexpression of a receptor and a resultant more viral susceptibility. First, while ACE and ACE2 are similar their active sites are different and they do not directly affect each other’s activity. Data from animal and human models are conflicting regarding the effect of ACE or even ARBs on the expression and activity of ACE2 [

In addition, even if we assume that RAAS inhibitors upregulate ACE2 levels, we do not have data to conclude that this will predispose to more entry of the virus in humans. Through converting angiotensin II to angiotensin 1–7, ACE2 in fact partially reverses the effects of the RAAS and its known detrimental outcomes in not only HF (vasoconstriction, myocardial remodeling) but also its potential role in inducing acute lung injury; therefore, attenuating the effects of an overactivated RAAS. This downregulation of RAAS has been used to explain the benefits of ACE2 in protection from severe lung injury in animal models [

A number of physician groups and professional societies recently considered the available data and the well-documented effect of discontinuing ACEI/ARB therapy and advised against changing clinical practice for the purpose of mitigating the pandemic and recommended to continue treatment based on standard indications [
