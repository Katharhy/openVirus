<p>At present, development of PPVIs has become a topic of strong interest in the field of antiviral drugs. Different from “passive defenders,” and fusion inhibitors and receptor antagonists in “gate keepers,” protein- and peptide-based inactivators have been found to actively attack and inactivate cell-free virions anywhere they meet in the blood by specifically interacting with one or more sites in Env on the virion, thus they are expected to have higher utilization rate than the current antiviral drugs. The action mechanisms of PPVIs include (1) blocking the RBS on viral Envs, (2) inducing conformational changes of viral Env, causing the virion to lose the ability to enter the host cell, or (3) binding to the Env stem or the viral lipid membrane, to disrupt the integrity of the viral envelope or lead to the release of viral genetic materials. Apart from these, exact mechanisms of some PPVIs still remain to be explored.</p>
