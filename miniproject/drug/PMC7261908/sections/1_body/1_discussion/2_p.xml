<p>Viral fusion proteins in different oligomeric states and structures can be classified into three different classes (classes I, II, and III) (
 <xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">Weissenhorn et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Harrison, 2008</xref>). Here we reviewed the development of PPVIs against the following representative enveloped viruses: HIV and influenza virus (with class I membrane fusion), ZIKV and DENV (with class II membrane fusion), and HSV (with class III membrane fusion). Although their fusion/entry processes vary from each other, some common technologies can be used for identifying or designing and evaluating PPVIs, including those (1) for constructing recombinant fusion proteins, such as those applied to design the potent protein-based HIV-1 inactivators 2DLT and 2Dm2m (

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2014</xref>); (2) for constructing phage display peptide libraries, such as the one utilized to screen for the peptide 12p1, from which the peptide-based HIV-1 inactivator Triazole KR13 was designed (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>); (3) for performing computer-aided design of proteins or peptides targeting the RBS, such as the CD4bs in HIV-1 gp120 and sialic-acid binding site in influenza virus HA1, or the conserved stem regions, such as those in DENV and ZIKV E protein; and (4) for performing viral inactivation assays, such as those for evaluating inactivation activities of the PPVIs against HIV-1 and ZIKV (

 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2017</xref>). In general, these techniques and strategies have been successfully applied to design a variety of virus inactivators targeting viral Envs, and they can also be used for the design of virus inactivators against other enveloped viruses, particularly the newly emerging and re-emerging viruses with potential to cause global pandemics (
