<p>The lower eukaryotic organisms, such as invertebrates and plants, only possess the innate immunity system, including some antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that can non-specifically destroy the viral envelope and inactivate the cell-free virions (

 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">Seo et al., 2012</xref>). After long evolution, higher vertebrates have gained an advanced adaptive immune system that can specifically attack and inactivate pathogenic viruses. Neutralizing antibodies are a vital component of the adaptive immune system. According to our definition of virus inactivators described before, many of the viral neutralizing antibodies with the ability to irreversibly inactivate cell-free virions can be considered as protein-based virus inactivators. The development of neutralizing antibodies during the evolutionary process may also reflect the fact that protein-based virus inactivators able to actively attack and inactivate cell-free virions have certain advantages against viral infections (
