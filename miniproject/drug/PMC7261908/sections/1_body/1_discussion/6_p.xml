<p>Besides these two disadvantages, compared with chemical-based virus inactivators, PPVIs usually have a shorter half-life and lack oral availability thus require several times of injection a week. In terms of their higher production cost, PPVIs are generally more expensive for long-term treatment of chronic viral infection. Lentiviral vector-based gene therapy to secret a PPVI continuously can be one choice to lower the cost (
