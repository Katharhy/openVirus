<p>Since the direct fusion is governed by gD, gH/gL, and gB, they are potential sources and targets of protein- and peptide-based HSV inactivators (

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Akkarawongsa et al. (2009)</xref> identified three antiviral peptides, gB94, gB122, and gB131, from the peptide library of HIV-1 gB-1 ectodomain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). The peptides gB94 (residues 496–510) and gB122 (residues 636–650) could inactivate cell-free virions with EC50 of 125 and 138 μM, respectively, although their detailed mechanism of action has not been reported. However, while peptide gB131 (residues 681–695) exhibited no virus inactivation, it did show inhibitory activity (IC50: ∼12 μM). More recently, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Cetina-Corona et al. (2016)</xref> created a library of continuous 15-25 residue stretches (CRSs) located on the surface of HSV-2 gH and HSV-1 gB through bioinformatics analysis. According to the flexibility, charged residues and conservatism of the CRS sequence, they selected and synthesized peptides CB-1 and CB-2 derived from gH and peptides U-1 and U-2 derived from gB (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Results showed that peptides U-1 and U-2 at 100 μM could inactivate more than 80% of HSV-1 and HSV-2 virions, while peptides CB-1 and CB-2 at 100 μM could only inactivate less than 50% of these virions. However, the detailed mechanism of action showing how these peptides inactivate cell-free HSV virions has not been clarified. Meanwhile, the viral inactivation activities of these peptide inactivators are relatively weak, requiring further optimization.
