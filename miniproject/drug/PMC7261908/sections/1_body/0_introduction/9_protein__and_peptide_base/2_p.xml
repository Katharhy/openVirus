<p>Different from most of other enveloped viruses using a single Env to mediate viral fusion process, HSV utilize a set of surface glycoproteins including gD, gH/gL, and gB as the core fusion components. Therein gD acts as the receptor-binding protein, gH/gL as the fusion regulator and gB as the class III fusogen (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, HSV-1 gH is an 838-amino acid type I membrane glycoprotein comprised of a single pass transmembrane domain, a short cytoplasmic tail and an ectodomain (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Gompels and Minson, 1986</xref>). Its ectodomain can be subdivided into domains H1 (H1A and H1B), H2 and H3, and the N-terminal H1 domain binds gL to form a non-covalent heterodimer (

Therefore, the gB-gH/gL complex is key for fusion and can be inhibited by neutralizing antibody to gH, implying that the gH/gL complex activates gB through direct binding (

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Bohm et al., 2016</xref>). HSV-1 gB, is a 904-amino acid glycoprotein with an extended rodlike ectodomain, transmembrane domain (TM) and cytoplasmic domain (CP) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). The ectodomain has five distinct parts, domains Iâ€“V, and domain IV is fully exposed with neutralizing epitopes on it and possibly interacts with cellular receptors (
