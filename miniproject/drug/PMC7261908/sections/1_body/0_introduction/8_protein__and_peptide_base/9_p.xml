<p>In sum, the studies on DENV and ZIKV inactivators are not as comprehensive as those on HIV inactivators (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Almost all of them are peptides, not proteins; some important targets including the RBS in domain III have not been utilized adequately like CD4bs in HIV gp120 (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Huerta et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, the viral inactivation activities of many peptides have not been verified with the virus inactivation assay, and specific targets and action mechanisms of most peptide-based inactivators have not been clearly elucidated. Despite of these deficiencies, the design and development of DENV and ZIKV inactivators can be referential paradigms for those of newly emerging or re-emerging viruses.
