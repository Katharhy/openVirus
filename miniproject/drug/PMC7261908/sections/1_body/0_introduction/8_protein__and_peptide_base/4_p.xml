<p>Since E protein plays an significant role in receptor binding and membrane fusion, it is considered as a promising source and target for development of protein- and peptide-based DENV inactivators. In recent years, the structure of DENV E protein has been well determined using X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) (

They found that DN59, derived from the helix-loop-helix sequence of the DENV-2 E protein stem region (residues 692–724) with amphipathicity and membrane-binding ability, could inhibit infection of all four serotypes of DENV with IC50 values in the range of 2–5 μM. It was also effective against some other flaviviruses, such as yellow fever virus (YFV) (

Further studies of its mechanism of action have shown that it can irreversibly inactivate virions by directly interacting with viral lipid membranes and forming holes at the five-fold vertices in the viral envelope, allowing the release of viral genomic RNA (
