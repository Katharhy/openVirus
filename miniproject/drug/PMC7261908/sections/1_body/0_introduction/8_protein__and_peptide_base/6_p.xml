<p>In addition to the conserved stem, other regions in E protein may also serve as sources of DENV inactivators. Based on the native dimeric E structure, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Costin et al. (2010)</xref> designed a set of anti-DENV peptides using predictive strategies together with computational optimization. The two most active peptides, DN57opt and 1OAN1, derived from the domain II hinge region (residues 205–232) and the first domain I/domain II beta sheet connection (residues 41–60), respectively, could inhibit DENV-2 infection with IC50 values of 8 and 7 μM, respectively. The biolayer interferometry study demonstrated that both DN57opt and 1OAN1 could bind to soluble DENV-2 E protein, and Cryo-EM analysis revealed that the surface of virions treated with DN57opt or 1OAN1 became rough, suggesting that the viral envelope may have been damaged (
