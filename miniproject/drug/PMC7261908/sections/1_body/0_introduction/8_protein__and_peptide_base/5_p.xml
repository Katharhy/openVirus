<p>Since the stem of flavivirus E protein is highly conserved, results of the above studies imply that protein- and peptide-based ZIKV inactivators can also originate from the stem sequence. Accordingly, peptide Z2 was designed and synthesized, which is derived from the stem of ZIKV E protein (residues 421–453), and similarly Z2 was shown to inhibit infection by different strains of ZIKV and other flaviviruses, including YFV and DENV with IC50 values between 1 and 14 μM. Animal studies indicated that Z2 could protect A129 and AG6 mice from lethal ZIKV challenge; Z2 was also found to cross the placental barrier and prohibit vertical transmission of ZIKV in pregnant mice. The mechanism studies suggested that Z2 could interact with E protein and inactivate the virions, with an EC50 value of ∼2.5 μM, by forming pores in the viral envelope, allowing the release of the viral RNA genome (
