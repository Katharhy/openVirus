<p>Other studies showed that M protein of DENV could interact with native E protein to trigger the conformation of DENV E protein, suggesting that peptides derived from M protein may act as DENV inactivators. 
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">Panya et al. (2015)</xref> designed a novel anti-DENV peptide, MLH40, derived from the conserved ectodomain of M protein, and found that it could inhibit infection of four serotypes of DENV with IC50 values ranging from 24 to 31 Î¼M. Molecular docking analysis suggested that the N-terminal loop of MLH40 could interact with DENV E protein to alter its native dimeric conformation. However, its inactivation activity has not been tested and reported.
