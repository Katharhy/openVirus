 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al. (2012)</xref> proposed, for the first time, the strategy of designing and developing a protein-based HIV-1 inactivator, 2DLT, for inactivating cell-free HIV-1 virions in the absence of target cells (
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">Sanders, 2013</xref>). 2DLT, a bivalent recombinant protein, consists of three parts: (1) the D1D2 domain of CD4 (2D), (2) a 35-amino acid linker (L), and (3) T1144 (T), a peptide-based HIV fusion inhibitor (

 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2009</xref>). Binding of D1D2 in 2DLT to the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) in HIV-1 gp120 triggers the formation of a gp120/gp41 pre-fusion intermediate (PFI), in which gp41 NHR is partially exposed (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Haim et al., 2009</xref>). The T1144 portion in 2DLT then binds the exposed NHR, resulting in the destabilization of PFI thus inactivation of the cell-free virions (

The results from the virus inactivation assay indicated that 2DLT could effectively inactivate cell-free HIV-1 virions, including laboratory-adapted strains and primary isolates of different subtypes with an EC50 (Half maximal effective concentration causing virus inactivation) between 17.3 and 78.6 nM, which is about twoâ€“six fold more potent than D1D2 alone, while T1144 alone had no virus inactivation activity (

 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">Sanders, 2013</xref>). Subsequently, the antiviral effects of 2DLT in combination with different anti-HIV drugs were explored, including HIV entry inhibitors, NRTIs, NNRTIs and protease inhibitors. The results indicated that the combination of 2DLT with these drugs brought about synergism or strong synergism against infection of both X4 and R5 HIV-1 strains (
