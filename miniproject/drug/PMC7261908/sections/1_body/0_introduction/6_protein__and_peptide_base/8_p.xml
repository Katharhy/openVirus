 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Ferrer and Harrison (1999)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Biorn et al. (2004)</xref> identified a 12 amino-acid peptide, 12p1 (RINNIPWSEAMM), which could inhibit gp120 interaction with sCD4 and mAb 17b, a neutralizing antibody that targets the CoRbs on gp120, indicating that 12p1 could simultaneously bind to CD4bs and CoRbs. Later, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Ferrer and Harrison (1999)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Biorn et al. (2004)</xref> demonstrated that 12p1 could preferentially bind gp120 before gp120engagement of CD4, thus limiting the interaction of gp120 with the receptor CD4 and the coreceptor CCR5, both of which are crucial for viral entry. Therefore, 12p1 may act as an HIV-1 attachment inhibitor and/or inactivator. By optimizing the structure and activity of 12p1, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Chaiken and Rashad (2015)</xref> designed and synthesized a class of peptide triazoles which could simultaneously bind CD4bs and CoRbs on gp120 with higher affinity than that of 12p1, causing gp120 shedding from the viral particles, and thereby irreversibly inactivating the virions (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Aneja et al., 2015</xref>). This group has designed and synthesized a new peptide triazole denoted KR13 which can simultaneously induce the shedding of gp120 and the release of capsid protein p24 from HIV-1 pseudoviruses (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Bastian et al., 2011</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Later, they found that gold nanoparticle-conjugated KR13 (AuNP-KR13) exhibited more potent virus-inactivating effect than that of peptide KR13 alone because AuNP-KR13 had many more gp120-binding sites than KR13 (
