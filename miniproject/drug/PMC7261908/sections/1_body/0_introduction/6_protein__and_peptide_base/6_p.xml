<p>According to the structural similarity between CD4’s the CDR2-like loop in CD4 and scyllatoxin’s the β-hairpin region of scyllatoxin, a short scorpion toxin, the side chains of nine residues in CD4 that are critical for, central in the gp120 binding to HIV-1 gp120, was transferred to the structurally homologous region in the scorpion toxin scaffold (

The resulting miniprotein (27 residues), CD4M9 inhibited CD4 binding to gp120 with an IC50 of 40 μM and suppressed the infection of HIV-1 X4 and R5 strains with IC50s ranging from 0.4 to 5 μM. Subsequently, they designed bivalent and trivalent CD4-mimetic miniproteins based on CD4M9 and tested their antiviral activity
