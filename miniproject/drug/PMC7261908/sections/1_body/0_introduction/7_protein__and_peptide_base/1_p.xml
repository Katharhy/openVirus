<p>Influenza viruses belong to the

 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">Palese and Shaw, 2007</xref>). Influenza virus infection can lead to a high fever, cough, headache, sore throat etc. after 1–3-day incubation period. Influenza viruses are classified as types A, B, C, and D, on the basis of antigenic properties of the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix protein (M). Since most annual influenza epidemics in humans are caused by influenza A viruses (IAVs) (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Dou et al., 2018</xref>), we mainly discuss IAVs here. A vital challenge in combating IAVs is the constant evolution of the surface antigens, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), to resist pressure from the host immune system, which is described as antigenic drift and antigenic shift. Therefore, IAVs are classified into subtypes based on the genetic and antigenic differences of HA and NA, including 18 subtypes of HA (H1–H18) and 11 subtypes of NA (N1–N11) (
