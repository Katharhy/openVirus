<p>Because HA plays a key role in viral attachment and membrane fusion, it is the promising target for the development of protein- and peptide-based IAV inactivators. Recently, 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Holthausen et al. (2017)</xref> isolated an amphibian special host defense peptide (HDP), urumin, from skin secretions of a frog native to southern India. This is a 27-amino acid peptide with net positive charges. Different from most HDPs that exert their virucidal activity by non-specific interaction with the viral lipid membranes, urumin could specifically interact with the conserved stalk region of H1N1 HA and then destroy the influenza virions. Interestingly, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> application of urumin could protect naive mice from challenge with a lethal dose of IAV infection, suggesting that urumin has good potential for further development into a first-line antiviral treatment during influenza outbreaks.
