<p>At present, there are mainly two types of anti-influenza drugs used in clinics, including (1) M2 ion channel inhibitors, such as amantadine (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Bright et al., 2006</xref>) and rimantadine, which block viral uncoating, and (2) neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), including oseltamivir (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">de Jong et al., 2005</xref>), zanamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir octanoate, which inhibit viral release. However, the continual emergence of drug resistance seriously limits their effectiveness and clinical applications (
 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al., 2017</xref>). In 2018, a new antiviral drug, baloxavir marboxil (trade name Xofluza), which can inhibit viral replication in cells, was approved by Japanese and United States FDA and proved effective against infection by influenza virus strains resistant to current anti-influenza drugs (
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">Ng, 2019</xref>). Still, several cases of drug resistance to baloxavir marboxil have been reported recently (
 <xref rid="B142" ref-type="bibr">Takashita et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">Sato et al., 2020</xref>). Also, these drugs mentioned above must inhibit viral infection in the presence of target cells, instead of inactivating cell-free influenza virions.
