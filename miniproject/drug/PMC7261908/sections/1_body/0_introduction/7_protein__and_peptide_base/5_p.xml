<p>Using a computer-aided strategy based on the structural information of the binding site of neutralizing antibodies (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Ekiert et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">Sui et al., 2009</xref>), Baker and colleagues designed proteins named HB36 and HB80, which could bind to a conserved surface patch of the HA stem from the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Fleishman et al., 2011</xref>). Results showed HB36 and HB80 bound H1 and H5 HAs with low nanomolar (nM) affinity. Based on their mechanism of action, proteins designed in this way are expected to possess viral inactivation abilities; however, a viral inactivation experiment was not performed in this study. Therefore, the actual inactivation activities of HB36 and HB80 were uncertain, which requires further investigation.
