  <p>Comparison of current antiviral drugs and the protein- and peptide-based inactivators, taking HIV as the example. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Major targets and mechanisms of the current anti-HIV drugs. They must act in the presence of target cells: receptor antagonists bind the cell surface receptor to prevent the virus binding and fusion inhibitors target the fusion process, while other inhibitors target viral replication in HIV-infected cells, including nucleoside transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and nucleoside transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors (INIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Targets and action mechanisms of the protein- and peptide-based HIV inactivators. They can actively attack and inactivate cell-free virions that they meet in the blood, by blocking the RBS on viral Envs, changing the Env conformation or destructing the viral structure.
