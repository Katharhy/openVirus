<p>It has been reported that 14.8–53% of SARS-CoV-2 patients had liver injury indicated by abnormal liver function tests—mainly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hypoalbuminemia, and elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) [

 <xref rid="B24-pathogens-09-00430" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These abnormalities seem to occur during either the viremia or inflammatory phase. Reduced albumin can be due to inflammatory response while raised levels of GGT and bilirubin are associated with biliary damage. This is confirmed in recent reports that SARS-CoV-2 has a much greater affinity for biliary cells (cholangiocytes), which have higher expression of ACE2 receptors compared with hepatocytes [

Significant liver injury with raised levels of ALT, Bilirubin, variable levels of alkaline phosphatase and GGT has been reported in 58–78% of patients with severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19 disease, being a surrogate marker for adverse outcome [
