<p>At present there is little data regarding the use of immunomodulatory agents such as tocilizumab or sarilumab when trying to suppress the ‘cytokine storm’ in these patients [

They also noted that while all biomarkers of inflammation were elevated, procalcitonin was the only marker which differed between moderate and severe disease and suggested that the chronically immunosuppressed may undergo a uniquely dysfunctional inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2. This was further supported by Lippi et al., who showed that high levels of procalcitonin can be a predictor of severe COVID-19 syndrome and potentially related to secondary bacterial infection [
