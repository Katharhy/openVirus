<p>Boettler et al. have published comprehensive recommendations for management and surveillance of patients with liver disease throughout the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak [
 <xref rid="B28-pathogens-09-00430" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This paper now forms the official position of the European Association for the Study of Liver and the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Disease [
 <xref rid="B49-pathogens-09-00430" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. They suggest prioritization of outpatient clinics, inpatient admission depending on presence of certain risk factors, reducing exposure through social distancing (remodelling waiting areas, reduction of waiting times, reduction of face to face contact through telemedicine), and carefully considering the benefits of patient care weighed against the risk of infection.
