<p>Recently, a test has been developed based on Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR/Cas12a), with visual readouts. The test can detect 10 copies of the virus gene in merely 45 min, providing simple and reliable diagnostic method, which additionally demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity. In order to enable fast diagnosis at the hospital or on admission, the test has been provided with an ssDNA reporter labeled with a blank green fluorescent particle, which will be split off by the Cas12a protein, when the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 is found in the detection system. In this way, a green signal of fluorescence will be obtained, visible with the naked eye, in the light, with a wavelength of 485 nm. The high specificity of the test was obtained by designing 15 crRNAs, which may distinguish the polymorphisms of a single nucleotide with other viruses related to SARS in four domains: ORF1a or ORF1b, N, and E genes [
