<p>Serological tests, detecting solely the IgM class of antibodies, should find applications for diagnostic purposes. When using tests which detect both IgM and IgG antibodies, one should remember that a positive result may be the evidence of past infection, not active infection (
 <xref rid="diagnostics-10-00434-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Negative results from serological tests do not exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection, as the ‘window period’ (delay in the production of antibodies) may exceed 7 days. Serological tests may also give false positive results. This may be the case of past or ongoing infection with virus strains other than SARS-CoV-2, such as coronavirus HKU1, NL63, OC43, or 229E. Moreover, the first tests assessing the titer of IgA class antibodies have been launched, which, from the perspective of immunology, is of extreme importance, as it provides the possibility of testing for antibodies in a material other than blood samples collected from patients, e.g., respiratory tract secretions.
