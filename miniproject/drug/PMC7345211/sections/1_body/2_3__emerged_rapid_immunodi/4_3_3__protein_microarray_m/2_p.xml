<p>The newly developed PEPperCHIP
 <sup>Â®</sup> SARS-CoV-2 Proteome Microarray (PEPperPRINT) based on the SARS-CoV-2 genome derived from the virus isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank ID: MN908947.3) enables us to serologically screen about 5000 individual peptides spanning the whole viral proteome. Sequences of ORF1ab protein, surface glycoprotein, ORF3a protein, coat protein, membrane glycoprotein, ORF6 protein, ORF7a protein, ORF8 protein, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, and ORF10 protein have been elongated and connected by means of neutral GSGSGSG connectors. The elongated protein sequences have been transcribed into 4883 different peptides composed of 15 amino acids printed in two repetitions (9766 peptide sites) in order to obtain high-resolution epitope data. In the case of SARS-CoV, which emerged in 2002, it was demonstrated that the application of PMM is characterized by enhanced sensitivity, as more Chinese subjects were diagnosed as SARS-positive when applying PMM in comparison with ELISA tests. The PMM seems to be more reliable, as it allows us to determine more protein antigens of the virus [

Unfortunately, the method has several imperfections, including the repeatability of the test itself, while the cost of the testing and equipment used for micromatrix diagnostics is significant, which makes the PMM method less accessible in standard laboratory settings [
