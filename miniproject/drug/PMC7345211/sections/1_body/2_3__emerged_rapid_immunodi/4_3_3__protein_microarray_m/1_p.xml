<p>The protein microarray method (PMM) is a proteomic screening technique serving the purpose of simultaneous/parallel quantitative and qualitative analysis of mixtures containing many proteins. The chip used is composed of a supporting surface (e.g., modified glass plate, nitrocellulose membrane, or microtitration plate), on which the matrix of ‘capturing’ proteins is immobilized in accordance with the determined formula, performing the function of a probe. The material captured may be antibodies, enzymes, or ligands. Protein analyte, added to the matrix, may be modified by means of various types of markers (among others: radioisotopes, fluorescence, luminescence markers). The interaction between micromatrix proteins and analyte induces an analytical signal, registered by means of suitable equipment. The advantages of protein micromatrices include the short time required for analysis, modest consumption of samples and reagents, high sensitivity, automation of testing. They allow us to investigate the functions and effects of proteins on large scale [
