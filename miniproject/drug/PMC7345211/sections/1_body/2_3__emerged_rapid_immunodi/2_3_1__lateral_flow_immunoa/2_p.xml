<p>At present, most immunoenzymatic tests available are based on the immunochromatic technique. The difference between those tests depends upon the molecule assayed (p/c or antigens), structure, performance time, and diagnostic material. It may be supposed that, in future, rapid tests will enable easier and quicker diagnostics of many diseases, without the necessity of performing tedious and complicated procedures. This would reduce the waiting time for obtaining results, and accelerate decision making regarding suitable treatment [
