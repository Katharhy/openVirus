<p>As in the case of other infectious diseases, the RT-qPCR method, as well as serological tests, are suitable for the in vitro diagnostics (IVD) of patients suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Genetic assay based on the RT-qPCR technique, performed in real time, especially plays a role at the early stages of viral infection, when the virus multiplies quickly, as this technique enables direct detection of the pathogen’s genetic material. A different approach in diagnosing infection is represented by serological methods, based on detecting—in blood serum—of antibodies that act specifically against viral proteins, which are produced in response to SARS-CoV-2. Serological IVD tests detect antibodies which are responsible for neutralizing the virus; therefore, this implies that they are used when the immunological reaction against SARS-CoV-2 virus is already taking place. These IVD measures can determine how fast antibodies fighting the virus are produced, which may influence the identification of subjects who already developed immunity. The results of serological IVD tests should not be used as basis for diagnosing, ruling out infection with SARS-CoV-2, or informing about infection status [
