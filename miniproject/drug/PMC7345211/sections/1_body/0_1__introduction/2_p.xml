<p>The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity and accuracy concerning suspected COVID-19 infection, based on controlled testing and performance data from clinical settings, is of substantial importance in the context of limiting the scope of coronavirus epidemics. Unreliable and unproved tests may not detect patients with active infection or may incorrectly indicate COVID-19-negative patients as positive, hampering healthcare efforts. The diagnostic laboratory and point-of-care tests (POCTs) used in order to detect SARS-CoV-2 are, first of all, reference tests based on molecular technique real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-qPCR) as well as serological antibody-detecting and antigen-detecting tests, for auxiliary purposes. At present, only molecular quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) testing of respiratory tract samples is the recommended method for the identification and laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 cases, as these methods were evaluated for their quality and safety through the World Health Organization (WHO) protocols [

On the other hand, based on current scientific evidence, WHO recommends the use of POC immunodiagnostic tests for research purposes and, at present, they should not be utilized in a clinical decision-making setting and in patient care until fully validated, with supporting data available. However, they can be useful in epidemiologic research or disease surveillance and further evolve as a critical step to develop COVID-19 vaccine in future. At the time of increased demand for hospital services, clinicians, governments and health services urgently need a fast, sensitive, but at the same time inexpensive diagnostic test, in order to rapidly manage patients, regarding admissions to hospitals meant for COVID-19 treatment. Therefore, the role of an approved and reliable diagnostic test in the COVID-19 care pathway is of the utmost importance.
