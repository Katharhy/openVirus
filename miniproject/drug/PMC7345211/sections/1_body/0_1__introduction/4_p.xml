<p>The relatively quick discovery of the composition of the full genome of SARS-CoV-2 early during the epidemics made it easier to develop specific starters and normalized laboratory protocols for COVID-19. The protocol of the first RT-qPCR test, focused on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) of SARS-CoV-2 was published very early indeed, at the end of January 2020. Providing a brief description, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is equipped with a receptor-binding domain (RBD), a structure similar to the ‘original’ SARS-CoV that emerged for the first time in 2002. Functionally important ORFs (1a and 1b) and other main structural proteins, including the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, are also well interrelated and clearly annotated. According to previous reports, the M and E proteins are essential for virus assembly, while the S protein is crucial for affinity and attachment to host cells, as the RBD of the S protein enables binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S protein on the surface of the viral particles and has been reported to be highly immunogenic. The N protein, the main structural protein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the transcription and replication of viral RNA, the packaging of the encapsulated genome into virions, and interactions with the cell cycle of host cells. In addition, coronaviruses contain the N protein, which has a substantial immunogenic ability and is abundantly expressed during viral infection (
