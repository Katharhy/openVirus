<p>At present, work is going on worldwide to develop new methods which will simplify and speed up the detection of novel coronavirus. Currently, there are nearly 200 commercially available genetic tests, with further companies awaiting the completion of the procedure and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or In Vitro Diagnostics (IVD) certificate to be issued. It is worth noting that a large portion of available tests are provided merely with the Research Use Only (RUO) certificate, which in fact does not imply anything concerning test quality or its validation. More rigorous tests apply to products certified as IVD, complying with the ISO13485 norm. In addition, IVD reagents are subject to local regulations, such as CE marking in Europe, and hence they should comply with Directive 98/79/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 1998 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices, with an extensive evaluation, including the validation of clinical samples.</p>
