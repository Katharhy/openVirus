<p>The progress made in recent years in the diagnostics of infections enables the application, often simultaneously, of numerous methods in order to detect respiratory viruses effectively. The choice of suitable tests depends upon the type of virus to be detected, the presumed number of antigens, patient population to be tested, as well as the technical abilities and experience of the testing unit. The validation of RT-qPCR tests seems to be an important step in combating the new coronavirus. One of the most significant parameters regarding the efficiency of the diagnostic procedure is most probably the one related to the minimum amount of analyte, which may be detected and quantitatively determine by means of a particular test. The parameters describing those properties are known as limit of detection (”LoD”) and limit of quantification (”LoQ”). In many laboratories, LoD is used interchangeably with “sensitivity”, “analytical sensitivity”, or/and “detection limit.”. This may be misleading, though, as “sensitivity” is also understood and used in other ways. Sensitivity and clinical (diagnostic) specificity are two different parameters. Diagnostic sensitivity is the proportion of true positive results to the sum of true positive and true negative results. A sensitivity ratio of 100% implies that all the sick people have been identified. The specificity of a test is the proportion of true negative results to the sum of true negative and false positive ones. The specificity of 100% implies that all healthy people in a given test have been correctly identified as healthy/not having the condition. As indicated in 
 <xref rid="diagnostics-10-00434-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, sensitivity and specificity of tests is already about 100%, with a few exceptions, still one can notice differences in analytical sensitivity of the test (LOD). The vast majority of molecular tests kits contain a so-called ‘internal positive control’ (IPC), that can be utilized either as an extraction control or internal control. The IPC is essential for an evaluation of whether the genetical material extraction procedure and amplification stage were carried out correctly. The failure in IPC detection using a patient’s specimen may indicate the improper extraction of nucleic acid from clinical material as a consequence of nucleic acid loss or the transposition of PCR inhibitors and the lack of sufficient biological material in the collected sample. It needs to be noted that many molecular tests may not provide sets for extraction stages, and they need to be acquired separately. However, all tests reviewed here that detect the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 contain IPC.
