<p>It is equally important to understand that RT-qPCR tests have also certain limitations. They are the most useful in case of positive results, although they appear to have less diagnostic value in situations when COVID-19 must be ruled out. Negative RT-qPCR test results do not necessarily indicate that person has not contracted an infectious disease, as other individual factors also need to be considered, such as exposure risk and potential laboratory errors. The false negative results may occur if the sample has not been properly collected, transported, or handled/treated, or as a result of the improper extraction of nucleic acid from clinical materials [

Moreover, the false positive results can be related to the situation where the sample contains inhibitors of amplification, or an insufficient amount of virus molecules. On the contrary, a false positive result may be due to the cross-contamination of the sample during its handling or preparation, or between patient samples. What is more, the influence of vaccines, antiviral drugs, antibiotics, chemotherapeutic agents, or immunosuppressive drugs has not been taken into consideration. Moreover, the set/kit does not exclude diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens. The negative results do not exclude infection and should not be the sole basis for patientsâ€™ treatment. Test results when using the kit serve clinical purposes only. Clinical diagnosis and treatment of patients should be considered in conjunction with the manifestations and symptoms, medical history, response to treatment or other laboratory tests [

In general, the sensitivity of this molecular method may vary depending on specimen collection (broncho-alveolar lavage, sputum, nasal swabs or throat swabs) and, what is more, the accuracy depends upon stage of infection, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 multiplication, and also the degree of clearance. Interestingly, the provided values of RT-qPCR accuracies seem to be higher for in vitro validation by utilizing SARS-CoV-2-dedicated primers and cultures in highly controlled laboratory settings [
