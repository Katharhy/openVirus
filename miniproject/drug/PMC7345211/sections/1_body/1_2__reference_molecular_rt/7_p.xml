<p>BioMaxima has invented a test whose main advantages include a short waiting time; the results can be obtained in a mere 2 h. Moreover, the analytical sensitivity of the test, being at the level of â‰¥10 RNA copies per reaction, is higher than in other comparable systems. It seems important that the molecular test kit contains reagents with substantially enhanced stability, which allows us to transport it safely and store it at room temperature, whereas many other tests available on the market need to be stored in a freezer and to be transported in dry ice. Storing such reagents, even for a short time, in conditions that deviate from those indicated is risky and may result in generating false negative test results [
