<p>Educational institutions and university education have an important role in building a health system for students, by promoting healthy and preventive life practices in their daily life. University is an integrated community in which many segments of society live or interact with it, such as students, teachers, administrative staff, and parents. Because health education has always targeted broad groups in order to generalize awareness, positive attitudes, and behaviors of health and life, the university is an effective and essential center for communicating awareness and education messages effectively to a large segment of society if it is best communicated in a systematic scientific manner. The promotion of community health through the university environment works to devote health education to students, by highlighting its components faculty members, educational curricula, and school activities, which work to spread health awareness among students, and inform them of the need to take care of their health, preserve them, and inform them of their physical conditions.</p>
