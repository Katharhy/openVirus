<p>Arnout et al. (
 <xref rid="pa2332-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) attempted to show that the current crisis of the spread of the COVID‐19 virus pandemic has swept the world, leaving infections in large numbers, and global health systems have collapsed with them, and large and advanced countries have not faced the challenges of confrontation. As of March 28, 2020, the Coronavirus (COVID‐19) pandemic had caused more than 1.6 billion children and young adults to drop out of education in 161 countries, nearly 80% of students enrolled in schools worldwide. This came at a time when we are already suffering from a global education crisis. There are many students in schools, but they do not receive the basic skills they need in working life.
