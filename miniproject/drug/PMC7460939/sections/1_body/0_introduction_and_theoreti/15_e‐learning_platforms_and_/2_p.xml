<p>UNESCO noted that the wealth of digital educational resources has made new demands on education systems and institutions, which include developing innovative curricula, alternative educational paths, and innovative qualitative teaching methods, all of which can be facilitated via the Internet, distance education, and short skills‐based courses. The organization has developed a set of programs that help with distance learning, including the “Black Board” application, which is an application that depends on designing courses, assignments, tasks, preparing online tests and correcting them, and communicating with students through a virtual environment as well as by applications downloaded via smart phones.</p>
