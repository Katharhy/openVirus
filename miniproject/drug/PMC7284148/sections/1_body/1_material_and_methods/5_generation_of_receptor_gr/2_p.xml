<p>Protease and methyltransferase were subjected to the Sitemap module of Maestro 12.0 for the prediction of active binding sites. A total of 4 binding sites was generated, and the top one was selected for receptor grid generation. The grid was generated using the default setting of the receptor grid generation module of maestro 12.0, i.e. 0.25 was partial atomic charge and were 1.0 Å was Van der Waals radii of receptor atoms. The center of the sitemap position was selected to generate a grid box by using the receptor grid generation module of Maestro.</p>
