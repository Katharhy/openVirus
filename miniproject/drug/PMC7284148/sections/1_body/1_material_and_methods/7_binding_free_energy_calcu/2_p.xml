<p>Binding free energy of protease enzyme and docked ligands were calculated using the Prime MM-GBSA (Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area) modules of Maestro 12.0, which run on the OPLS_2005 molecular mechanicâ€™s energies, nonpolar solvation and VSGB solvent model [
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Prime MM-GBSA module was operated using pose viewer file of ligand and receptor (generated after docking) to generate binding free energy. The MM-GBSA analysis employs molecular mechanics and solvent accessibility methods to depict free energies. This analysis is efficient and quite reliable for studying the energetics of biomolecular systems. Prediction of the binding free energies in biomolecular such as, protein, protein-drug complexes is the application of this approach. The following descriptors were used to generate changes in energy upon binding.
