<p>Virtual screening of prepared library was operated by using virtual screening workflow (VSW) of GLIDE (maestro 12.0, Schrödinger, LLC, NY, USA). VSW has many tools to calculate the properties of ligands, and filter ligands such as QuikProp and prefilters by Lipinski rule were selected. VWS of Maestro has three type docking precision: (1). HTVS (High Throughput Virtual Screening) for fast screening of huge number ligand’s docking, (2) standard-precision (SP) for screening and docking of ligands of unknown quality in large numbers, and (3) extra-precision (XP) is a powerful and discriminating procedure for docking ligands. Extra precision (XP) docking was operated on prepared ligands by keeping default parameters, i.e. scaling factor at 0.80 and partial charge at 0.15. The binding affinity of docked ligands for the receptor protease at the active site was generated from the docking binding energy.</p>
