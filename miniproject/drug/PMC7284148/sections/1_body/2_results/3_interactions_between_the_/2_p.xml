<p>Protein-ligands interactions are generally highlighted by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds, which play a significant role in predicting the binding affinity of the ligand with proteins. All the selected compounds in the dataset were docked into the active site of the NSP10/NSP16 methyltransferase and the main Protease of SAR-CoV-2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figures 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">4</xref>) depicts the binding conformations of the selected compounds in the binding pocket of the NSP10/NSP16 methyltransferase and protease. The active site of the NSP10/NSP16 methyltransferase showed hydrophobic interaction with the help of Met248, Pro252, Phe251, Cys47, and Pro60 amino acids. The amino acids are present in the active site of Protease like Phe112, Phe8, and Phe294 are found to create hydrophobic interaction with top ligands. Besides Hydrophobic interactions, there are some hydrogen bonds present between amino acids and compounds. In the case of NSP10/NSP16 methyltransferase, mostly Gln88, Glu61, and thr48 formed hydrogen bonds with the atoms of ligands and in the active site of main protease complex Gln110, Thr111, Gln127, and Asn151 amino acids have been found to form a hydrogen bond with the atoms of ligands (
