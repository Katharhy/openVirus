<p>The crystal structure of the NSP10/NSP16 Methyltransferase (PDB ID: 6w6l) and main Protease (PDB ID: 6lu7) of SARS-CoV-2 was used for docking purposes. Molecular docking has been performed using the extra precision (XP) mode of grid-based ligand docking with energetics (GLIDE). We used known anti-viral, anti-infectious, and anti-protease inhibitors for the docking purpose (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">2</xref>). We selected the top 5 compounds with good docking scores, which were docked with proteases and NSP10/NSP16 methyltransferase. Our result highlighted that; Cyclocytidine, Hydrochloride, Trifluridine, Adonitol Meropenem, and Penciclovir yielded a preeminent dock score with the main Protease of SARS-COV-2 with docking score of −6.8, −6.0, −5.5, −5.2, and −5.1 Kcal/mol respectively (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) as well as Telbivudine, Oxytetracycline dihydrate, Methylgallate, 2-deoxyglucose, and Daphnetin docked with the NSP10/NSP16 methyltransferase with the docking score of −7.0, −6.0, −6.0, −5.8, and −5.7 Kcal/mol. Cyclocytidine hydrochloride (anti-viral and anti-cancer), Trifluridine (anti-viral), Adonitol (anti-bacterial), Meropenem (antibiotic and anti-bacterial), and Penciclovir (anti-viral) yielded a good docking score with the main Protease and Telbivudine, Oxytetracycline dihydrate (anti-viral), Methylgallate (anti-malarial), 2-deoxyglucose (anti-cancer), and Daphnetin (anti-inflammatory, and antitumor) showed good docking score with methyltransferase-stimulatory factor complex of NSP16 and NSP10 of SARS-CoV-2.
