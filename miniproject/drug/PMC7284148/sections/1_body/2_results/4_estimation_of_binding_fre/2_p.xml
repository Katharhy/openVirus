<p>MM/GBSA calculation was performed to estimate the free binding energy of ligands with docked proteins. Docked top five compounds from ligands library with proteins showed the binding-free energy values. Compounds selected in virtual screening has been found to show the good result of binding free energy with their respective Proteins (
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). All the compounds showed good binding free energy with their respective proteins of SARS-CoV-2.
