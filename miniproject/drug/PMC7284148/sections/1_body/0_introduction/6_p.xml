<p>It was proved that the availability of FDA-approved anti-RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (anti-RdRp) drugs could help in the treatment of patients and reduce the chances of the danger of the viral infection caused by SARS CoV2. These drugs can tightly bind to the RdRp and thus may be useful to treat the disease caused by the SARS CoV2. Furthermore, it has also been shown that Ribavirin, vitamin B12, and nicotinamide may be helpful against COVID 19 infections [

Moreover, it has also been shown that the anti-virals Velpatasvir and Ledipasvir are particularly attractive as therapeutics to combat the SARS CoV-2 with minimal side effects (fatigue and headache). The drugs Harvoni (Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir) and Epclusa (Velpatasvir/Sofosbuvir) with their dual inhibitory actions on two viral enzymes could be very effective [
