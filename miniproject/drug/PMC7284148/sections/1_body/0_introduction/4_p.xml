<p>The coronaviruses have been found to encode two proteases (translated nonstructural proteins), i.e. a papain-like protease (Plpro) and main proteases. The main protease is also known as 3-C-like protease (M-pro) [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It has been shown that the main Protease (Mpro, also called 3CLpro) is one of the best-characterized drug targets among coronaviruses [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Protease is necessary for the processing of polyproteins, which are translated from the SARS CoV-2 RNA [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The main Protease of SARS CoV-2 operates at about 11 sites of cleavage on the large polyprotein 1ab (replicase 1ab, size = ∼790 kDa) and the recognition sequence is found to be Leu-Gln↓Ser-Ala-Gly) (where ↓ marks the site of cleavage). It has been seen that inhibiting the activity of the main protease enzyme could be an effective measure to check viral replication [
