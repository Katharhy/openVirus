<p>Moreover, the NSP10/NSP16 methyltransferase complex was found to docked with Telbivudine, Oxytetracycline dihydrate (anti-viral), Methylgallate (anti-malarial), 2-deoxyglucose (anti-cancer), and Daphnetin (anti-inflammatory, and antitumor) from the docking score of −7.0 to −5.7 (Kcal/mol). Hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding have been observed between the protein complexes and our selected compounds. These hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding have been found to show a strong bonding between the atoms of compounds and protein molecules [
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This ligand-protein interaction also shows good DG free binding energy and the strength of bonding between the protein and ligands. All the chosen compound also follows the criteria of Lipinski’s rule of five and show properties to have the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic parameters of drugability [
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Our ligands probably inhibit protease and NSP10/NSP16 methyltransferase molecules involved in the COVID-19. Moreover, it may be possible that applying inhibitors in combination will exert a synergetic effect against the SARS CoV-2.
