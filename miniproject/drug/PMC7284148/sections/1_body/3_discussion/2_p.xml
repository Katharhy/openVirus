<p>Drug discovery has become an important area in the field of COVID 19 spreading worldwide. So, the identification of drug targets is a crucial phase to modulate the expression of any targets. Many scientists are involved in searching for a cure for COVID 19. Most of the researchers are targeting protease complex and NSP10/NSP16 methyltransferase, which play a crucial role in inhibits the infection of the virus of COVID 19 [

It has been observed in this study that protease complex with Cyclocytidine hydrochloride (anti-viral and anti-cancer), Trifluridine (anti-viral), Adonitol (anti-bacterial), Meropenem (antibiotic and anti-bacterial), and Penciclovir (anti-viral) bound with a good docking score ranging from −6.8 to −5.1 (Kcal/mol).
