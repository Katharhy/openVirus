<p id="Par3">Humankind has previously witnessed the outbreak of many life-threatening pathogens including Ebola, Zika, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and, nowadays, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Memish et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2013</xref>; Organization; Sikka et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2016</xref>; Stawicki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2016</xref>; Su et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2016</xref>; Xiong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2020</xref>). The novel coronavirus has initially spread from China and propagated rapidly throughout the globe and has received worldwide attention due to its alarming levels of transmission and aggressive behavior in causing acute respiratory disease. The virus was then officially declared pandemic as a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO). Researchers throughout the globe are working around the clock to develop potential vaccines and drugs to fight the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 disease. However, developing a new drug or vaccine usually takes a long time as it should be intensively tested and confirmed to be safe through clinical trials before they can be approved for human use (Control and Prevention

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2014</xref>). Therefore, repurposing FDA-approved drugs seems to be a quicker way to treat patients who otherwise have no option. The SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus that relies on its spike (S) protein to attach and enter the target cells (Chiang 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>; Hoffmann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>; Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>). The virus S protein binds to the host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, allowing the virus particles to enter the cells (Chiang 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>; Hoffmann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>; Wan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2020</xref>). Thus, blocking the ACE2 receptor reveals a potential therapeutic target for drug discovery to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility. Besides, two coronavirus proteases, designated 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) and a papain-like protease (PLpro), were previously considered vital targets to combat the SARS and MERS coronavirus epidemics (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>). These two proteases were shown to be highly conserved with the novel SARS-CoV-2, especially in the functional regions (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>). Viruses use their proteases to break down their viral peptides into functional units essential for replication and packaging inside the host cells, and thus considered antiviral drug targets. Molecular docking is a popular bioinformatic modeling tool broadly used in structure-based drug design (Kitchen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2004</xref>; Mubarak et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>; Naik 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>; Naik and Pardasani 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2017</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2018</xref>; Naik and Zu 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). It is an efficient way to predict the type of interaction, binding affinity and the appropriate target-binding sites between the drug and corresponding receptor using, for instance, scoring functions (Kitchen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2004</xref>; Lengauer and Rarey 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1996</xref>). Elucidating the binding behavior plays an important role in the rational design of drugs as well as to explicate fundamental biochemical processes (Kitchen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2004</xref>; Lengauer and Rarey 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1996</xref>). In this study, molecular docking was performed on dozens of FDA-approved drugs and the top ten hits, previously used in the treatment of malarial, fungal/bacterial and Ebola infections and FDA-approved/fast-tracked for human treatment, were selected. For the selected drugs used in this study, the MOE modeling program was used to predict the binding sites and their docking score.
