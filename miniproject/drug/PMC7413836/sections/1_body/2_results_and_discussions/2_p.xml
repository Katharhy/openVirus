<p id="Par8">Brincidofovir (BCV) is an orally bioavailable, long-acting nucleotide analog broad-spectrum antiviral developed by Chimerix Inc. of Durham, North Carolina, USA, for the treatment of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses (Lanier et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2010</xref>). BCV is less toxic with an enhanced cellular penetration prodrug of cidofovir, wherein the cidofovir acyclic nucleoside monophosphate is conjugated through its phosphonate group to a lipid, 3-(hexadecyloxy)-1-propanol (Florescu and Keck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2014</xref>). Being linked to a lipid particle, the compound ensures better and higher intracellular releases of cidofovir and lower plasma concentrations of the active drug, effectively increasing its antiviral activity. When intracellular, the released free cidofovir from the BCV is phosphorylated to its active metabolite cidofovir diphosphate, which, due to its structural similarity to the deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) nucleotides, gets incorporated into the growing viral DNA strands (Parker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2008a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">b</xref>). Once incorporated, it prevents further DNA polymerization and disrupts DNA replication of viruses. The drug received FDA Fast Track Designation and has been evaluated in healthy individuals in Phase I studies and in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients and other immunocompromised patients in Phase II/III clinical trials and revealed to be well tolerated and highly efficacious against adenoviruses, BK virus, herpes simplex viruses, and smallpox, but eventually somehow failed for cytomegalovirus (Chittick et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2017</xref>; Hoiberg and Rapaka 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1991</xref>; Schepers). Preliminary in vitro tests have also shown the drug potential for the treatment of Ebola virus disease, despite that Ebola is an RNA virus, albeit trials were eventually discontinued (Dunning et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2016</xref>). Being acted on the Ebola RNA virus so, it is encouraging to act as well on the novel RNA SARS-CoV-2. In addition to its intracellular therapeutic strategy of arresting viral replication and packaging, our study shows here that it also interferes efficiently with the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 receptor, revealing a different therapeutic mode of action through potentially blocking or inhibiting the virus entry to the host cell, thereby slowing the progression of the infection.
