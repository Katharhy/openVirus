  <p>veSEQ-HIV includes a sequencing protocol and bioinformatics pipeline, yielding information on individual and population levels. (A) The veSEQ-HIV method was developed to provide multiple measurements from a single assay, including viral load, HIV genotype, drug resistance, and transmission inference. (B) Overview of veSEQ-HIV: a complete laboratory and computational pipeline for high-throughput sequencing. RNA extraction from plasma samples is carried out in a CL-3 certified laboratory, before transfer to a dedicated genomics facility for library preparation, bait capture, and finally sequencing. Raw sequencing data are preprocessed to remove host and contaminant RNA, and these computationally filtered reads together with their 
   <italic>de novo</italic>-assembled contigs are used to determine the consensus genome and minority variant frequencies using 
   <italic>shiver</italic>. QC metrics are then calculated, and the proportion of contaminant reads originating from other samples is estimated with Kallisto. Samples which result in a successful read mapping are then cleaned with 
   <italic>phyloscanner</italic> to remove contaminant reads, and clean reads are used to infer transmission patterns with 
   <italic>phyloscanner</italic>, and to make drug resistance predictions with HIVdb and drmSEQ.
