  <p>veSEQ-HIV is both sensitive and specific. Figure shows the length of recovered HIV genome for all sequenced samples. We consider a position in the genome to be accurately determined when the read depth is at least five. The category “Other” consists of potential intersubtype recombinants. Quantitative standards (HXB2, subtype B) are included in all sequencing runs, but are not displayed in this analysis.</p>
