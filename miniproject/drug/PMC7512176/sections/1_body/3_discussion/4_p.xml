<p>The throughput of veSEQ-HIV is suitable for large-scale public health applications. In our research setting, a single technician is able to process 360 samples per week. Routine combination testing to provide information on viral suppression, drug resistance, and transmission in near real time is feasible with veSEQ-HIV. This could prove useful as drug resistance surveillance is scaled up to guide and monitor new interventions, including preexposure prophylaxis, long-acting antiviral drugs, and alternative treatment regimens. High-resolution characterization of transmission events could augment precision public health programs and focused responses to local outbreaks. However, we caution that patient groups should be regularly consulted on the ethical use of this technology, to provide maximum benefit while minimizing risks to individuals (
