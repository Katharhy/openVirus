<p>We have developed, optimized, and validated veSEQ-HIV, a fast, robust, cost-effective, and high-throughput laboratory and computational process for recovering complete HIV genomes, estimating viral load, detecting ART drug resistance mutations, and constructing transmission networks. The method has been shown to work with 1,620 genetically diverse samples collected from 10 Zambian clinics participating in HPTN 071-2 (PopART phylogenetics), producing whole genomes from &gt;90% of samples with viral loads of &gt;1,000 copies/ml. The assay works with residual plasma taken from routine CD4 cell count testing obtained in field laboratory conditions, without introducing undue contamination or degradation of the samples or the need for additional blood draws.</p>
