<p>The detection and quantification limits of veSEQ-HIV are comparable with those of clinical viral load assays (40 to 100 copies/ml), and inclusion of reference standards shows quantification is reproducible between runs. Sequencing from direct virus-PCR was previously shown to be less quantitative than veSEQ because of PCR saturation effects and because, unlike veSEQ, template resampling cannot be corrected with bioinformatic methods (for example, 
 <italic>PICARD MarkDuplicates</italic>). Sequencing viral amplicons can be made quantitative with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) that barcode single cDNA templates (

 <sup>2</sup> value of 0.89 in a comparison with the Roche AmpliPrep TaqMan system, which is well within range of reported

 <sup>2</sup> values between commonly used clinical viral loads (0.80 to 0.94) (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Additionally,
