<p>In summary, veSEQ-HIV is a cost-saving high-throughput protocol that, with current technologies, produces a sequence-derived viral load, a high-resolution drug resistance genotype, and data that can be used to provide highly granular insights into HIV epidemiology. The method has proven robust to field conditions in Zambia and carries no additional testing burden for patients. Sequencing will provide insights into the outcome of the HPTN 071 PopART trial (
