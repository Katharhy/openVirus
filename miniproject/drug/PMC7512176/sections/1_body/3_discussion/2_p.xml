<p>Our method has several advantages over previous high-throughput approaches (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). First, our probes were designed using an algorithm proven to tolerate levels of virus diversity even greater than that observed for HIV (e.g., HCV) (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and are therefore expected to be unbiased with respect to the range of HIV variants commonly found in the region. Abbott Laboratories has recently reported on a similar method, developed in parallel to ours, which they show works across a wider panel of reference genomes (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Second, because our quantitative method minimizes the biases involved in PCR and computationally controls for contamination, our estimates of the frequency of minority genetic variants are likely to be more robust. Third, veSEQ is cost-effective. In our laboratory in Oxford, the reagent and consumables cost of the entire assay, from frozen blood to final data, is approximately 30 GBP in 2020, less than a fifth of the cost of the 2015 WHO budget for generating a full-genome sequence and viral load result (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Our costing includes a technician salary, but not the initial costs of setting up a laboratory (equipment etc.)
