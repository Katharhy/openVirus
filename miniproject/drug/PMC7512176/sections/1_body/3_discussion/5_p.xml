<p>There remain important limitations to our approach. While we have validated our methods to minimize contamination and provide quality control tools to detect mix-ups as quickly as possible, the risk of large-scale mix-ups increases with higher throughput. This should be mitigated with sample barcoding and sample tracking. Second, veSEQ-HIV is not licensed for clinical viral load, genotyping, or drug resistance testing. However, as part of the HPTN-078 study, drug resistance mutations detected by veSEQ-HIV were concordant with those detected by the FDA-accredited HIV genotyping test, ViroSeq. This study also validated viral load estimates against the Abbot RealTime Assay and found that veSEQ-HIV obtained complete drug resistance information 93.3% of the time in samples with viral loads of &gt; 5000 RNA copies per ml (
