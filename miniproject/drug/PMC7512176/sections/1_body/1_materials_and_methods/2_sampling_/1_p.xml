<p>No additional blood samples were required for this ancillary study. Unused samples of blood collected from consenting individuals undergoing routine CD4 cell count testing were transported to the local hospital on the same day. Blood was centrifuged twice and two 500-μl aliquots of plasma were frozen at −80°C. Samples were transported to a central research laboratory (ZAMBART facility) in Lusaka, Zambia using a mobile −20°C freezer, and then shipped to the sequencing laboratory in the United Kingdom. Samples were processed approximately in order of collection and represented the diversity of the population recruited at the beginning of the study.</p>
