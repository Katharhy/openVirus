<p>Libraries retaining directionality were prepared using the SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq kit v2 - Pico Input Mammalian (Clontech, TaKaRa Bio) with the following protocol specifications. Total RNA was first denatured at 72°C with the addition of tagged random hexamers to prime reverse transcription, followed by cDNA synthesis according to the manufacturer’s protocol option with no fragmentation. The first strand cDNA was then converted into double-stranded dual-indexed amplified cDNA libraries using in-house sets of 96 i7 and 96 i5 indexed primers (
