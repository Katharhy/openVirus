<p>No depletion of ribosomal cDNA was carried out prior to target enrichment. Equal volumes (5 μl from a total of 12.5 μl) of each amplified library were pooled in 96-plex without prior cleanup. The pool was cleaned with a lower ratio of Agencourt AMPure XP than recommended by the SMARTer protocol, to eliminate shorter libraries (0.68×). The size distribution and concentration of the 96-plex was assessed using a High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape assay on a TapeStation system (Agilent) and a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>
