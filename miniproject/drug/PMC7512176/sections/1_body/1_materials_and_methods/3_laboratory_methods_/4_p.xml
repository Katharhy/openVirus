<p>A total of 500 ng of pooled libraries was hybridized (SeqCap EZ reagent kit, Roche) to a mixture of custom HIV-specific biotinylated 120-mer oligonucleotides (xGen Lockdown Probes, Integrated DNA Technologies), then pulled down with streptavidin-conjugated beads as previously reported (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Unbound DNA was washed off the beads (SeqCap EZ hybridization and wash kit, Roche), and the captured libraries were then PCR amplified to produce the final pool for sequencing using a MiSeq (Illumina) instrument with v3 chemistry for a read length up to 300 nt paired-end. Alternatively, up to 384 samples were sequenced on HiSeq 2500 set to Rapid run mode using HiSeq Rapid SBS kit v2 with maximum read lengths of 250 nt.
