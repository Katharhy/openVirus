<p>Total RNA was extracted with magnetized silica from HIV-infected plasma lysed with guanidine thiocyanate and with ethanol washes and elution steps performed using the NUCLISENS easyMAG system (bioMérieux). The total 30 μl elution volume was reduced with Agencourt RNAClean XP (Beckman Coulter) to maximize the input RNA mass while minimizing volume for library preparation.</p>
