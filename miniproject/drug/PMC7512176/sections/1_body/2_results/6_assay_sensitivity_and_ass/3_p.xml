<p>Higher viral loads in general resulted in higher read depth and therefore in greater coverage across the genome. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> shows the dependence of this success rate on sequence-derived viral load in more detail. Sigmoid functions (fit to the data with least-squares) indicate the viral load thresholds above which at least 8,000-bp genomes tend to be recovered: these are between 1,000 and 10,000 copies/ml, depending on the desired depth of reads supporting the consensus. Partial genomes were frequently obtained from samples with viral loads between 100 and 1,000 copies/ml (
