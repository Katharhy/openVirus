<p>One of our aims was to ensure that veSEQ-HIV generated whole HIV genomes for the majority of samples within the range of viral loads observed in this population. The length of the recovered consensus sequence depends on the minimum read depth required to make a consensus call at each genomic position. We defined “read depth” as the number of mapped reads covering each position in the genome after removal of PCR duplicates. The point at which reads consistently matched the sample consensus saturated at a depth of five reads; we took this as our threshold for reliably inferring a consensus (Fig. S3). This may be a conservative estimate given that sequencing uninfected plasma (a negative control included in every run) resulted in no HIV reads after our multistage removal of contamination artifacts. However, we sought to produce not only accurate whole-genome consensus sequences, but also sufficient read depth for analyses of within-host diversity and characterization of low-frequency drug resistance mutations.</p>
