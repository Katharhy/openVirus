<p>Viral load is the concentration of virus in a sample and is usually measured with highly standardized and regulated clinical assays using quantitative PCR to amplify both the material to be tested and spiked internal standards of known viral load. Viral load tests are essential for rapid detection of resistance-associated treatment failure, but are expensive and not a part of routine care in many low-income countries.</p>
