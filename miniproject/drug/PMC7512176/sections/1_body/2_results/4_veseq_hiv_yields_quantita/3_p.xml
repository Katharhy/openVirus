<p>The relationship between number of reads and viral load was linear on a log-log scale with a slope of 0.83. This corresponds to some nonlinearity on a linear scale, consistent with some loss of information at high viral loads, possibly due to saturation effects or erroneous bioinformatic-compression of distinct reads into single “deduplicated” reads (which is expected, by chance, at very high sequencing depth). This does not affect the use of the number of viral fragments to infer viral loads, since the relationship is well described mathematically. We therefore defined “sequence-derived log viral load” as the linear transform of the log number of deduplicated sequence fragments (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). This distribution was bimodal, with the minor peak at very low viral load, corresponding to individuals with HIV read counts below the quantifiable limit of conventional assays. In line with procedures used to calibrate clinical viral load assays, a serial dilution of inactivated cultured virus was included in each run to ensure the quality of the assay, guard against batch effects, and quantify rates of contamination between samples.
