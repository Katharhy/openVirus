<p>Contamination can be physically introduced in the laboratory or occur due to index misassignment errors during sequencing, resulting in a number of reads being incorrectly attributed to a sample. The presence of these contaminant reads can undermine several important inferences: estimations of viral load (in particular distinguishing low viral load from aviraemia), detection of drug resistant minor variants, and the inference of transmission direction using within-host phylogenetics. We identified and blacklisted contaminant reads using the previously described routine “phyloscanner clean” in the 
 <italic>phyloscanner</italic> package (Fig. S2A). Out of the total set of HIV reads obtained from all samples, 1.2% of reads were blacklisted (median 6 reads per sample, mean 16 reads). As expected, the majority of contaminant reads were found in samples that had very few total HIV reads (Fig. S2B). To validate the blacklisting procedure, we looked at reads within the 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene, which contains the majority of drug resistance mutations. In “spike-in” experiments, where known fractions of contaminant reads were introduced and then recovered, “phyloscanner clean” correctly blacklisted 262 out of 274 contaminant reads, giving an overall sensitivity of 95.6%. The distribution of the spiked-in reads over the 50 samples is shown in Fig. S2C. Of the 291,815 noncontaminant reads, 291,742 were correctly identified, giving an overall specificity of over 99.9%.
