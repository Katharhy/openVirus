<p>The veSEQ-HIV protocol was developed to obtain multiple measurements from a single assay (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). It provides a quantitative viral load estimate across at least 5 orders of magnitude, frequency of drug resistance mutations at both consensus and minority variant levels, and accurate and unbiased genotype information that is suitable for ancestral state reconstruction and the generation of directed transmission networks.
