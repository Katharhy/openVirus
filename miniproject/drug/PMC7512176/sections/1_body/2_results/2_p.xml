<p>The method is the integration of a laboratory protocol with a bioinformatics pipeline (Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Briefly, RNA extraction is followed by library preparation, bait capture, and sequencing. The bioinformatics pipeline removes host and contaminant RNA, and constructs consensus genome and minority variant frequencies from
