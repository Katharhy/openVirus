<p>The quantitative nature of the veSEQ-HIV pipeline and its ability to identify and remove contamination artifacts are useful properties for characterizing drug resistance mutations at low frequency. In accordance with previously published guidance on generating drug resistance inferences from next-generation sequence data (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), we implemented a simple algorithm, based on the 
 <italic>HIVdb</italic> classification system (Stanford, US), to predict overall susceptibilities to antiretroviral drugs from the resistance mutations identified on individuals reads, after cleaning with 
 <italic>phyloscanner</italic>. A novel output of this approach was a detailed description of all mutations and combinations of mutations linked to within-host phylogenetic information that 
 <italic>phyloscanner</italic> uses to infer transmission. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> provides representative examples of two transmission pairs, for which the direction of transmission had been systematically determined from ancestral-state reconstructions of multiple phylogenies of reads, performed in sliding windows across the genomes. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref> depicts an example where a subclade of virus carrying the NNRTI resistance mutation K101E was transmitted to a female recipient. In the same transmission pair, subpopulations of wild-type susceptible virus and dual-class NRTI/NNRTI resistant virus (K65R/D67T/K70S/K101E and K70N/K101E) were not transmitted to the recipient, probably because they were detected in the transmitter at low frequency (&lt;5%). In another transmission pair (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>), V106M and G190A mutations were detected in the female recipient along with a number of additional mutations (D67G, K70E, A98G, Y115F, Y181C, and M184V) that were not found in the male transmitter, suggesting these additional mutations were acquired after the inferred transmission event. Consistent with this finding, the female recipient reported prior knowledge of her HIV-positive status and previous use of ART, although she was not on treatment at the time of sampling. Both individuals were sampled within 2 months of each other, and in the same health care facility.
