<p>Achieving sustained reductions in the incidence of HIV infections through programs of universal access to testing and antiretroviral treatment (UTT) remains a major goal in public health. International efforts have been focused on working toward the UNAIDS “90-90-90” targets, with 90% of people living with HIV (PLWH) diagnosed, 90% of those on antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 90% of those successfully virally suppressed (
