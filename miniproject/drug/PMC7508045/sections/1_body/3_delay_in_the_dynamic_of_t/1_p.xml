<p id="p0045">The hypothesis of a marked delay of the onset of the epidemic in Africa could be linked to less frequent exchanges between China and Africa (a mono-directional exchanges model where it is especially the Chinese who travel to Africa) than between China and Europe or China and the USA (a bi-directional exchange model). According to air travel flows from infected provinces in China to Africa and the African country's capacity to detect COVID-19, Gilbert et al. estimated that Egypt, Algeria, South Africa, Nigeria and Ethiopia presented the highest risk of importation of cases of COVID-19 from China [

 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The only African countries identified as at high risk were Ethiopia (28th) and South Africa (40th). Egypt, Algeria and Nigeria were estimated as at low risk (59th, 88th and 100th, respectively). However, this hypothesis is questionable: the African continent attracted 121 million Chinese visitors in 2017 (a tremendous growth compared with 2005 (31 million)) [

 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. But the status of Chinese visitors is different between Europe and Africa. Most Chinese visitors in Europe are either students, tourists or on business trips. In contrast, most Chinese visitors to Africa are construction workers, engineers, translators, or company executives who stay in Africa for a long time [

 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In 2017, Chinese tourists accounted for only 11 million flights for a total of 121 million visitors [

In contrast, many Chinese tourists leave China for Europe on vacation days before the Chinese New Year Day. Most of the first COVID-19 cases in Europe have been linked to Chinese tourists or people returning from China [
