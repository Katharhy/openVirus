<p id="p0030">The gathering of available information regarding the number of infected people varies between countries depending on several factors. First, screening strategies vary considerably between countries according to the availability of virus-screening assays. For instance, in western countries, some countries (like France) have recommended testing only people with mild to severe symptoms, whereas other countries (like Germany) have adopted an open strategy to detect asymptomatic persons and then isolate positive persons. At the beginning of February 2020, only two countries in Africa (Senegal and South Africa) had laboratories able to carry out RT-PCR tests, the reference standard in COVID-19 testing, in the absence of available and reliable rapid diagnostic tests [
