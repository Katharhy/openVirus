<p id="p0060">One hypothesis that has been rarely mentioned to explain the weakness of the epidemiological signal in Africa regarding the COVID-19 epidemic (and potentially a delay in its dynamic) is the fact that its population is extremely young. In 2015, 40% of its population was aged 0–14 years and 19% was aged 15–24 years, whereas those aged over 65 years accounted for only 3.5% The proportion of people over 65 years of age in 2019 was higher in Southeastern Asia (7%), in Central America (7%) and South America (9%) but remained much lower than in Europe (21%) [

Yet, there is a consensus to consider that COVID-19 is far less severe in children than in adults, and that in this group, most of them are asymptomatic. For example, in China, in a study conducted on 7736 individuals who had been hospitalized with COVID-19, only 0.9% were younger than 15 years [

Individuals over 65 years of age accounted for 15.1% of the patients and 27.0% of the total severity. In an investigation of 72 314 cases, Wu et al. reported that children under 9 and from 10 to 19 years old represented 1% of the total number of cases, respectively [
