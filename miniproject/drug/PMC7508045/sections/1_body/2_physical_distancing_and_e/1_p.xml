<p id="p0040">WHO anticipates a rapid increase in the number of individuals with COVID-19 on the African continent and Africa has responded quickly. African health ministers quickly implemented the Africa Taskforce for Coronavirus Preparedness and Response on 3 February 2020 [
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Physical distancing and enhanced hygiene are two of the response measures. Lockdown measures, like closing schools, churches, mosques or markets to promote social distancing or shutting down airports, have been rapidly implemented in some African countries [

 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>]. However, lockdown and working from home are unlikely to be implementable in many areas of Africa because of a cash economy, daily work requiring physical presence, and electricity or internet inaccessibility [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Sanitary measures including access to soap, water and hydroalcoholic gel, are also difficult to set up [

 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. For instance, the surveillance structure and screening measures in airports developed for Ebola virus disease became pillars in the COVID-19 response in Uganda [
