 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. High temperature and high humidity may reduce coronavirus transmission [
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], which could explain the relatively low number of confirmed cases in Africa. Around 60% of the world cases occurred in areas where temperature ranged from 5 to 15°C [
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The rate of confirmed cases significantly decreased with maximum temperature above 22.5°C [
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Mean daily cases and deaths were significantly lower in the hottest countries with highest temperatures reported between 29 December 2019 and 12 May 2020 (26.3°C; 407.1 daily cases and 17.8 daily deaths) than in the coldest countries with lowest temperatures (6.2°C; 1876.7 daily cases and 100.4 daily deaths) [
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The viral transmissibility is estimated by the reproduction number (R
 <sub>0</sub>), which represents the number of people that will be infected by an individual who has an infection. The SARS-CoV-2 R
 <sub>0</sub> was &gt;2 for temperatures below 0°C, decreased to R
 <sub>0</sub> = 1 for temperatures increasing from 0°C to 11°C, increased to R
 <sub>0</sub> = 1.6 for temperatures increasing from 11°C to 20°C, and gradually decreased to R
 <sub>0</sub> = 1 for temperatures above 20°C [
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. However, a study carried out in Australia suggested that even with high temperature, COVID-19 could persist [
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Another study showed that in Brazil, high temperatures and relative humidity favoured COVID-19 transmission [
