 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Analyses of different geographical populations demonstrated the existence of at least 32 variants of ACE2 (single mutation, deletion, truncation) [
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Expression of a specific variant allele in African subpopulations could alter the process of interaction between the viral S protein and the ACE2 receptor on the alveolar cells of the lung. In addition, expression quantitative trait loci variants were reported to regulate the expression of the ACE2 gene. ACE2 gene expression was down-regulated by variants rs11271234 and rs75979613 and up-regulated by the other variants [
