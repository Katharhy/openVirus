<p id="p0075">Moreover, the ACE1 gene, an analogue of ACE2, can have insertion (I) or deletion (D) of a 287-bp Alu repeat sequence in intron 16 [
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Three different genotypes exist: II, ID and DD. The number of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the number of deaths from COVID-19 were negatively associated with the ACE1 II genotype frequency [
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The European population has a lower ACE1 II genotype frequency and a higher prevalence of infected patients and mortality due to COVID-19 than the Asian population [
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. These data are consistent with an epidemiological study that reported a significant positive correlation of the D allele with SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence and mortality rate in Asian population [
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. The DD genotype was also increased in acute respiratory distress syndrome [
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Increase of ID genotype frequency was found to increase recovery rate after COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The frequencies of D allele were different between ethnic groups: it ranged from 72% to 77% in North African individuals (Moroccans, Egyptians, Algerians, Tunisians), 59% in West African individuals (Nigerians), 64% to 73% in East African individuals (Sudanese, Somalis), only 14% in South African individuals (Zambians), 29% in Chinese individuals, 9% in Samoan individuals, and 46% in Caucasian individuals [
 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. For instance, the DD frequency was 43% for Sudanese individuals [
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], 51% for Somali individuals [
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], 36% for Burkinabe individuals [
 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], 34% for South African individuals [
 <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] and 30% for European individuals [
 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Prospective studies are needed to investigate ACE genotype frequencies in different world areas and a potential role in delayed transmission. Moreover, other SARS-CoV-2 receptors could be involved in COVID-19 cases and mortality rate, like the transmembrane protease serine 2 (encoded by 
 <italic>TMPRSS2</italic>) [
 <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. 
 <italic>TMPRSS2</italic> up-regulating variants were found at higher frequencies in European and American populations than in the Asian and African populations, which implies that these populations might be relatively susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>].
