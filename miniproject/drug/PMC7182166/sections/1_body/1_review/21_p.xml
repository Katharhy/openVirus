<p>CoV proteins, structural, enzymatic, and accent proteins play key roles in the pathogenesis of the CoV disease (COVID). Structural proteins, in addition to their role in the maintenance of virion shape and morphogenesis, also contribute to the viral spread in vivo and antagonizing host cellular and immune responses. Nonstructural proteins include the small accent proteins that are not at all conserved among mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoVs and the 16 conserved proteins encoded in the replicase locus, a lot of which have an enzymatic role in RNA metabolism or protein processing, which further assists the viruses in antagonizing hosts immune responses during infectionsÂ [
