<p>The whole-genome sequencing and the genetic analysis studies had revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is genetically related to SARS-CoV of the 2003 outbreak [
 <xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 was also found to be closely related to the genus Betacoronavirus and was noted to be a distinct clade in lineage B of the subgenus Sarbecovirus, collectively with two other bat-derived SARS-CoV-like strains [
 <xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The origin of the virus is not yet clearly understood. The latest study showed that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2), a membrane exopeptidase, is the receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter into the human cells, much like its predecessor (SARS-CoV) [
