<p>Respiratory failure is the most important problem of COVID; at least half of the patients (mostly the elderly people) require supplemental oxygen during the intense phase, whereas around 20% of patients progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring invasive mechanical ventilator support. In contrast, the severity is usually mild in infected young children [

Virus shedding from the respiratory tract was found to peak around day 10 and later declined. Virus excretion from the gastrointestinal tract was also noted. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies had been detected 10-15 days after the onset of symptoms, and the patient’s improvement correlated with the decrease in virus load. The severity of the disease was found to correlate with increasing age, with increased mortality (up to 50%) in patients over 60 years of age [
