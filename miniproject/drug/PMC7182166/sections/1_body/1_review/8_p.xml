<p>All CoV genomes are organized further with the replicase locus encoded in the 5' end and the structural proteins encoded inside the 3' end of the genome. The structural proteins include the hemagglutinin esterase (HE) (only found in some beta-CoVs), spike (S), small membrane (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and internal (I) protein, encoded inside the 'N' gene. The nucleocapsid protein complexes with the genome RNA to form a helical capsid structure observed in the viral envelope. Trimers of the spike proteins form the peplomers embedded in the envelope, giving the virion its corona or crown-like morphology. In some CoV virions, the HE protein forms smaller spikes at the membrane. The “M” and “E” also are transmembrane proteins involved in virus assembly [
