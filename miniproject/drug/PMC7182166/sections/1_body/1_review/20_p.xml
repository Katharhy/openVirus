<p>CoVs demonstrate versatile host ranges and tissue tropism [
 <xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The preliminary attachment of the virion to the host cell is initiated by interactions between the “S” protein and its receptor [
 <xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The sites of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 vicinity of a CoV’s “S” protein vary with the virus strain. Some have the RBD at the N-terminus of S1 (MHV) and the others (SARS-CoV) have the RBD at the C-terminus of S1, as noted by the results of the recent research studies [
