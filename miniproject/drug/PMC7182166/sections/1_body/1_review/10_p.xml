<p>The genome consists of a 5′ cap structure together with a 3′ poly (A) tail, permitting it to behave as an mRNA, which is ready for translation of the replicase polyproteins. The replicase gene encoding the nonstructural proteins occupy two-thirds of the genome, approximately 20 kb, instead of the structural and accent proteins, which make up only approximately 10 kb of the viral genome. The 5′ end of the genome includes a leader series and untranslated region (UTR) that consists of multiple stem-loop systems required for RNA replication and transcription. Moreover, at the start of every structural or accent gene, there are transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRSs) that might be required for the expression of each of those genes. The 3′ UTR additionally consists of RNA structures required for replication and synthesis of viral RNA. The organization of the CoV genome is 5′-leader-UTR-replicase-S (Spike)-E (Envelope)-M (Membrane)-N (Nucleocapsid)-3′ UTR-poly (A) tail with accessory genes interspersed in the structural genes on the 3′ end of the genome. The accent proteins are nearly completely non-essential for the replication in tissue cultures, but some have been proven to play a crucial role in viral pathogenesis [
