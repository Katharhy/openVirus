<p>CoV virions are spherical, with diameters of about 125 nm, as depicted from the available research by employing cryo-electron tomography and cryo-electron microscopy. The maximum distinguished characteristic features of CoVs are the club-shaped spike projections emanating from the surface of the virion. Those spikes are a defining characteristic of the virion and deliver them the appearance of a solar corona, prompting the name coronaviruses. In the envelope of the virion is the nucleocapsid. CoVs have helically symmetrical nucleocapsids, which are unusual among positive-sense RNA viruses, however, a way more common for negative-sense RNA viruses [
