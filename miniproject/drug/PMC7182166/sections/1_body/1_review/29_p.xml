<p>The 10 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from the nine patients have been noted to be extremely identical and exhibiting more than 99.98% sequence similarity. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 was closely related (with 88% similarity) to two bat-origin SARS-like CoVs (Bat-SL-CoV), Bat-SL-CoVZC45 and Bat-SL-CoVZXC21, which were collected in 2018 from Zhoushan, eastern China. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 was found to be non-identical with SARS-CoV (about 79% similarity) and MERS-CoV (about 50% similarity). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the nCoV-19 fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives (Bat-SL-CoVZC45 and Bat-SL-CoVZXC21) and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Notably, homology modeling revealed that SARS-CoV-19 had a similar RBD structure to that of SARS-CoV despite amino acid variations at some key residuesÂ [
