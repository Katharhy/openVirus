<p>SARS is generally transmitted through direct or indirect contact of mucous membranes (eyes, nose, or mouth) with infectious respiratory droplets or fomites. Transmission risks increase with period and proximity with the contacts/infected persons [
 <xref rid="REF30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The time of survival of SARS-CoV-2 within the environment is presently unknown. Recent research showed that SARS-CoV can live up to two weeks after drying and five days at temperatures of 22-25°C and 40-50% relative humidity, with a gradual decline in the viability of the virus thereafter. The viability of SARS-CoV was found to decrease after 24 hours at 38°C and 80-90% relative humidity [
 <xref rid="REF31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The virus may remain viable on distinct surfaces for 48 hours at 20°C and 40% relative humidity, even though viability reduced to 8 hours at 30°C and 80% relative humidity conditions [

 <xref rid="REF32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This confirms the fact that at low temperature, low humidity conditions favor the virus survival in the environment.
