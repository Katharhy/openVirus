<p>Laboratory tests, which are currently available for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in various human clinical specimens (Sputum, throat swab, nasal secretions, feces, blood/serum/plasma), include real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), viral cultural techniques for the isolation of virus from clinical specimens, immunological tests for the detection of antibodies and antigens such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, indirect fluorescent antibody technique, rapid immunochromatographic tests, and immunofluorescence techniques [
