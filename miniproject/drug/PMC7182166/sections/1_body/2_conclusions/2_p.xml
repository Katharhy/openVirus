<p>As a future recommendation for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2, each country of the world should give attention to the diagnosis and prevention of the disease and have quarantine facilities where the suspected persons can be kept in isolation until the confirmation of the disease or otherwise, and all healthcare centers should have personal protective equipment during the diagnosis and identification of the disease. The governments of the respective countries of the world should give attention to the prevention of the disease by promoting or amending the laws concerning prevention strategies to combat the disease. The scientists, medical workers, and pharmaceutical organizations should work hard to prepare a vaccine for prevention and control and to discover a specific drug for the treatment of the disease. Most importantly, timely disease surveillance and preventive measures should be implemented all over the world to fight the disease globally.</p>
