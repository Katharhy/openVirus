<p id="p0030">Ethylene Diamine Tetraacetic acid (EDTA) was first synthesized in1935 and EDTA has been employed as an excipient in bronchial dilator solutions for decades (e.g., Albuterol, Metaproterenol). EDTA has been added to nebulized bronchodilator solutions in the United States as both nonsterile and sterile-filled products 
 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Accordingly, Edetate disodium (Na2EDTA) is often present as preservative or stabilizing agents in nebulizer solutions used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Historically, common nebulizer therapies used by asthma and COPD patients have had concentrations of EDTA available in nebulizer solutions that vary from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/mL 
 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. For example, Albuterol (manufactured by Dey Laboratories) contained 300 μg of EDTA, which is also far below the threshold dose for bronchoconstriction. Currently, Metaproterenol Inhalation Solution USP is expressly formulated with EDTA (edetate disodium) as a unit-dose bronchodilator to be administered by oral inhalation with the aid of an intermittent positive pressure breathing apparatus (IPPB). It contains 0.4% or 0.6% Metaproterenol sulfate in a sterile, acidic, aqueous solution containing edetate disodium, sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid, and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment
