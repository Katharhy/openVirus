<p id="p0020">When the S1/S2 site and S2â€² are activated by host proteases (e.g., TMPRSS2) there are changes in the cleavage site position relative to the fusion peptide to modulate the fusion loop (FL). This process gives CoVs the unique flexibility to invade different cell types and host species. Additionally, the CoVs fusion process employs a calcium-dependent fusion process that was only recently discovered for Rubella 
 <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and later described for SARS-CoV-1 infection 
 <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. While two fusion peptides (FLs) were found with SARS-CoV-1, influenza had no calcium-dependent membrane fusion process. The calcium dependent membrane-ordering results in more effective binding that can penetrate deeper into membranes. There are two FL domains in each SARS-CoV versus a single FL domain found in for HCoV-229E and Rubella shown in 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> below. Thus, this calcium-dependent requirement for the FL process may explain both the increased lethality of the beta CoVs and the apparent resistance of asthma patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to inhaling medications containing EDTA excipients.
