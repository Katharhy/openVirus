The strategies for Coronavirus treatment regimens have mainly relied on combination therapies with drugs known to have acceptable safety profiles include IFNs, ribavirin, and corticosteroids. However, the data from past regimens indicates that the treatments were not effective in treating SARS

Accordingly, the asthma paradox is unlikely due to steroid treatments because recent admonitions against routine systematic corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19 and prior reports indicate that systemic steroids for treating SARS-CoV-1 may have been harmful
