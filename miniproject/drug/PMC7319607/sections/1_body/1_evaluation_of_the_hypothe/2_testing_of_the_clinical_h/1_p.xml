<p id="p0085">Technically, the hypothesis can be tested in humans who are COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR postive by performing a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study to compare the effect of admininstering nebulizer treatments with either containing saline solutions containing EDTA exclusively or containing EDTA/B2-agonist (e.g., Albuterol, Metopateronol). The focus of the study is directed towards utilizing objective parameters that distinguish treatment groups. Parameters could include, RT-PCR results, clincal progress, and/or length of hospital stay, etc. Moreover, outpatient studies may be possible. That is, after initial medical supervision, the less clinically imparired COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR postive patients may be treated as an outpatient if the patient tolerates EDTA. Clinical measurements that may followed in clinic settings include vital signs, FEV1, and pulse oximetry measurements.</p>
