<p id="Par19">The re-emergence of outbreaks in low-risk areas and importation of cases to Asia indicate the rapidly changing epidemiology of YF. As part of epidemic preparedness, efforts should be directed at enhancing YF surveillance, diagnostic capabilities of laboratories and improving vaccine coverage, even in low endemic regions. While the live attenuated YF vaccine is highly efficacious, vaccine supply shortfalls due to limited production suggest that the development of new vaccines and improved manufacturing technologies will be urgently needed to meet increased worldwide demand. Lastly, a two-pronged approach that combines vaccination and therapeutic interventions will be paramount to prevent the re-emergence of future YF outbreaks.</p>
