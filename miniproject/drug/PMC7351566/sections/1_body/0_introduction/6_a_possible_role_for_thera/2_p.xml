<p id="Par18">Drug repurposing has been adopted as a strategy for identifying de-risked compounds that have demonstrated safety profile in preclinical models or humans, with potential time saved for drug development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Although there are currently no approved antivirals for the treatment or prevention of YF, there are several repurposed candidates in the drug development pipeline. Galidesivir and Sofosbuvir are both nucleoside analog antivirals originally used to treat chronic hepatitis C infections, which have emerged as promising antivirals for the treatment of YF [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. Both Galidesivir and Sofosbuvir were found to inhibit YF replication in vitro and in vivo in rodent animal models [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. Interestingly, the therapeutic administration of Galidesivir allowed the development of neutralizing antibodies against YFV that completely protected against secondary YFV challenge, highlighting that the use of these drugs will not hamper the development of adaptive immunity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Following the completion of Phase IA clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of intravenous Galidesivir in healthy volunteers, a Phase IB study that aims to evaluate antiviral effects of intravenous Galidesivir in YF patients is currently ongoing (

Recently, two YFV-infected patients presenting with acute liver failure were treated off-label with Sofosbuvir for a week as compassionate use and displayed marked reduction in viremia and improved liver function [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. Furthermore, in recent years, virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have also been recognized as a treatment modality for YF [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. The candidate that is most advanced in clinical development is TY014, which has currently completed Phase 1A/1B safety trials (

As antivirals against YFV become licensed for use in patients and travelers, it is hoped that these will contribute to both treatment of YF disease and the control of YF outbreaks.
