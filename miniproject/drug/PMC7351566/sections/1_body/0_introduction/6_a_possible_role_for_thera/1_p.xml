<p id="Par17">There are no approved therapeutics against YFV infections and treatment of YF disease is reliant on supportive care to alleviate disease symptoms. Although its initial clinical presentation may be benign, 15% of symptomatic patients can rapidly progress to severe yellow fever that requires intensive care support [

Against this backdrop, an effective antiviral against YFV could be used as a treatment (to significantly improve the clinical outlook for patients with severe YF) and also as an outbreak control strategy (i.e., as prophylaxis when YF vaccine is in short supply).
