<p id="Par16">The EYE’s initiative aims to eliminate YF through vaccination of 1 billion people living in at-risk areas by 2026. Unfortunately, these efforts have been thwarted by vaccine shortages. The ambitious EYEs initiative assumes that a single dose confers life-long immunity, yet as discussed above this is likely not the case. It is estimated that 90 million doses of the YF17D vaccine are needed every year. Due to the slow, tedious, and low-yielding process of manufacturing YF vaccine doses in chicken embryos [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. The most promising of which is a cell culture (Vero cell)-based production of an inactivated YFV vaccine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. The inactivated vaccine showed promising results in clinical trials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>], but was less immunogenic than the live-attenuated YF vaccines and required a two-dose schedule with an adjuvant. Ideally, a new cell culture method for YF17D that increases yields and cuts production time, while maintaining efficacy, genomic stability, and safety would be required to meet the world’s growing demands for the vaccine.
