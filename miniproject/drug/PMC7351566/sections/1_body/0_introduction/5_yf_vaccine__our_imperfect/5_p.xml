<p id="Par13">The role of T cell immunity in yellow fever vaccination remains unclear. Not surprisingly, YF vaccination induces strong CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses, which persists for several years following vaccination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell expansion occurs earlier and with a greater magnitude after vaccination than CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Epidemiological evidence shows that seroconversion rates drop and immunity wanes rapidly following YF vaccination of HIV positive patients, whose CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell response is impaired [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. While these studies suggest that T cells contribute to the maintenance of sero-protection and flaviviral clearance, it is likely that T cell immunity alone is insufficient to confer protection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Furthermore, immunization with the chimeric flavivirus vaccine on a YF17D backbone of non-structural proteins did not offer protection when challenged with YFV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. On the other hand, passive transfer of antibodies was sufficient for protection against wildtype infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].
