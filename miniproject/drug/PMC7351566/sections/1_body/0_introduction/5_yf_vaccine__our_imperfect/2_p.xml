<p id="Par10">Recent epidemiological studies have expanded our understanding of factors that affect YF vaccination-induced human antibody responses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Historically, YF vaccine studies conducted in healthy adults demonstrated that a single subcutaneous dose elicits a remarkably high seroconversion (nearly 100%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. However, recent studies show that age has a large influence on seroconversion rates, as observed by the high rates of vaccine failure in infants (9–12 months) and the elderly (&gt; 60 years) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>••, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In particular, seroconversion rates of children who received the YF vaccine in conjunction with the routine childhood vaccines for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) had a lower seroconversion rate (69%) as compared with children who received the YF vaccine alone (~ 85%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Additionally, seroconversion rates in non-endemic countries (98.9%) tend to exceed seroconversion rates in endemic countries (94.2%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Whether, the observed difference in seroconversion rates between endemic versus non-endemic countries is due to host genetics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], exposure to other circulating flaviviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], microbiome, additional co-infections that alter host immune response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] or host nutritional status remains to be elucidated.
