<p id="Par9">The live-attenuated YF vaccine, YF17D remains the single best control measure against YFV infection and is widely regarded as one of the most successful vaccines ever developed. The YF17D strain was developed in 1936 through the tedious process of serial passaging in chicken tissue of the wildtype YFV Asibi strain isolated from a patient in Ghana. There are currently three sub-strains (17D-204, 17D-213, and 17DD) licensed for use in individuals aged 9 months to 60 years old, residing in or traveling to YF-endemic regions. For all substrains of YF vaccines, antibodies against YFV are currently the gold standard when examining correlates of protection against future infection [

However, calculating LNI requires pre and post vaccine serum, which is not always feasible in the context of natural infection or mass vaccination. Consequently, plaque reduction neutralizing titer (PRNT) assays have replaced LNI measurements, where an 80 or 90% PRNT (i.e., PRNT
 <sub>80</sub> PRNT
 <sub>90</sub>) is used to indicate protection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. However, both YFV LNI and PRNT are slow, tedious, not standardizable, require experienced laboratory staff, and are limited to Biosafety level-3 containment facilities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Therefore, currently, we are urgently in need of new rapid, high-throughput, easy-to-use techniques that can be used to accurately assess protective antibodies following vaccination.
