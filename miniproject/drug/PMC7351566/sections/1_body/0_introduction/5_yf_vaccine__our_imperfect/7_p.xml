<p id="Par15">In terms of vaccine safety, YF vaccination has been associated with several rare but related adverse events (AEs) particularly in the elderly (≥ 60 years old) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. Vaccine-associated neurotropic disease (YFV-AND) causes neurological complications that are typically not fatal. However, vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YFV-AVD) results in an infection that resembles natural YF disease accompanied by a high fatality rate. Virus isolated from YFV-AVD patients do not have any mutations in the YF17D genome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>], thus the driver of YFV-AVD remains unknown. AEs tend to be reported more frequently in non-endemic countries, possibly as a result of under-reporting in endemic countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Additionally, host genetics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], egg allergies (due to the manufacturing process) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>], and an active immune environment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] have been linked with disease outcome and could contribute to the frequency of adverse events experienced by different populations. At the same time, YF vaccines unknowingly administered to pregnant women were immunogenic and elicited varying degrees of sero-protection without harming or trans-placentally infecting the fetus, illustrating the safety profile of YF vaccines during pregnancy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Therefore, given the low incidence of AEs in high-risk areas, and the large risk of mortality associated with YF infections, the threat from wildtype YFV infections outweighs that from YF vaccine-associated AEs [
