<p id="Par11">Duration of immunity and the need for a booster has been highly debated in past years, with arguments for [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] and against a YF booster vaccination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. In controversial studies carried out in non-endemic countries, it had been reported that YF17D offer long-term sero-protection lasting up to 30–40 years post vaccination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Therefore, in 2012 the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunization declared that a single dose of YF vaccine was sufficient for long-term protection in 2012 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. However, more recently a substantial number of studies have highlighted that neutralizing antibody titers as well as cellular immunity wane with time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. In adults, sero-positivity decreases at just 5–9 years post vaccination from 100% down to 82% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. This trend of waning immunity is further exaggerated at around 10 years post-vaccination with sero-protection dropping under 80% in both endemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] and non-endemic cohorts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Furthermore, waning immunity in children vaccinated between 9 and 12 months of age is more severe with only ~ 40% retaining long-term sero-protection (~ 6 years post vaccination) in Brazil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and Ghana [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>••]. Surprisingly, a retrospective study in Brazil between 1973 and 2008 noted that the number of hospitalised YF cases with a history of YF vaccination over 10 years prior to illness and without past YF vaccination (52% vs 45%, respectively) was not significantly different [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In fact, vaccination coverage of up to 95% may be required for high-risk regions to eliminate yellow fever outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. These disturbing observations are further evidence of waning YF vaccine immunity over time, and thus provides strong support that a YF booster vaccination is needed (i.e., a 10-year vaccination booster for travelers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] and a 4-to-5-year booster for children vaccinated during their first year of life).
