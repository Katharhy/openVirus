<p id="Par12">Following the global shortage of YF vaccine supplies in 2016, in an effort to maximize vaccination coverage and to curtail the epidemics in Angola and DRC, public health officials proceeded to conduct fractional dosing of the remaining YF vaccines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Studies in 
 <italic>Rhesus macaques</italic> showed fractional dosing of YF17D to be effective in protecting against wildtype Asibi in a challenge model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In humans, a tenfold lower dose of YF17D provoked a similar cytokine profile, viremia, and PRNT response as a standard dose [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Compared with full dose, fractional dosing of YF17D stimulated similar seroconversion rates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] that persisted for 10 months to 1 year post-vaccination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Long-term protection was observed in 98% of patients receiving a fractional dose in a non-endemic setting [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], while only 85% of recipients in an endemic region maintained lasting immunity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Overall, the decision to use fractional dosing in an outbreak setting was supported by the prediction that during the 2016 YF epidemic in Angola a lack of fractional dosing would have led to a 5.1-fold increase in mortality due to YF [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, our understanding of the effect of fractional dosing on waning immunity, on vaccine shelf-life, on the antibody responses in different age groups and genetic background are limited [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Hence, it is imperative that we continue to improve our evidence base to understand the effect of YF vaccine dose-fractionation on protection against YFV infections.
