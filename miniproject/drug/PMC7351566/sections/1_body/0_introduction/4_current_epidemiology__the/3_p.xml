<p id="Par7">In South America, case fatality rates from YFV infections is more than double that in Africa (40–60% versus 20%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Therefore, under the YFI program, preventative vaccination campaigns in high-risk YF regions significantly reduced YFV outbreaks in humans until no major outbreak (i.e., greater than 100 cases) was detected between 2010 and 2015 in Latin America. Nevertheless, in 2016 a large YF outbreak occurred in regions of Brazil that had previously had low or no risk of YF infections and therefore, low vaccination coverage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Phylogenetic tracking of the epidemic strains identified the originating dissemination event to have occurred in “Central-West” region in the Brazilian state of Goiás about 2 years prior to the outbreak [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The epidemic then moved into the state of Minas Gerais, from where it moved along two different routes (route 1 towards the east and route 2 towards the south-east) into peri-urban regions of the Brazilian megapolis, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This led to an exponential increase in transmission leading to over 2000 confirmed cases and over 600 deaths. Molecular analysis confirmed that the 2016–2017 epidemic strain was within the South American (SA) 1 genotype and that the epidemic resulted from direct sylvatic spill over to humans with the absence of sustained YFV transmission within the urban cycle [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Some studies have attributed the 2016 YF epidemic in YF non-endemic regions of Brazil to increased virulence of the new virus strain [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], others have blamed changing aspects of population and ecology, such as the rise in population density [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], the geographical expansion of the peri-urban mosquito 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], human encroachment into NHP habitats [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and global warming [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Since the factors that promote the emergence of YFV in low or non-endemic regions are not well understood, currently, we are unable to predict the next YFV outbreak in these regions.
