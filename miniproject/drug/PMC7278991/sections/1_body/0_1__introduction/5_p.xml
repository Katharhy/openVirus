<p>Finally, ACE1 and ACE2 cooperate in the reninâ€“angiotensin system (RAS) to balance the local vasoconstrictor/proliferative (ACE1/Ang-II/AT1-axis) and vasodilator/antiproliferative (ACE2/Ang1-7/MAS-axis) actions. This results in the protection of organs and blood vessels by anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferation, anti-fibrosis, anti-alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis, and anti-oxidative stress activities antagonizing the Ang-II effects (
