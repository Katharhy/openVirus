<p>The efficiency in the ACE2-receptor/S-protein recognition and interaction is a key determinant for the success of viral infection and receptivity [
 <xref rid="B35-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Recently, the S-protein/ACE2 interface has been elucidated at the atomic level and several crucial amino acid residues are recognized to correctly achieve the homo-dimerization process [
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therefore, proper ACE2 functionality is essential for both virus cell entry and local pulmonary homeostasis, and although it has been previously described that polymorphisms in the

 <xref rid="B43-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], females might have a higher degree of heterodimer assembling than males, which in turn might show different affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor.
