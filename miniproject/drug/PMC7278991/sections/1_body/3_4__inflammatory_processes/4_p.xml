<p>Finally, X-linked genes coding for inflammatory mediators/receptors may also escape XCI leading to bi-allelic expression [
 <xref rid="B153-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>], with strong implications in sex-related differences of inflammatory responses [
 <xref rid="B154-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. Interestingly, the X-linked 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> gene, in transgender males treated with estrogen therapy and androgen antagonists shows significantly higher expression and increased number of cells expressing 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> among testicle cells [

Overall, if inflammation is needed to control the invasion/elimination of pathogens, the onset of exacerbated inflammatory responses may be harmful and lead to tissues/organs damage. In this scenario, females result as better “armed” thanks to the presence of a cellular mosaicism that may be more than useful to modulate/balance inflammation [
