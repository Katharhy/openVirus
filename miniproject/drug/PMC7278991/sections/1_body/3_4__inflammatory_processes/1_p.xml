<p>Sexual dimorphism in terms of risk, susceptibility, and prognosis has been reported for several inflammatory pathological conditions, including respiratory diseases in which hormonal profile, genetic, and epigenetic factors may play a role [

In relation to SARS-CoV2, the accumulation of reports and epidemiological data indeed confirms that, in agreement with other respiratory inflammatory diseases and consistent with previous MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections, the new coronavirus preferentially affects males than females that show a better prognosis [
