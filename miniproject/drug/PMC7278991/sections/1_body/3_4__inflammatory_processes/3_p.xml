<p>With regard to the role of the number of X-chromosomes on inflammation and release of inflammatory cytokines, in a recent work Lef√®vre and colleagues addressed how the number of X-chromosomes can affect the secretion of inflammatory cytokines after the activation of the TLR signaling pathways [

The authors demonstrated that cytokine production in response to different TLR ligands was improved in males, showing higher inflammatory response than in females and subjects with Klinefelter syndrome who carry two X-chromosomes, but are characterized by a hormonal profile more similar to that of males [
