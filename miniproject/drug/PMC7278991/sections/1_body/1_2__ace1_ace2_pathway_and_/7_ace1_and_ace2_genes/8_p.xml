<p>Our hypothesis should be demonstrated by dedicated clinical epidemiological studies in genetically selected patients, though it is to be taken into account that the above described 
 <italic>ACE1</italic> and 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> gene variants do not completely lessen the enzyme levels. Rather, they are responsible for a medium–mild reduction with enzyme levels within the low–normal range of the general population. Nonetheless, in critical conditions and co-morbidities (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 infection), selected genetic variants might favor RAS-rebalancing. Moreover, among COVID-19 patients, those taking RAS-inhibitors may take advantage of the treatment considered an adjuvant drug for RAS rebalancing [
