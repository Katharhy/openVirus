<p>Although about 60% of the ACE1 levels seem to be determined by the 
 <italic>ACE1</italic> I/D polymorphism, it is extremely interesting that there is a significant sex-difference in serum ACE1 activity/level, which is lower among females in both healthy and pathological conditions [

 <xref rid="B89-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. This evidence, together with the observation that the 
 <italic>ACE1</italic> I-allele seems to be overrepresented among females, and that the D-allele (associated with a high level of ACE1) seems more prone to express even higher levels among males, suggests a higher chance to have ACE1/ACE2 imbalance among males during ACE2 receptor suppression, as in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection [
