<p>Within the several habit-related factors, smoking deserves particular consideration. Smoking is a risk for many respiratory diseases and undoubtedly also for COVID-19 [

 <xref rid="B156-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. The European Respiratory Society [
 <xref rid="B157-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>] reported results of different studies concluding that smokers are 14 times more likely to die from COVID-19 [

 <xref rid="B159-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>], but only a few studies definitely advise to stop smoking [
 <xref rid="B160-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>] and, to our knowledge, no country has taken strong prevention measures. As regards the individual susceptibility of smokers toward respiratory diseases, such as influenza, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), tuberculosis (TB), or other lung pathological conditions, there are no doubts about a direct association [
 <xref rid="B161-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>,
 <xref rid="B162-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>,
 <xref rid="B163-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>,
 <xref rid="B164-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. Accordingly, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) suggested that smoking may contribute to increasing the number of severe COVID-19 cases [
 <xref rid="B165-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. Conversely, it has been speculated that smokers seem less likely to develop COVID-19, by the hypothesis that smoke exposure might modulate the immune response and the levels of inflammation markers. By attenuating the physiological defense of the immune and inflammatory system, smoking might paradoxically mount a less aggressive cytokine storm [
 <xref rid="B166-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. Accordingly, a “nicotinic hypothesis for COVID-19” has been speculated, suggesting the use of nicotine-patches on coronavirus patients [
 <xref rid="B167-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. Overall, no evidence exists that smoking protects COVID-19 patients from developing severe symptoms and recent metanalyses indeed list smoking habits as risk factors [
 <xref rid="B168-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>,
 <xref rid="B169-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>,
 <xref rid="B170-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. Of note, it has been reported that the ACE2 receptor is upregulated in the lungs of smokers or COPD patients, including small airway epithelium, brush borders, type-II alveolar pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages [
 <xref rid="B171-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>,
 <xref rid="B172-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. The expression was more evident in patients with COPD compared to never-smokers, suggesting that smoking upregulates ACE2 expression and COPD further exacerbated it, hypothesizing in them an amplified susceptibility for COVID-19.
