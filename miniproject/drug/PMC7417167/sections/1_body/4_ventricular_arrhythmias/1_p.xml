<p id="p0155">It is important to identify and treat secondary causes like hypoxia, metabolic or electrolyte imbalances, and proarrhythmic effects of drugs. In patients with ventricular tachycardia storm not related to the previously mentioned causes, the first choice of therapy is amiodarone or intravenous lidocaine, especially if underlying myocardial infarction is suspected, in addition to sympathetic blockade with esmolol, sedation, and possible intubation. In patients with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation with prolonged QTc interval, replace electrolytes to target potassium level &gt;4.5, start intravenous infusion of magnesium and isoprenaline infusion, and stop QT-prolonging antiviral meds. Temporary pacemaker implantation using flotation guided technique at bedside in emergency situations can be considered to overdrive terminate ventricular tachycardia and incase of recurrent TdP or bradycardia (

After recovery from COVID-19, evaluate the need for secondary prevention ICD and catheter ablation. If transient cardiomyopathy due to myocarditis is suspected, consider wearable defibrillator devices (
