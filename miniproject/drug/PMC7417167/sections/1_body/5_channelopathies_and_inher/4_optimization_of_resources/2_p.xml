<p id="p0190">The nature of procedures in the field of electrophysiology are mainly nonemergent, except for some cardiac arrhythmias, which require urgent interventions. The Heart Rhythm Society COVID-19 task force (
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>) has put together a consensus document which divides electrophysiological procedures into urgent or emergent, semi-urgent, and nonurgent or elective procedures. Procedures are considered emergent if they would reduce the risk of clinical deterioration, hospitalization, or death. Patients requiring electrophysiology procedures should be screened for fever and COVID-19 symptoms and should undergo COVID-19 testing. In locations with limited testing availability or with concern for community spread, it may be prudent to consider at least droplet precautions for all electrophysiology procedures. N95 masks should be used by all operating physicians and a surgical mask for all patients (

If needing intubation which is an aerosol generating procedure, it is recommended to consider performing in a negative pressure room either in the electrophysiology lab or inpatient ICU before bringing the patient to electrophysiology lab. Anesthesia data recommends to limit personnel in the procedure room during intubation or extubation and to follow institutional protocols for the length of time before other personnel can return to the room after intubation which could be between 15 and 30Â min based on frequency of air exchanges and the type of PPE used (

Electrocautery is another aerosol generating procedure that is routinely used during device implantation procedures, and the smoke produced can have a significant amount of viral load. Surgical data recommend using low power electrocautery settings and using adequate PPE including goggles or face shield for eye protection as it is considered possible that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to the conjunctiva by aerosol, although there is no evidence (

PlasmaBlade (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota) is a soft tissue dissection device other than electrocautery that is routinely used especially during generator changes to limit lead damage, produces less smoke, and in theory could be used as a substitute for electrocautery; however, there is no evidence to support this. Apart from considerations for electrophysiology procedures, the Heart Rhythm Society COVID-19 task force document (
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>) also provides guidance regarding management of patients in the outpatient setting via telemedicine as well as regarding minimizing in-person cardiovascular implantable electronic device interrogation via remote device monitoring.
