<p id="p0160">In patients with LQTS, monitor the QT interval and cardiac rhythm due to high risk of QT prolongation seen in COVID-19. Hypokalemia should be avoided in patients with COVID-19–associated diarrhea. It is recommended to maintain a potassium level at the higher range of normal. The effect of fever is not much evident with LQTS (except with specific LQTS2 mutation). Whereas in patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS), fever can unmask the ECG manifestation of type 1 BrS, and thus it is recommended that all patients with COVID-19 self-medicate with paracetamol or acetaminophen if they develop fever. High-risk BrS patients who develop fever (&gt;38.5°C) despite treatment should be evaluated in the emergency room and kept under observation if ECG shows type 1 pattern; otherwise, the patient can be discharged home to limit exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital. Patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia have adrenergic-related ventricular arrhythmias; thus, catecholamine infusions should be administered with great caution in critically ill patients. BBs and flecainide should be continued while monitoring interactions with antiviral drugs. Patients with short QT syndrome do not seem to be at particular risk with COVID-19 (
