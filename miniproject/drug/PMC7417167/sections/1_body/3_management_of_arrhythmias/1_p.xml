<p id="p0120">The goal of managing arrhythmias in patients with COVID-19 is to treat safely by minimizing exposure and by being mindful of drug-drug interactions. There are not enough clinical studies to guide management of arrhythmia in confirmed COVID-19 cases. Treatment of any bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias in a COVID-19 patient should be similar to treatment as in any patient with arrhythmia due to infection or transient metabolic disturbances. Special consideration should be given to management of arrhythmias in patients with inherited arrhythmia syndrome and management of QTc prolongation while receiving COVID therapy.</p>
