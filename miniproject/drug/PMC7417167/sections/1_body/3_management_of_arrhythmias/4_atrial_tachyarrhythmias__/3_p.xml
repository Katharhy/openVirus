<p id="p0145">In patients with recurrent atrial fibrillation and flutter who are hemodynamically stable, consider discontinuing antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) especially sotalol, flecainide and likely amiodarone and propafenone given serious drug-drug interactions with antiviral drugs and to start rate controlling medications with BBs or CCBs unless contraindicated, with or without digoxin. Similarly, patients with new onset of atrial fibrillation or flutter with a stable rhythm can be treated with rate control. Rhythm control strategy should be reserved for patients with hemodynamically unstable patients or in congestive heart failure patients (
