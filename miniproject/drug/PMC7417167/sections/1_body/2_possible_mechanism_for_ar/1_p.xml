<p id="p0060">Numerous potential mechanisms increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias during COVID-19 infection. These include various modes of injury to myocardium as well as extracardiac processes that can exacerbate arrhythmias in patients with a pre-existing proclivity. In the setting of a viral infection, chronic cardiovascular diseases can become unstable due to increased metabolic demand and reduced cardiac reserve (

Arrhythmias in COVID-19 may result either primarily due to hypoxia caused from direct viral tissue involvement of lungs, myocarditis, or abnormal host immune response, or secondarily as a result of myocardial ischemia, myocardial strain due to pulmonary hypertension, electrolyte derangements, intravascular volume imbalances, and drug side effects. Arrhythmias are not merely due to the direct effect of COVID-19 infection, but rather are likely as a result of systemic illness (
