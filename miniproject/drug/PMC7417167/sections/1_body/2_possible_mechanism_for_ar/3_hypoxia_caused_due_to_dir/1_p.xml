<p id="p0070">Acute respiratory failure as a result of lung injury from novel coronavirus infection can lead to hypoxia. Following from our understanding of hypoxia-induced cellular damage as it is rooted in myocardial ischemia due to coronary occlusion, hypoxia can activate anaerobic glycolysis, reducing intracellular pH and thus increasing cytosolic calcium levels. This, in turn, can facilitate early and late depolarizations, as well as cause and temporal alterations in the action potential duration (
