<p id="p0115">Many of the “off-label” COVID-19 therapies including (hydroxy)chloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and azithromycin have either known or possible risk of TdP due to their effect on QT prolongation (
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). (Hydroxy)chloroquine and azithromycin inhibit the hERG-K+ channel, which causes prolongation of action potential, and this along with unopposed inward Na+ and Ca2+ currents trigger early after depolarization that can lead to TdP. In a cohort study of 90 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the administration of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin was associated with an increased risk of QTc prolongation and risk of TdP (
