<p id="p0030">Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), was first officially reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, in China on December 31, 2019 (

 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), and several efforts are underway to better define the epidemiology of the disease (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Although many cases remain asymptomatic, the most common symptoms include cough, fever, and fatigue. A minority of patients experience complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other end organ damage (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Of particular concern is cardiac injury, defined as elevation of high-sensitivity troponin I above the 99th percentile, which appears common. One case series of 146 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China reported a cardiac injury incidence of 20% and a higher mortality of 51.2% compared with 4.5% in patients with cardiac injury versus without cardiac injury (

Similarly, in another case series, cardiac injury was manifested in 27.8% of 187 COVID-19 patients, and presence of cardiac injury was associated with fatal outcomes, with a significantly higher mortality of 59.6% compared with patients without cardiac injury (8.9%) (

In an observational cohort study of German patients who recently recovered from COVID-19 illness and underwent cardiac magnetic resonance with a median duration of 71 days since COVID-19 diagnosis, 78% of the patients were found to have cardiac involvement and 60% had ongoing inflammation, irrespective of the severity and overall course of the illness (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). One aspect of cardiac injury and overall critical illness is an increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias. In this review, we present the current state of knowledge in the potential mechanism and manifestations of cardiac arrhythmias in COVID-19–infected patients to provide a resource for clinicians during this rapidly evolving crisis (
