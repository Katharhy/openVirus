<p>To date, there is no proven effective strategy, although many teams are working tirelessly to identify an effective treatment. Molecular formulations are leading in this race:

   <p>(Hydroxy)chloroquine is well known due to its effectiveness in the treatment of inflammatory diseases and against malaria. Recent studies have shown antiviral effects of chloroquine and in vitro studies concluded that it was highly effective in the control of SARS‐CoV‐2.

   <p>Lopinavir, a viral protease inhibitor, with its pharmacological booster ritonavir (LPV/R) is commonly used in HIV‐positive patients. It has already been used for SARS‐Cov‐2. Some countries, including China and India, have approved its use in symptomatic infected patients, although the first randomised, controlled, open‐label trial showed no benefit of LPV/R over standard care in patients with severe SARS‐CoV‐2 disease.

   <p>Ribavirin is a guanosine analogue that interferes with the replication of RNA and DNA viruses. It has been used for years in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Based on its direct anti‐viral activity against SARS‐CoV‐2 in vitro and some evidence for its potential efficacy during the prior SARS‐Cov and MERS‐Cov outbreaks, it has been suggested as a potential candidate for the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2 disease.
