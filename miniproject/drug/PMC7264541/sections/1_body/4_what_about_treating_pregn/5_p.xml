<p>The use of antiviral therapy in infected pregnant patients should follow the same indication as in the general population, but some obstetric specificities should be emphasised.

   <p>The main goal should be to slow down (and at best stop) the clinical progression of the disease: to remain asymptomatic or, in symptomatic patients, to avoid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome. In the latter the obstetrician will often be called on to perform an emergency delivery and thus induce prematurity in the infant. At present expert consensus provides guidance for obstetricians, but the management between 25 and 32 weeks’ remains challenging in the absence of effective antiviral treatment.

   <p>The second objective should be to decrease viral load and duration of contagiousness in infected pregnant women. The majority do well, but the infection can disrupt their ‘obstetrical calendar’. Some procedures need to be performed at a specific gestational age, such as screening using first‐trimester serum markers, ultrasound examinations or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). The same applies to access to termination of pregnancy. All such procedures may be delayed to limit the risk of contagion, to reduce the burden on the health care team or, in the particular case of CVS/amniocentesis, to limit the theoretical risk of fetal transmission.</p>

   <p>The third aim should be to introduce preventive treatment in case of maternal contact with an infected person, similar to what is done for seasonal influenza and oseltamivir.
