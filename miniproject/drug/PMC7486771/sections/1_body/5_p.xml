<p>The age pattern we use in this paper does not include the indirect increase in deaths as healthcare systems are overwhelmed or the long-term effect of infection on the mortality of survivors. It also does not take into account any potential lowering of mortality, for example, from decreased air pollution, traffic accidents, and consumption of alcohol resulting from the economic slowdown. These effects may be important, but the age pattern of these changes might be quite different.</p>
