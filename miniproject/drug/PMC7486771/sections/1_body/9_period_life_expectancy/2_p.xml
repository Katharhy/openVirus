<p>When we apply the observed average age pattern of COVID-19 mortality from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>, we find that 1 million COVID-19 deaths would produce a life expectancy decline of 2.94 y. Such a decline would temporarily take us back to the mortality conditions of 1995 when life expectancy was 75.88 y, 2.98 y less than 78.86 in 2017. The same calculation with 250,000 COVID-19 deaths would produce a decline of 0.84 y in life expectancy.
