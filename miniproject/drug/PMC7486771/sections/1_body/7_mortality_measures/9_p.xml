<p>All of the above results are for sexes-combined mortality, the approach we take throughout this study. As an aside, however, analysis of COVID-19 mortality by sex in the United States finds a steeper rate of increase for females above age 35 y (just above 0.10/y) than for males (just below 0.09), so the ratio of male to female COVID-19 death rates which is 1.44 from 35 to 54 y declines thereafter across 10-y age groups to 1.37, 1.34, 1.26, and finally 1.12 for 85+ y. Despite the widespread reporting of higher COVID-19 mortality for males, the relative risk of males to females is actually lower for COVID-19 than for all-cause mortality in the United States in 2017 (
