<p>There also appears to be a relationship between the age distribution of COVID-19 mortality and that of all-cause mortality that holds across countries. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref> shows the exponential rate of increase in mortality by age for all causes and for COVID-19, for countries in the Human Mortality Database. The rate of increase of all-cause mortality varies from country to country around a central value of about 0.10, higher than the 0.086 for the United States. The smaller rate of increase in the United States is due to unusually high mortality at younger ages, not advantages at older ages, and has been used as an indirect indicator of the inequality of health status of the population (

 <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). From this small number of countries, at least, it appears that COVID-19 may be echoing the same factors as all-cause mortality, suggesting that there may be a relationship between the level of health inequality within populations and the age pattern of COVID-19 mortality.
