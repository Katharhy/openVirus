<p>As an alternative, we estimate cause-specific mortality rates by age, using the counts in age groups of the entire population, focusing on the relative risk by age, rather than the overall level. We use compiled age-specific death data from the following countries: China (

But we do assume that the age distributions of reported COVID-19 deaths are accurate.
