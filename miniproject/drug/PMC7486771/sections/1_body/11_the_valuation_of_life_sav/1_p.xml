<p content-type="flushleft">We can view these results from a different perspective, comparing the outcome of a hypothetical uncontrolled US epidemic in 2020 (2 million deaths, ref. 
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) to the far smaller one we may perhaps achieve with social distancing, which we hypothetically set at 250,000. To ground this number, we note that current projections are pointing at close to 200,000 deaths by summerâ€™s end, with mortality continuing at some unknown rate afterward (
 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). With 2 million deaths, period life expectancy at birth for 2020 would have dropped by 5.08 y, but with only 250,000 deaths it would drop by only 0.84 y. An 80-y old would lose 0.40 y of remaining life versus only 0.05 y. The population as a whole would lose about 1/650 of its remaining years versus only one 1 in 5,100.
