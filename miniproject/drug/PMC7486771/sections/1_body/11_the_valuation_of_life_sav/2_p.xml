<p>In one of the most quoted lines of the Talmud, it is said that whoever destroys one life, destroys an entire world; and who ever saves one life is considered to have saved an entire world. Still, policymakers face the inescapable choice of how many lives to save at what cost. Federal policy decisions are guided by a substantial literature in this area. Current estimates for the United States by Viscusi (
 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) give a single value of $10 million to each life regardless of age or alternatively $500,000 per year of life. Using Viscusi’s estimates, which are similar to those used by the federal government, we can attach a value to a hypothetical 1.75 million (= 2 million – 250,000) lives saved through public and private measures taken. Avoiding 1.75 million deaths would be valued at $17.5 trillion, and saving 20,475,000 person years of life would be valued at $10.2 trillion. Some other health economists use substantially lower values around $125,000/y of life (
