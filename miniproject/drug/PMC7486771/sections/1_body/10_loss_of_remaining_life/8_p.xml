<p>The HIV epidemic, which peaked in the 1990s, and opioid overdose deaths, which continue today, have each over the decades produced total mortality that is comparable, depending on the metric, to the 1 million deaths COVID-19 scenario we are considering and even to Spanish flu. However, on a deaths-per-year basis, they are an order of magnitude smaller. One million deaths from COVID-19 would confront society in 1 y, or possibly in just 3 or 4 mo, while the deaths we have experienced from HIV or opioid overdoses occur over the course of decades. This concentration of epidemic deaths in a short time creates a crisis which overwhelms the capacities of healthcare systems, morgues, and mortuaries, leading to triage in hospitals and makeshift storage of bodies such as in an ice rink in Madrid. The slower-moving epidemics bring other stresses and anguish, since afflicted individuals suffer for many years, and the prevalence of those afflicted at any moment is consequently much higher than for epidemics that kill quickly.</p>
