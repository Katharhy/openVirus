<p>Our above calculation is specific to the United States and to our estimated age pattern of COVID-19, but the small effect of a single year of epidemic mortality can be seen more generally by extending Keyfitz’s (
 <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) model to a more general formulation of the loss of remaining life (

  <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>
 </xref>). This model, like Keyfitz’s, also shows that the effect of an epidemic on loss of remaining person years of life, like the effect on life expectancy, scales roughly proportionately with the magnitude of the epidemic. We consider a population that is not growing (“stationary”) experiencing an epidemic mortality proportional to the baseline age pattern. An epidemic that increases mortality by a factor

  <math id="i19">

 <inline-formula>
  <math id="i22">
   <mi>A</mi>
   <mo>=</mo>
   <mn>40</mn>
  </math>
 </inline-formula>—roughly the case of the United States—this model would predict the share of lost life would be about 1/800. Unlike our exact calculation above, this model does not include the older age of death of COVID-19 relative to all-cause mortality, improvements in mortality implied by using the cohort life expectancy forecast, or the particular features of the US age distribution. Nonetheless, such stylized calculations arrive at a result of the same order of magnitude.
