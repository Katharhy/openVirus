<p>As we describe below, the most commonly used measure of mortality, life expectancy at birth, is not a good measure of transitory mortality shocks. Other measures, including the crude death rate, age-specific mortality, and the loss of remaining person years of life, together give a better summary of the magnitude of epidemic deaths. These perspectives allow us to compare mortality impacts over time and across populations. They also allow policymakers to make more informed judgments about the valuation of saved lives.</p>
