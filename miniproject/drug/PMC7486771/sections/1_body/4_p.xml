<p>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) ensemble forecast of total COVID-19 deaths, based on 33 forecasts by different groups as of August 3, is for 175,000 to 190,000 deaths by August 29 (

For illustrative purposes we use an intermediate scenario of 1 million deaths in 2020 due directly to COVID-19 across all waves, at times comparing it to a lower scenario of 250,000 and a higher one of 2 million. The metrics we produce scale approximately proportionately with the number of deaths, so readers can translate our results under different mortality scenarios.
