<p id="Par17">Finally, provision of harm reduction supplies (e.g., sterile drug use equipment) are essential to preventing HIV, STIs and hepatitis C transmission [

People will have sex and use drugs to pass the time and in ways that are also entirely predictable and understandable, but that also confer risks for HIV infection. But do we know this? Let’s ask them. There are many NIH-funded ongoing studies with cohorts of HIV negative and HIV positive participants who also stand at the ready to help, and with time on their hands! Let’s ask them important questions and use their responses to help those in their community who are not as fortunate to be in such studies. Without access to harm reduction supplies, new HIV infections (and STIs and Hepatitis-C)—are unavoidable. Now is the time for pharmacies to ensure access to syringes, for all of us to place condoms and lube anywhere people are still congregating. Another round of NIH supplements funded through the End the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America Initiative [

In many other communities, we do not know whether, where, and how people are still meeting up to share their fears and get social support, and some semblance of normalcy. We should find out, and reach them there.
