<p id="p0090">It is not just diabetes that is making COVID-19 more deadly; it's also possible that COVID-19 is making diabetes worse [
 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is known that SARS-CoV-2 can infect endocrine pancreas cells via their expression of ACE2 receptors. As such, it's possible that pancreatic damage from the virus and resultant impairment in beta-cell insulin secretion could worsen preexisting diabetes or even predispose to new cases of diabetes in non-diabetic subjects. This could make hyperglycemia worse in the short term (and thus lead to a more severe COVID-19 disease course), and also trigger the emergence of increased rates of autoimmune diabetes, whereby the body coordinates an immune response to the damaged pancreas, with physiology akin to type 1 diabetes.
