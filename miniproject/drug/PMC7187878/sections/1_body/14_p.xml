<p id="p0070">Aside from medications potentially increasing risk of COVID-19 via increasing levels of ACE2, there also may be an additional virus-specific mechanism. It is known that a diabetic state is associated with higher levels of plasmin(ogen), a protease enzyme that can cleave furin sites in COVID-19 S proteins and allow the virus to have easier infectivity [

 <italic>Physiologic Reviews,</italic> “the cleavage of the new furin sites in the S protein of the [COVID-19] virus by plasmin … may enhance its infectivity by expediting entry, fusion, duplication, and release in respiratory cells. Elevated plasmin(ogen) and furin levels are a common feature in COVID-19 patients with underlying medical conditions, and could be an independent factor for risk stratification of patients with COVID-19 [
