<p id="p0045">Both diabetes and obesity can lead to a pro-inflammatory state in the body, with circulation of excess cytokines that keep the immune system in “threat” mode. These cytokines, including IL-6 and TNFα, have been found to be elevated in the patients that show severe disease in COVID-19 [

 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and are associated with increased disease severity [
 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Monoclonal antibody IL-6 inhibitors (normally used in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis) are being tested as therapeutics to mitigate immune-mediated morbidity in COVID-19 patients [
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. TNFα, IL-1 and IL-6 are, at baseline, more active in the setting of diabetes and obesity, and it has been posited that infection with SARS-CoV-2 may serve to amplify an already primed cytokine response in patients with these conditions, thus exacerbating the cytokine storm that appears to be driving the multiorgan failure seen in COVID-19 [
