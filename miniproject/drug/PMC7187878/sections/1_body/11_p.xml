<p id="p0055">A theorized potential link between diabetes and COVID-19 mortality lay in hemoglobin [
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Because of higher circulating glucose levels, patients with diabetes will have a higher percentage of glycated hemoglobin. SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins seem to bind to and potentially impair the heme molecule within red blood cells, causing separation of iron from the molecule to form a porphyrin [
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This results in red blood cells carrying less oxygen and carbon dioxide, and thereby can generate cell death and intense inflammation in the lungs. Because patients with diabetes and older people have more glycated hemoglobin, they may be preferentially affected by SARS-CoV-2 binding and dissociation of iron from heme to form porphyrins [
