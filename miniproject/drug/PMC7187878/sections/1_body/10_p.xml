<p id="p0050">It also appears that certain “helpful” immune cells (certain subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) that coordinate the immune response are decreased in concentration in the blood of people with diabetes who have COVID-19, and there is a higher proportion of pro-inflammatory immune cells (i.e. Th17 cells) [

 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The death of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells relieves inhibition and effective modulation of the innate immune system, causing an exaggerated deluge of inflammatory cytokines, resulting in a cytokine storm. Specifically, recent reports have shown that there are reduced numbers of memory T lymphocytes, Treg subtypes, and helper T cells in patients with severe COVID-19 [

In short COVID-19 generates an uncoordinated and aggressive immune response, specifically in those with diabetes, and this immune response causes intense damage to organs. The baseline pro-inflammatory state found in diabetes and obesity may serve to exacerbate this.
