<p id="p0085">Research published April 18th, 2020 found that patients exposed to highest amount of environmental nitrogen dioxide (NO
 <sub>2</sub>) had increased risk of death from COVID-19, and that long-term exposure to this pollutant may be one of the most important contributors to fatality by compounding lung inflammation [

Minimizing exposure to environmental pollutants may serve a role in quelling the underlying pro-inflammatory state that characterizes metabolic disease and COVID-19 associated cytokine storms, however more research needs to be done to confirm this. Other environmental toxins, including persistent organic pollutants (POPs) found in air, water, and food generated from pesticides and industrial chemicals, are also strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome; promoting “clean living,” toxin-avoidant strategies for patients as simple as emphasizing organic foods, home air purification, and non-toxic home supplies could be considered, although the clinical utility of these measures in the acute setting is unknown [
