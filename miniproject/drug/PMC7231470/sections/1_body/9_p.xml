<p>In short, accumulating evidence on the discovery of SARS-, MERS- and HCoV-19-like viruses in animals makes it clear that there are likely more unknown, highly virulent coronaviruses with epidemic/pandemic potential circulating amongst wild animal species. Increased interactions between human populations and these zoonotic hosts due to deforestation, economical development and climate change will increase the probability for close contact, and thus higher chances for the next outbreak. In light of this scenario, it is ever more important for authorities to provide sustainable support not only for the discovery of novel coronaviruses, but also other unknown or neglected tropical pathogens with potential for high public health impact, such as bunyaviruses, filoviruses, arenaviruses and so on. As evidenced by the increasing frequency of viral epidemics/pandemics with novel pathogens in the 21
 <sup>st</sup> century (i.e., SARS-CoV, pandemic H1N1, MERS-CoV, Zika virus and now HCoV-19), it remains difficult to predict the location and timing of the next outbreak. Pathogen surveillance and discovery, facilitated by cutting-edge new sequencing technology, comparative genomic analyses and elegant molecular characterization, remains one of our best ways for pandemic preparedness, and the origins of novel pathogens, along with specific vaccine and drug development, need to be highlighted as research priorities, such that evidence-based policy for the prevention of future infections with novel pathogens can be established.ished.
