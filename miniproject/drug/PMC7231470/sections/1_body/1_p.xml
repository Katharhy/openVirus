<p>Tracking the origins of these novel coronaviruses has important implications for the control and prevention of related infectious diseases in humans. While the scientific world is focused on developing efficacious drugs, vaccines and therapeutics specific to HCoV-19 to save the maximum number of lives, elucidating the source of these viruses can lead to evidence-based policy changes that can prevent infections, and thus outbreaks, from occurring in the first place. Extensive work performed on the origins of SARS-CoV found that this virus had zoonotic origins (

Phylogenetic analysis of these SARS-like coronaviruses strongly suggested bat-origins for these pathogens, and horseshoe bats (as the presumptive natural reservoir) likely infected humans directly in the wild or indirectly through intermediate animal species (such as palm civets) in Chinese live animal markets (
