<p>With virus neutralization tests now at hand, Chinese researchers have already done 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> efficacity tests against the novel coronavirus (Wang 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mbt213557-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2020a</xref>). The most promising effects were observed with the nucleotide analog remdesivir and the anti‐malaria compound chloroquine. Both showed inhibition of the novel coronavirus in the low micromolar concentration range. Remdesivir acts on viral RNA transcription at the postviral entry level, while chloroquine needs to be applied at the beginning of the infection; chloroquine’s action on lysosome membranes might interfere with the viral entry–fusion events. It is of note that the nucleotide analog remdesivir had a better activity against MERS coronavirus than the protease inhibitor lopinavir combined with ritonavir, and this both in cell culture and in mouse infections. In the mouse MERS infection model remdesivir improved pulmonary function, reduced lung viral loads and decreased severe lung pathology (Sheahan 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mbt213557-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). In addition, remdesivir given prophylactically to MERS virus‐challenged rhesus monkeys significantly reduced viral titres in the lung and prevented lung pathology as assessed by histology or by X‐ray radiographs when compared to control animals (de Wit 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mbt213557-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Treatment with remdesivir 12 h after viral challenge had a more limited protective effect in rhesus monkeys. In early February, two randomized, placebo‐controlled clinical trials testing the therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir were started in China. One trial will enrol 308 patients with mild or moderate novel coronavirus disease (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04252664) and the other 453 patients with severe disease (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04257656). The enrolment is planned to be completed by end of April and May 2020 respectively. The importance of evidence‐based treatments proven in controlled clinical trials must be stressed since in the SARS epidemic untested drug treatment seems to have done more harm than no treatment (A. Danchin, personal communication). Therapeutics directed against immunopathological host responses might have a treatment value in view of the ‘cytokine storm’ seen in some patients with novel coronavirus infections.
