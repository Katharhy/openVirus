<p>Within a record time of less than a month, the novel coronavirus was identified, isolated and sequenced by three groups of Chinese scientists. A large consortium coordinated by W. Tan from the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Chinese CDC) obtained eight complete viral genome sequences from nine patients either by direct RNA isolation and sequencing from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) or from classical virus isolation on human airway epithelial cells (Lu

The eight genomes showed sequence identity of 99.98%, i.e. only four nucleotides differed out of the 30 000 nucleotide‐long single‐stranded RNA genomes. This level of viral genomic identity isolated from different human subjects is unusual for an RNA virus that has been circulating for a long time in the human population. This observation suggests a recent single spill‐over event from an animal source into humans. Geneticists estimated that this event might have occurred in November 2019. The closest relatives of the new virus are coronaviruses isolated from bats in Eastern China, but they shared only 87.6% sequence identity with the new isolates. Therefore, viral taxonomists consider the novel coronavirus as a new viral species belonging to clade 2 of the Sarbecovirus group, acronym for SARS comprising betacoronaviruses. With the SARS virus, the new isolates shared even less, namely 79% sequence identity. While bats are still considered the most likely source for this novel coronavirus, bats were already hibernating at the time of onset of this epidemic and no bats were sold at the Huanan food market in Wuhan, suggesting an intermediate animal host where adaptation to human transmission might have occurred. Live hedgehogs, badgers, snakes and turtledoves were sold at the Huanan market. Claims were made, but were not (yet) substantiated that snakes or pangolins were intermediate hosts for creating the coronavirus by recombination events. W. Tan and colleagues, who now constitute the China Novel Coronavirus Investigating and Research Team, described subsequently the isolation of further coronaviruses from three patients in Wuhan who tested negative for 18 viral and four bacterial respiratory pathogens. These viruses were closely related to those of the earlier nine patients. In human airway epithelial cells, the cytopathic effect of this virus was a lack of cilium beating (Zhu
