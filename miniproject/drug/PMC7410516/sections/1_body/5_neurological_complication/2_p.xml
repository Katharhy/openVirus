<p id="Par21">The main interactions between antiviral therapies and neurologic and psychiatric drugs are reported in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Among these, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been administered in COVID-19 even in milder forms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], although the use of both drugs has recently shown contradictory results [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. In particular, a small Chinese randomized trial reported no differences in virologic outcomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], and the Survival Sepsis Campaign guidelines on the management of critically ill adults with COVID-19 stated that there was insufficient evidence for recommending the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in this group of patients. Different organizations, including the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA), have suspended the employment of hydroxychloroquine outside clinical trials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Seizures have been observed in the past in some patients treated with chloroquine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Moreover, due to their association with QT prolongation, co-administration with drugs eliciting the same side effect (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants) is discouraged and should be carefully used in patients with cardiac diseases (e.g. NMD-related heart failure). Furthermore according to Russo et al., chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, as well as Remdesivir, an antiviral agent used in COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], should not be co-administered with carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital and primidone, for the risk of drug interactions and enzymatic induction of inhibition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Lopinavir and ritonavir have been employed in COVID-19 treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], although contradictory results have been observed and their effectiveness is still debatable [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Moreover, ritonavir may promote the metabolism of phenytoin and other antiepileptic and antipsychotic drugs due to the induction of CYP450 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Furthermore, azithromycin has proven efficacy in COVID-19 in association with hydroxychloroquine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Nonetheless, patients with myasthenia gravis taking macrolides should be monitored, as they have been reported to exacerbate symptoms or trigger a new-onset myasthenic syndrome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Finally, the monoclonal antibodies employed in COVID-19 trials (mainly tocilizumab [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] and anakinra [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]) have not shown nervous system side effects or interactions with neurological diseases.
