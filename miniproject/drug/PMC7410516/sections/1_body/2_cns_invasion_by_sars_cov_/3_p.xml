<p id="Par11">HCoVs share high similarities and common neurotropic features, and there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may not be an exception [

First description of patients with meningitis or encephalitis whose cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by gene sequencing is described. Moreover, other neurological manifestations such as headache, impaired consciousness, psychiatric symptoms, and acute cerebrovascular diseases have been reported in patients with COVID-19 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The mechanism provided for cerebrovascular diseases, however, is probably different and does not require a direct viral invasion of the CNS. It seems that COVID-19 can cause a cytokine storm syndrome which, together with the elevation of D-dimer levels, platelet reduction, and hypoxia, may cause susceptibility to cerebrovascular events [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. On the other hand, the systemic dysregulation of homeostasis in the infected host can influence the CNS, too. However, infected glial cells and neurons may also play a significant role in CNS tissue damage, having in vitro properties to secrete inflammatory cytokines and so potentially perpetuating inflammation and causing demyelination, oedema, and long-term neurological sequelae [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, the direct infection of cardiorespiratory centres in the CNS seems strong to contribute to respiratory failure and death in SARS-CoV-2-affected patients [
