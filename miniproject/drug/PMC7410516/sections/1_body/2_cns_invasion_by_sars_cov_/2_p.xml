<p id="Par10">Aerosol droplets allow HCoVs to firstly locate in the nasal mucosa of the infected host, subsequently gaining access to the CNS through a transcribrial route [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Once in the CNS, the membrane-bound ACE2 receptor, which is ubiquitous and detectable also over the cerebral capillary endothelium, glial cells, and neurons, assures CoVs to fuse with cellsâ€™ surface via spike proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To prove this, mice transgenic (Tg) for human ACE2 resulted as highly susceptible to CoV inoculation, with broad brain invasion and death within a few days [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Within a few days after infection, HCoVs widely diffuse to the CNS, being detectable in the brains of infected mice or healthy patients time after the acute manifestations of the disease [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Similar mechanisms of neuron-to-neuron HCoV transport might potentially involve all sensory nerves, depending on the entering site (e.g. nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal). Therefore, the sensory branches of the trigeminal and vagal nerves may also lead to viral invasion of the brainstem nuclei, and later to the cerebrum and cerebellum [
