<p id="Par23">Data on laboratory findings have been only occasionally described. However, Henry et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] collected the findings from 12 studies reporting on 66 children. According to the authors, leukocytes were normal in the vast majority of patients (69.2%), whereas factors related to abnormal coagulation, such as thrombocytopenia and increased D-dimer, are anecdotal. Moreover, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were increased by 13.6% and 10.6% of the cases. Accordingly, it is reasonable to suspect that children have a lower risk of presenting SARS-CoV-2 neurological complications compared with adults.
