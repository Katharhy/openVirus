<p id="Par29">Patients with mental health disorders may be particularly vulnerable in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, not only for their intrinsic psychiatric condition but also because of some of the long-term effects of psychotropic medication (such as metabolic syndrome with long-term antipsychotics), comorbid physical health problems and smoking habits [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, psychiatric treatment in COVID-19 patients is a source of medical concern. Indeed, from one side, many psychiatric patients have been infected with COVID-19, and on the other side, a contingent number of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 or simply infected by SARS-CoV-2 are experiencing psychiatric symptoms like anxiety, fear, depression and insomnia, which can be difficult to discern from antiviral treatment side effects. In this regard, many patients will need psychiatric medications including antipsychotics, antidepressants and antianxiety drugs, while using specific drugs against COVID-19, such as antiviral or anti-inflammatory. Consistently, the arising question is which drug to use to have the least possible interactions. The best choice seems to be on drugs that do not act on the cytochrome P450 or on drugs that act little on the cytochrome P450, such as citalopram, escitalopram, olanzapine and valproate, to avoid interactions with antivirals, which are metabolized via cytochrome P3A4 and cytochrome P2D6.
