<p id="Par32">The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) that is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently been designated a pandemic by the World Health Organization, affecting 4.4 million individuals globally as of May 16, 2020, with over 301.059 deaths. A growing body of evidence supports CNS involvement. The clinical manifestations range from vague non-focal complaints to severe neurologic impairment associated with encephalitis. It is unclear whether neurological dysfunction is due to direct viral injury or systemic disease. The virus may affect brainstem pathways that lead to indirect respiratory dysfunction in addition to direct pulmonary injury. Necessary adaptations in management, triage and diagnosis are needed, especially for subjects suffering from chronic and disabling illness. Finally, precise and targeted documentation of neurological symptoms, detailed clinical, neurological and electrophysiological investigations of the patients, attempts to isolate SARS-CoV-2 from cerebrospinal fluid, and autopsies of the COVID-19 victims may clarify the role played by this virus in causing neurological manifestations.</p>
