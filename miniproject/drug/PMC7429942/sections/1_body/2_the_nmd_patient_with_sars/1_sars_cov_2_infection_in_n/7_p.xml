<p id="Par34">Limited literature exists on the clinical course and recovery of NMD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. A small case series of 5 immunosuppressed MG patients showed high variability of disease severity and outcome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Three of them developed severe respiratory insufficiency following the infection and required intubation or high-flow oxygen, whereas two had a milder disease course. Four of them had a favourable outcome. Indications of therapy discontinuation in immunosuppressed MG patients during the infection are uncertain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Although this patient population lacks a long-term follow-up, in which an exacerbation may present, mycophenolate was discontinued in two patients without experiencing a subsequent flair of the underlying disease after recovery [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In some MG patients, SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary infection may directly induce an MG crisis [
