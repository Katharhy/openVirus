 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In case of symptoms suggestive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, NMD patients should follow local health authorities' policies, call their health care provider to receive guidance on treatments, testing, and monitoring [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and contact their neuromuscular specialist to discuss possible drug dosages adjustments and potential treatments. The decision to temporarily withhold or reduce immunosuppressant medication should be discussed with the neuromuscular specialist, and should never be done by the patient without consultation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, decisions regarding treatment de-escalation should be individualized according to the severity of infection, the risk for disease exacerbation, and the intensity of immunosuppression [
