<p id="Par41">The most dangerous complication that may arise during short-term treatment with such agents is QTc prolongation and arrhythmias [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. In addition to CQ/HCQ, many drugs that are now used against COVID, such as azithromycin and lopinavir/ritonavir, hold potential for QTc prolongation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>], which may already be altered in NMD patients, such as individuals with myotonic dystrophy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. The Canadian Heart Rhythm Society has released guidelines to minimize the risk of drug-induced ventricular arrhythmias [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. In this document, they recommend performing baseline electrocardiography (ECG) in patients with an increased risk of rhythm alterations. If QTc is moderately prolonged, optimization of medications and electrolytes may permit therapy, while in patients with markedly prolonged QTc these therapies should be avoided [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. CQ and HCQ are also associated with CK increase and, in long-term treatments, with the development of toxic neuropathy and myopathy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Furthermore, reports describe drug-induced myopathies and rhabdomyolysis in patients treated concomitantly with LPV/RTV and statins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. For this reason, we recommend a careful risk/benefit assessment before use in myopathic patients, and, in case of treatment with these agents, regular monitoring of serum CK levels. HCQ and azithromycin also have the potential to cause the onset or worsening of myasthenia gravis, and thus use in these patients should be carefully evaluated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. We do not recommend using these drugs as prophylaxis in NMD patients, as their prophylactic efficacy has not been proven and it may lead to serious toxicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].
