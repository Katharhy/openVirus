<p id="Par7">Some conditions, such as mitochondrial diseases, metabolic myopathies and myasthenia gravis, might also determine a worse outcome because of the risk of deterioration or rhabdomyolysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] secondary to fever and infections. In addition, patients receiving steroid treatment might undergo an adrenal crisis during fever or infection if steroid dosage is not adjusted [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Patients with conditions that do not affect respiratory and swallowing functions and whose immunocompetence is not affected by medications are generally not considered to be high risk [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, there are additional risk factors that might add to the pre-existent neurologic condition and increase the risk in the single patient (Table
