<p id="Par17">Different expert panels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and international societies (e.g. Muscle Dystrophy Society) have already provided general recommendations regarding disease-modifying therapies used in NMD patients that may increase the risk of infection or a more severe disease course. As a general rule, NMD patients should continue to take their medications, unless differently instructed by an NMD specialist via telephone or online. These medications include also newly FDA and/or EMA approved drugs, such as enzymatic replacement therapy (ERT) for Pompe disease, antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) patients with deletions amenable to exon 51 skipping, splicing-modulator ASO and gene therapy for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), and messenger-RNA interfering molecules for transthyretin (TTR) amyloidotic neuropathy. The challenge with these drugs lies more within the highly specialised setting required for their administration, involving recurrent visits to hospital tertiary centres, rather than within specific contraindications of the administered compounds.
