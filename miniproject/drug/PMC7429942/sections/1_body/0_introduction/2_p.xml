<p id="Par3">Specifically, first-hand experiences regarding neuromuscular centres have been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and different general recommendations for NMD patients are available (e.g. World Muscle Society), but the literature on the management of non-infected and infected NMD patients during the pandemic is limited. In addition, some issues regarding NMD patients remain open: (1) drugs used compassionately for SARS-CoV-2 patients (e.g. azithromycin, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine) are contraindicated in some NMD patients (myasthenic patients) and can cause NMD-related complications (rhabdomyolysis, toxic neuropathies, and myopathies); (2) the use of anaesthetics, intubation, and mechanical ventilation is the standard of care for severe SARS-CoV-2 cases in intensive care units (ICU), but it poses additional risks for NMD patients with bulbar involvement; (3) neuromuscular disorders centres should reorganize to offer the highest level of care while securing best standards of safety for the NMD patients.
