<p id="p0165">The genome of SARS-CoV-2 has about 14 open-reading frames (ORFs) that encode the four structural proteins spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), in addition to sixteen nonstructural proteins (nsps) involved in the replication-transcription complex (RTC) [

Indeed, Baric and collaborators showed that the systematic deletion of these accessory proteins does not dramatically alter the replication of SARS-CoV
