<p id="p0185">The microtubule associated protein 1B light chain 3 (LC3) is an important autophagy marker regulated by PHBs, that interacts with PHB2 and is manipulated by coronaviruses to escape antiviral innate immunity. It is thus tempting to hypothesize that coronaviruses control LC3 via PHBs. Indeed, a wide variety of viruses hijack LC3 or other components of the autophagy machinery for their own replication and to escape autophagic degradation [

LC3-I is a cytosolic protein that, upon autophagy induction, is cleaved and conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine to form the active, lipidated form LC3-II. LC3-II is then recruited to autophagosomal membranes to promote various forms of autophagy. LC3-II interacts in particular with mitochondrial PHB2 to trigger mitophagy [
