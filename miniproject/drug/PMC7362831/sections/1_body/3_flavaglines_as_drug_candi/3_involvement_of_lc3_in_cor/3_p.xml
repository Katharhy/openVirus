<p id="p0190">LC3-I is also found at the surface of EDEMosomes that transport unfolded proteins from the ER to lysosomes [
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Reggiori and colleagues showed that coronaviruses misdirect the machinery of EDEMosome formation for the generation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) [
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. DMVs are coated with non-lipidated LC3-I that allow them to hijack intracellular membranes for viral replication and escape autophagy, which often mediates the lysosomal degradation of viral elements [
