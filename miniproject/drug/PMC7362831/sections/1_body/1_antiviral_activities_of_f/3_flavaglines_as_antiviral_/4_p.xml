<p id="p0095">Hepatitis E virus (HEV) has a short 5′-UTR without a complex secondary RNA structure, but it still requires eIF4A for its replication [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Accordingly, Hildt and collaborators showed that silvestrol induced a significant reduction in viral particle release and viral protein biosynthesis in infected cells at low nanomolar concentrations [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Independently, and at the same time, Steinmann and collaborators also found that silvestrol inhibits the replication of many subgenomic replicons in an additive manner with the clinically used antiviral drug ribavirin [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This antiviral activity was also manifested 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Indeed, silvestrol (0.3 mg/kg ip.) rapidly and significantly lowered the amount of HEV RNA in the feces of humanized mice, while no effect was observed in control mice. At this stage, this is a unique study that reports an antiviral effect 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> of a flavagline due to an inhibition of eIF4A.
