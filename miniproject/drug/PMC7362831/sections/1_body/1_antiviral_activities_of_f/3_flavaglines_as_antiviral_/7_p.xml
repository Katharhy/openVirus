<p id="p0110">Grünweller and collaborators showed that 10 nM silvestrol significantly inhibits the translation of mRNAs harboring 5′-UTRs derived from the human coronavirus HCoV-229E associated with common cold symptoms and the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Silvestrol diminished the viral titer of these two viruses in human fetal lung fibroblast (MRC-5) cells, with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.3 nM and 3 nM respectively (EC
 <sub>90</sub>: 27 an 12 nM). The antiviral effect of silvestrol was also found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with similar EC
 <sub>50</sub> values. At 100 nM, silvestrol abolished the production of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and the HCoV-229E nsp8 protein in MRC-5 cells.
