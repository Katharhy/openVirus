By modulating the activity of PHBs and eIF4A, flavaglines display a wide therapeutic potential, in particular against devastating viral epidemics, including Ebola, dengue, chikungunya and COVID-19. By targeting host proteins these compounds may overcome the problem of resistance that is likely to occur with RNA viruses, which have a high mutation rate. In addition to viruses, PHBs also interact with a wide variety of infectious agents diseases, such as
