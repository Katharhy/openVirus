<p id="p0130">Duncan Smith and collaborators were the first ones, in 2010, to show that a virus, in this case, DENV 2, interacts with PHBs to enter into cells (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> ) [
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. DENV has four serotypes (DENV 1–4) that are transmitted to humans by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Each of these four serotypes can induce dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome. Using a combination of separation methodologies, virus overlay protein binding assays and mass spectrometry, they identified PHBs as the first DENV receptor in 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. Next, the DENV 2 envelope (E) protein was shown to be coimmunoprecipitated and colocalized with PHB1. Recently, using similar approaches, Desai and collaborators showed that DENV 3 also interacts with both PHB1 and PHB2 to enter into neuronal, astroglial and microglial cells [
