<p id="p0135">Smith and collaborators also identified PHB1 as the first CHIKV receptor in mammalian cells [
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Using a combination of different techniques, they demonstrated that PHB1 (but not PHB2) interacts with the CHIKV E2 protein to mediate viral entry into microglial cells. Considering that both DENV and CHIKV, which belong to very different families of RNA viruses use both PHBs as a receptor, it may be possible that PHBs also act as receptors for other human viruses.
