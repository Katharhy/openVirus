<p id="p0155">Enterovirus 71 (EV71), which causes hand, foot and mouth disease, may result in neurological complications in young children. Alonso and collaborators found that EV71 uses cell surface-expressed PHB1 to facilitate its entry into neuronal cells specifically [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition, mitochondrial membrane-bound PHB1 was shown to facilitate viral replication through association with the replication complex. In line with these findings, rocaglamide was found to reduce the virus load in EV71-infected neuronal cells, due to diminution of the amount of mitochondria-associated PHB, and not through an inhibition of the C-RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. 
 <italic>InÂ vivo</italic>, rocaglamide extended the life of EV71-infected mice and lowered virus loads in the spinal cord and brain, but not in the limb muscles, indicating that flavaglines hold some potential to alleviate the neurological complications of hand, foot and mouth disease in children.
