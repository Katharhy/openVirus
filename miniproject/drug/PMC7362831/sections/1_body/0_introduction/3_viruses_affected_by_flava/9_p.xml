<p id="p0070">Coronaviruses represent a large family of RNA viruses that usually cause mild respiratory tract infections in animals and humans. However, three new coronaviruses that cause more serious, even lethal, infections have appeared in the last two decades: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV in 2002, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV, and COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. The current absence of an effective treatment for coronavirus infections poses a great public health problem and highlights the urgent need to develop efficient treatment for these diseases.</p>
