 <p>Avian influenza A viruses (AIVs), as a zoonotic agent, dramatically impacts public health and the poultry industry. Although low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) incidence and mortality are relatively low, the infected hosts can act as a virus carrier and provide a resource pool for reassortant influenza viruses. At present, vaccination is the most effective way to eradicate AIVs from commercial poultry. The inactivated vaccines can only stimulate humoral immunity, rather than cellular and mucosal immune responses, while failing to effectively inhibit the replication and spread of AIVs in the flock. In recent years, significant progresses have been made in the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the vaccine antigen activities at the mucosal surfaces and the development of safe and efficacious mucosal vaccines that mimic the natural infection route and cut off the AIVs infection route. Here, we discussed the current status and advancement on mucosal immunity, the means of establishing mucosal immunity, and finally a perspective for design of AIVs mucosal vaccines. Hopefully, this review will help to not only understand and predict AIVs infection characteristics in birds but also extrapolate them for distinction or applicability in mammals, including humans.</p>
