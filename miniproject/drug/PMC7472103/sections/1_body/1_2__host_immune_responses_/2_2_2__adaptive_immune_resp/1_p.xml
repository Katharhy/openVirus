<p>The adaptive immune response comprising humoral and cellular responses at both systemic and mucosal levels constitutes the second line of defense against influenza viruses; this multifaceted immune response is complex (

 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In the case of the humoral immune response, influenza virus infection leads to production of antibodies (Abs) against the viral surface glycoproteins, particularly HA. Abs raised against the globular domain of trimeric HA could prevent the binding of infected viruses to the cell receptors in the host and endocytosis mediated by the receptors. As most Abs recognizing the viral HA exhibit virus strain-specific activities, they are ineffective in neutralizing viruses of other subtypes and intrasubtypic drift variants [
