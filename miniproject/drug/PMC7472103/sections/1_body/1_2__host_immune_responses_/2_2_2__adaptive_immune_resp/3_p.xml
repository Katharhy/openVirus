<p>During IAV infection, CD8+ T cells, a vital subset of immune cells, are activated after recognition of viral epitopes on DCs that migrate from the lung tissue to T-cell areas in the draining lymph nodes, resulting in their proliferation and differentiation into CTLs [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. CD8+ T cell differentiation toward CTLs can also be induced by proinflammatory cytokines, including IFN-γ, type I IFNs, IL-2, and IL-12 [

 <xref rid="B53-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In this case, CTLs release cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzymes such as GrA and GrB, inducing apoptosis of the virus-infected cells [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Moreover, GrA prevents virus replication and exerts non-cytotoxic effects through cleaving viral and host cell proteins related to protein synthesis [

 <xref rid="B54-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In addition, CTLs can recruit death receptors of cells infected with IAVs via cytokines, including FASL, TNF, and TRAIL, causing Fas/FasL interaction–mediated apoptosis in the infected cells [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Neutralizing Abs provide protection against reinfection with the same serotype of influenza virus, and CTLs are mainly directed against epitopes of the highly conserved internal viral proteins, like M1, NP, polymerase acid (PA), and polymerase basic 2 (PB2). Thus, CTL responses contribute to heterosubtypic immunity and display cross-reactivities among various subtypes of IAVs [
