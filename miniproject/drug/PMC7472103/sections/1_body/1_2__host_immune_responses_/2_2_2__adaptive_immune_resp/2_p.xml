<p>Infection with influenza viruses initiates virus-specific cellular immune response involving CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00862-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Upon infection, the migration of dendritic cells (DCs) from the lungs to the draining lymph nodes was induced, resulting in the activation of CD4+ T cells [

 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Then, activated CD4+ T cells could differentiate into a variety of Th cell subsets in response to distinct stimulatory factors produced by epithelial cells, DCs, and inflammatory cells [

 <xref rid="B45-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Meanwhile, Th2 cells produce cytokines (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13) that facilitate the activation and differentiation of B cells leading to Ab generation [

 <xref rid="B47-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Strikingly, lung-resident memory CD4+ T cells, a new defined population, was identified to facilitate optimal protective response to influenza viruses [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Moreover, CD4+ T cells can be differentiated into Th17, regulatory T (Treg) cells, follicular helper T (Tfh) cells, and even killer cells depending on the local stimulators. Th17, Treg, and Tfh cells have been found to play a regulatory role in cellular immune response to IAVs [
