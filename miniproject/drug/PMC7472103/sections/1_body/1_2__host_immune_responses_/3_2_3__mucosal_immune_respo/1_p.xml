<p>The mucosal immune system plays a crucial role in controlling infection with influenza viruses in the URT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00862-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The URT serves as the initial site for IAV entry and multiplication in the host and also plays a crucial location for host defense. A powerful oral-pharyngeal immune system in the host responds to the initial IAV infection by producing antiviral and immunomodulatory components, including mucins, lectins, antimicrobial peptides, complement molecules, and natural immunoglobulins [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The entry of IAVs into epithelial cells renders detection of the viral PAMPs by the local immune cells via PRRs. The above immune cells can induce antigen-specific immune responses, producing a variety of cytokines and chemokines acting in antiviral immunity and adaptive effector cell recruitment and activation.
