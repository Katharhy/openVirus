<p>Abs, particularly IgG and IgA, are the major immune components acting in the protective response to IAVs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00862-f002">Figure 2</xref>). IgG is secreted into blood and then diffuses onto the mucosal tissue. In the mucosa, IgG plays a major role in decreasing viral pneumonia rather than preventing the upper respiratory system infections [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In contrast to IgG, IgA exerts a key role in preventing from infection of the human URT mucosa with influenza viruses [
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], eliminating viruses from the infected secretory epithelium, and relocating antigens from the lamina propria to the lumen [
 <xref rid="B61-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Importantly, infected viruses can be neutralized by secretory IgA (S-IgA) on the surface of the respiratory mucosa prior to their attachment to epithelium and penetration into the epithelial surface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00862-f002">Figure 2</xref>). In addition, influenza-virus-induced S-IgA in the respiratory mucosa is more potent than serum IgG for cross-reactivity against diverse virus strains. IAV (H1N1 A/Yamagata/120/86) HA immunization can lead to protection of mice against infection with multiple virus strains [

 <xref rid="B63-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In this case, while the protection rate was shown to be proportional to the level of cross-reactive Abs produced in the URT [
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], the reduced level of the cross-reactive Abs evidently resulted in a decline in the efficiency of protection against heterologous virus infection [
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that S-IgA purified from volunteers intranasally immunized with inactivated vaccine against the H5N1 has the potential to act as the broad neutralizing Ab against variant virus strains [
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Unlike IgG, IgA does not promote the activation of the inflammatory complement pathway [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Thus, all the above responses are non-inflammatory in nature.
