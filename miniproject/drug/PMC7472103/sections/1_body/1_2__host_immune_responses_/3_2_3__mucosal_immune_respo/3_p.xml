<p>In response to antigen stimulation, IgA class switching and IgA secretion occur in B cells stimulated by specific signals such as co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines and in Th cells via T-cell-dependent and T-cell-independent pathways [
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The above process is dependent on TGF-β signaling in B cells that activates isotype switching to IgA and is essential for T-cell-dependent and independent pathways. Notably, multiple activation signals contribute to the IgA isotype class switching. For example, CD40L binding to its receptor CD40 on B cells, binding of B-cell-activating factor or a proliferation-inducing ligand to transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor on B cells, IgA switching-directing TGF-βð1, and Th2-type cytokines facilitate IgA+ B cell post-switch and differentiation toward IgA-secreting plasma cells [
