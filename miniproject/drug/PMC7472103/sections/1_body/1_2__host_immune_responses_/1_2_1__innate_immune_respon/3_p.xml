<p>The RLRs—RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5)—recognize the cytoplasmic viral non-self RNA and transcripts. RIG-I preferentially binds cytoplasmic single-strand 5′-triphosphate RNA, while MDA5 is activated by long dsRNA species [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Upon influenza virus infection, the repressor domain (RD) of RIG-I recognizes the viral RNA molecule, resulting in the release of RD-mediated autoinhibition of caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) in RIG-I. After the CARDs are dephosphorylated or ubiquitinated by TRIM-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) known as an E3 ligase [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], RIG-I associates with an adaptor molecule called mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Then, the MAVS elicits a signaling cascade that ultimately activates transcription factors such as IRF3 to induce type I IFNs expression [

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Although RIG-I is absent in chickens, the absence of chick RIG-I can be functionally compensated by MDA5. In ducks and geese, RIG-I displays a high degree of structural similarity with that in mammals [
