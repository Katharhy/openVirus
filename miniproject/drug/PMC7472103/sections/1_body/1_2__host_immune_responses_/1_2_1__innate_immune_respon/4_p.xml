<p>The roles of NLR signaling in bacterial infection have been broadly investigated [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. IAV infection activates NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and NLR apoptosis inhibitory protein 5 [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Notably, viral PB1-F2 protein acts as the signal activating the NLRP3 inflammasome [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Moreover, the IAV M2 ion channel is needed to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and cleave pro-IL-1Î² and pro-IL-18 [

 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Conversely, other studies demonstrated that the NLRP3 signaling has no effect on the adaptive immune response [
