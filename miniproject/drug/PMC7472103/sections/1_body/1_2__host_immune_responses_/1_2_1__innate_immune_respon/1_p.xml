<p>The innate immune response constitutes the first line of protection from invading pathogens. AIV infection results in a recognition of viral conserved components called pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by host pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) receptors (RLRs), and NOD-like receptors (NLRs); the above recognition subsequently activates innate immune signaling and induces various proinflammatory cytokines as well as antiviral molecules [
