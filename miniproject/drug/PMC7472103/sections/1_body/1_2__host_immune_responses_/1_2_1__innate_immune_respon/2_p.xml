<p>TLRs were identified as the first PRRs family that are expressed on either the plasma membrane (TLRs 1–6, 10, and 11) or the surface of endosomes and lysosomes (TLR3, 7, 8, and 9) [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To date, 10 human, 13 murine, and 10 chicken TLRs have been identified and characterized. In chicken, eight TLRs have been shown to recognize a range of molecules, including diacylated lipopeptides (TLR1), triacylated lipopeptides (TLR2), double stranded RNA (dsRNA) (TLR3), LPS (TLR4), flagellin (TLR5), single stranded RNA (ssRNA) (TLR7), yeast proteases (TLR15), and double stranded DNA (dsDNA) (TLR21) [

TLR3 pathway activates the transcription factors, including nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), inducing the expression of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines. TLR7 is a receptor for influenza viral ssRNA in endolysosomal compartments of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). An adaptor protein MyD88 mediates TLR7 signaling transduction, activating IRF7 and NF-κB [

Overall, cytokine production promotes the expression of major histocompability complex (MHC) and co-stimulatory molecules in antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which regulates T helper (Th) cell differentiation and facilitates the immune responses to antigens. These properties of TLR signaling make TLR ligands promising candidates for vaccine adjuvants.
