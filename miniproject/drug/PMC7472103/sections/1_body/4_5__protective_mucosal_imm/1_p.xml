<p>Vaccination via the nasal cavity is the earliest mean of mucosal delivery, and nasal immunity can effectively prevent respiratory diseases. At present, mucosal immunity has made great contributions to human medicine from theory to practice, and various influenza vaccines such as LAIVs and cold-adapted influenza attenuated vaccines have been developed [

 <xref rid="B140-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. The oculo-nasal-oral route of vaccination is likely to be the most practical approach for preventing infectious diseases in poultry. Immunization of Newcastle diseases has demonstrated that mucosal immunization is of good efficacy. Currently, nasal and eye-based immunization has been successfully applied to the large-scale prevention of Newcastle diseases in chickens. The nasal and eye-based routes were used to deliver Newcastle disease attenuated vaccines. These delivery routes produce S-IgA Abs in the airway, digestive tract, and Harder gland and induce high titers of serum IgM and IgG. This suggests that mucosal immunity may contribute to establishment of a good defense line, which can effectively control the spread of the viruses. It was found that serum IgA and IgM against NDV appear within the first week following vaccination, whereas IgG can be detected starting from the second week. In this case, induction of cellular immunity against NDV occurred in the first week following vaccination [
