<p>Moreover, it has been shown that mucosal vaccines induce cross-reacting Ab in the respiratory tract, providing cross-protection against heterologous virus infection. Inoculating the influenza HA vaccine together with cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) or B subunit of heat-labile enterotoxin (LTB) supplemented with cholera toxin (CT) intranasally enhanced anti-HA lgA and IgG Ab responses in nasal wash or serum, which protect mice against variant virus infection [

Okamoto et al. found that intranasal formalin-inactivated whole-virion H5N1 vaccine injection protected mice against challenges with lethal influenza viruses of homologous and heterologous subtypes by inducing cross-reactive neutralizing antibody responses and cross-reactive cell-mediated immune responses [

Besides, they also demonstrated that the cross-protection elicited by the whole-virion vaccine and the split-virion vaccine plus mucosal adjuvants is similar [

Particularly, trained medical personnel are not always required to deliver nasal vaccines in the large-scale immunization program. Practically, exploration of mucosal immunization in AIVs defense could contribute to the development of effective vaccines and drugs against the viruses and identify the molecular pathogenesis related to influenza infection and the working mechanism underlying normal mucosal immunization.
