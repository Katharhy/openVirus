<p>The respiratory mucosa is the first target of influenza virus, constituting the first line of defense against the infection, which can effectively prevent the virus from entering [

Mucosal vaccines are designed to mimic the natural process of virus infections and evoke better mucosal immune responses than parenteral vaccines. On the one hand, while mucosal vaccines enhance innate immunity by increasing the expression of cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-21; chemokines; and co-stimulatory molecules, including CD40, CD80, CD86, IFNÎ±, and B cell-activating factor, they induces differentiation of CD4+ T cells toward Th1, Th2, Treg, Th17, and Tfh cells. On the other hand, mucosal immunization can induce more S-IgA Abs than parenteral vaccines [
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. S-IgA Abs on the mucosal surface have the capacity to effectively prevent virus infection due to the fact that these Abs remain active on the surface prior to attachment of the pathogens to mucosal epithelium, the primary site for virus infection. Furthermore, S-IgA Abs display more effective protection against the influenza virus variants than serum IgG Abs because S-IgA Abs act more widely [
