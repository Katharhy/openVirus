<p>At present, the commercial vaccines against influenza available on the market mainly comprise inactivated influenza A virus (IIV) vaccine and recombinant influenza A virus (RIV) vaccine. Strains used in commercial influenza vaccines are selected based on the compositions of viruses from the surveillance, laboratory, and clinical observations [
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. These vaccines are licensed clinically only for intramuscular injection. The IIV vaccines mainly include whole inactivated virus (WIV), split virus, and subunit vaccines [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. WIV vaccine production begins with the virus growth in 9–11-day-old pathogen-free embryonic chicken eggs, followed by chemical inactivation using formaldehyde or β-propiolactone, concentration, and purification. WIV has safe and complete antigenic components that are nontoxic and have strong immunogenicity and no risk of mutation. Although WIV vaccines usually provide protection against the virus subtypes that are antigenically closely related to one another, minor changes in antigenicity could cause a loss in the cross-reaction and protection [
 <xref rid="B71-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In split virus vaccines, the virus envelope has been disrupted by treatments with diethyl ether or detergents for exposure of all viral proteins [
 <xref rid="B72-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The subunit vaccines are prepared by extracting an immunogenic protein of influenza viruses and supplemented with a very safe adjuvant for stimulating production of sufficient immunity. The RIV vaccines are generated through a viral host (baculovirus Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus) in the insect cell line, which were authorized for use in the United States. These influenza vaccines, administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly, can elevate the level of serum Abs at systemic immune compartments, providing the most efficient, valuable, and low-cost means for effectively controlling the virus infection and subsequently reducing morbidity and mortality. However, all these parental administrations fail to elicit local mucosal immunity on the location of initial infection [
 <xref rid="B73-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], representing a limited capacity of the conventional vaccines in conferring broad protective immunity against infections. Moreover, once the vaccine strains are not well matched to the seasonal circulating influenza strains, the effectiveness of these vaccines becomes very low.
