<p>Vaccination remains one of the most effective ways to control and prevent AIVs transmission in poultry. Current influenza vaccines are generally effective against antigenically matched strains. It has been demonstrated that the antigenic mismatch between the vaccine and circulating strains or inadequate vaccine protocols can cause an antigenic drift and failed vaccination [

It has been proposed that extensive vaccination for the control of AIV epidemics in poultry favors the occurrence of antigenically diverse viruses drifted from the seasonal vaccine strains, possibly reducing vaccine efficacy and causing failed vaccination [

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Given that the infection and spread of AIVs occur at mucosal surfaces, vaccine administration via the mucosal route could provide the first line of defense against viral infections through inducing mucosal immunity. Moreover, mucosal vaccines are designed to target specific mucosal tissues and to trigger “frontline immunity” for IgA production in the upper respiratory tract (URT), controlling viral infection. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanisms for mucosal immunity would contribute to design and adopt more adequate vaccine strategies for the control of AIVs infection and epidemics.
