<p>Influenza viruses undergo antigen mutations through antigen drift and shift. Circulating AIVs evolve constantly, resulting in the occurrence of new strains with variable antigenicity. Particularly, mutations occurring in the HA or NA usually cause antigenic drift, subsequently leading to an escape from earlier immune responses. Besides, an antigenic shift can take place in AIVs. In this case, co-infection of a host cell with AIVs strains of different origins can lead to the generation of novel virus subtypes via induced genetic reassortment; a newly formed HA subtype of AIVs can transmit easily in immunologically naïve individuals [
