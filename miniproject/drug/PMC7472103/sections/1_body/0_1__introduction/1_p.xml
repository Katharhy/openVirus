<p>Avian influenza A viruses (AIVs) remain one of the important viral pathogens that cause respiratory tract infections in various animal species, such as poultry and humans, and aquatic birds are considered the primordial source of AIVs infecting other animal species [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Influenza A virus (IAV) is a single-stranded negative-sense RNA virus of the family Orthomyxoviridae that is grouped into the following four genera: Aâ€“D. IAV is classified into distinct subtypes based on its two surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (HA) (18 subtypes) and neuraminidase (NA) (11 subtypes) [

 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. AIVs are categorized as either highly pathogenic or low pathogenic viruses based on the presence of a polybasic cleavage site in the HA protein as well as the disease severity in poultry. Infection with low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) results in mild respiratory disorder accompanied with reduced egg production and/or a depression, whereas infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) cause a significant mortality in chickens. Notably, AIVs, particularly subtypes H5, H7 and H9, have posed an increasing threat to public health worldwide. So far, H5N1 and H7N9 have caused hundreds of human infections, with a mortality rate of 20% to 60% [
