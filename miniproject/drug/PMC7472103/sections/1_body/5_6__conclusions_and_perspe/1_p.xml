<p>Avian influenza is a serious respiratory disease. Although currently used inactivated vaccines are effective, circulation of antigenically different strains could reduce the efficacy of vaccines due to the fact that almost all vaccines are administered via the i.m. route. The rate of antigenic variation of AIVs is accelerating, thereby increasing the risk of human infection and harm to the economy and society. Therefore, speeding up the research on AIVs vaccines and improving vaccine safety and reliability will have huge economic and social benefits. Mucosal immunity constitutes the first line of defense against AIVs; the mucosal delivery route elicits mucosal and systemic immunities simultaneously. Compared to inactivated vaccines, mucosal vaccines stimulate both cellular and humoral immunities and can be more effective in protecting against influenza variant strains, hence producing more cross-reactive and longer-lasting comprehensive immune responses. Overall, mucosal vaccines and delivery routes should play an irreplaceable role in remarkably reducing AIVs-caused burden.</p>
