<p>A number of adjuvants for inactivated influenza vaccines including TLR agonists are widely used to enhance the vaccine immunogenicity (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00862-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Studies on innate immune system have identified PAMPs as adjuvants used in animals such as mice, non-human primates, and chicken. For example, poly(I:C) and CpG, the respective ligands of TLR3 and TLR21, stimulate elevated levels of S-IgA in the airway and IgG against AIVs in the serum when given along with inactivated H5N1 [
