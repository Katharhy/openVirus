<p>Adjuvants can potentially increase the immunogenicity of mucosal influenza vaccines, while enhancing the efficacy of vaccines through modulating the quantity and quality of host immune responses. Commonly used adjuvants include a wide range of compounds (

Numerous experimental animal studies have demonstrated that enterotoxins (cholera toxin and heat-labile enterotoxin), TLR ligands (Poly I:C, lipopolysaccharide, flagellin, CpG), chicken interleukin-1 beta, etc. elicit increased immune responses and protect against viral challenge in poultry and other animals (

These should be good candidates for mucosal influenza vaccines for clinical use in poultry or other food animals in the near future. For most inactivated vaccines, multiple administration is needed to attain protective levels in recipients; co-administration with an adjuvant could promote the immune response to the initial dose of vaccines, resulting in an elevated response above the threshold of protection. Importantly, formulation of vaccines with adjuvants not only require a lower amount of vaccine agents and less number of doses for inducing protective immune responses, but increase the efficacy of vaccines as well. Compared to the standard response induced by 15 mg H5N1 antigen, administration of AS03 elicited a decreased response by 3.75 mg [

However, mucosal surfaces display a broad tolerogenicity and harbor a number of antigen barriers, such as cilia (mechanical), mucus (chemical), and proteolytic enzymes (biochemical). As a result, mucosal vaccination could be a challenge. To address the above issues, special adjuvants may be used in mucosal vaccination for antigen protection and induction of the local immunity [
