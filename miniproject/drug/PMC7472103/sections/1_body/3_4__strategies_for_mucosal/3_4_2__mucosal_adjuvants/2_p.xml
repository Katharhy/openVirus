<p>Adjuvants act via the following mechanisms: (1) a depot formation at the site of injection, which enables the vaccine agents to be slowly released and the host immunity to be constantly stimulated; (2) enhancement of the agent uptake via APCs and APC activation and maturation; (3) immune cell recruitment; and (4) innate immune receptor activation. Moreover, adjuvants can shape subsequent adaptive immunity for producing the most effective and protective responses to a given pathogen through targeting the subsets of innate immune cells and forming a unique cytokine milieu associated with Th1, Th2, and/or Th17.</p>
