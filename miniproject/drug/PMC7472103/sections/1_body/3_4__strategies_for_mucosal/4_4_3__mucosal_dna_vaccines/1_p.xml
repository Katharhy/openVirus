<p>DNA vaccines are capable of expressing immunogenic antigens in vivo, thereby inducing cellular and humoral immunities without causing host exposure to live viruses [
 <xref rid="B116-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Extracellular proteins can be selected as the DNA vaccine antigens that are recognized by MHC class I or II directed intracellular proteins. Notably, DNA vaccines have potential advantages over conventional vaccines, including ease of manufacture, stability at room temperatures, and the ability to mimic natural infections and elicit an appropriate immune response. Thus, DNA vaccines without the need for virus propagation in eggs represent a fast, safe, and efficient alternative to conventional influenza vaccines [
