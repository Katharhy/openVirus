<p>It has been shown that intranasal administration of DNAs in mice leads to a fast and relatively even distribution of plasmid DNAs all over the body [

DNA vaccines are delivered as naked plasmid DNA, resulting in a weak immunogenicity due to nuclease-mediated DNA degradation and inefficient delivery to the target cells. To optimize DNA vaccination, various strategies involving adjuvant formulation, distinct prime-boost combinations, and diverse approaches for delivery have been proposed to enhance the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines. Compared with the DNA vaccine alone, a-Galactosylceramide-adjuvanted DNA vaccine can induce a marked increase in titers of serum IgG and IFN-γ levels in mice [

Other approaches have been used to increase vaccine immunogenicity by targeting the DNAs to M cells (specialized epithelial cells in the mucosa). One study showed that nasal delivery of complexes formed from DNA and M cell-binding σ1 protein in reovirus produced strong antigen-specific responses with mucosal IgA and IgG, particularly CTL-stimulated responses to DNA-encoded antigen in the lung, indicative of accumulation of Th1 and Th2 effector cells in the mucous tissues [
