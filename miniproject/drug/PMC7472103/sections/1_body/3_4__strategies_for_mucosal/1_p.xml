<p>Researchers have been attempting to create universal influenza vaccines for providing broad and sustainable protection against diverse influenza viruses. In recent years, research on the prevention of influenza infection by nasal immunity has gained more and more attention. To effectively work in mucosal immunization, mucosal vaccines must be designed to possess the characteristics of mucosa and promote the specific immune responses to vaccine antigens in the mucosa. Currently, generating effective mucosal vaccines mainly involves the identification of efficient means for antigen delivery to the mucosal immune system and the development of safe and effective mucosal adjuvants or immunoregulatory agents.</p>
