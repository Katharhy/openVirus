<p>A growing number of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials have advanced our understanding of how live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) elicit mucosal antibodies via intranasal administration. Contrary to the wild-type forms, attenuated viruses have the capacity to replicate well at temperatures around 25 °C rather than at 37 °C, deterring their replication in the lower airway, including lung tissue, and the subsequent occurrence of influenza-like disease [
