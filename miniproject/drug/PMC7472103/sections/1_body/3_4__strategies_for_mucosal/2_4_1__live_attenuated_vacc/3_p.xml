<p>Successful development of LAIVs largely rests on the proper balance between attenuation and immunogenicity. It has been reported that serial virus passage in the host cells during vaccine development causes a decrease in the virulence of effective live attenuated vaccines for rotavirus [
 <xref rid="B88-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. As a result, the above vaccines are sufficiently attenuated, eliciting a minor subclinical infection, while retaining a high immunogenicity. In the other case, the live oral typhoid vaccine exhibits moderate immunogenicity but good safety due to extensive attenuation [
 <xref rid="B89-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Live attenuated H5N1 influenza viruses were produced by removing polybasic cleavage site of HA protein and selected gene deletion, leading to generation of a safe vaccine with high immunogenicity [
 <xref rid="B90-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Therefore, precisely targeted gene deletion provides a controlled approach for attenuation that can be highly desirable to generate a safe and stable live vaccine. Further studies on the genetic basis of attenuation could make a great contribution to development of the next generation of live vaccines and improvements in the safety and stability of the vaccines.
