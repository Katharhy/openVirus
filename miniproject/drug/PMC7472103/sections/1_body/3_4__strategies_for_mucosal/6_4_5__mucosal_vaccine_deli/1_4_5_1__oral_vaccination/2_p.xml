<p>There exist continued efforts in developing oral live attenuated vaccines. However, compared with live-attenuated pathogen based vaccines with limitations in safety, recombinant subunit vaccines or non-living or non-infectious vector vaccines could be more attractive, albeit more difficult to deliver [

 <xref rid="B135-viruses-12-00862" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Hence, it is important to develop live mucosal vaccines with stronger immunogenicity, better stability, and increased safety. Although there are several hurdles in achieving the above goal, effective oral vaccines such as rotavirus and cholera vaccines have been generated. However, it remains to be understood why only a proportion of oral vaccines work. Thus, it would be impossible to successfully generate effective oral vaccines by simply replicating the formulations or protocols. Nevertheless, the effective oral vaccines may be attributed to the delivery of sufficient antigens within sustained time periods for effectively initiating intestinal immune system via the follicular epithelium and Peyerâ€™s patches.
