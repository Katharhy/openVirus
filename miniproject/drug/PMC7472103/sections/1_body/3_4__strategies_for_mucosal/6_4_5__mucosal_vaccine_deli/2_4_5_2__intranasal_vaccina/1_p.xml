<p>As a major entering portal for pathogens, the nasal route becomes a promising option for mucosal vaccination due to its unique physiological and immunological characteristics. Intranasal vaccination is capable of stimulating immune responses in the nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue, eliciting systemic and mucosal immunities in the gastric mucosa and the respiratory and/or genital tract [

Most soluble antigens are not efficiently taken up and transported in the nasal cavity due to its anatomical and physiological features. Generally, subunit antigens with very little affinity for the nasal epithelium display a poor immunogenicity and are quickly eliminated via mucociliary clearance. The tight junctions of nasal epithelial cells can remarkably decrease the epithelial permeability to macromolecules [

Overall, the formulation of nasally administered vaccines needs to be optimized for a prolonged residence time in the nasal mucosa and increased stability [

However, intranasal vaccination could be superior to oral vaccination as the former requires markedly lower doses of antigen and/or adjuvant. It has been proved that intranasal administration of LAIVs can effectively protect from the seasonal infection and even induces cross-protective immune response against drifted strains [

Novel approaches for the co-delivery formulation have been employed to carry out one or more of the following functions: mucosal adhesiveness, protection, permeation and enhanced penetration of antigens, inductive-site specific targeting, and adjuvant effect.
