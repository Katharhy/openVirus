<p id="Par29">Given the prevalent use of ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and the predominant role of ACE2 receptors in the disease pathogenesis, there has been some concern surrounding the use of these medications in COVID-19 patients. Animal data have supported that chronic use of ARBs elevates ACE2 receptor expression, and elevated ACE2 expression has potential protective CV effects [
