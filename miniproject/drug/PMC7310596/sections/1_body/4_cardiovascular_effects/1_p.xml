 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. It was therefore not unexpected to see a higher incidence of CV events in those infected with COVID-19. On the other hand, the presence of pre-existing cardiac conditions appears to increase the chance of complications, including death, in COVID-19 patients. As reported in a meta-analysis of patients admitted with COVID-19, the incidence of CV disease (CVD) was 16.4% in non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and three times higher in those requiring the ICU [
