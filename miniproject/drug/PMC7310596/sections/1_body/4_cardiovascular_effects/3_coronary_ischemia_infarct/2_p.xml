<p id="Par18">The management of STEMI has been particularly difficult. Currently, multiple factors have been sources of delay for a primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) approach, including determining whether STEMI or COVID is the primary problem, and deciphering mimickers of STEMI, such as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, RV failure, or massive pulmonary embolism (PE). In the emergency department, screening for COVID infection may take some time, and, within the catheterization laboratory, additional time is needed for donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE). In addition, redeployment of staff has resulted in shortages to team availability. From a procedure room standpoint, catheterization laboratories are positive pressure rooms with a significantly higher risk of aerosolization, and therefore some have been converted to negative pressure rooms, while others must be fitted with high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. In addition, specific protocols for anesthesia, emergent intubation, and protection of staff and equipment have been implemented, all of which add time to the care of these patients.</p>
