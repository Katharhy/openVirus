<p id="Par19">A small study evaluating primary PCI in seven patients presenting with STEMI calculated the time from onset of symptoms to medical contact to be a median of 318 min, compared with a median of 82.5–91.5 min recorded in the previous year. Similarly, the door-to-device time was almost 30 min longer, at a median of 110 min, compared with a median of 84.9 min in the previous year [

When put in the context of existing data on door-to-balloon (D2B) time and CV outcomes, while 60–90 min estimates the absolute risk reduction of 1-year mortality at 2.4%, the odds worsen when this time increases to 90–120 min. In the same study, an incremental increase in the D2B time by 1 h was associated with a 64% increase in 1-year mortality (HR 1.90, 95% CI 1.51–2.39;
