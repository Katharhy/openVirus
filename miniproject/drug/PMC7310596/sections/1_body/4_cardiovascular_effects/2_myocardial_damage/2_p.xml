<p id="Par13">Many studies have shown poorer outcomes, including mortality, in patients with elevated biomarkers (such as cardiac troponin, creatinine kinase, pro-brain natriuretic peptide [BNP]) in COVID-19-related ARDS [

Another study aimed at correlating the change in troponin levels with the progression of COVID-19 disease, and showed that 37.5% of patients with normal troponin at admission had a rise in troponin during hospitalization, which peaked in the week before demise [
