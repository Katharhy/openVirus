<p id="Par22">The incidence of arrhythmia is currently unknown in COVID-19 patients, with preliminary data suggesting an incidence of 16.7% among hospitalized patients and 44.4% of ICU admissions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Both ventricular and atrial arrhythmias have been seen, in addition to sinus tachycardia due to clinical decompensation, fever, or sepsis. The cause of arrhythmia could be myocarditis, hypoxia, or electrolyte derangement seen in these patients, and in many cases may be reactive. Management of these arrhythmias are largely supportive, with control of the underlying clinical condition, electrolyte repletion, and pharmacologic antiarrhythmic therapy.
