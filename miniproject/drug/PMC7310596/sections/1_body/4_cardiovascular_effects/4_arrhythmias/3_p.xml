<p id="Par24">Arrhythmias leading to cardiac arrest deserve special mention. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with chest compressions is very high risk for aerosolization of virus, and a minimum number of caregivers should be inside the room, with full PPE. To minimize prolonged exposure, mechanical CPR devices may be considered, and all attempts should be made to prioritize immediate intubation into a closed circuit by anesthesiologists so that the duration of any aerosolization is kept to a minimum. While waiting for intubation, bag/mask ventilation with filter is recommended. The choice of tools for intubation should be determined by the expected success rate, with preference given to devices with the highest first-pass rate. Video laryngoscopy should be used where possible to ensure quick and effective airway management, and minimal to no disconnections in the closed-circuit should be the goal [
