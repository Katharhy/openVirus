<p id="Par31">Apart from complications during the active phase of infection, as described herein, long-term sequelae of the disease remain a possibility despite complete viral clearance. Previous epidemics from similar viruses can be informative in providing some clues for the long-term CV complications of COVID-19. For example, the 2002 SARS epidemic caused metabolic alterations through an increase in the level of phosphatidylinositol and lysophosphatidylinositol in recovered SARS patients in comparison with healthy volunteers [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. However, the mechanism leading to these metabolic changes as a result of the viral infection remains unknown. Osteonecrosis is independently associated with an increased risk of adverse CV outcomes in SARS patients treated with corticosteroids and warrants further exploration [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. Psychiatric morbidities, including chronic fatigue syndrome, were also reported in patients who recovered from SARS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. Given the strong association between psychiatric conditions, such as depression and chronic fatigue syndrome, and CVD, such as chronic HF and cardiac arrhythmias, the evidence backing long-term CV sequelae of these infections appears compelling [
