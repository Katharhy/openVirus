<p id="Par33">A surge of elective procedures is expected after this pandemic, and potentially an increased number of decompensated patients secondary to non-compliance, delayed elective procedures, and completed or late-presenting MI. A recent analysis showed a 38% decrease in primary PCI in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is partly attributable to avoiding going to the hospital early for fear of contracting the infection in the hospital, misdiagnosis of STEMI, and more use of fibrinolysis [

This would likely lead to an increase in the number of post-MI complications, such as mechanical complications, cardiogenic shock, cardiac rupture, post-MI angina, and reinfarction, that were not common previously because of prompt management by an invasive strategy. Some of these complications may not have presented due to deaths at home. Similarly, a significant decrease in ACS-related hospitalization rates across northern Italy has been noted [
