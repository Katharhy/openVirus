<p id="Par5">The lung is the principal organ affected in the early stages of COVID-19. The virus utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, abundant in the lower respiratory tract, for entry into the cells. Importantly, ACE2 is also expressed in the heart, intestinal epithelium, vascular endothelium, and the kidneys, making all of these organs potential targets [

 <italic>S</italic>-glycoprotein receptor located on the surface of the virus consists of two subunits, S1 and S2, which attach to the ACE2 receptor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. S1 determines the virus host range and cellular tropism, whereas S2 mediates fusion of the virus-cell membrane followed by the release of viral RNA into the cytoplasm. This is followed by the translation of new viral particles, with subsequent release to infect other cells [
