  <p>(A): Schematic representation of coronavirus particle. Spike proteins are highly glycosylated type I transmembrane protein, which assemble into trimers on the virion surface to form the distinctive “corona” (crown-like) appearance. (B): Domain organization and cleavage sites of the coronavirus Spike monomer (S). The ectodomain of all CoV spike proteins share the same organization in two domains, that is a 
   <italic>N</italic>-terminal domain, named S1 and responsible for receptor binding, and a C-terminal S2 domain responsible for fusion. The domain organization of the S monomer consists of a signal peptide (SP), the 
   <italic>N</italic>-terminal domain (NTD), the receptor-binding domain (RBD), the fusion peptide (FP), the internal fusion peptide (IFP), the heptad repeat 1/2 (HR1/2), and the transmembrane domain (TM).The region between the two domain is termed S1/S2 site. (C): Sequence of S1/S2 cleavage site of S protein from SARS-CoV-2. The four amino acid insertion (SPRRs), unique to SARS-CoV-2, is marked in yellow, the conserved S1/S2 cleavage site is marked in grey. (D): Comparative sequences of S protein cleavage sites.
