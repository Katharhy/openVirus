  <p>Analysis of sequence and structure of Mpro (3CL) protease. (A): Multi-alignment of Mpro homologues from the seven known human coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-2 (Uniprot ID: P0DTD1), SARS-CoV (P0C6X7), HCoV-OC43 (P0C6U7), HCoV-KU1 (P0C6U3), MERS-CoV (V9TU05), HCoV-NL63 (P0C6U6), HCoV-229E (P0C6U2). Secondary structure references were taken from SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB: 6M2Q). (B): Three-dimensional structure of apo SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB: 6M2Q). The structural domains I, II and III of Mpro are colored in light blue, orange and green, respectively. The localization of the protease active site (
   <italic>i.e.</italic>, residues Cys41 and His145) and the “N-finger” are indicated by arrows. (C): SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complexed with N3 peptide (PDB: 6LU7). Mpro structure is represented by molecular surface colored with the same scheme used in panel B. Subsite pockets S1 and S2 are explicitly indicated. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
