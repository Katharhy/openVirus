<p id="p0380">For SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mpro a direct role in the S1 shaping was found to be played by the protonation of two histidines (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, His163 and His172 in SARS-CoV sequence) flanking the S1 pocket 
 <xref rid="b0580" ref-type="bibr">[116]</xref>. Interestingly, a particularly stable water molecule seems also to play an important role by forming a water-bridge that stabilizes His163 and His172 conformations 
 <xref rid="b0585" ref-type="bibr">[117]</xref>. Additionally, available crystallographic structures of Mpro from SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV reveal that the P1 glutamine side chain may interact with the imidazole side chain of His163 which is located at the very bottom of a hydrophobic pocket (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, residues Phe140, Ile141, Leu165, Glu166 and His172) which flanks the S1 subsite (
