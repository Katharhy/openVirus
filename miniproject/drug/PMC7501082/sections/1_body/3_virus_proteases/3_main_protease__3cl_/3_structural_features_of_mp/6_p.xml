<p id="p0390">A structural comparison of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with other coronaviruses Mpros reveals additional amino acid substitutions (usually located far from the catalytic site, see 
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A), but two of them (namely Lys180Asn and Ala46Ser) are potentially relevant, since they are found in the deep hydrophobic pocket below the active site and in the loop region flanking its entrance (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, Cys44-Pro52 loop). Although Lys180Asn is located too far to directly contribute to substrate binding, it clearly extends the hydrophobic inner region of the site. On the other hand, even though the Ala46Ser substitution is not expected to have significant effect on the binding of small ligand compounds
 <xref rid="b0605" ref-type="bibr">[121]</xref>, molecular dynamics simulations showed that it increases the flexibility of the Cys44-Pro52 loop modifying the active site entrance and likely playing a role in substrate recruitment 
 <xref rid="b0545" ref-type="bibr">[109]</xref>. Further, a comparison of differing residues between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpros, has shown that the Cys44-Pro52 loop and the Phe185-Thr201 linker loop are evolutionarily correlated, so that mutations, occurring in these flexible loops, can render them more stable. Interestingly, molecular dynamics simulations of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpros also showed that, despite the high sequence/structure similarity, their active site binding cavities have significantly different shape with an overall accessible volume 50% larger in SARS-CoV Mpro than in its SARS-CoV-2 counterpart 
 <xref rid="b0545" ref-type="bibr">[109]</xref>. Thus, these findings suggest that repurposing SARS-CoV drugs for SARS-CoV-2 may not work well
