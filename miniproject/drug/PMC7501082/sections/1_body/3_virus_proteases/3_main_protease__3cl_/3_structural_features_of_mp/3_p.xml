<p id="p0375">The Mpro active site has different subsite pockets which confer a high substrate specificity for each residue in the recognized cleavage sequence 
 <xref rid="b0570" ref-type="bibr">[114]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0575" ref-type="bibr">[115]</xref>. These specificity pockets are named as S1, S2, S4, S1′ after the residues in position P1, P2, P4, P1′ of the substrate sequence. When bound to coronavirus Mpro, the P4 and P3 residues adopt a β conformation, inducing structural adaptation of the corresponding subsites, while both P1 and P2 side-chains are allocated in the pre‐formed S1 and S2 specificity pockets
