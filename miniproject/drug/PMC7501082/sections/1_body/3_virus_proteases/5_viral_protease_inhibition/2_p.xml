<p id="p0410">An efficient inhibition of a multimeric protease can be gained not only by targeting the active site but also by interfering with the stability of its structure and with the modulation of its activity. As an example of this, we can mention darunavir which blocks dimerization of the HIV-1 protease 
 <xref rid="b0615" ref-type="bibr">[123]</xref>, thus impairing its activity and HIV replication. As previously mentioned, proteases may appear evolutionary distant as differing for their active-site, but still share some important functional properties. As a matter of fact, in the following sections we will report not only on molecules specifically tailored for the active site of Mpro and/or PLpro, but also on molecules, which, though designed for other types of proteases (such as HIV-1), may nonetheless interfere with non-specific processes required for the activity of SARS-CoV-2 proteases.
