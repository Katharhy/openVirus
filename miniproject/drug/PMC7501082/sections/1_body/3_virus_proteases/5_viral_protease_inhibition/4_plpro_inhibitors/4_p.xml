<p id="p0595">The biological evaluation (in Vero E6 cell and in HEK293 cell lines) of a second-generation series of SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors (namely 3 k, 3e, 3j and 5c) has shown neither cytotoxicity nor off-target inhibitory activity. The 3 k compound exhibits the most potent PLpro inhibitory capacity (IC
