<p id="p0585">The lack of information pertaining PLpro, as compared with Mpro, in particular its mechanism of action and involvement in viral replication, does not rule out the possibility that it represents an excellent candidate for drug screening. In this respect, two substrates with natural and unnatural amino acids (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, Ac-hTyr-Dap-Gly-Gly-ACC and Ac-Abu(Bth)-Dap-Gly-Gly-ACC) were converted into inhibitors by exchanging the fluorescent tag (
 <italic>7-</italic>amino
 <italic>-</italic>4
 <italic>-</italic>carbamoylmethylcoumarin ACC) into the reactive group vinylmethyl ester. Both compounds exhibit high selectivity for SARS-PLpro variants and inhibit both SARS-CoV-PLpro and SARS-CoV-2-PLpro activities
