<p id="p0420">Available crystallographic structures and molecular modelling studies put in evidence the general structural and dynamical properties of SARS-CoV-2 main protease in relation to its catalytic function. In this context, co-crystallized structures of Mpro in complex with ligands clearly offer new insights which can be exploited for the development of inhibitors. The first crystallographic structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (a complex with an N3 inhibitor, PDB ID: 6lu7) was released to public on February 2020 through the Protein Data Bank
