<p id="p0445">The peptidomimetic α-ketoamides represent a class of prototypical inhibitors of Mpro. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were used to characterize the interaction of an α-ketoamide analogue with the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The predicted Glide score and molecular dynamics indicated clearly that α-ketoamide analogues bind the Mpro more tightly than the amoxicillin used as control

 <xref rid="b0555" ref-type="bibr">[111]</xref>) by substituting the P2 cyclohexyl moiety with a smaller cyclopropyl ring, suggesting that the S2 binding pocket is less flexible than originally thought. This was partially confirmed by a computational study, which, though observing a relevant flexibility of several domains of Mpro, detected a particular rigidity of its active site
