<p id="p0505">An additional source of potential SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors seems represented by natural marine products. For example, among five tested marine natural products, the cytotoxic molecule fostularin 3 exhibited hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions with residues in the active site of Mpro

 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>C) showed the lowest docking energy (−14.60 kcal/mol), associated to a network of hydrogen bonds with the acceptor residues of Thr24, Ser46, Asn142, Glu166, Pro168 and hydrophobic interactions with Met49, Met65, Leu141, and Pro168. After the molecular dynamic simulation and re-docking protocol the His41 residue, belonging to the catalytic dyad, is shown to establish a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl residue of the ligand
