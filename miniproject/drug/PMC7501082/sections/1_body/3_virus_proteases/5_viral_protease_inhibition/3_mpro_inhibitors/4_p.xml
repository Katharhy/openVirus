<p id="p0425">Since then, more than 150 structures of SARS-Cov-2 Mpro complexes with putative inhibitors have been made available, although many of them are not presented and discussed yet in a published research work. Interestingly, the co-crystallized structures showed how the absolute requirements of Gln in P1 can be easily overcome by replacing the amino acid with a lactam group which can form a hydrogen bond with His163

Moreover, crystallographic structures of Mpro in complex with inhibitors showed how the common Î²-conformation of residues in position P1-P4 can be easily interspersed by ad-hoc spacers to enhance the half-life of the compound, provided that the overall number of hydrogen bonds with the main-chain of residues forming the enzyme specificity subsites remain constant
