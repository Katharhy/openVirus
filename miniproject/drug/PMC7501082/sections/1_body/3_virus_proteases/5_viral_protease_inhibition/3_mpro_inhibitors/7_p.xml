<p id="p0440">In the framework of the actual coronavirus pandemia, selected drugs, like favipiravir, amodiaquine, 2′-fluoro-2′-deoxycytidine, and ribavirin are not classified as protease inhibitors, but they were docked and evaluated as possible inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 MPro. The amodiaquine showed the best binding energy (
