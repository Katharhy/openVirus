<p id="p0550">Baicalin and baicalein, two compounds from 
 <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic>, were considered as novel non-peptidomimetic inhibitors of Mpro, displaying also an antiviral activity in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Baicalin showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 6.41 µM against the Mpro, while baicalein shows an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.94 µM; 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> of baicalin and baicalein binding to Mpro were 11.50 and 4.03 µM, respectively 
 <xref rid="b0770" ref-type="bibr">[154]</xref>. The crystal structure revealed that baicalein binds Mpro in a core region of the substrate-binding site between domains I and II also interacting with the the His41-Cys145 dyad, S1/S2 sub-sites and the oxyanion loop. Furthermore, Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of different concentrations of baicalin or baicalein. Baicalin and baicalein showed a dose-dependent inhibition on the replication of SARS-CoV-2 with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 27.87 and 2.94 µM, respectively 
 <xref rid="b0770" ref-type="bibr">[154]</xref>. Therefore, the cell-based antiviral activity of baicalin or baicalein is close to that of chloroquine (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.71 µM) and hydroxychloquine (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.51 µM)
