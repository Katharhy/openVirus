<p id="p0540">An interesting molecular docking study compared the binding energy score of most promising molecules against SARS-CoV-2 MPro. It showed that O6K molecule had a binding score similar to N3 (−7.4 kcal/mol and −7.1 kcal/mol, respectively). Remdesivir and its metabolite (GS-441524) turned out to be slightly less effective (−7.0 and − 6.4 kcal/mol, respectively), while the entecavir, which has a structure similar to that of GS-441524, displayed also a closely similar score of −6.4 kcal/mol 
 <xref rid="b0765" ref-type="bibr">[153]</xref>. Notably, remdesivir, GS-441524 and entecavir might be multi-target potential inhibitors for both RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) and Mpro. In the same work, umifenovir, together with montelukast, a drug for the treatment of allergies and the prevention of asthma attacks, showed moderate binding score to Mpro (−6.5 kcal/mol and − 6.5 kcal/mol, respectively) while a lower score was found for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with −5.0 kcal/mol and −5.9 kcal/mol, respectively
