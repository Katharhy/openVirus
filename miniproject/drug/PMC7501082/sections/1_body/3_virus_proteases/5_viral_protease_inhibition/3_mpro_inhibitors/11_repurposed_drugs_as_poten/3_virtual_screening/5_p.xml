<p id="p0530">Not only anti-HCV and anti-HIV drugs but also the anti-influenza triazavirin was docked against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and tested clinically in China for COVID-19 treatment 
 <xref rid="b0735" ref-type="bibr">[147]</xref>. Viomycin, a nonribosomal peptide with antibiotic properties and administered for the treatment of 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection, was docked for Mpro embedding deeply inside the binding pocket and showing a higher number of hydrogen bonds with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro than N3 inhibitor 
 <xref rid="b0740" ref-type="bibr">[148]</xref>. A completely different category of drugs, like statins, have been docked with MPro; in particular pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, lovastatin, and fluvastatin may be novel molecules with inhibitory properties. In fact, pitavastatin (

 <xref rid="b0745" ref-type="bibr">[149]</xref>. Potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro were also identified by a structure-guided virtual screening approach using inhibitor N3 as a starting reference. Interestingly, among the selected molecules, leupeptin, pepstatin A, birinapant, lypressin, and octreotide turned out to be remarkable potential inhibitors. All these molecules have applications spanning from anticancer therapy to widespread inhibition of different types of proteases 
 <xref rid="b0750" ref-type="bibr">[150]</xref>. A structure-based virtual screening on SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was also performed using the ChEMBL database and thousands of other compounds as reference. The first result discussed was a hit of 64 drugs classified into antibacterial, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, anti-HIV, and neuropsychiatric drugs. Among them, two potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs were obtained from autodock vina docking simulations, namely a) curcumin (−7.3 kcal/mol), b) sepimostat (−7.9 kcal/mol), even though the best score was found for the eszopiclone (−10.0 kcal/mol) (
