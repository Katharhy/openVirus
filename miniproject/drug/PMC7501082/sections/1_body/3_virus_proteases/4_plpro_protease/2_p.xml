<p id="p0400">As already reported above, the Mpro is not the only protease that processes the post translational maturation of the viral polypeptide product but there is also a papain-like protease (PLpro) (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Unlike Mpro, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro share only 83% sequence identity with substantial variations occurring on the protein surface. These differences are expected to influence the binding of ligands to the PLpro but not the overall secondary and tertiary structures, suggesting that inhibitors developed for SARS-CoV would possibly work as lead compounds also for the development of SARS-Cov-2 PLpro drugs
