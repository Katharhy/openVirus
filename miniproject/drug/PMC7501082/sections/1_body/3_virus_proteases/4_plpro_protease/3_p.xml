<p id="p0405">The papain-like protease (PLpro) is part of the multi-domain/multi-functional non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) which is highly conserved among coronaviruses. Besides the proper proteinase domain, nsp3 also contains two ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domains, an ADP-ribose-1'-phosphatase domain, a nucleic acid-binding domain and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-membrane domains 
 <xref rid="b0610" ref-type="bibr">[122]</xref>. The catalytic domain of PLpro recognizes the tetrapeptide Lys-Xxx-Gly-Gly motif at P4-P1 positions found in-between viral non-structural proteins (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, ns1 and 2, ns2 and 3, ns3 and ns4), but it shows a broad substrate specificity at P3 position. SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and SARS-CoV PLpro differ by 54 residues, but the P3 and P4 sites are almost identical.
