<p id="p0640">The emergence of resistant strains under drug selective pressure and their limited availability in high-risk cases further exacerbates the need for new therapeutic strategies. The most obvious target is the virus cycle, trying to stop one of steps in this vicious cycle; in this respect, many laboratories have focussed on inhibitors of the main protease MPro and/or the PLpro. However, since the cycle occurs inside the host cell, this approach demands a deep investigation on the biological molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, requiring the virus isolation 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and its cultivation, as it is usually employed to verify the proof of principle of the viral infection process. However, it may not usually be practical, demanding particular facilities that are not easily accessible in bioresearch laboratories. Another possible approach to explore the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle is to clone a protein gene 
 <italic>P</italic> into an appropriate vector, transfect the cells, incubate them with the related protease, purify the protein and carry out the protein assays. This approach shows a number of drawbacks, such as the need of the viral genome, expensive synthesizing processes, availability of monoclonal antibodies, and time-consuming process
