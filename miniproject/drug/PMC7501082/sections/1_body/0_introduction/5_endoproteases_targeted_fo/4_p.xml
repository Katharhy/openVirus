<p id="p0035">The inactive CoV S protein acquires both cellular receptor binding and fusion function upon cleavage events at different sites, which can be carried out by multiple proteases at multiple sites in different cell compartments

 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> (see 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Importantly, depending on CoV strain and cell type, CoV S protein is activated at a specific cell localization by one or several host proteases, including furin, trypsin, cathepsin L, transmembrane protease serine protease2 (TMPRSS2), TMPRSS4, or human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT) 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> (see 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Exploiting redundant pathways to activate surface glycoproteins, the activating cleavage is mediated by multiple host membrane proteases via two distinct pathways, namely either (
 <italic>i</italic>) the late endosomal pathway, using cathepsins, and/or (
 <italic>ii</italic>) the cell-surface or early endosome pathway, using transmembrane serine proteases (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, TMPRSS2 and pro-protein convertase furin) (
