<p id="p0025">The activity of several endoproteases ensures viral infection, involving host and viral proteases which belong to the classes of serine- and cysteine-proteases, respectively. Both proteases of the host cell (which are supposed to assist the virus during the intracellular and extracellular phases of its cycle) and those of the virus act in a concerted fashion to regulate and coordinate specific steps of the viral propagation, such as (
