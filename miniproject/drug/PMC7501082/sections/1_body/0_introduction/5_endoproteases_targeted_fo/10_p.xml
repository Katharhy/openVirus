<p id="p0065">Beside host proteolytic enzymes, two viral proteases, namely Mpro and PLpro (involved in the maturation of viral polyprotein) are also recognized as important drug target(s). In particular, Mpro has been found to play a prominent role in the viral gene expression and replication, thus becoming an attractive target for anti-CoV-2 drugs. Notably, its quaternary structure renders Mpro ideal for rational drug design strategies against SARS-CoV-2, as there is a correlation between homodimer formation and the enzyme catalytic activity. Each protomer contains an antiparallel Î²-barrel structure, which has a folding scaffold similar to other viral chymotrypsin-like proteases. However, unlike chymotrypsin, the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro contains a catalytic cysteinyl residue instead of a serine residue.</p>
