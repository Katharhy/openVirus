<p id="p0075">Further, structural and evolutionary analyses indicate that SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is a highly conserved viral protein, which recognizes the sequence Leu-Met-Phe-Glnâ†“Ser-Gly-Ala while no human proteases share the same specificity 
 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. This unique feature makes Mpro an even more attractive target for a broad inhibition of multiple stages in the viral life cycle (such as viral formation, progression of the viral infection and reproduction of virions).
