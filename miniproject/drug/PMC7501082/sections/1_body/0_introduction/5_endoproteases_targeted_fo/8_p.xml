<p id="p0055">Therefore, furin may play either (
 <italic>a</italic>) a role in the first entry of the virus, thanks to its topological location at the outer membrane (which would allow the formation of the ternary complex with ACE2, 
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, furin:SARS-CoV-2S:ACE2), and/or (

 <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, envisaging the possibility that in these districts the role of furin in favouring the virus cell entry is relevant, providing a cellular and molecular basis for the comprehension of the major clinical effects of COVID-19 in the tissues where these cell types are located.
