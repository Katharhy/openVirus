<p id="p0605">The clinical observation clarifies that mortality is increased by co-morbidities like cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, and cancer. The therapies with antiviral drugs may have important cardio-vascular side effects and toxicities, but the effect of short-term use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, ribavirin, and lopinavir/ritonavir in patients without autoimmune diseases, hepatitis, HIV infection is not clear. Remdesivir is an experimental drug for the treatment of Ebolavirus, so cardiovascular effects and toxicities are unknown, whereas chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine seem to have considerable cardiovascular effects, at least when used at high dosage

Lopinavir efficacy was modest and detected only in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, discouraging its use at the later stage of viral infection; further, lopinavir/ritonavir showed side-effects, such as nausea, diarrhoea and hepatotoxicity
