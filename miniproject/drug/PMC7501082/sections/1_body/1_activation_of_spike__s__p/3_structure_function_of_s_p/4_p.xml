 <italic>N</italic>-terminal S1 subunit mediates the infection of receptor-expressing host cells; it contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B), made by 193 amino acids fragment, which is responsible for recognizing and binding the cell surface receptor (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, ACE2, see below). On the other hand, the S2 domain mediates viral–membrane fusion through the exposure of a highly conserved fusion peptide, important for the entry of the viral genome inside the host. Multiple cleavage events activate the viral S protein with the involvement of several host proteases; the cleavage at the S1/S2 sites splits S into S1 and the S2 bioactive fragments, while another critical cleavage event, conserved in all coronaviruses, occurs at the so called S2′ site
