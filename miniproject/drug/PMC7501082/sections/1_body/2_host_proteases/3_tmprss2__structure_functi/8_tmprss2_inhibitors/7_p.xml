<p id="p0280">A structural model of TMPRSS2-Camostat complex suggests that the predicted active site of the TMPRSS2 consists of the amino acid residues Asn146, Arg147, Cys148, Val149, Arg150, Leu151, Asp187, Met188, Tyr190, Ile221, Tyr222, Lys223, Asn368, Pro369, Gly370, Met371, Lys449, Asn450, Ile452, and Trp454 
 <xref rid="b0380" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0460" ref-type="bibr">[92]</xref>. Camostat interacts with the TMPRSS2 Val28, Asp440, Thr459, Ser460, Trp461, Tyr474 by van der Waals interactions and establishes seven hydrogen bonds with four key residues of the protease active site (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, Asn146, Cys148, Asp187, and Asn450) 
 <xref rid="b0380" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. In detail, Asn146 forms an arene cation and backbone acceptor H-bonds, while Cys148 forms an arene-H bond with the benzene ring of the ligand. Asn450 forms two hydrogen bonds with the anhydrous carbonyl oxygen, with side chain acceptor and backbone acceptor. Asp187 forms an acidic hydrogen bond with the primary amine and a sidechain donor hydrogen bond with the secondary amine of the ligand 
 <xref rid="b0380" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. In addition, different groups of Camostat mesylate form strong hydrogen bonds with two amino acid residues of the TMPRSS2 catalytic triad (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, His296 and Ser441) (
