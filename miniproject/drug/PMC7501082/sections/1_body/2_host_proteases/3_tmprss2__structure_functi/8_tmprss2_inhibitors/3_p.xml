<p id="p0260">A1AT is a small protein, synthesized in the liver and present in plasma at high levels (0.9Â g/L), its concentration displaying a six-fold increase under acute inflammation 
 <xref rid="b0465" ref-type="bibr">[93]</xref>. In the lungs, A1AT acts as a protective protein of the tissue damage and inflammatory response blocking the action of proteases involved in the cleavage of several structural proteins and processing several mediators of the innate immune response. It has been speculated that A1AT may reduce the pathogenicity of COVID-19 both by inhibiting the alveolar inflammatory response and by acting as a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, blocking the entry of the virus into the host cell
