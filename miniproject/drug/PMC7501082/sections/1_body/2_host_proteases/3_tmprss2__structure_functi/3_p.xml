<p id="p0205">TMPRSS2 (EC 3.4.21.109) is preferentially expressed in several epithelial tissues, such as prostate, kidney, colon, small intestine, pancreas, and lungs

 <xref rid="b0330" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. TMPRSS2 is also expressed in the cardiac endothelium, kidney, and digestive tissues, which indeed are target tissues for SARS-CoV-2 infection. As a matter of fact, among the clinical complications of COVID‐19 myocardial and acute kidney injuries are reported together with gastrointestinal symptoms

 <xref rid="b0345" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. Furthermore, since TMPRSS2 is also expressed in microvascular endothelial cells of the blood vessels, the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus may bring about endothelial dysfunction with associated thrombosis
