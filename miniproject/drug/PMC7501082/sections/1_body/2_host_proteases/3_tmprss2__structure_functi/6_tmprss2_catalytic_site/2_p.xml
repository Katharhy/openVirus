<p id="p0220">To date, the three-dimensional structure of human TMPRSS2 protein has not been solved, since it displays a high percentage of coiled structure, a theoretical isoelectric point of 7.42, and a high surface hydrophobicity 
 <xref rid="b0360" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0380" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. Full length structural models show that TMRPSS2 has a considerable structural homology with the serine protease hepsin (PDB ID: 1Z8G) 
 <xref rid="b0385" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. In detail, the TMPRSS2 structural model (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A) shows: (
 <italic>i</italic>) the 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminal region, weakly structured as a low density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor class A, (
 <italic>ii</italic>) putative Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> binding residues (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, Asp134, His138, Asp144, Glu145, and Ile256) on a loop linking the 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminus of the protein with the Scavenger Receptor Cysteine-Rich (SRCR)-domain, (
 <italic>iii</italic>) the SRCR domain, composed of an α helix and multiple anti parallel β sheets stabilized by two disulfide bonds between Cys172-Cys231 and Cys185-Cys241, (
 <italic>iv</italic>) the 
 <italic>C</italic>-terminus, with typical structural features of chymotrypsin family serine proteases, characterized by the His296, Asp345, and Ser441 catalytic triad and the substrate binding sites (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, Asp435, Ser460 and Gly462) sandwiched between two β barrels, each being composed of six strands of nearly equal size 
 <xref rid="b0390" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0380" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. The globular conformation of the domains is likely stabilized by four disulfide bonds between Cys244-Cys365, Cys281-Cys297, Cys410-Cys426, and Cys437-Cys465
