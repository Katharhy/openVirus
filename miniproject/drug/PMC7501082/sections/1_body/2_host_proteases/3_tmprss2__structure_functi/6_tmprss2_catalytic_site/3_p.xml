<p id="p0225">The catalytic mechanism of the TMRPSS2 involves a catalytic triad of three amino acids, namely Ser441 (nucleophile), Asp345 (electrophile), and His296 (base). The catalytic reaction hydrolyzes the substrate by a two-steps mechanism, that is (
 <italic>a</italic>) the acylation step, which involves the formation of a covalently linked enzyme-peptide intermediate and the loss of a peptide fragment, followed by (
 <italic>b</italic>) the deacylation step, characterized by a nucleophilic attack on the intermediate by water
 <bold>,</bold> leading to the hydrolysis of the peptide
