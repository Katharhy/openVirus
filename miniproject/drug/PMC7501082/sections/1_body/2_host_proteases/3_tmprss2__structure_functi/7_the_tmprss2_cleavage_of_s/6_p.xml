<p id="p0250">Since the key residues of TMPRSS2 interact with amino acids flanking the cleavage site of S protein, it has been suggested that, upon interaction with TMPRSS2, the protein S may undergo a conformational change needed for the fine positioning of the cleavage site (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, residues Arg685/Ser686 and/or Arg815/Ser816) into the active site cleft
