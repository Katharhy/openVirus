<p id="p0235">Not only SARS-CoV-2 but also other types of coronaviruses and influenza viruses (such as the SARS-CoV responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak and the influenza H1N1 responsible for the 1918 and 2009 influenza pandemics) depend on TMPRSS2 for activation of their spike S protein and the consequent cellular invasion

 <italic>TMPRSS2</italic>-deficient mice had minimal initial infection when infected with specific influenza A virus strains, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, showing an attenuated disease progression, as compared to wild type control mice. This protection indeed is likely due to the inhibition of the proteolytic activation of progeny virus and consequently inhibition of virus spread along the respiratory tract
