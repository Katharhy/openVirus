<p id="p0245">TMPRSS2 cleaves the S protein of coronavirus at two potential sites (Arg689/Ser690 and Arg815/Ser816 at the S1/S2 and the S2′sites, respectively) (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C and 3D) generating two distinct fragments of the S protein

 <xref rid="b0380" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. Selected docking poses for the complex between TMRPSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 S protein show that both cleavage sites of the viral S protein (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, S1/S2 site and S2′, see 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B) interact with one of the β barrel of the catalytic domain of TMPRSS2. In detail: (
 <italic>i</italic>) at the first cleavage site (Arg685/Ser686), the TMPRSS2 His296 establishes a hydrogen bond with the viral S protein residue Arg682; (
 <italic>ii</italic>) at the second cleavage site (Arg815/Ser816), His296 and Ser441 of TMPRSS2 form hydrogen bonds with Pro809, Lys814 and Ser810 of the S protein. A hydrogen bond also occurs between Ser810 of the S protein and the Ser460 of TMPRSS2 at the substrate binding site (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). Furthermore, the S protein Ser810 forms a hydrophobic interaction with the His296 of TMPRSS2 at the catalytic site
