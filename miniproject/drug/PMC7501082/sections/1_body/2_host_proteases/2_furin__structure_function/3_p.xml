<p id="p0135">Furin shuttles between the TGN and the cell membrane through the endosomal system, it is synthesized as a multi-segmented zymogen (100 kDa) (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), and it is autocatalytically cleaved into the mature form (70 kDa) in the TGN. Furin ectodomain can be shed, and the soluble form also retains its catalytic activity

 <italic>.</italic> This essential prodomain has a crucial role in the folding, activation and transport, and thus in the regulation, of furin activity through cell specific compartments.
