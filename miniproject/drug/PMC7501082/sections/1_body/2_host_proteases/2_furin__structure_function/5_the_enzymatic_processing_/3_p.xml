 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein displays at the S1/S2 site a 4 amino acids insertion which provides a minimal furin cleavage site (Pro-Arg-Arg-Ala-Arg689↓Ser-Val) and appears to create a larger S protein-furin interface, showing both positively charged residues (such as Arg185, Arg193, Lys261 and Arg298) (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C) and negatively charged ones of the catalytic site. It is supposed that furin attacks this cleavage site during virus egress 
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, facilitating the S protein priming and providing a gain-of-function to the SARS-CoV-2 for efficient spreading in the human population, as compared to other b lineage of β-coronaviruses. Therefore, the inhibition of such a process indeed might represent the basis for a successful antiviral strategy.
