<p id="p0165">A variety of approaches has been proposed to inhibit furin activity and some protein-based inhibitor variants have been engineered to develop powerful inactivators of furin. Among them, the α-1 antitrypsin Portland (α1‐PDX), a variant of the naturally occurring serine protease inhibitor α-1 antitrypsin, is able to efficiently inhibit furin (almost irreversibly due to its strong affinity) and to prevent the processing of HIV‐1 Env and measles virus F
