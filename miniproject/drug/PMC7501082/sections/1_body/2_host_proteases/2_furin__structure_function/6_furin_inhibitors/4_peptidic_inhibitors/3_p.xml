<p id="p0180">In this regard, the most powerful peptidomimetic furin inhibitors were based on the prototypical compound dec-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-CMK (where dec refers to decanoyl group and CMK to chloromethyl ketone) (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C and 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), by coupling appropriate multi-basic substrate sequences to a P1 arginyl chloromethyl ketone group 
 <xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. The addition of the CMK moiety has proven useful as it irreversibly alkylates the His194 residue in the active site of furin, blocking its activity

 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C and 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>); dec-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-CMK has also good cell permeability properties, which in turn enhance its efficacy

 <italic>.</italic> It was also reported that it is able to inhibit furin-mediated cleavage and fusion activity of viral glycoproteins, and acts as an antiviral agent against different viruses, including HIV

Recently, the efficacy of dec-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-CMK as an anti-flavivirus agent (against Zika virus and Japanese encephalitis virus) has been demonstrated in both mammalian cells and mosquito cells with significant antiviral activities in terms of the reduction in virus progeny titre, in viral RNA and protein production
