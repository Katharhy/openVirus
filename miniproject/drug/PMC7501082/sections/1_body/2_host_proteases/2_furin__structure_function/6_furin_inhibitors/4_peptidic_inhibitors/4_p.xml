<p id="p0185">In the context of the coronavirus infection, dec-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-CMK inhibited the processing of MERS-S protein, in a concentration-dependent manner, and had no effect on SARS-CoV-S expression, as expected from substrate specificity

 <xref rid="b0295" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Noteworthy, this furin inhibitor has been shown to block SARS-CoV-2 S processing at the S1/S2 site
