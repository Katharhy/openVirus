<p id="p0130">Furin (EC 3.4.21.75), also named PACE or PCSK3, is the prototype of subtilisin-/kexin-like proprotein convertase (PCSKs), encoded by a transcription unit in the upstream region of c-fes/fps proto-oncogene and it is ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic cells and tissues 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Furin is a type I transmembrane highly specific endoprotease which cleaves the precursor forms of many secreted proteins during their transport along the constitutive secretory pathway. Notably, furin has been identified as an activating protease for fusion surface glycoproteins of a broad range of viruses 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, displaying a broad optimum pH ranging between pH 5 and pH 8

 <italic>.</italic> Its large luminal/extracellular region has an overall homology with similar regions of other members of proprotein convertase (PC) family. The multi-segmented pro-precursor (794 amino-acid long) is formed by: (
 <italic>i</italic>) the 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminal signal peptide, (
 <italic>ii</italic>) the pro-domain (which is autocatalytically removed at pH 6.5), (
 <italic>iii</italic>) the subtilisin-like catalytic domain, (
 <italic>iv</italic>) the P-domain (which modulates pH and calcium requirements), (
 <italic>v</italic>) the Cys-rich domain, (
 <italic>vi</italic>) the transmembrane anchor domain, and (
 <italic>vi</italic>) the 
 <italic>C</italic>-terminal cytoplasmic domain (which controls the localization and sorting of furin in the 
 <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN)/endosomal system) (
