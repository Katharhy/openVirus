<p id="p0305">Within the lineage b of β-coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has revealed a dominant importance of furin, which was not observed before, suggesting that furin inhibitors may participate to halt virus propagation. However, despite considerable evidence of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of furin inhibitors, there is very limited clinical trial evidence to support or reject the use of these compounds in a therapeutic context. Moreover, one of the greatest limitations for the development of furin inhibitors as therapeutic agents has been related to potential health consequences. In this regard, since furin-like enzymes are involved in a multitude of cellular processes 
 <xref rid="b0495" ref-type="bibr">[99]</xref>, an important issue would be to avoid systemic inhibition that may lead to relevant side effects. While many of the inhibitors, described above, strongly reduce furin activity, most of them also inhibit other PCSKs, recognising the same or similar polybasic cleavage sites 
 <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Although a selective inhibition of individual PCSKs can be achieved, systemic long‐term inhibition will most likely have detrimental effects. Therefore, one crucial point in the therapeutic application of furin inhibitors is to limit the systemic inhibition that may lead to some adverse effects.
