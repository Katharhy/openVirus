<p id="p0325">Overall, despite the crucial role of furin, it is possible that acute inhibition over a limited time interval may lead to vastly beneficial effects in tackling viral infections, especially in the case of a substantial ineffectiveness of vaccines or other drugs. Future studies will have to better define short- and mid-term toxicity profiles and thus to establish the pharmacological safety of this type of intervention. Although the therapeutic application of furin inhibitors may show several pitfalls, it is certainly a potential treatment option against SARS-CoV-2 that should be further pursued
