<p id="p0315">An additional important aspect concerns the assessment of cell penetration properties for the developing inhibitors. Since furin localizes both in intracellular compartments (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, secretory pathway, endosomal pathway) and at the cell surface, inhibitors will have to reach both destinations to ensure full cleavage inhibition. Of note, several furin inhibitors (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, polyarginine and dec-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-CMK) exhibit good cell permeability properties, which in turn enhance their efficacy
