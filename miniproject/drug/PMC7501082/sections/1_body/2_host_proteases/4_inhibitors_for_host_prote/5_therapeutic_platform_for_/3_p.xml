<p id="p0335">Considering the central role of TMPRSS2 in activating SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viral infections, to interfere on its expression or on its activity indeed could represent a promising approach to treat respiratory COVID-19. Therefore, the knowledge of the amino acids that make up the active site of TMPRSS2 and the cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 favors the targeted design of efficient drugs against COVID-19. The structural information, obtained by computational analysis, combined with experimental

 <italic>in vivo</italic> validation, represents the basis for designing and discovering new protease inhibitors to be used for preventing the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human host cells.
