<p>Despite the high clinical importance of respiratory viruses, the mechanisms of pathogenicity, transmission and evolution are only partially known, and most respiratory virus infections lack effective treatment or prevention modalities. With this Research Topic we aimed to focus on these knowledge gaps. We sought to collect original research articles and focused reviews from leading experts all over the world on respiratory virus epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. We acknowledge all authors who submitted high-quality manuscripts. We accepted nine papers including six original research articles and three reviews. Influenza viruses are well-presented in the Topic by five papers. Two articles focus on RSV and one each on rhinovirus and MERS coronavirus.</p>
