<p>Respiratory virus infections cause an enormous disease burden both in children and in adults in all parts of the world. Influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are responsible for the highest numbers of deaths and hospitalizations but other respiratory viruses, including rhinovirus, parainfluenza viruses, adenovirus, human bocavirus and coronaviruses, are also currently known to cause severe diseases in addition to mild upper respiratory tract infections. Furthermore, respiratory viruses of animal origin keep on emerging as novel human pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential. Such viruses include avian influenza viruses and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses.</p>
