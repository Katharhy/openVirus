<p>RSV occurs in yearly epidemics that cause high number of severe lower respiratory tract infections in young infants and also in the elderly. There is variation in the timing of RSV epidemics between geographic areas. Recognition of the onset of the epidemic is important in order to accurately start adequate control measures, particularly passive immunization of high-risk infants by monoclonal antibodies such as palivizumab.
