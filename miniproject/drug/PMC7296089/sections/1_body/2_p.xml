<p>Seasonal influenza A and B virus epidemics globally cause up to 600,000 deaths per year. Influenza A viruses have an animal reservoir in avian species, which forms the basis for a permanent threat of pandemics. Vaccines and specific antiviral drugs against influenza are available but they have limitations including variable vaccine efficacies.

Identification of the important steps in adaptation of these viruses to humans is needed for evaluating the pandemic risk related to avian influenza viruses.
