<p id="par0040">Understanding transmission pathways of SARS-CoV-2 has significant implications for intervention and prevention. It was initially suggested that Chinese patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may have visited the seafood market in Wuhan City or may have consumed infected animals. However, further investigation revealed that some individuals contracted the COVID-19 without visiting the market. Indeed, an epidemiological study in early cases in this city showed that only 22% of patients were directly exposed to the marketplace, 32% of cases were in close contact with the suspected cases and 51% had no contact with either source [

Three transmission ways of SARS-CoV-2 in humans were proposed with incubation times of 2–14 days: 1) contact with liquid droplets produced by infected patients and/or 2) close contact with infected individuals and 3) contact with surfaces and material contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 (

In experimental setups, infectious viruses could be detected up to 24 h on cardboard, up to 2–3 days on plastic and stainless steel and up to 3 h post aerosolization (van Doremalen et al. 2020). Certain scientists recently highlighted another possible transmission route, the airborne transmission through droplet nuclei (or aerosols), meaning the possibility of the disease spreading in much smaller particles from exhaled air, known as aerosols. They are suggesting that aerosols are also more likely than droplets to be produced by talking and breathing and might pose a higher probability of transmission than coughing and sneezing [

 <xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Liu and colleagues at Wuhan University collected samples of aerosols in and around hospitals treating COVID-19 patients and found viral RNA from SARS-CoV-2 on protective apparel and floor surface and their subsequent resuspension. In this study, viral RNA concentration in aerosol samples was low (0–42 genomes/cubic metre of air) [
 <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. An American team studied the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in air samples and surfaces from 11 isolation rooms of COVID-19 patients and showed that many (63%) of air samples had evidence of viral contamination, with higher airborne virus concentration (2860 copies per cubic metre of air) [
 <xref rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. It is noteworthy to mention that infectious viruses have not been recovered from aerosols in any study. In a recently published paper, ten air samples of patient rooms with confirmed COVID-19 cases in the largest clinical hospital in Iran showed that all air samples were negative [
 <xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This may be because of air sampling processes damaging the viruses or because the virus does not resist easily to aerosolization process. Finally, given the general scientific knowledge about aerosol long distance indoor transport, aerosol scientists have proposed that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is most likely to occur in poorly ventilated spaces [
