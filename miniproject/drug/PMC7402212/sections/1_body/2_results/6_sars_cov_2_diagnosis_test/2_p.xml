<p id="par0060">At the initial stage of the outbreak, identification of COVID-19 cases mainly involved virus isolation from swabs and viral nucleic acid detection by RT-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in respiratory samples. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for detection of IgM and IgG antibodies against N and other SARS-CoV-2 proteins have also recently been made available. Several other diagnostic tests are developed to detect other regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome or targeting RdRp, Hel, S, E and N genes [
