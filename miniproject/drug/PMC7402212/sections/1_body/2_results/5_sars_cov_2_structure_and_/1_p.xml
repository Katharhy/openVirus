<p id="par0045">SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome is 29.9 kb [
 <xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. It contains 14 open reading frames (ORFs), encoding 27 proteins. At the 5’-terminal region of the genome, the ORF1 and ORF2 encode 15 non-structural proteins important for virus multiplication. The 3’-terminal region of the genome encodes functional structural proteins, namely spike (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleocapsid (N), plus 8 accessory proteins [

 <xref rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Phylogenetic and computational genomic analyses suggest that to enter in host’s cells, SARS-CoV-2 shares the same human cell receptor with SARS-CoV (ACE2), while MERS-CoV uses another (DPP4) [
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. ACE2 is an ectoenzyme anchored to the plasma membrane of the cells of several tissues, particularly in the lower respiratory tract, heart, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract [
 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. A structure model analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 with above 10 folds greater affinity than SARS-CoV, and much higher than the threshold required for viral infection [
 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The Spike (S) protein (of about 150 kDa) is the major antigen presented on the surface of SARS-CoV-2. The S protein forms a transmembrane homotrimer protruding from the viral surface to attach to the host cellular receptor ACE2. S comprises two functional subunits: subunit S1 responsible for binding to the cell surface receptor ACE2 and subunit S2 responsible viral fusion to the cell membrane [
