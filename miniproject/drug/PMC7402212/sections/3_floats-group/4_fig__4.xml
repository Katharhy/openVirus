  <p>SARS-CoV-2 life cycle in infected cells and inhibition targets: SARS-CoV-2 begins its life cycle by binding of the S protein presented on the surface of the virus to the cellular receptor ACE2 on the target cell. After receptor binding, the S protein changes conformation, facilitating viral envelope fusion with the infected cell membrane through endocytosis. SARS-CoV-2 then releases its genetic material into the host cell. Genomic RNA is translated into viral replicase polyproteins pp1a and 1ab, which are then cleaved into small products by viral proteinases. By discontinuous transcription, the polymerase produces a series of subgenomic mRNAs that are translated into viral proteins. The positive-sense genomic RNA is then packaged into a ribonucleocapsid and is assembled into viral particles in the ER and Golgi apparatus where they undergo maturation. Virions are finally transported via small vesicles and released out of the cell through exocytosis. Inhibition targets are presented in red.</p>
