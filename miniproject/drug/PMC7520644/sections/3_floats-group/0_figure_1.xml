  <p>Virulence factors and immune mechanisms during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. After the recognition of the virus by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and/or TMPRSS2 receptors, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) internalizes in the host cell. 
   <italic>Via</italic> several secondary messengers, the respiratory mucosal cell is stimulated to secrete cytokines and present viral antigens 
   <italic>via</italic> major histocompatibility complex (human leukocyte antigen) class II molecules to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which further secrete cytokines, such as interferon gamma. Additionally, natural killer cells (not shown) also contribute to the killing of infected host cells along with T cytotoxic cells as a part of cellular immunity against every viral infection. Antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, can present viral particles 
   <italic>via</italic> human leukocyte antigen class II molecules and prime CD4+ T helper cells, which further differentiate to different Th cells, such as Th17 cells (showed), which secrete a vast majority of cytokines, leading to cytokines storms and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Th cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies against some SARS-CoV-2 antigens, part of the humoral immunity against the virus. Viral replication and shedding are not shown. ARDS: Acute respiratory distress syndrome; SARS-CoV-2: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; ACE2: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.
