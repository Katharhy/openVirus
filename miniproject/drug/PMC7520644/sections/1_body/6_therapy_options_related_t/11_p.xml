<p>Anti-inflammatory strategies, including the blockade of specific cytokines that increase B1 expression on endothelial cells locally at the site of inflammation in combination with B1 and or B2 receptor blockade, should be considered. IL-1 (consisting of IL-1α and IL-1β) and TNF are potent inducers of the B1 receptor. Blocking the translocation of nuclear factor kappa B, TNF-α, or IL-1 prevents the regulation of B1 receptors both functional and molecular by lipopolysaccharide. Therefore, one strategy could be the treatment with anakinra, a monoclonal antibody that blocks not only IL-1α but also IL-1β, and has an excellent safety profile. IL-1a is probably in extremely high concentrations locally due to its release from damaged cells. TNF blockade is an option but is associated with many more infectious complications. Also, complement activity has been described and may play a role in this stage of the disease. Moreover, it may be affected by blockade of C5 component with eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that was randomized to COVID-19 (NCT04288713)[

The use of antibodies against cytokines is a general approach in several autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases in which one or more cytokines play a direct role in the pathogenesis. However, this approach is not without any side effects, so the benefit should always be considered.
