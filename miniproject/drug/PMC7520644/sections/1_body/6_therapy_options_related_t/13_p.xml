<p>Although various clinics in China have proclaimed the use of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) in severe cases of COVID-19 infection, no reliable results have yet been published. One of the advantages of this therapy is that MSCs must be activated by IFNγ. After that, MSCs are capable of exerting their anti-inflammatory effects. By producing various growth factors, MSCs can help repair damaged lung tissue. However, severely affected patients may lack these MSCs properties because T cells do not activate well in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The use of a “licensing approach” is being considered: Pre-treatment of MSCs with IFNγ with or without TNFα or IL-1. Thus, cytokine-treated MSCs may be more effective in suppressing the hyperactive immune response and promoting tissue repair, as such MSCs are useful in acute lung damage caused by lipopolysaccharide[
