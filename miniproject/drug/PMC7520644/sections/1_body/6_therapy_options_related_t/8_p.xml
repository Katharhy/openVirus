<p>The risks of passive application of sera products fall into two categories - known and theoretical. The known risks are those associated with the use of blood products - infectious diseases and allergic reactions to the components of the serum, including serum sickness. With modern blood banking techniques, these risks are low. For sera used for therapy, there are also theoretical risks for transfusion-related acute lung injury and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. Several mechanisms of ADE have been described for CoV, and there are concerns that antibodies against one type of coronavirus may exacerbate infection to another virus strain. It is possible to experimentally predict the risk of ADE in SARS-CoV-2, as suggested for MERS. It is assumed that when using sera rich in virus-neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, the risk of developing ADE is minimal[

Another theoretical risk is that the use of antibodies to individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 may weaken the immune response so that not enough of their own antibodies would form. This puts these people at risk for subsequent reinfection. However, if the risk proves to be real, these individuals can be vaccinated against COVID-19 when the vaccine becomes available.
