<p>However, ARDS is assumed as the leading cause of death in COVID-19. During the early stages of the outbreak, it was reported that of the 41 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients admitted, six died of ARDS[
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. ARDS remains the most common immunopathological event for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV infections. One of the primary mechanisms for ARDS is the cytokine storm. The latter is a uncontrolled systemic inflammatory reaction resulting from the release of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, IL-33, TNF-α, TGFβ, 
 <italic>etc</italic>.) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, 
 <italic>etc</italic>.) from immune effector cells during many viral infection[
