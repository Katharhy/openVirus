<p>A common complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the development of ARDS. The latter is assumed as the leading cause of death in patients with COVID-19, especially among those with underlying diseases and conditions, evaluated as risk factors, smokers, and older age. ARDS is a result of the cytokine storm - an immunopa-thological event that leads to an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response from the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFNα, IFNγ, IL-1β IL-3, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, TNFα, and chemokines by the immune cells during SARS-CoV infection[

Furthermore, it was shown that blocking IL-6 by Tocilizumab restored partially HLA-DR expression and increased the number of circulating lymphocytes[
