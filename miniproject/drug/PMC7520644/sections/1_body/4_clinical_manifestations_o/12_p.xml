<p>Another hypothesis on the severity of COVID-19 disease includes the problem associated with the activation of bradykinin B1 receptors on the lung endothelial cells. It is assumed that the enzymatic activity of the ACE-2 receptor inactivates des-Arg9 bradykinin, which is a ligand for B1. Furthermore, unlike B2, B1 is regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines[

Probably, angioedema is a typical manifestation of the severe disease onset and the cause of typical changes visible on the computed tomography scan. The feeling of choking is observed mainly around day 9, denoted the worsening of the patients[
