<p>Patients with COVID-19 may worsen clinically after some days of illness (especially around day 9), which is accompanied by an increase in the pro-inflammatory response, which often leads to admission to intensive care units and the need for supportive mechanical ventilation. This secondary deterioration is reminiscent of SARS-CoV, in which 80% of patients with SARS-CoV develop acute respiratory disease at the time of anti-viral IgG seroconversion[
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. IgG seroconversion is associated with two points in the immune response - the disappearance of the virus and the appearance of IgG antibodies. IgM antibodies may persist for some time together with IgG. Moreover, patients who produce anti-S-neutralizing antibodies at the onset of the disease have a higher risk of death. The mechanisms behind these observations are not clear, but it is assumed that excessive complement activation may play a role. In addition, a phenomenon called antibody-mediated enhancement of viral infection may be responsible for persistent viral load and subsequently cause a direct or indirect effect on ACE-2 activity in the lung[
