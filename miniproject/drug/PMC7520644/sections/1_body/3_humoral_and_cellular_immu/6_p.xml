<p>Helper CD4+ T cells simultaneously expressing CD38 and HLA-DR increased between day 7 (0.55%) and day 9 (3.33%) in this patient compared to healthy donors (0,63% Â± 0.28%), although being in lower percentages than for CD8+ T cells. CD38+HLA-DR+CD8+ T cells produce about 34%-54% more granzymes A and B and perforin.
