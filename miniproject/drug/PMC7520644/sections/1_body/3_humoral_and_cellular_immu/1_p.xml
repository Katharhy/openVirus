<p>The presentation of virus antigens stimulates the humoral and cellular immune response, which are exerted by virus-specific B and T lymphocytes, respectively. Like common acute viral infections, the antibody production against SARS-CoV viruses has a typical immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG pattern. SARS-specific IgM antibodies may disappear at the end of the 3
 <sup>rd</sup> mo. In contrast, the IgG antibody may persist longer, indicating that IgG antibodies are likely to be protective[
