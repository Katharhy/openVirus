<p>A clinical case of mild SARS-2-CoV infection and favorable outcome for the patient revealed that the antibody-producing immune cells, defined by the expression of CD3-CD19+CD27
 <sup>hi</sup>CD38
 <sup>hi</sup> and CD4+CXCR5+ICOS+PD-1+ Th follicular cells, appear in the blood during viral clearance (day 7; 1.48%) and peak on day 8 (6.91%); and on day 7 (1.98%), increasing on day 8 (3.25%) and day 9 (4.46%), respectively. The peak of both cell subpopulations was significantly higher in the COVID-19 patient than in healthy controls and persisted during convalescence[

Besides, the incidence of CD38+human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR+CD8+ T cells was significantly higher in this patient than in healthy subjects (1.47% Â± 0.50%)[

We have to emphasize once again that activated cytotoxic T cells, representatives of adaptive or so-called specific immunity, along with natural killer (NK) cells, part of innate immunity, are critical players in the cell-mediated immune response that accompanies any viral infection.
