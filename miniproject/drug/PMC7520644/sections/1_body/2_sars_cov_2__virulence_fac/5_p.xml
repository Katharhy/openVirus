<p>CoV have developed many mechanisms to avoid the immune system, which allow them to better survive in host cells. One of the multiple strategies is the forming of double-membrane vesicles that lack pattern recognition receptors when shedding, thus avoiding the recognition of their evolutionary old and conservative pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as double-stranded RNA[
