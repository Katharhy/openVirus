<p>Another aspect of the unclear immune response and immune memory regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection is the desire of the world to have an effective vaccine against the virus to be invented. This vaccine is essential to reduce the severity of the disease and its spread and clear the virus, thus helping to control current and future coronavirus outbreaks. There are several strategies for developing vaccines against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV tested in animals. Among them are: Using live attenuated virus, viral vectors, inactivated virus, vaccine subunits, recombinant DNA, and protein vaccines[

There may currently be other promising targets to use in the creation of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection and therapy, but additional laboratory and clinical evidence are still needed. Some new pharmaceutical drugs, including anti-human immunodeficiency virus and stem cell drugs, have been shown in these clinical trials. These studies are ongoing, but still it will take months to years to develop vaccines for SARS-CoV-2.
