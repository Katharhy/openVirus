<p>One of the main immunological features of COVID-19 is the exhaustion of lymphocytes. This, along with the reduced functional diversity of immune cells, is associated with a severe course of the disease[
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The impaired immune response makes the possibility of adequate immune memory questionable. However, recovered patients displayed some SARS-CoV-specific antibodies up to 2-6 years after infection, unless they experienced ARDS, which led to undetectable peripheral memory B cell responses[

 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. To develop its own specific protective anti-viral immune response during the incubation period and in mild cases, the host must be in good general health and have an appropriate genetic terrain (
