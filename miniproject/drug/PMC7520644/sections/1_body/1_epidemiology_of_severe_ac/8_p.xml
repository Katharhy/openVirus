<p>Coronavirus is one of the significant pathogens that targets the human respiratory system primarily[
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 was found to have higher rates of transmissibility and therefore pandemic risk than SARS-CoV, as the current effective reproductive number (R) is 2.9, which is much higher than the R of SARS (1.77). Several COVID-19 studies have estimated the basic reproduction number ranges between 2.6 to 4.71[

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, the case fatality rate (CFR) of any disease is not fixed and varies with location and time. It was shown that CFR of COVID-19 varies widely between countries ranging from 0.2% in Germany to 7.7 % in Italy[
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The differences in the CFR might be due to various factors. On one hand, the greater the number of performed polymerase chain reaction tests, the less the CFR will be. On the other hand, underlying conditions and comorbidities of the patients should also be taken into account - has a patient died because of COVID-19 or as a result of an exacerbation of a chronic disease/or another sudden acute medical condition, such as stroke and heart failure, but with a positive polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
