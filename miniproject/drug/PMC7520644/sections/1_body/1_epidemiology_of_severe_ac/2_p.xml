<p>The positive-sense single-stranded RNA of SARS-CoV-2 is enveloped in a lipid bilayer. The virus belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> and family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>[
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Yet, the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 remain vague. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-related viruses were found in Malayan pangolins (
 <italic>Manis javanica</italic>), as several recent studies showed. These data provided new insights into the evolution and host distribution of these SARS-CoV-2-related viruses[
