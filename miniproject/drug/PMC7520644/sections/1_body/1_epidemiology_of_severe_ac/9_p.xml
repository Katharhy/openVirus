<p>SARS-CoV-2 proved to be a great challenge. Adapted to the human body, it spread around the world in a short time. The air-drop mechanism is straightforward to implement. The natural spread of SARS-CoV-2 is due to the mechanism and the fact that in about 85% of patients, COVID-19 occurs in a mild form. Patients with a mild form do not seek medical help. Usually, they treat themselves and infect their contacts[

It has been shown that asymptomatic individuals can be contagious and secrete SARS-CoV-2. This further facilitates the spread of COVID-19. From an epidemiological point of view, mild and asymptomatic infections are hazardous because people have no idea that they are contagious. They do not seek medical help, they are not examined, and by contact, infect others. This requires a strict search and examination of the contacts of proven individuals with COVID-19 for the detection of asymptomatic infectious.
