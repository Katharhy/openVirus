<p id="Par24">In previous retrospective studies, the occurrence of psychosocial diseases is often strongly associated with specific population or special environmental factors. For example, although the stress level of medical staff among SARS survivors during the outbreak was similar to that of non-medical staff, a year later, the pressure level of medical staff was significantly higher, with higher levels of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic symptoms and scores. After controlling factors such as age, gender and education, health care workers are six times more likely to score above the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) threshold due to the dual pressure of being patients and medical staff [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. 17.3% of the medical staff without the disease had similar mental symptoms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], including chronic fatigue, pain, weakness, depression and sleep disorders [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Over the long term, of the 90 subjects recruited, a quarter had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 30 months after SARS, while 15.6% had depression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. What’s more, different occupations have different effects on mental health, doctors have more physical symptoms compared to nurses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Our results, therefore, highlight the need to enhance the preparedness and capacity of healthcare professionals to detect and manage the psychological consequences of future comparable outbreaks of infectious diseases.
