<p>The role of NK cells in coronaviral infections has been mostly understudied because mice studies showed that NK cells may not be essential for viral clearance in SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infections. However, the recent COVID-19 vaccine study demonstrated the antispike dependent NK cell responses in vaccinated macaques [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which indicates NK cells do exert functions towards COVID-19–infected cells. Nonetheless, most studies have not considered the alternate hypothesis that NK cells could in fact be pathologic and contribute to the pathogenesis in COVID-19 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008820.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In SARS-CoV-2–infected patients, the frequency of peripheral NK cells were reduced [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] or not significantly altered [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Reduction in NK cell frequencies and their CD16 expression in severe COVID-19 patients reverted back to normal levels after recovery [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Functionally, peripheral NK cells and CD8 T cells exhibited reduced expression of CD107a, IFN-γ, and TNF-α in COVID-19 patients [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Elevated NKG2A expression on both NK and T cells indicative of exhaustion in the patients was restored to normal levels after therapy [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This upregulated NKG2A expression on NK cells was found to be mediated by the viral spike protein. In vitro coculture of peripheral NK cells with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein transfected lung epithelial cells resulted in reduced NK degranulation and up-regulation of NKG2A [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The concomitant histocompatibility leukocyte antigen E (HLA-E) expression on the lung epithelial cells shows that the spike protein could lead to NK cell exhaustion through HLA-E and NKG2A interaction [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The commentary by Antonioli and colleagues [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] suggests that this NKG2A expression on NK cells and T cells could be a critical factor in the immune dysfunction of COVID-19 patients, disrupting the crosstalk between these immune cells and neutrophils. The IFN-γ secreted by activated NK cells not only functions as an antiviral cytokine but is also important for the impairment of neutrophil expansion and survival in the lungs of TB-infected mice, thus regulating and limiting neutrophil mediated tissue injury [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The increased NKG2A expression on NK cells provides inhibitory signals, which in turn inhibits the NK cell expansion, while the neutrophil numbers remain uncurbed. This is further aggravated by the inflammatory milieu set up by the cytokine release syndrome, particularly IL-6 and IL-10, which have been shown to induce NKG2A expression [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] while inducing neutrophilia [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This phenomenon could be why COVID-19 patients have reduced frequencies of NK cells, T cells, and total lymphocyte counts, while a high NLR is one of the prognostic markers of poor disease outcome [
