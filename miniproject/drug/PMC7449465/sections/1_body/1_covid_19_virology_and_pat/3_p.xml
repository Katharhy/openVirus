<p>The central immunopathogenic mechanism in COVID-19 associated complications and morbidities is the cytokine syndrome elicited by the unbridled inflammatory immune cells. Indeed, elevated IL-6, TNF-α, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 7 (CCL7), and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10) correlated with severity of disease [

 <sup>+</sup> monocytes secreting IL-6 and GM-CSF have been reported in COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia [

While there is limited data available on the role of NK cells in COVID-19 pathogenesis, particularly in lung pathology, the functional exhaustion of NK cells and T cells could further complicate the immune dysfunction in COVID-19 patients [
