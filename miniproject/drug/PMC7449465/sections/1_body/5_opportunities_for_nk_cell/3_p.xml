<p>Functional exhaustion of NK cells and T cells seen in COVID-19 patients [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] could be targeted for restoration by blockade of exhaustion and inhibitory markers. Overexpression of NKG2A on NK and T cells leads to inhibitory signaling and suppressed cytotoxic functions and could further disrupt the NLR [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Monalizumab [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], which blocks NKG2A, has already cleared Phase II clinical trials against a number of cancers and could be a potential therapeutic candidate that could restore antiviral functions of NK and T cells and restore the NLR. However, it is important to point out that there is a risk of overactivation of NK cells, which could also result in tissue injury.
