<p>NK cell–based therapies for COVID-19 as stand-alone or combination therapy are very promising. However, as explained by Rajaram and colleagues [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], NK cell therapy could be associated with significant risks. There are several concerns that need to be addressed, such as overactivation of NK cells and secretion of inflammatory cytokines, destruction of pneumocytes, and tissue injury, which would perpetuate the ARDS and fatal outcomes associated with COVID-19 pathology. Parameters such as the timing of the NK cell therapy and the severity of the disease status need to be considered to tip the balance towards therapeutic protection. NK cell responses would be more effective early in the infection and would prevent progression of the disease. Immunomodulation of NK cells towards regulatory function could be useful as adjunct therapy in progressive patients. For example, IFN-β therapy induces regulatory NK cells that could control overt T cells responses [

To truly understand the implications of NK cell therapy in COVID-19 pathology or protection, it would be highly beneficial to use animal models for studying the effect of NK cell depletion and activation in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Overall, more clinical and preclinical data is necessary to take the right steps towards curbing the pandemic and bolstering a future plan in case of recurring SARS-CoV-2 infections.
