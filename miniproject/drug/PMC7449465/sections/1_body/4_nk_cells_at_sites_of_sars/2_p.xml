<p>The main SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, ACE2, is also found in several tissues associated with the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, cardiovascular system, and brain. ACE2 is particularly enriched in the gut, where it is involved in regulation of intestinal amino acid transporters and thereby influences gut microbiome composition and intestinal inflammation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Therefore, it is unsurprising that GI symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are also associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection with viral shedding in fecal samples [

NK cells are present in large and small intestine and localized in the intraepithelial lymphocyte compartment, lamina propria, and Peyer’s patches, and play important complex roles in regulating the gut microbiome, immune crosstalk, and immune defenses against gut pathogens. Unlike lung NK cells, the gut mucosal NK cells are predominantly immature NK cells of phenotype CD3

 <sup>bright</sup>CD16
 <sup>-</sup> cells, which are primarily IFN-γ secreting and not cytotoxic [

While alterations in gut NK cell subsets have been reported in mucosal infections, particularly in HIV infection, there are no studies to provide information on coronavirus-mediated immunity or pathology in the gut of humans and animal models.
