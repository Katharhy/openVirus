<p>Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that provide rapid and efficient responses against pathogens and tumors. NK cells are present in healthy lymphoid and mucosal tissues and are swiftly mobilized to sites of infection. The phenotype and functions of human NK cells can be complex and varied depending on the tissue, ranging from pathogen clearance by cytotoxic responses to maintenance of homeostasis by immune-regulation. Broadly, CD56
 <sup>bright</sup> immature NK cells are secretors of proinflammatory cytokines, and CD56
 <sup>dim</sup>CD16
 <sup>high</sup> mature NK cells are cytotoxic in function. NK cells are also used in development of novel biotherapeutics and vaccines due to their potent functions. However, there is a huge gap in the understanding of the roles and functions of NK cells in COVID-19 infection. In this review, we strive to provide an overview of what is known about NK cells in SARS-CoV-2 patients and animal models, and their potential roles in stand-alone or combination therapy against the pandemic (
