<p id="Par38">Many of the non-trivialities we noticed in the interpretation of the COVID-19 data would have remained unknown without charting out our approach. The IRRP (1) and the derived analytic expressions based on IRRP (1) are worthy enough to capture and comprehend the importance of the restrictions like social distancing to reduce (if not a total elimination) the COVID-19 infectivity. The lessons we learned from analyzing and interpreting the data evidence to deal with pandemics like COVID-19 will equip us to be ready for any future pandemic. The predictability in any category for any zone is feasible via building appropriate regression or structural equation models if the pertinent data on the covariates such as gender, age, race, socioeconomic status, and health insurance status are collected and made available.</p>
