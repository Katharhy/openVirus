<p id="Par42">Does our model in harmony with this turning changes? Florida, Texas, and California were a member of the eastern, central, and pacific zone states. Our IRRP model pointed out that the estimated incidence rate of COVID-19 was highest in all these three zones. New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania were uniquely within the eastern zone which had the highest incidence rate. Recall that the effectiveness of controlling the spread of COVID-19 was the best only in the eastern zone. What must have happened in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania was the spillover lag effect of most effectiveness. Being a part of the least effective central and pacific zone (as we pointed out in early discussion), Texas and California continued to experience increased COVID-19 incidences. California and Florida relaxed the social distancing too fast and too liberal. Our data analysis did not involve any direct information pertinent to these changes and hence, our IRRP model could not address this issue. The quick reopening up the state from the lockdown and/or social distancing ought to have created super-spreaders (who have the potential to connect with a great number of people) via some social events (such as sport, music, religious gathering, recreation parks). Such information has not entered the current IRRP modeling process and hence, the model is limited in that sense to explain the resurgence or the second wave.</p>
