<p id="Par16">One such model for the COVID-19-driven health system could be the 
 <italic>incidence rate restricted Poisson</italic> (IRRP). The IRRP distribution was originally presented by Shanmugam [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It fits our scenario here because the rates in all categories (they are infectivity, hospitalization, recovery, and mortality) receive an impact due to practical restrictions with respect to COVID-19. If the IRRP works, it helps to learn and interpret the patterns and predictability of the COVID-19 as they are illustrated in the article. Also, we will be knowledgeable enough to present a feasible reform for the optimal healthcare delivery to deal with any future contingency due to pandemics like this COVID-19.
