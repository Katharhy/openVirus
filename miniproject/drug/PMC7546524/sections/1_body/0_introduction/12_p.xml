<p id="Par13">The research theme of this article is therefore to construct an approach to detect how effective the social distancing, locking down the nation, etc. have been to reduce the prevalence of COVID-19, to detect how efficiently the infected cases have been hospitalized by the local/state/federal agencies, to detect how optimally the COVID-19 patients recover in the treatment, and lastly to detect how best the COVID-19 mortality is disposed of. For this purpose, we construct an approach based on the incidence of restricted Poisson chance principles and derive much needed algebraic expressions to detect the abovementioned goals. To check whether our novel approach works, we involve the prevalence of COVID-19 cases, the number of them hospitalized, the number of recovered cases from coronavirus, and how many died in the 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC). The data are drawn from a public domain webpage

For optimal data analyses, we grouped the data in terms of eastern, central, mountain, and pacific time zone states because we need enough samples to estimate the sampling errors to make a statistical assessment. Of course, the Alaska and Hawaii states were included in the pacific zone, while the DC is included in the eastern zone.
