<p id="Par3">Our approach is new, novel, and interesting from the view of extracting and interpreting pertinent data informatics for the sake of better public health. Our approach helps the administrators and policymakers to formulate and adapt refined healthcare public policies to reduce the incidences of the COVID-19 because of the interpretable parameters and computable expressions of the IRRP model. The US data are portioned into four regions (eastern including District of Columbia, central, mountain, and pacific time zone states, Alaska and Hawaii are added to the pacific states) to compare the regional performances and/or differences. Some factors like population density, reaction time to shut down the state, or even the temperature could affect the prevalence rate directly. Also, the peopleâ€™s movements are more frequent within than out of the regions on daily basis and it is a reason for the partitioning of data in terms of time zones. Even inside these four time zones, the data are highly imbalanced. There is no significant outlier in any time zone and hence, our results based on the mean and variance are robust. However, the manuscript discovers some fascinating differences and similarities among the four regions including non-intuitive findings about the existence of imbalance, different vulnerability, and risk reduction.</p>
