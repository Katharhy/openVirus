<p id="Par2">In this frightening time of COVID-19, professionals in the field of public health are drowning with lots of data. Not much practical findings are extracted from the data either in favor of the current public health policies such as lockdown, no travel, masking the face, no public interactions in shopping, and in restaurants or in need new policies to reduce if not total elimination of the COVID-19â€™s incidence rate. This article, using modeling as an approach, addresses whether a significant reduction in the parametric space of the incidence rate has occurred due to various current public health policies cited above with respect to each one of the four categories: infectivity, hospitalization, recovery, mortality. Mathematical models are the generally convenient vehicle to grasp the dynamics of the epidemics and uncertainty that prevent or spread the epidemics in the population (see Okabe and Shudo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] for details). Once the significant factors that spread the epidemics are identified and quantified, that would assist the policymakers to formulate accurate decisions to reduce first and eliminate later the epidemics (see Yang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] for details). Though several variations exist, the basic model that describes the transitions of a population in an epidemic to susceptible, infectious, and recovery state based on ordinary differential equations (connecting the contact and cure rates) is called the SIR model. The SIR model does not incorporate the uncertainty principle. Sometimes, an extended version of the SIR is recognized as a compartment model in the literature of infectious diseases (see Tolles, Luong [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] for details). The ideas behind the SIR model originated from Kermack and McKendrick [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] which discussed an epidemic of an infectious disease in a large population. The SIR model perhaps oversimplifies a complex epidemic process like COVID-19. It assumes a homogeneously mixing population, meaning that all individuals in the population are assumed to have an equal probability of meeting one another. This assumption does not match human social structures, in which most of the contact occurs within limited vicinity or networks. In addition, the parameters in a traditional SIR model do not allow quantification of uncertainty as model parameters, although no model is perfect in so far as predicting closely the incidence rate of the epidemics and/or offering some help to formulate viable public health policy. Recently, using the SIR model, Ambrosio and Aziz-Alaoui [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] took into consideration the daily fluxes between New Jersey (NJ) and New York (NY) states to notice a decrease in the COVID-19 incidences due to their lockdown policies. They also noted that a wave in NJ occurred following the NY wave, illustrating the mechanism of spread from one attractive hot spot to its neighbor. Therefore, we offer a viable alternative approach based on probabilistic principles to deal with uncertainty in the spread and reduction of the COVID-19 incidences in US states.
