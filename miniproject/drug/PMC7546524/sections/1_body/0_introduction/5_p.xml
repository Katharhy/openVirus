<p id="Par6">How does coronavirus spread? The COVID-19 is a single-stranded RNA. Even after a full recovery from treatment in a hospital, a person could get inflicted by the coronavirus again, according to Japan’s Broadcasting Corporation 
 <italic>Nippon Hōsō Kyōkai</italic> (NHK). This dampens the hope of the drug or vaccination discovery process. Even with the availability of effective vaccination, everyone needs to be annually vaccinated. However, as of now, there is no vaccination or preventive medicine to consume to avoid coronavirus. The best people can do is to practice 
 <italic>social distancing</italic>, 
 <italic>lockdown</italic>, 
 <italic>no travel</italic>, 
 <italic>masking face</italic>, 
 <italic>no public interactions in shopping</italic>, 
 <italic>in restaurants</italic>, etc. to prevent COVID-19’s spread.
