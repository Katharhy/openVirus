 <italic>δ</italic> = ∞ in the IRRP (1), the impact factor is one. The impact factor in all zones of infectivity and of mortality is less than one. The eastern and central zones have less than one impact in the recovery category. The impact factor is less than one in the hospitalization category in the mountain zone and the pacific zones only. However, the least impact has occurred in the infectivity category of the eastern zone. These findings confirm what we heard in the media about COVID-19 in the USA.
