<p id="Par30">The estimated imbalance factor across the categories (see Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, and 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> for details) in every zone confirms that the IRRP (1) fits better than a simple Poisson in the COVID-19 data. The expected value is clearly tilted from the variance. Only when the estimated imbalance factor is unity, the regular Poisson distribution (in which 
 <italic>δ</italic> = ∞) is appropriate. The regular Poisson is synonymous with no restriction.
