<p>Variability in illness severity in patients with COVID-19 highlights a complex interaction between virological factors and host susceptibility. ARDS is the most frequent cause of death of COVID-19. It is related to an excessive host immune response to the virus, characterised by a cytokine storm with features of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and cytokine-release syndrome (CRS).
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> There is evidence showing that immunosuppressants and, in particular, cytokine-targeted biological and glucocorticoids can hamper the inflammatory response and improve the outcome of patients with MAS or CRS.
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Currently, various clinical trials are underway to study the optimal approach to reduce the inadequate inflammatory response with immunosuppressants to prevent ARDS in COVID-19.
