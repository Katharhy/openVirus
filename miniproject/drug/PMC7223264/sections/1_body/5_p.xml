<p>Type 1 interferons (IFNs) are cytokines that play a key role in antiviral immunity and include among others IFN-α and IFN-β. Type 1 IFN interfere with coronavirus replication in vitro. SARS-CoV, and probably also SARS-CoV-2, interfere with the host’s antiviral signalling pathways, resulting in decreased production of type I IFN.
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The efficacy and safety of IFN-β1 in COVID-19 are currently evaluated as part of the ‘Solidarity’ clinical trial. Overexpression of type I IFN is one of the characteristics of SLE and appears to be the result of genetic polymorphisms and environmental factors. One may hypothesise that the increased bioavailability of type 1 IFN in SLE promotes host defenses against SARS-CoV2 infection and provide some degree of protection against severe COVID-19 in this patient population.
