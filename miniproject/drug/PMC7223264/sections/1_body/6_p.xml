<p>Given their antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, antimalarials (hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine) represent a potential adjunct treatment for patients with COVID-19 infection. Small uncontrolled or poorly controlled clinical trials have shown an antiviral effect of antimalarials in COVID19 contributing to the growing interest of the health authorities, media and general population. As a result, concerns have arisen about the availability of antimalarials for patients with SLE, for whom these drugs have been proven for a long time. Since only limited data support the use of these drugs in COVID-19, a recent document emphasised the importance of limiting their systematic use in COVID-19 and rationing the supply available for clinical trials and for patients with SLE or with other rheumatic diseases.
