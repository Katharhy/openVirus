<p>During the current COVID-19 pandemic, strict measures of social distancing have been implemented and are probably the best way to limit the spread of the virus. However, since the healthcare system is overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases and regular patients are advised not to leave their confinement for elective consultation, we must remain alert to the risk of missed or delayed diagnosis of SLE flare-up. Therefore, regular monitoring should be maintained for the early detection of disease flare-up.
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> With the aim to reduce contact exposure, telephonic visits are a reasonable first-step screening for stable patients, nevertheless face-to-face visit should not be precluded for SLE patients with active disease potentially requiring therapeutic changes.
