<p>SLE is an autoimmune disease prone to flare-ups that are linked to significant morbimortality. Immunosuppression-related infections are one of the leading causes of premature death in patients with SLE. However, there are currently no data to support a higher infection rate, an increased risk of ARDS or other serious complications related to COVID-19. One could even argue that SLE and/or its treatment can protect against the serious complications related to COVID-19. Current knowledge of the immunopathology of COVID-19 is far too limited to draw definitive conclusions, but certain hypotheses can be made on the basis of preliminary data and previous epidemics of coronavirus.</p>
