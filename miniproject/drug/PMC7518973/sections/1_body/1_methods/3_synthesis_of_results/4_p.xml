<p id="p0075">The OH understandings were categorized into groups derived inductively from the wording used by the authors in their texts. Other classifications of OH proposed in the literature [e.g. 
 <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>] provided a basis for defining the groups. It was thereby possible for a study to be associated with more than one group. Three groups were identified following the patterns of how OH was utilized:
 <list list-type="simple" id="l0010">
  <list-item id="li0025">
   <label>•</label>
   <p id="p0080">Institutional coordination and collaboration: OH was framed as a way to communicate, coordinate, and collaborate among stakeholders across sectors in a multi−/inter−/ and/or transdisciplinary manner to solve complex health challenges.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="li0030">
   <label>•</label>
   <p id="p0085">One Health in action/implementation: OH was used in a way to provide a frame for the actions introduced or proposed to prevent and control the respective disease outbreak, e.g. through surveillance and monitoring.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="li0035">
   <label>•</label>
   <p id="p0090">Extended One Health: OH was framed as a more comprehensive and extended understanding, thereby emphasising the role of the environment (either built or natural) and highlighting the complex interactions at the human-animal-environment interface as well as social, structural and ecological changes.</p>
