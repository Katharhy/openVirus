 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Eight databases were systematically searched (i.e. Google Scholar, JStor, PubMed, Science Direct, Springer Link, Taylor and Francis Online, Web of Science, and Wiley Online Library). The search terms were inspired by Elsevier's “Novel Coronavirus Information Center” [
 <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and further organized into coronaviruses and combined with OH: (i) coronavirus or “corona virus”, (ii) “COVID-19” or “2019-nCov” or “SARS-CoV-2”, (iii) “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome” or “SARS-CoV” or “SARS”, (iv) “Middle East Respiratory Syndrome” or “MERS-CoV” or “MERS”, and “One Health”. The literature search was repeated several times between April and September 2020 to identify newly published studies constantly.
