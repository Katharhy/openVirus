<p id="p0060">Studies were considered suitable for inclusion if they specifically mentioned OH in their title or abstract in combination with either SARS, MERS, or COVID-19. Scientific publications in the form of case reports, correspondences, data articles, discussions, editorials, research and review articles, or short communications were included. However, books or book reviews, conference proceedings, and meeting abstracts, front matters, news, posters, practice guidelines, presentations, replication studies, or software and video publications were not considered. The year of the SARS outbreak (2002) was set as the starting point and only studies published in English were included. The full-texts of the studies that met the inclusion criteria were assessed for eligibility subsequently. Only studies that demonstrated an explicit and clear link between OH and coronaviruses were included in the final synthesis.</p>
