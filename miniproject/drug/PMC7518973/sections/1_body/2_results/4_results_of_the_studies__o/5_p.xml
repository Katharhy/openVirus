<p id="p0140">For further analysis, the studies were categorized by disease focus in two groups (i.e. SARS or MERS and COVID-19) (see 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). The number of studies on COVID-19 pursuing OH as institutional coordination and collaboration was much higher than for the SARS/MERS groups. The application of the extended OH approach has increased, however, it remains the least common understanding of OH. Examining the relative distribution of OH understandings by disease group (Fig. 2b) highlights that the dominant understanding of OH changed from OH in action/implementation, which decreased from 94% to 59%, to institutional coordination and collaboration. The application of an extended OH understanding decreased slightly from the SARS/MERS (2013â€“2020; 44%) group to the more recent studies on COVID-19 (2020; 35%).
