<p id="p0135">Segregating the studies according to their study types revealed that OH was framed as institutional coordination and collaboration in most editorials (92%) and opinion and perspective studies (92%), while 80% of the original articles and only 67% of the reviews used it as such. Understanding OH as action/implementation was found in three-quarter of both opinion and perspective as well as reviews and in less than two-thirds of editorials and original articles. The extended understanding of the OH approach was mentioned more often in editorials (46%), followed by opinion and perspective (42%), reviews (33%), and original articles (30%).</p>
