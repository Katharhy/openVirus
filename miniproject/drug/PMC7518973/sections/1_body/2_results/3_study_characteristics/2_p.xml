 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> displays the characteristics of the included studies. The majority of studies were conducted on a global scale, followed by studies at the national and regional scale, with the majority of countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) that reported MERS outbreaks. Literature reviews and mini-reviews were the most numerous group. Opinions and perspectives, position statements, and commentaries, as well as editorials, guest editorials, and letters to the editor followed. Original research articles had the lowest count. There was a steep increase in publications in 2019 and 2020 explained by the outbreaks of MERS and COVID-19, after a period of relatively few studies between 2013 and 2017. Most studies focused on COVID-19, followed MERS and SARS.
