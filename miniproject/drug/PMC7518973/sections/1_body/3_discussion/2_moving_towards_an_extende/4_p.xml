<p id="p0175">Zoonotic disease emergence has been mostly mediated by the mobility of pathogens across species and ecological boundaries [
 <xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Human population growth has increased the demand for housing, food, trade, and tourism thereby directly or indirectly increasing human exposure to viral zoonoses through the expansion and modification of the built environment into natural habitats [

 <xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>]. In addition, as a result of globalization and increased urbanization patterns, the demand for animal protein also increases, driving agricultural expansion and intensification, along with deforestation, as well as animal trade. This increases animal density and contact between animals and humans, leading to an increased risk of pathogen transfers [
 <xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. This is evident in the emergence and re-emergence of viral zoonosis (e.g. Ebola or MERS-CoV) in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and Asia [
