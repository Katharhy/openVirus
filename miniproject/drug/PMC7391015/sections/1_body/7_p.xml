<p id="Par8">To date, there is no established treatment for COVID-19. In recent days, remdesivir was the first antiviral drug approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicine Agency (EMA) for the treatment of hospitalized adults with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 lower respiratory tract involvement, in virtue of the positive results obtained in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [

So far, remdesivir has been available only for compassionate use or within the randomized clinical trial and therapeutic strategies have largely relied on off-label use of old drugs, such as antimalarial drugs chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and antiretroviral lopinavir/ritonavir and darunavir/cobicistat [

Unfortunately, conclusive data about the real impact of these compounds on the outcome on Covid-19 patients are still lacking, albeit a constant flow of published data from clinical experiences, mostly biased by methodological flaws. Fanin et al. analysed ins and outs of a well-known open-label non-randomized clinical trial by Gautret et al. on the efficacy of the combination use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, which had great resonance and influenced treatment strategies worldwide, despite important limitations [
