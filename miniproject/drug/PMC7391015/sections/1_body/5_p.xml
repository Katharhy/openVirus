<p id="Par6">The correct identification of COVID-19 cases remains the cornerstone for the control of the epidemic, allowing to confine infected patients and prevent SARS-CoV-2 spread. At the hospital level, an effective triage strategy is of paramount importance to avoid nosocomial outbreaks amongst HCWs and patients with other diseases than COVID-19. Poggiali et al. described their flowchart, applied in the heart of the Italian epidemic storm [

However, physicians soon learned that in some cases, a typical clinical and radiological picture should drive the diagnosis, regardless of a negative microbiological result. As an example, in the case report by Song et al. a patient with fever, respiratory symptoms and evocative mixed ground-glass opacity at the computed tomography (CT), had negative PCR on seven consecutive sputum sample, before achieving the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the eighth sample [
