<p id="Par24">Azithromycin has well-documented, broad antiviral properties in vitro. Numerous studies have shown it to be effective against respiratory viruses, including the picornavirus human rhinovirus (RV), where it enhances viral-induced type I and type III interferons and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression and reduced RV replication and release [
