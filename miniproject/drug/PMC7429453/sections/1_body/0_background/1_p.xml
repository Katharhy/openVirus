<p id="Par23">Azithromycin (AZM) is an orally active synthetic macrolide antibiotic with a wide range of antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. It is a safe, inexpensive, generic licenced drug available worldwide, on the World Health Organization (WHO) list of essential medications, and manufactured to scale and therefore an ideal candidate molecule to be repurposed as a potential candidate therapy for pandemic COVID-19. Macrolides, particularly azithromycin, were used to treat 1/3 of severe cases of MERS-CoV [
