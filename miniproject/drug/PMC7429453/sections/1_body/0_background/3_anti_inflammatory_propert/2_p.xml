<p id="Par27">AZM’s anti-inflammatory properties include dose-dependent suppression of lymphocyte expression of perforin and of many of these cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF, IL-8(CXCL8), IL-18, G-CSF and GM-CSF [

For these reasons, they have proven clinical efficacy in asthma, COPD, CF and obliterative bronchiolitis, post lung transplant obliterative bronchiolitis and diffuse pan bronchiolitis (DPB): a disease characterised by alveolar accumulation of foamy macrophages [
