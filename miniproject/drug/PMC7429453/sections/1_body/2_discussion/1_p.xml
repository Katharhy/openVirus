<p id="Par38">The current COVID-19 pandemic has galvanised an unprecedented response within the global research community. AZM has been rapidly identified by a number of researchers as of potential utility based on theoretical grounds [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] of molecules which could be repositioned. This approach of repositioning existing drugs has the advantage of known safety profiles and that drugs can be rapidly produced at relatively low cost and so being quicker to deploy than a new molecule or vaccine. AZM in particular is already synthesised at scale globally by a number of manufacturers and so is particularly attractive for repurposing.
