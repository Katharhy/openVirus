<p id="Par43">Besides answering the question of clinical efficacy, this study will also provide valuable samples at baseline and at subsequent admission for both blood and nasal epithelial samples. Using proteomics, direct ex vivo functional T cell analyses and RNA studies, this will provide information both on potential biomarkers of response and also insight into the immune consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the peripheral blood and airway epithelial cell transcriptome. Such insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of coronaviruses may prove valuable in directing research into future epidemics of this challenging family of emergent RNA viruses.</p>
