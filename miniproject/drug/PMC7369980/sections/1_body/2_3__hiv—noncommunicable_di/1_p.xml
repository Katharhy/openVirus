<p>PWH suffer from multiple chronic diseases including CVD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), HTN, and clinical depression. Depression among PWH is common, with rates of major depressive disorder nearly three-fold higher than the general population [

Throughout history, HIV- and AIDS-related stigmas have led to discrimination and violence against individuals affected by the disease, which is especially challenging for marginalized groups including sexual minorities and injection drug users [

As a result, many suffer from mental health issues and are more likely to exhibit unhealthy or harmful behaviors such as overeating, smoking, drinking in excess, unsafe sexual practices and drug abuse, which may lead to other conditions/diseases in many populations [

The role of substance abuse (e.g., opioids) in the clustering of cardiovascular, lung, blood, and sleep disorders/diseases in PWH is also not clearly understood. Furthermore, stigma, discrimination, and violence have inhibited many from seeking or receiving proper healthcare.
