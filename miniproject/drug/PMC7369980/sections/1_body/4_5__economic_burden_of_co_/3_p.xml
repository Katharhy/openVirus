A care plan that incorporates TB and other related comorbidities into the current treatment plan would not only reduce the individual economic burden, but the regional and even national economic burden as well. Therefore, a comprehensive model of care incorporating both CD and NCD management is desperately needed to reduce the global economic burden of HIV comorbidities especially in LMICs where resources are already scarce.
