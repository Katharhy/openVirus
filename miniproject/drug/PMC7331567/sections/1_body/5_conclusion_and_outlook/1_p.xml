<p id="p0120">The COVID-19 pandemic poses a major challenge to mankind. In view of the magnitude of the current global crisis, numerous attempts to develop vaccines and antiviral treatments are obviously underway. With respect to drug development, the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 stands out as a promising viral target, as it differs significantly from human proteases. Given the conserved structure and specificity of M
 <sup>pro</sup> amongst SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, pan-coronaviral main protease inhibitors might become available. However, in line with previously successful examples like HIV or HCV, the development of novel specific protease inhibitors and their approval will take several years. Although this process will likely take too long to impact on the current COVID-19 crisis, protease inhibitors would be worth pursuing as they may provide specific drugs for upcoming coronavirus outbreaks.
