<p id="par0055">COVID-19 disesae has created an alarming situation worldwide and therefore, it requires serious attention from healthcare authorities and research communities in the aspects of transmission, treatment and prevention. After originating in bats, SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, spread all over the world through human to human transmission, and infected millions of individuals. Currently, each pasing day, the virus is causing deaths in thousands of COVID-19 infected individuals across the globe. Although, the virus mainly affects lungs to cause severe to moderate pneumonia, it may adversely impact mental health to develop stress, anxiety and depression. To control the spread of COVID-19 infection, there is a need for developing therapeutic options, vaccines and proper management of daily activities and human to human interactions. Given the importance of the COVID-19 pandemic, further studies are necessary to understand replication, pathogenesis, and biological properties in order to control COVID-19 disease and prevent novel emerging diseases in future. The research work should focus on identifying or designing therapeutic agents and developing effective vaccines. Testing the drugs for coronaviruses requires suitable animal models prior to their use in humans. However, the currently established models for SARS and MERS are not promising except few small animals such as transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 and mouse-adapted SARS-CoV strains [

Neverthelesss, healthcareworkers and medical professionals should focus on helping the public to cope with the mental health concerns. They should further educate the people to understand the spread mechanisms, infection consequences and required management to control the spread.
