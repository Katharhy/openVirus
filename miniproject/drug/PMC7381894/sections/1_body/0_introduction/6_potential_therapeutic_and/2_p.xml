<p id="par0045">Moreover, some antiviral drugs in combination with traditional Chinese medicines are currently being evaluated in COVID-19 patients. It is thought that lower mortality and higher recovery rate from COVID-19 disease in China may be linked to the treatment with tradiations Chinese medicines in combined with Western medicines, as approximately 85% patients in China received these combinations [

 <xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, we did not find convincing evidence to conclude that traditional Chinese medicines are siginifanclty effective, thereore, further investigations are required to determine their effects against COVID-19 disease. Despite the afore-mentioned therapeutic options, further studies are necessary to develop promising therapeutic strategies against COVID-19 infection. The serious concern with coronaviruses is the ability to suppress counteracting response from the host innate interferons [

Surface structural spike protein (S) and ACE2 play a critical role in the process of pathogenicity through facilitating SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells [

 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Targeting these regions through monoclonal antibodies or fusion inhibitors [
