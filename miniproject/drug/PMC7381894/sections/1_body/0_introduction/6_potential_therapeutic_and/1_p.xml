<p id="par0040">Currently, no promising treatment options are available against the COVID-19. However, to contain the COVID-19, several therapeutic strategies have been evaluated. Among the trialed antiviral drugs, remdesivir alone or in combination with chloroquine or interferon beta showed effectiveness against the COVID-19 infection [
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Chloroquine efficacy against the COVID-19 may be linked with its ability to prevent binding and cellular entry of the SARS-CoV-2 through interfering with ACE2. While remdesivir inhibits the action of viral RNA polymerase to prevent viral replication [
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Currently, clinical clinical trials are underway in different regions of the world, while China based preliminary data has demonstrated benefits of chloroquine in patients with pneumonia, as the drug significantly eliminatied the virus and improved recovery from COVID-19 disease [
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Thus, it was included in the Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of COVID-19 disease, Chinese National Health Commission [
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, chloroquine is also known to have toxicity and side effects to central nervious system [
 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. On the other hand, a multi-center trial of remdesivir showed serious side effects in 12 out of the 53 COVID-19 patients, although 36 of them were reported clinically recovered [
 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Therfore, both remdesivir and chloroquine should further be evaluated for their suitability against COVID-19. Baricitinib an approved drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis has been considered as the potential candidate to treat COVID-19. This drug inhibits the endocytosis regulating enzymes (AP2-associated protein kinase 1) [
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], thus, can inhibit endocytosis of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell. Thus, it could be another potential candidate to treat COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], however, wide range of clinical trials are necessary to evaluate its effectiveness Furthermore, ritonavir and lopinavir are promising protease inhibitors, which have been included in the list of anti-COVID-19 drugs. Although, earlier treatment of COVID-19 patients with ritonavir and lopinavir in Wuhan, China, did not indicate sufficient benefits of these drugs [
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], however, their combination may successfully inhibit both protease cytochrome P4503A4 which can reduce metabolism and inhibit viral replication [
 <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Therefore, further clincal trials with combination of these drugs are required to evaluate their effectiveness. Recently another antiviral drug known as favipiravir designed for influenza that inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, was found effective against the COVID-19. However, further studies are required to find its broad term efficacy and associated side effects [
