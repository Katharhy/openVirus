To curb the risk of spread and manage the adverse impacts of virus, it is necessary to know the medical consequences associated with COVID-19 infection. In this article, we briefly describe the consequences of highly infectous human corona viruses, and elaborate the transmission and health consequences (both physical and mental health) of COVID-19 disease. We further discuss the potential therapeutic and preventive strategies, and required research investigations that may help managing and controlling the spread of COVID-19 disease.
