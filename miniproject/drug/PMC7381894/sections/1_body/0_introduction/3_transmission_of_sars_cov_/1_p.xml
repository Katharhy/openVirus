<p id="par0015">Although bats are thought to be the source of origin for SARS-CoV-2, the intermediate animal that caused the transmission of virus to humans, is still unknown [
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Once SARS-COV-2 transfers from zoonotic source to human, it can potentially transmit from human-to-human, mainly through respiratory droplets from an infected individual 
 <italic>via</italic> coughing or sneezing [
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The virus can also transmit from an asymptomatic infected individual to infect healthy individual [
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The entry of virus to host cell occurs in several steps including binding to a target host cell 
 <italic>via</italic> cellular receptors, fusing the envelope with a cellular membrane, and forking over its genetic material inside the cell [
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This process is highly dependent upon binding specificity to receptors, proteolytic activation, and endocytosis efficiency. This entry process is facilitated by glycosylated spike (S) fusion protein, which is capable of significant structural rearrangement, thus plays an important role in fusing the viral membrane with the host cell membrane [
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The spike glycoproteins are comprised of two subunits known as S1 and S2, where S2 subunit contains fusion peptide [
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This fusion process is the key to virus entry into a cell, however, the fusion process is linked with the accessibility of the receptor determined by hinge-like conformational movements of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1. The RBD can transiently hide or expose the determinants of receptor binding [
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Soon after the entrance of the virus to the host cell, transcription of polyprotein 1a/1ab (pp1a/pp1ab) is initiated by the activity of the replication-transcription complex (RTC) [
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Binding of S protein to the cellular receptor ACE2 initiates the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells [
