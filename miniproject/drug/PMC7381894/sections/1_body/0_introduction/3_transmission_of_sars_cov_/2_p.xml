<p id="par0020">Studying the infectiousness mechanism further can help to understand the source of origination and transmission. Knowing the intermediate sources of transmission is important in disease control. A recently report indicated pangolin as the possible intermediate source that might have transferred the virus to humans after receiving it from bat [
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The main reasons for the high rate of transmission are not well documented however, the higher affinity of RBD for binding to ACE2 receptors is considered to be one of the possibilities for the high rate of infectiousness [
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The RBD amino acids (L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501, and Y505) in SARS-CoV-2 can play a role in the determination of the host range [
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Further research is required to investigate these RBD amino-acids in a wide range of animal species. Despite the RBD aminoacids, proteases associated with infectiousness such as furin, can also help to determine host range. This determination can further be facilitated by studying the higher genetic variation in spike glycoproteins [
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It has been reported that the mutation found in polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 from humans was dissimilar to that in bat and pangolin viruses [
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], suggesting its association transmission and infection in humans. These observations indicate the need for further research on understanding the impact of polybasic cleavage on transmissibility and pathogenesis. Without knowing the zoonotic source of transmission, range of animals hosts, and source of origination, it may be impossible to eradicate the virus.
