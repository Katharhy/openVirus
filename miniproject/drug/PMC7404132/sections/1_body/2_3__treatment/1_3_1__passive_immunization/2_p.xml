<p>A potential alternative challenge is to directly administrate neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to subjects encountering the infection. Generated mAbs can interrupt any stage of the viral lifecycle or the host cell receptor proteins, thereby affecting virus binding, attachment on the cell surface, and entry into the host cell [

Similarities between RBD of different SARS-CoVs might justify the neutralization activity of SARS-like CoV neutralizing mAbs against SARS-CoV2. This hypothesis needs to be confirmed by a comparative analysis of the RBD sequence of SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV to verify that RBD specific mAbs can potentially be of efficacy and thus be recommended for evaluation in clinical trials. Combination therapy of remdesivir (GS-5734) [
