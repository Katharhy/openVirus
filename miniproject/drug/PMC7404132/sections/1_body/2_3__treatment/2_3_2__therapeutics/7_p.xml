<p>Of note, cytokines play important roles in the immunopathology of viral infections since innate immunity is the first line defense against viruses. Dysregulated proinflammatory immune responses cause the ‘cytokine storm’ in the pathogenesis of CoV2 infection. This is closely related to the development and progression of the Acute-Respiratory Disease Syndrome (ARDS) or extrapulmonary multiorgan failure, leading to infection exacerbation or death. Therefore, immunomodulators and cytokine antagonists represent a potential effective strategy. In this regard, evidences were produced on the efficacy of anti-inflammatory drug tocilizumab to ensure the possibility to timely control the cytokine storm at the early stage to improve success rate of treatment and reduce mortality rate. Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody raised to both soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and bound to the membrane (mIL-6R) [

It also finds application for the management of severe or life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) that can be elicited by chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR) T therapeutic approaches. Chinese researchers reported preliminary data on efficacy of tocilizumab (at the expected dose of 400 mg iv for CRS treatment) in 21 patients with severe or critical COVID-19 pneumonia [

They observed reduction of oxygen requirement, resolution of CT (spiral computerized tomography) lesions, normalization of lymphocyte count, reduction of C-reactive protein levels, and hospital discharge with an average hospitalization duration of 13.5 days. In Italy, AIFA (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco) recently started a protocol for evaluating the efficacy of tocilizumab in treating respiratory distress in COVID-19 patients (EudraCT Number 2020-001110-38) (
