<p>In the past, MERS and SARS-CoV have caused large-scale epidemics; however, from recent epidemiological data, SARS-CoV2 presents a higher rate of transmission; on average, 2 or 3 people become infected from one already infected person [

Molecular assays based on reverse real-time PCR (rRT-PCR) are today the gold standard for screening and diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in early stage, verifying its course, and estimating the extent of viremia. The virus can be detected on a variety of clinical specimens from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, saliva, pharyngeal and nasal swabs, stool, or peripheral blood [

This method, under isothermal conditions, rapidly amplifies DNA with high specificity and efficiency. It is based on the use of four specially designed primers (complementary to a total of six distinct sequences on target DNA) and of the enzyme DNA polymerase, which, having strand displacement activity, amplifies target DNA up to 10
