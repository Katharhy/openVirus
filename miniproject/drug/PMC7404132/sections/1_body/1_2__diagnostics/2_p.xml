<p>Serological immunoassays are currently used to estimate seroconversion in seroprevalence surveys in people suspected of current or previous SARS CoV2 infection through anti-viral IgG and IgM immunoglobulins testing. Accuracy of antibodies detection is assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent, chemiluminescence, and flow laminar immunoassays. IgGs persist for the longest time and may reflect a longer-time immunity, although it is the last to rise after infection since positivity occurs between 13â€“21 days. Reported time to IgM positivity ranges from 5 to 10 days following disease onset but declines soon after an infection is cleared [
