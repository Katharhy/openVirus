<p>In the past 10 years, approaches were already attempted to combat CoV viruses [

 <xref rid="B77-ijms-21-05145" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Surface spike glycoproteins or S-proteins have been principally considered optimal targets for raising neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses to this virus family [
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-21-05145" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. S-protein-based vaccines should generate antibodies against viral binding to ACE2 but also virus uncoating [
 <xref rid="B49-ijms-21-05145" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. S-proteins were employed as full-length proteins or in their most immunogenic parts. Recombinant S-protein-based strategies have also been attempted by using expression in virus-like particles (VLP), DNA, or viral vectors [
