<p>The immunity generated by CoV2 vaccines is currently assessed in preclinical studies and started trials through humoral antibody induction and/or T cell effector responses [
 <xref rid="B83-ijms-21-05145" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Of note, vaccines that do not elicit a skewed Th2 immune response are considered ideal for controlling SARS-CoV2 infection since the generation of a skewed Th2 T cell response involving IL-10 and IL-4 cytokines would suppress inflammatory CD8+ T cells contributing to exacerbate pathology [

 <xref rid="B84-ijms-21-05145" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. In this regard, live attenuated vaccines (LAV) employ viruses that are rendered replication-incompetent through different passages in culture [

At present, Codagenics is proposing a computationally designed immunogenic, but not pathogenic, SARS-CoV2 virus. SinoVac has published preclinical data regarding an inactivated purified SARS-CoV2 vaccine (PiCoVacc) [
 <xref rid="B85-ijms-21-05145" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] that induced specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, rats, and non-human primates. These antibodies showed broader neutralizing activity against 10 representative SARS-CoV strains. When administered using two different doses (3 μg and 6 μg) to a macaque model, partial or complete protection was obtained; this was mediated by humoral immunity with controlled T cell responses to avoid immunopathology [

Protein subunit vaccines are produced in vitro by employing antigenic proteins that induce a protective immune response, avoiding the use of highly pathogenic live particles (Generex Biotechnology, Vaxart, Medicago, GSK, and Clover Biopharmaceuticals, University of Queensland) [
 <xref rid="B83-ijms-21-05145" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. These predominantly elicit a humoral antibody response by administration with an adjuvant.
