Thus, full-length or appropriate parts of the S glycoprotein are believed to be the most promising candidate vaccine for previous SARS-CoV viruses attempts. S-protein immunogenicity or its binding to ACE2 receptor, critical for virus access into host cells, is apparently not affected by the presence or absence of other structural viral proteins [
