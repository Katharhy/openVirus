Since 1999, China’s numerous live-animal markets have arguably led to three important epidemics and now, a pandemic, although the ultimate origins of pandemics can rarely be known with certainty. The emergence of deadly “bird flu” associated with the poultry-adapted influenza A viruses known as H5N1 and H7N9 have killed over a thousand people, SARS killed 774 and came close to causing a global pandemic in 2002 and 2003, and now in 2019 and 2020, SARS-like SARS-CoV-2 is causing our newest pandemic, COVID-19. One seemingly simple human behavior, establishment of multiple large live-animal markets in a populous region, or at least the greatly increased human-wild animal contacts that such markets represent, has within 2 decades caused the emergence of four fatal zoonotic diseases, including one barely prevented near pandemic, and one we have clearly failed to prevent.
