<p>Every pandemic is different. Roughly 18 weeks into the COVID-19 pandemic (17 April 2020), we remain unsure of what lies ahead. Controlling a pandemic can be compared to dancing with an unpredictable leading partner. Neither where the dance is going nor the direction of the next leading step can be known. The trick is to remain alert, flexible, and capable of changing strategy at any moment as the situation itself changes. To complicate matters, the changing situation requires not only good management of uncertainty but good communication about uncertainty to a confused public. In early 2020, we are grudgingly relearning that public health efforts, such as “social distancing,” shuttering of businesses, prevention of mass gatherings, travel restrictions, etc., can be highly effective when adopted early and stringently. Similar lessons were learned centuries ago in earlier pandemics, e.g., during the plague pandemic of the 1340s, which brought about the establishment of quarantine, publication of numerous preventive medicine “plague tractates” to guide personal and public actions, and self-isolation, as described in Boccaccio’s classic 
 <italic>Decameron</italic>, in which young people sequestered themselves in the Florentine countryside to avoid the plague raging in the city.
