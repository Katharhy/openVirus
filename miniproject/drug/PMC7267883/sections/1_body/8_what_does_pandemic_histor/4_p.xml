<p>We must also now ask whether the three unprecedented coronavirus emergences within 17â€‰years are harbingers of a new era in which additional members of the presumably large universe of enzootic coronaviruses will repeatedly emerge to threaten us for the foreseeable future. To begin to answer this question, we need a much more complete characterization of these viruses in nature, not only from identifying viral genomes but also from studying live viruses experimentally. The few dedicated scientists involved in this work over the past decade, including U.S.-Chinese teams working in China, have had to work with minimal funding and against many unhelpful obstacles. Among many important questions to be answered is whether enzootic coronaviruses have shared epitopes that will be cross-protective if presented in vaccines. Such questions can be answered only by robust collaborative research of all aspects of this disease, including virologic, immunologic, clinical, pathological, and epidemiologic studies.</p>
