<p>That China has been able to achieve at least short-term regional control reminds us of the often-unused potential of public health police power. Some other countries/jurisdictions, e.g., Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea, have controlled early COVID-19 waves as well. Anecdotal evidence ascribes these successes to early aggressive public health interventions, such as mass PCR testing, contact tracing, and isolation, but more evidence is needed to rule out the biasing effects of ecologic comparisons and to establish the efficacy of specific public health actions. However, other countries with sophisticated public health capacities, e.g., Italy, have not had early success at controlling viral spread, and there is a growing realization that, as is true for many other respiratory viral diseases, “silent spreading” of SARS-CoV-2 by people who are either presymptomatic (incubating), asymptomatic, or exhibiting mild or atypical symptoms is undoubtedly driving the COVID-19 pandemic (
