<p>However, science is beginning to provide hope that we can predict some aspects of pandemic emergence and hopefully begin to lower the risk. Tracking past pandemic origins allows us to identify the underlying causes of emerging diseases and hot spots where they are most likely to originate, although these may be very large regions. Analyzing host-virus relationships allows us to identify wildlife species that carry the highest risk of as-yet-undiscovered viruses (

Analyses of air travel pathways provide real-time data to anticipate the likely spread of novel diseases once they have gained a foothold in the human population. Much remains to be done, but these efforts provide the first steps to what may one day become a preventive approach to pandemic emergence. If land use change and agricultural intensification drive disease emergence, future programs to reduce human-wildlife contact around these activities may reduce the risk of future pandemics. In addition, mounting successes in biomedical science are chipping away at existing infectious diseases; smallpox and the veterinary disease rinderpest have been eradicated, and other diseases, such as polio, dracunculiasis, measles, and rubella, among others, are current eradication targets. We now cure once-fatal bacterial diseases with antibiotics, have developed many effective vaccines, have an antiviral cure for hepatitis C, and use antiviral cocktail therapy to keep millions of HIV-infected persons alive and healthy. Nature may be relentless, but science continues to push back.
