<p>It has not, so far, been possible to predict the exact timing, place of origin, or clinical-epidemiologic features of any of the recent pandemics. No explosive sexually transmitted disease had ever been seen in Europe at the time that the syphilis pandemic appeared suddenly, in the late 15th century. The horrifying gummatous deformities (

Four centuries later, the HIV/AIDS pandemic was just as shocking in its ability to cause high fatality and tragic deaths, this time in association with multiple human-to-human modes of transmission (e.g., sexual transmission, needle sharing, blood product transfusion, maternal transmission), significantly complicating control efforts. More than a millennium of at least 20 pandemic influenza recurrences (at least one every 57 years, and since 1700 AD, one every 32 years [

Strong human reactions to the unexpected and frightening consequences of pandemics, including reactions to the highly fatal Ebola and the tragic deformities of babies during the Zika pandemic, have characterized almost all pandemics, and now we are experiencing shock at the overwhelming of hospitals and the hastily dug mass graves associated with COVID-19.
