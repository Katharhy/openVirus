<p>The reality that humans are the ultimate cause of pandemics is demonstrated most tragically by what historian Alfred Crosby has referred to as the “Columbian exchange” (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). After the first voyage of Columbus to the Americas in 1492, syphilis was apparently brought back to Europe. Even more devastating consequences quickly followed. Europeans soon brought smallpox, measles, and other previously unknown diseases to the New World, wiping out millions of native peoples, e.g., the infamous

During the next several hundred years, all over the Americas, countless millions of native people died from these and other imported diseases. Beginning in the 1700s, the tragedy was extended by explorers to the Pacific islands. The near extinction of native peoples over half of the globe occurred on a scale so massive that it was never adequately measured. The age of exploration might more appropriately be called the age of global microbial devastation.
