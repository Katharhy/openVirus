<p>The 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aedes aegypti</named-content>-borne diseases (yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika) are all associated with human crowding/imperfect sanitation, peri-domestic water storage, exportation of vector mosquitoes, and human development of novel mosquito breeding sites, such as discarded rubber tires. These four arboviral diseases have all exploded in recent decades, the delayed result of the emergence and adaptation of a single mosquito species in response to water storage behaviors of humans beginning more than 5,000 years ago and which are being greatly amplified today (

The unwitting spread of microbes by humans, a process termed “pathogen pollution,” accelerates the geographic spread of emerging diseases and their impact on morbidity and mortality. In a world now dominated by a globalized economy that depends on international travel and trade, such disease spread has led to significant economic losses, e.g., $30 to 50 billion for SARS and multiple hundreds of billions of dollars (so far) for COVID-19 (
