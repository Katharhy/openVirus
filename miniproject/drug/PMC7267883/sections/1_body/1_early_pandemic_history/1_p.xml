<p>Around 12,000 years ago, small family/clan groups of humans abandoned nomadic hunting and gathering to settle down in stable locations, cultivating crops and raising domestic animals for food, labor, and clothing (the Neolithic revolution). For the first time, humans and newly domesticated animals were living together in complicated ecosystems of villages, towns, cities, and pasturages. Under conditions of intense human-animal proximity and environmental alterations, enzootic and zoonotic diseases appeared. The agents of measles, smallpox, tuberculosis, gastric cancer (caused by

As human populations continued to expand, these agents were able to initiate epidemics and pandemics (

At some point, smallpox spread pandemically over most of the world, sparing the Western Hemisphere for millennia, up to the 16th century, when the first known epidemic occurred there in 1520. Until its eradication was declared in 1980, smallpox killed untold millions over at least 3 millennia. Even diseases now commonly dismissed as benign, like measles, killed millions; little more than a century ago, measles case fatality reached as high as 30%, especially in indigenous populations with vitamin A deficiency (
