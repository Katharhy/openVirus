<p>In this study, we developed a multiplex real-time RT-LAMP assay that can diagnose influenza A and influenza B with one step. The multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay using the probe-quencher that compensates for the disadvantages of LAMP, such as false positive diagnoses, shows similar sensitivity and specificity to the WHO RT-PCR primer set. Since LAMP takes less time (within 60 min) than conventional RT-PCR, the multiplex influenza A/B RT-LAMP assay can be used as an efficient method in on-site molecular diagnostic kits.</p>
