<p>Since many respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses, can cause similar symptoms, it is difficult for clinicians to distinguish one virus from another [
 <xref rid="pone.0238615.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Given the annual morbidity and mortality caused by influenza viruses, there is an urgent need for sensitive and convenient laboratory methods to identify influenza virus subtypes in clinical care and infection control [

 <xref rid="pone.0238615.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. There are immunodiagnostic kits that can be utilized quickly, but their sensitivity and specificity are too poor; thus, PCR methods are currently used to make accurate diagnoses [
 <xref rid="pone.0238615.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, PCR-based target gene detection requires bulky and expensive equipment as well as highly skilled technicians [
 <xref rid="pone.0238615.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Several isothermal amplification methods, such as HDA, RPA, and LAMP, have been developed for on-site diagnosis of infectious pathogens [

 <xref rid="pone.0238615.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Among them, LAMP is a promising method that has been utilized to detect a variety of pathogens [

 <xref rid="pone.0238615.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Recently, a variety of multiplex RT-LAMP methods have been developed to detect influenza viruses by using annealing temperature, nanoparticle hybridization, one-pot colorimetric visualization and immunochromatographic strip etc [
 <xref rid="pone.0238615.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0238615.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, their multiplex system amplified each type of influenza individually or consist of two steps, which are lamp assay and rapid test. Thus, it may take a more time when diagnosis a large number of clinical samples. Thus, it can take a more time to diagnose a large number of clinical samples. In addition, it is known that LAMP assay is easy to contaminate [

 <xref rid="pone.0238615.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In this study, we developed the one tube-multiplex influenza A/B/IC LAMP assay, including an internal control (actin), for the detection of influenza A/H1, A/H3, and B using newly designed assimilating probes, which has advantages for reducing test time and risk of contamination.
