<p>For optimization of the multiplex influenza A/B/IC LAMP primer set, different concentration ratios of the influenza A, influenza B, and internal control primer sets (1:1:1, 1:1:0.5, and 1:0.5:0.5, respectively) were tested using human serum RNA samples spiked with influenza A and B plasmids (10
 <sup>7</sup> copy, ratio of 1:1) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238615.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). As a result, three signals (influenza A, influenza B, and internal control) were detected in the ratios of 1:0.5:0.5, whereas two signals (influenza B and internal control) were detected in the ratio of 1:1:1 and 1:1:0.5. Among three ratio of LAMP primer set, the ratio of 1:0.5:0.5 showed the lowest Ct values of influenza A and influenza B were 12.58 and 10.41, respectively. Therefore, the ratios of influenza A, influenza B, and internal control LAMP primer set (1:0.5:0.5) was determined as optimum ratio for multiplex influenza A/B/IC LAMP assay. Next, temperature gradient tests (58–65°C) were performed to determine the optimal temperature of the multiplex influenza A/B/IC LAMP assay (

Among 8 temperatures (65, 64.6, 62.5, 60.8, 59.4, 58.5 and 58.0°C), the LAMP assay showed lowest Ct values and RFU of all fluorescence channels at 60.8°C (Ct/RFU, influenza A: 15.13/3919, influenza B: 11.02/5237 and internal control: 16.51/2745) and 59.4°C (Ct/RFU, influenza A: 14.36/6996, influenza B: 11.08/5053 and internal control: 16.73/2707). Therefore, we decided the optimal temperature for this assay to be 60°C between 60.8°C and 59.4°C. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238615.g001">Fig 1C</xref> showed the performance of the multiplex influenza A/B/IC LAMP assay against influenza A RNA samples, influenza B RNA samples, and influenza A/B RNA mixture samples at the optimum conditions (ratio of the influenza A, influenza B, and internal control primer sets was 1:0.5:0.5 at 60°C).
