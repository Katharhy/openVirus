<p>To confirm the possibility of cross-reactivity with other infectious viruses, 41 respiratory virus samples, including 4 RSV A, 4 RSV B, 4 adenovirus, 4 PIV(1–4), 9 coronavirus (OC43/HKU1, NL63, and 229E), 4 HBoV, 4 HEV, 4 HRV, and 4 MPV samples, were tested using the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay, WHO RT-PCR primer set, and RealStar® Influenza RT-PCR Kit 2.0 (
