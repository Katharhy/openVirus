<p>To confirm the clinical performance of the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay, the sensitivities and specificities of the assay were compared with those of the WHO RT-PCR primer set and RealStar® Influenza RT-PCR Kit 2.0 for 93 influenza A, 80 influenza B, and 100 healthy patient NP specimens (
 <xref rid="pone.0238615.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). For the influenza A H1 clinical samples (n = 11), the sensitivities of the WHO RT-qPCR primer set and RealStar® Influenza RT-PCR Kit 2.0 were 100% and 81.81%, respectively. The sensitivities of the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay were 90.90% in the influenza A channel (FAM) and 81.81% in the internal control channel. The specificities of all three assays for influenza A/H1 clinical samples were 100%. For influenza A/H3 clinical samples (n = 82), the sensitivities of the WHO RT-PCR primer set and RealStar® Influenza RT-PCR Kit 2.0 were 97.59% and 89.02%, respectively. The sensitivities of the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay were 95.12% in the influenza A channel (FAM) and 36.58% in the internal control channel. The specificities of the WHO RT-PCR primer set and multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay for influenza A/H3 clinical samples were 100% while that of the RealStar® Influenza RT-PCR Kit 2.0 was 95.12%. Overall, the WHO RT-PCR primer set was found to have the highest sensitivity (97.84%) for all influenza A clinical samples (n = 93), followed by the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay (94.62%), and finally the RealStar® Influenza RT-PCR Kit 2.0 (88.17%). The specificities of the former two assays for influenza A clinical samples were 100% while that of the latter was 95.69%. In addition, the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay showed 100% of sensitivities and specificities for H5 (n = 10), H7 (n = 10) and H9 (n = 10) subtypes of avian influenza viruses (

For influenza B clinical samples (n = 80), the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay and WHO RT-PCR primer set showed the highest sensitivities (97.50% and 97.50%, respectively) while that of the RealStar® Influenza RT-PCR Kit 2.0 was 86.25% (
 <xref rid="pone.0238615.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The internal control channel of the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay showed 97.50% sensitivity for influenza B clinical samples. The specificities of all three assays against influenza B clinical samples were 100%. The specificities of the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay and WHO RT-PCR primer set for healthy clinical samples (non-infection; n = 100) were 100%, whereas that of the RealStar® Influenza RT-PCR Kit 2.0 was 99% (
 <xref rid="pone.0238615.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The sensitivity of the internal control channel of the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay for healthy clinical samples was 100%.
