<p>The analytical sensitivity of the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay was compared with monoplex LAMP primer sets [In A, In B and Internal control (IC, actin beta)] by testing synthetic RNA plasmids ranging from 10
 <sup>8</sup> to 10
 <sup>1</sup> RNA copies/μL (

 <xref rid="pone.0238615.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In monoplex In A, In B and IC LAMP test showed all the detection limits of 1 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> copies/μL. In multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay, both influenza A and B plasmids were detected up to 1 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> copies/μL and actin beta plasmid was detected up to 1 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> copies/μL. As a result, multiplex influenza A/B/IC showed comparable detection limits with monoplex LAMP assay, although detection limit of IC in multiplex was higher than that of IC monoplex LAMP. Furthermore, the LOD of the RT-LAMP assay was compared with the WHO RT-PCR primer set and commercial RealStar® Influenza RT-PCR Kit 2.0 using serially diluted clinical influenza A/H1, A/H3, and B samples (range of 10
 <sup>−1</sup> to 10
 <sup>−6</sup>; 
 <xref rid="pone.0238615.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). As a result, the LOD of both the WHO RT-PCR primer set and RealStar® Influenza RT-PCR Kit 2.0 for influenza A/H1 was 10
 <sup>−3</sup> while that of the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay was 10
 <sup>−2</sup>. For influenza A/H3, the RealStar® Influenza RT-PCR Kit 2.0 assay showed the highest sensitivity (10
 <sup>−5</sup>), and the LOD of the other two assays was 10
 <sup>−4</sup>. For influenza B, the RealStar® Influenza RT-PCR Kit 2.0 assay showed the highest sensitivity (10
 <sup>−4</sup>), and the LOD of the other two assays was 10
 <sup>−3</sup>. Overall, the detection limits tested with clinical sample dilutions were the lowest in the analysis of the RealStar® Influenza RT-PCR Kit 2.0, followed by the WHO RT-PCR primer set, and finally the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay.
