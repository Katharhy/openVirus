<p>To evaluate the performance of the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay, two real-time RT-PCRs, the commercial RealStar® Influenza RT-PCR Kit 2.0 (Altona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany) and the World Health Organization (WHO) influenza A/B primer set [

 <xref rid="pone.0238615.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] with the DiaStar OneStep Multiplex qRT-PCR Kit (SolGent Co., Ltd., Daejeon, Korea), were performed using the CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The PCR cycling conditions of the WHO influenza A/B primer set were as follows: reverse transcription at 50°C for 20 min, inactivation at 95°C for 15 min, 39 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, and annealing with fluorescence detection at 60°C for 40 s. For the RealStar® Influenza RT-PCR Kit 2.0, the thermocycling parameters were as follows: reverse transcription at 55°C for 20 min, inactivation at 95°C for 2 min, 44 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s, annealing with fluorescence detection at 55°C for 45 s, and extension at 72°C for 15 s.
