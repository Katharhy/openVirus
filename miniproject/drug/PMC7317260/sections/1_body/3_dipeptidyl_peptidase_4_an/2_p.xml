<p id="Par6">Gut-derived incretins such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) are necessary for glycemic control. In particular, GLP-1 is secreted after a meal, and it lowers glucose concentrations by increasing insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon release. DPP4 rapidly degrades circulating GLP-1 and GIP, thus contributing to glycemic homeostasis. However, a series of indirect findings suggest that the DPP4 system can have important biological actions beyond glucose metabolism as DPP4 can have a pro-inflammatory action, stimulating the production of IL-6 and TNF-α in monocytes, as well as exert a possible modulating function in the immune system. This trans-membrane glycoprotein, known also as CD26 lymphocyte cell surface protein, is expressed in different types of immune cells, and it is supposed to influence their function: CD4 + , CD8 + T cells, B cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. In principle, therefore, DPP4 is capable to modulate many cytokines, chemokines, and peptide hormones [

In the lungs of healthy subjects, DPP4/CD26 is mainly present on type I and II alveolar cells, alveolar macrophages, vascular endothelium, and pleural mesothelium. Previous studies have shown a direct functional role for DPP4/CD26, in pulmonary diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung fibrosis (Fig.
