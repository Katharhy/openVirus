<p id="Par2">In December 2019, many cases of viral pneumonia were identified in Wuhan, caused by a new strain of virus, coronavirus (SARS-CoV2). In humans, coronaviruses typically cause a mild disease of the upper respiratory tract, but they can also be associated with more serious lung diseases, mainly in subjects with multiple comorbidities. In this respect, SARS-CoV2 infection may cause a more severe condition, known as COVID-19 syndrome. This epidemic quickly spread to a growing number of countries, counting to date hundreds of thousands of cases. COVID-19 has already caused more deaths than previous SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics combined. Therefore, therapies are urgently needed to help curb COVID-19 rapid spread, and minimize its high mortality rate.</p>
