<p id="Par4">Understanding how diabetes contributes to the severity of the disease, and how to treat COVID-19 syndrome, may be of utmost importance. The pathophysiology of this association remains uncertain today. Previous studies have shown that diabetic patients are more susceptible to infections, in particular flu and pneumonia. Indeed, diabetes is not just a disorder of glucose metabolism, but it can also be viewed as a chronic inflammatory state, which is also accompanied by alterations in immune system; in metabolic disorders, altered activity of macrophages and lymphocytes impairs immune function, with development of major complications. In type-2 diabetes, there is a change in immune system cells residing in adipose tissue, shifting from an anti-inflammatory, macrophages, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) to a predominantly pro-inflammatory pattern, macrophages, and CD1 + Th1 and Th 17 T cells, interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which promotes systemic insulin resistance and pancreatic beta-cell injury (Table

In patients with viral pneumonia, Guo et al. found that the absolute count levels of CD3 + T cells, CD8 + T cell.s and CD3 + CD4 + T cells in patients who died were higher than in the survivors [
