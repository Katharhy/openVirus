<p id="Par7">If DPP4 system is also involved in immunological and inflammatory processes, it would be expected that inhibiting this pathway should translate into beneficial effects in this respect. This possibility has recently been tested, thanks to the availability of specific inhibitors of DPP4 (DPP4is). DPP4is, commonly called gliptins, have been initially developed and are currently widely used as effective oral hypoglycemic drugs in the treatment of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, DPP4 inhibition has the potential to exert a positive pleiotropic effect on vascular and inflammatory diseases [

With specific respect to lung diseases, Kawasaki et al. demonstrated the direct anti-inflammatory effects of DPP4 inhibition on LPS-induced lung injury in mice and in human lung epithelial cells. Similarly, DPP4i administration in mice is able to exert protective effects in the lung [

Telikani et al. have determined serum levels of TNF-α, IL-1 β, and IL-10 in 60 patients with T2DM; sitagliptin treatment significantly decreased the high levels of pro-inflammatory TNF-α, and at the same time increased anti-inflammatory IL-10 concentrations [

Recently, Soare et al. have shown that DPP4 promotes activation of fibroblasts, induced by transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), which is instrumental to initiate tissue fibrosis: conversely, inactivation of DPP4 exerted important anti-fibrotic effects in several experimental models of pulmonary and skin fibrosis [

This effect might be mediated through a combination of several mechanisms, including a potent anti-inflammatory action, as demonstrated by a significant reduction of cytokines in the lung.
