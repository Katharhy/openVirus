Indeed, Sadikot et al. have recently proposed that GLP-1 may constitute a novel therapeutic approach to ARDS, as they demonstrated that human GLP-1 inhibits nuclear factor-B (NF-KB) activation in cultured macrophages and in a murine model of acute lung injury [

Given the already established safety profile of these classes of drugs, and their clinical availability, they might be “repurposed” as potential therapeutic drug candidates for coronavirus pneumonia in T2DM patients. Interestingly, as gliptins are known to have little or no hypoglycemic effects [
