<p id="Par3">Epidemiological analyses have found a strong correlation between presence of pre-existing comorbidities and development of serious diseases following SARS-CoV2 infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Risk factors associated with development of serious morbidity or deaths are: male gender, advanced age, and number of comorbidities. In particular, diabetes, renal failure, cardiac, respiratory, cerebrovascular disease, and hypertension, have all been shown to predispose patients to more complicated clinical pictures with consequent increase in risk for lethal outcomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Overlapping risks among diabetic subjects have been described during the two previous COV infections, namely the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of 2002, which involved more than 8000 individuals mainly in Asia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which in 2012 affected over 2000 people mainly in Saudi Arabia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Data on COVID-19 in patients with diabetes are accumulating. Overall percentage of diabetics affected by COVID-19 has been reported between 5.3% and 20% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In intensive care unit (ICU) patients, Yang et al. observed that major comorbidities of COVID-19 patients who did not survive were cerebrovascular disease (22%) and diabetes (22%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A report of 72.314 COVID-19 cases by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention showed an overall mortality of 2.3%, which rose to 7.3% in diabetics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In Italy (15 May 2020), 223.095 cases with 29.884 deaths were confirmed and more comorbidities were observed in COVID-19 patients who died. The report from the Italian National Institute of Health, indicates that a large number of COVID-19 patients are affected by diabetes (30.5%) [
