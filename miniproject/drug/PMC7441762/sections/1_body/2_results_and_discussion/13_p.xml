<p>Both from docking and ADME analysis, it is clear that the sugar moieties and other polar groups are both responsible for the high binding affinity to M
 <sup>pro</sup>/ACE2 and low oral bioavailability. Among other natural compounds reported to bind with M
 <sup>pro</sup> and ACE2, Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (Khaerunnisa et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Lalit &amp; Vyomesh, 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Mittal et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) and Theaflavin-3,3-digallate (Manish, 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) also showed very good binding to M
 <sup>pro</sup> and ACE2, but has poor oral bioavailability (ABS-0.17) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref>). Specifically, EGCG has been reported to be broken down in large intestine by the colonic microflora. The fraction of EGCG that is absorbed might undergo rapid methylation catalyzed by liver cytosolic catechol-
 <italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase which decreases its hydrophilicity (Mereles &amp; Hunstein, 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), the key feature found responsible for M
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibition. Thus a majority of the natural molecules with therapeutic potential against SARS-CoVs require an effective way to get delivered to lung in their native form to bypass degradation and metabolism associated with oral route.
