<p>Remdesivir is a prodrug of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) analog, GS-441524 that interferes with the action of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase towards controlling viral RNA production. From the present study, the estimated docking scores and MM-GBSA bind energies for GS-441524 are −6.24 Kcal/mol and −46.51 Kcal/mol for Mpro and −5.65 Kcal/mol and −40.48 Kcal/mol for ACE2, respectively. For SARS-CoV2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> the docked poses of GS-441524 shows the hydroxyl groups of oxolan ring are inserted inside the S1 subunit by multiple hydrogen bonds with the CYS
 <sup>145</sup> and ASN
 <sup>142</sup>. The nitrogen of the nitrile group was found to form a hydrogen bond with the GLU
 <sup>166</sup> of the side chain of S1 subunit. However for ACE2 multiple hydrogen bonds were formed by hydroxyl groups of the oxolane ring with PRO
 <sup>346</sup>, ARG
 <sup>273</sup> of S1 subsite, and ARG
 <sup>518</sup> of the side chain. The oxygen of the oxolane ring was found forming hydrogen bond with the THR371 residue of the side chain. The free amine group interacts with the ASP
 <sup>367</sup> residue of the S1′ subsite through hydrogen bonding. Non-specific binding to M
 <sup>pro</sup> might be also contribute to the overall CoV inhibitory potential of the drug, which has shown encouraging results in terms of reduced time to clinical recovery but with insignificant clinical benefits in COVID-19 patients. However, further

 <sup>pro</sup> binding. Similar to remdesivir, Hydroxychloroqine has also been assigned for EUA from FDA (
