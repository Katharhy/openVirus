<p>The catalytic sub domain of human ACE2 in presence of inhibitor undergoes hinge bending movement causing the deep cleft of the subdomain I of enzyme to wrap the inhibitor. This closing of subdomain I around inhibitor changes the conformation of the whole receptor making it less susceptible to interact with SARS-CoV2 receptor binding domain. In the free form zinc makes coordination bonds with three residues (HIS
 <sup>374</sup>, HIS
 <sup>378</sup> and GLU
 <sup>402</sup>) and a water molecule (Towler et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The leads are explored under two key categories (a) drug candidates undergoing clinical evaluation and (b) natural products (Arts et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; McGhie &amp; Walton, 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Okonogi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Paul et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Stenlid, 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">1976</xref>; Yuldashev, 
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Glide (Friesner et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) Extra Precision (XP) approach was used for screening of candidates followed by calculation of MM-GBSA energies to increase accuracy, and reliability of the docking process. The SARS-CoV2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> crystal structure plays an important role in identifying lead drugs through molecular simulation studies. The crystal structure sourced from protein databank has co-crystallized ligand N3, a michael acceptor that act as an irreversible inhibitor (Jin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). To validate the methods utilized in this work, N3 was re-docked to its active site in M
 <sup>pro</sup> (RMSD value &lt; 2 Å). The docking yielded similar binding interactions as reported by Zhenming et al. and the MM-GBSA binding energy for N3 was calculated to be −80 Kcal/mol. The lactam of N3 embeds into the S1 subsite and forms a hydrogen bond with H
 <sup>163</sup> as reported earlier. Also, N3 forms multiple hydrogen bonds with the residues in the substrate-binding pocket. The docking pose is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1(i)</xref>. On the other hand the crystal structure of human ACE2 (PDB ID: 1R4l) 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(i)</xref> bound with its inhibitor (MLN-4760) was also validated by re-docking. The residues involved in the binding site showed similar interaction as reported by Towler et al. with the docking score of −10.74 Kcal/mol and MM-GBSA score of −51.79 Kcal/mol. ACE2 behaves differently with or without the inhibitor. In the presence of its inhibitor subdomain I of zinc matallopeptidase undergo conformational change which could prevents the binding of SARS-CoV2 to its surface.
