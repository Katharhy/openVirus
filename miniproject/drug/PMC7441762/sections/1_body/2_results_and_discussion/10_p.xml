<p>Out of top 4 screened leads 3,5-Di-O-galloylshikimic acid have the highest MM-GBSA dG binding energy of −35.09 Kcal/mol with docking score of −10.3 kcal/mol for M
 <sup>pro</sup>. It is also the only lead among top four that lacks a sugar moiety. To fit inside the M
 <sup>pro</sup> cavity, the hydroxyl groups of benzoyl moiety are involved in H-bonding with the S4 subsite residues (THR
 <sup>190</sup>), and S1 subsite residues (HIS
 <sup>163</sup>, ASN
 <sup>142</sup>). The hydroxyl group and the oxygen atoms of both the benzoyl groups are found to interact with the LEU
 <sup>167</sup>, GLY
 <sup>143</sup> and GLU
 <sup>166</sup> (
