<p>Among the 30 natural secondary metabolites screened, the top four leads exhibiting highest binding affinity were re-scored for their MM-GB/SA dG bind energies and predict their docking poses (Guimarães &amp; Cardozo, 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). All these four natural secondary metabolites were found to fit perfectly at the active site pockets of SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> and human ACE2. By analysis of the interactions it can be inferred that the active site of M
 <sup>pro</sup> is polar in nature and shows good binding energies with ligands having polar functional groups. All the top four leads are presented in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> with corresponding docking scores, MM-GB/SA dG bind energies, and pharmacokinetic descriptors for both the targets. For SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup>, similar to N3, the screened leads also engaged through multiple H-bond with the residues present in the cleft between domain I and II of M
 <sup>pro</sup> of SARS-CoV-2. The key residues involved in the binding interaction are GLN
 <sup>166</sup>, HIS
 <sup>163</sup>, THR
 <sup>190</sup>, CYS
 <sup>145</sup>, GLN
 <sup>189</sup> of main chain bonded through H-bonding and H41 of the hydrophobic pocket through π stacking interaction. Delphinidin 3,5-diglucoside is an anthocyanin mainly found in high concentration in pomegranates. It is a phenolic compound formed of anthocyanidin unit which is linked to carbohydrate moiety with O-glycoside at the C5-position. There are few reports on the therapeutic potential of this anthocyanin as an anticancer agent against colon and fibrosarcoma cancer. One of them reported that it significantly inhibited the HCT 116 and HT-29 human colon cancer cells (Mazewski et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In another study, delphinidin-3,5-glucoside showed cytotoxicity in combination with other anthocyanins (gallic acid, delphinidin and pelargonidin3-glucosides) (Filipiak et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).
