<p>SARS CoV-2 main protease (M
 <sup>pro</sup>) and ACE2 were used as target to identify effective leads. M
 <sup>pro</sup> processes polyproteins into 16 non-structural proteins (NSPs), which further generates subgenomic RNAs encoding for four main structural proteins (envelope (E), membrane (M), spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins) and other additional proteins (Coleman et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Lu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Roh, 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In the S1 subsite of M
 <sup>pro</sup>, GLN is vital for high cleavage efficiency and is specific to this particular protease. There is no known M
 <sup>pro</sup> human homolog with similar cleavage site making it an interesting antiviral target with lower probability of inhibitor toxicity. While human ACE2 belongs to the category of type I integral membrane protein having 805 amino acids. Despite its role in making a pathway for SARS-CoV2 (Q. Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), ACE2 prevents lung injuries, resulting in worsening of pathological condition (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
