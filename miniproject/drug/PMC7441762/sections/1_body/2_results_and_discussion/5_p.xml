<p>The MM-GBSA binding energy for HCQ with M
 <sup>pro</sup> and ACE2 was found to be −67.53 Kcal/mol and −59.03 Kcal/mol. In the M
 <sup>pro</sup> catalytic site it forms π-π stacking interaction between quinolin and HIE
 <sup>41</sup> of the hydrophobic S2 subunit. The hydrogen of the two amine groups was showing interaction with the GLN
 <sup>189</sup> and CYS
 <sup>145</sup> through hydrogen bond and non-covalent ionic interaction (salt bridge). The hydroxyl group of the alkyl chain was found to interact through hydrogen bond with GLY
 <sup>143</sup> residue of the S1 subunit. While this drug shows good binding to M
 <sup>pro</sup> catalytic site, it is also labeled for possible cardiac injury (FDA, 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). While in the catalytic site of ACE2 the free hydroxyl group of alkyl chain and the hydrogen of tertiary amine group interact with the side chain residue ASP
 <sup>367</sup> through hydrogen bonds and one non-covalent ionic interaction was also formed between ASP
 <sup>367</sup> and hydrogen of tertiary amine group. The side chain residue HIE
 <sup>345</sup> was found to interact through couple of π-π stacking interaction with the two rings of quinolin nucleus. The 2D and 3D docking pose of both remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> and ACE2 is presented in
