 <italic>in silico</italic> analysis showed its highest binding affinity against for both the targets, M
 <sup>pro</sup> and ACE2. The estimated docking scores were −12.2 Kcal/mol for M
 <sup>pro</sup> and −13.6 Kcal/mol for ACE2 and MM-GBSA dG binding energies came out be −74 Kcal/mol and −79.47 Kcal/mol, respectively, which are lowest among all the screened ligands for both the targets. The 2D and 3D generated docking poses in M
 <sup>pro</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(i)</xref>) shows that the hydroxyl groups of the glycone participate in H-bond interaction with GLU
 <sup>166</sup> and ASN
 <sup>142</sup> of the main chain, and with LEU
 <sup>141</sup> of S1 subunit. The hydroxyl groups of benzene ring interact with CYS
 <sup>145</sup> of the catalytic site and HIS
 <sup>164</sup> of the S2 subunit through H-bond. Docking results also exposed the π-π interaction between the benzene ring and the HIE41 of the hydrophobic cavity of S2 subunit. The hydroxyl group of flavylium nucleus found to be interacting with the THR
 <sup>190</sup> of S4 subunit. On the contrary 2D and 3D refined poses of delphinidin-3,5-glucoside (

 <sup>375</sup>. In addition to this the hydroxyls of the sugar moiety were found to have multiple hydrogen bond interaction with GLU406, THR371, ASH368, and ASP367. Likewise hydroxyls of the phenyl ring were bonded to TYR
 <sup>127</sup> with multiple hydrogen bonds.
