<p>Molecular docking was performed, using glide package of Schrödinger chemical simulation software (Schrödinger, LLC, and New York, NY). The crystal structure of SARS-Cov-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> and ACE2 was sourced from PDB data bank (PDB-ID: 6lu7 (Jin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), 1R4L (Towler et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>)). The protein preparation wizard was utilized to preprocess the crystal structure which includes removal of water molecules present beyond 5 Å, addition of right bond order, addition of H-atoms and optimization of hydroxyl and amino groups. Restrained minimization was performed using OPLS3 force field until the average root mean square deviation of the non-hydrogen atoms reached 0.3 Å. The receptor grid generation module was employed to generate grid for M
 <sup>pro</sup> and ACE2 co-crystallized with its inhibitors, N3 and MLN4760, respectively. Position of N3 and MLN-4760 was set as the primary active site for the docking of selected ligands. The size of protein grid was optimized by re-docking of co-crystallized ligand within RMSD value &lt; 2 Å. Up to 55 molecules (Source: PUBchem) were imported to the LigPrep module of Schrödinger software package to generate possible ionization states at the pH range 7 ± 2 using Epik. Up to 60 conformers were generated for single ligand and chirality was determined from the 3D structure. The generated conformers of all the screened ligands were docked to the M
 <sup>pro</sup> using extra precision mode.
