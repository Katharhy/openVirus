<p>It is vital to explore the pharmacokinetic profile of a molecule to be eligible as an active drug in clinical trial. The druggability of screened molecules were investigated for ADME properties using Swiss ADME software (Daina et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Three pharmacokinetic parameters (Lipophilicity, solubility and bioavailability) were considered for the purpose of handling and formulation. Lipophilicity (Log P) calculations were based on XLOGP3 model (Cheng et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and solubility calculation was based on ESOL model (Delaney, 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), while bioavailability scores were based on the method developed by Martin (
