<p>We selected viral and host targets, SARS CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) and ACE2, respectively to identify effective leads. Mpro is a homodimer with two protomers, each containing three domains (I, II and III) and a CYS-HIS catalytic dyad inside the cleft between domain I and II. This cleft has four subsites (S1, S1′, S2 and S4) that remain conserved in all coronavirus Mpro. The other target is a host protein, ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme-related carboxypeptidase) which is having HEXXH-E zinc-binding consensus sequence. Extracellular region of ACE2 consist of two domains (I and II), a zinc metallopeptidase (residues 19–611) and C terminus (residues 612–740). Zinc metallopeptidase further have two domains in which catalytic site for ACE2 inhibitors is present. Along with the presence of residues coordinating with the zinc the catalytic site also have two subsites S1 and S1′ defined by specific residues which occupies major portion providing substrate binding specificity (Towler et al.,
