<p>Although structure analyses of many other SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins would soon follow, predictions of other protein structures with homology/knowledge‐based (theoretical) methods would be required until structure analyses are completed, especially for the proteins currently out of focus as drug targets. In the presented study, therefore, the homology models of SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins and their ligand complexes were comprehensively constructed. Also, the structural models of the complexes between SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins and potential drugs were proposed by comparing the ligand molecules of the proteins and approved, experimental, or natural drugs.</p>
