<p>The residues of 2’‐
 <italic>O‐</italic>ribose methyltransferase, Ser74, Asp99, Asn101, Asp130, and Met131, were involved in the major interactions with sinefungin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="feb213806-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3B,C</xref>). These residues were conserved among the template proteins (SARS‐CoV and betacoronavirus) and SARS‐CoV‐2.
