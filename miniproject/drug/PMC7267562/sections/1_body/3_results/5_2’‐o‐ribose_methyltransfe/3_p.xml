<p>As the drugs similar to these ligands, several investigational adenosine A1 receptor agonists, namely tecadenoson, selodenoson, and trabodenoson, were found (Fig. 
 <xref rid="feb213806-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). These molecules share adenosine moiety, and this moiety interacts with the aforementioned 5 conserved residues in the complex models. The DSX scores of sinefungin, tecadenoson, selodenoson, and trabodenoson were −75.6, −54.3, −70.0, and −55.3, respectively. The scores of sinefungin and selodenoson were comparable to that (−74.9) of the genuine substrate,
