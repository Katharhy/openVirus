<p>Surface glycoprotein is used for a viral entrance into the host cell, and its cell surface receptor is human angiotensin I‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [
 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">51</xref>]. ACE, a homolog of ACE2 sharing 44% amino acid sequence identity, is a major target of hypertension medicating drugs, and several ACE–drug complexes have been reported [

 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">54</xref>]. Lisinopril, enalaprilat, and captopril, which show similar structures to each other (Fig. 
 <xref rid="feb213806-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>), have been targeted toward ACE and approved for hypertension treatments [

 <sup>2+</sup> coordination with Glu384, His356, and His360 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="feb213806-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2B,C</xref>). These residues were conserved between the template (ACE) and the model (ACE2) structures. The drug molecules also formed electrostatic interactions with Arg255 and Arg500 even though these residues were not conserved between ACE and ACE2 (Gln259 and Ser504 in ACE). The SARS‐CoV‐2 surface glycoprotein interacted with ACE2 through the receptor‐binding domain (RBD), while the bound drugs had no direct interaction to the RBD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="feb213806-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>), suggesting that those drugs would not directly interfere the host–pathogen interaction.
