<p>Although the models of SARS‐CoV‐2 protein would be useful for structure‐based virtual screening, potential drugs for these proteins were sought by rather simple knowledge‐based method in the presented study. The ligand molecules that were complexed with the homologs of SARS‐CoV‐2 protein in the PDB were extracted, and structurally similar molecules to the ligands were sought among the approved/experimental drugs retrieved from the KEGG database [
 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref>] and the DrugBank database [
 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>]. Many of the approved drugs, such as morphine, aspirin, or penicillin, have been adapted from natural medicines [

 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">43</xref>]. The molecules in the natural medicines are expected to serve as argent therapeutics. Therefore, the ligand structures were also compared with the components of natural medicines (natural drugs) registered in the KNApSAcK database [
