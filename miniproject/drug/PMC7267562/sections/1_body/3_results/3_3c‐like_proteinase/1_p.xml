<p>3C‐like proteinase is involved in the processing of viral polyprotein [
 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">44</xref>]. This enzyme is one of the most extensively studied drug targets and thus analyzed in complex with various peptide mimetic inhibitors [
 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">48</xref>]. Unexpectedly, these ligands did not show very high similarity to known drug molecules (Table 
 <xref rid="feb213806-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). As a peptide mimetic drug, carfilzomib showed highest score to the template ligand (ligand code AZP) of 3C‐like proteinase homolog (Fig. 
 <xref rid="feb213806-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). However, the similarity score between the ligand and the drug was only 0.754. Carfilzomib is the irreversible proteasome inhibitor targeted to the subunits with chymotrypsin‐like activity and has been approved for refractory multiple myeloma or Waldenström's macroglobulinemia [
 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">50</xref>]. A complex model of carfilzomib–SARS‐CoV‐2 3C‐like proteinase was constructed. In the model, carfilzomib formed a parallel β‐sheet with His164–Glu166, and side chains of His41, Cys145, Met165, Leu167, Phe185, and Gln189 contributed major interactions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="feb213806-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1B,C</xref>). These residues were conserved between the template (SARS‐CoV) and the model (SARS‐CoV‐2) proteins. Carfilzomib covalently binds to active site threonine through epoxy moiety, and the epoxy moiety is also reactive with thiol group of cysteine. Although a possible covalent linkage between carfilzomib and the catalytic Cys145 of SARS‐CoV‐2 3C‐like proteinase was not explicitly modeled, the epoxy moiety was placed close to the catalytic residue in this model. The fitness of the ligand to SARS‐CoV‐2 3C‐like proteinase in the model was evaluated by the DSX function, and the score of carfilzomib, –139.6, was even better than that (−99.8) of inhibitor N3 in the complex crystal structure of SARS‐CoV‐2 3C‐like proteinase (PDB ID
