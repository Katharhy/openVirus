 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">73</xref>]. The cap structure is essential for viral mRNAs to be translated and escape from innate immune system in the host cell. Thus, inhibition of this enzyme might prevent virus propagation. Despite the overall sequence identities between templates (SARS‐CoV or human betacoronavirus) and SARS‐CoV‐2 enzymes were relatively low (~66%), the residues interacting with the drugs were conserved.
