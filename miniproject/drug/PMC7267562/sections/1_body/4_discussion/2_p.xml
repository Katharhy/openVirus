<p>Several drugs were suggested to bind to the SARS‐CoV‐2 targets (Table 
 <xref rid="feb213806-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The procedure employed in the presented study should largely limit the extent of search (because it depends on the presence of ligands in known complex structures). However, it is noteworthy that the binding of suggested drugs to the homologous proteins of the SARS‐CoV‐2 targets would be probable because of the presence of structural evidences.
