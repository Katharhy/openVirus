<p>Among the suggested drugs for this enzyme, sinefungin is a naturally occurring and verified inhibitor of 2’‐
 <italic>O</italic>‐ribose methyltransferase. Since a toxicity was detected [
 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0074" ref-type="ref">74</xref>], however, appreciation of this natural drug should be carefully considered. Although tecadenoson has been examined in a clinical trial for atrial fibrillation, and passed phase II test, final results were not formally reported at this point of time [

 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0076" ref-type="ref">76</xref>], but had failed in the phase III clinical trial test due to lack of superiority over placebo. Selodenoson was designed to control heart rate [

Since tecadenoson and trabodenoson appeared to have cleared the phase I tests, these drugs would worth examining against COVID‐19. The DSX score suggested the fitness of sinefungin or selodenoson is comparable to the genuine substrate of the 2’‐
