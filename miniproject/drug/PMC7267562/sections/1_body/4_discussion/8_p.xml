<p>Several structure determinations of SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins, for example, endo‐RNase (PDB IDs

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://6VYO" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://6VYO</ext-link>), and nsp12 (RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase)‐nsp7‐nsp8 complex (PDB ID 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://7BV2" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://7BV2</ext-link>) have been reported after the modeling of the presented study was executed. Although many of the other proteins should be under analyses undoubtedly, it would take considerable time before all structures of potential targets are experimentally elucidated. During the period until the structural determinations, theoretical models might be useful. The presented structural models are freely available from the BINDS webpage (
