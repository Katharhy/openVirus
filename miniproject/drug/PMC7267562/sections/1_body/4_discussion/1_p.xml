<p>In the presented study, knowledge‐based models of SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins were constructed by homology modeling and comparison of the known ligands with drugs. Since a considerable number of structure analyses have already reported for coronavirus proteins including those of SARS‐CoV, 66% (17/26) of the SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins could be modeled based on highly similar (85% sequence identity and 89% coverage on average) templates (Table
