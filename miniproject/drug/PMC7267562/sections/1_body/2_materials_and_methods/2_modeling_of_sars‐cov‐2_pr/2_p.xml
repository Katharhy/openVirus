<p>The structures of the ligand molecules in the known complex structures, as sought in the template search process, were exhaustively compared with that of the drugs by using COMPLIG [
 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref>]. COMPLIG matches molecular graphs and evaluates the similarity score of two molecules A and B as min{M(A, B)/M(A), M(A, B)/M(B)}, where M(A) and M(B) are the total numbers of atoms and bonds in molecules A and B, respectively, and M(A, B) is the total number of atoms and bonds matched between molecules A and B. Both element and chirality, if applicable, should be identical for atoms, and bond order should be identical for bonds to be matched.
