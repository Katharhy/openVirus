<p>Selected drug molecules were built into the protein models by superposing drug molecules to known (original) ligand molecules with COMPLIG. According to the graph matching results, the dihedral angles in the drug molecules were adjusted toward the corresponding angles in the original ligand molecules, and corresponding atoms were superposed between drug and known ligand by fixing the coordinates of the latter. The models of protein–drug complexes were further modified with PHENIX and COOT. The constraints for drug molecules were generated by using the eLBOW application in PHENIX. Hydrogen bonds were evaluated with canonical parameters (constraints were relaxed by 0.4 Å and 20 degrees) [
