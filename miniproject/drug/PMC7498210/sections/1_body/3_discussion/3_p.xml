<p id="p0105">The drug barnidipine, a calcium channel blocker and an antihypertensive agent was short listed because of its significant interaction with M

The drug tipiracil is currently used along with an anticancer agent trifluridine for treatment of advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer. Tipiracil prevents the degradation of trifluridine by inhibiting the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase, whereby, increases the concentration anticancer agent trifluridine at the cite of action. At therapeutic doses, tipiracil has no reported adverse events (
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In this study, the data infers that the tipiracil interaction with M
 <sup>pro</sup> is much more durable and stable in both SP-docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Thus, the repurposing of tipiracil will have advantages compared to other selected molecules.
