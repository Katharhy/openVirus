<p id="p0115">In the recent literature on COVID-19 drug discovery, there are many reports with the thought of repurposing. Researchers have reported repurposing possibilities of many existing antiviral drugs like remdesivir and favipiravir have been officially approved for COVID-19 treatment. Similarly, dexamethasone is an immunosuppressant is repurposed for COVID-19 to reduce the cytokine storm and whereby reduce the mortality. The anti-HIV drugs such as ritonavir and nelfinavir, have been proposed for repurposing in COVID-19 by targeting to M
 <sup>pro</sup> (

 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Similarly, anti-hepatitis-C virus drugs paritaprevir and simeprevir was suggested in another report as a covalent inhibitor of M
 <sup>pro</sup> (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Limitation of these drugs being high adverse events and many drug-drug/drug-disease interactions. In another study, drugs such as simeprevir, ergotamine, bromocriptine and tadalafil are proposed by the researcher (
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). There was a virtual screening report on peptides drugs such as nafarelin and icatibant for repurposing to COVD-19 (
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Similarly, the drugs leupeptin, hemisulphate, pepstatin A, nelfinavir, birinapant, lypression and octreotide have been reported by targeting M
 <sup>pro</sup> in virtual screening (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). These studies strengthen and support our hypothesis of drug repurposing from an entirely new class of drugs which are not screened for treating any infections. One of our ambition is to give avenues for repurposing rather than the novelty of selected drugs in comparison with the other reports.
