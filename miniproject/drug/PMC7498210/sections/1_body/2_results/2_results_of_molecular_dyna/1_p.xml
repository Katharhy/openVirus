<p id="p0065">MD-simulation was performed to validate the stability of the binding mode predicted by Glide docking of FDA approved drugs to major protease M
 <sup>pro</sup>. The data provided adequate information on structural changes in the form of conformations and ligand-protein interactions. The MD simulation conducted for five drugs, aprepitant, barnidipine, tipiracil, arbutin and terbutaline. The Root Mean Square Deviations (RMSD) plot analysis of the structures saved in the trajectory produced during the MD-simulation exhibited strong and stable binding with M
 <sup>pro</sup> for the aprepitant and tipiracil where the RMSD-fluctuations for the ligand and protein remained within 2.0 Å. The barnidipine and terbutaline demonstrated strong binding ability and arbutin demonstrated the least stable binding (
