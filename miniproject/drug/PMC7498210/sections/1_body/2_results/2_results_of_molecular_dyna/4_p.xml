 <sup>Pro</sup> exhibited consistent binding stability during MD-simulation. As illustrated in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C, after 10 nsec initial fluctuations due to the equilibration, the RMSD for the ligand-protein structures remained within 2.0 Å till the end of simulation which indicates the binding stability of the ligand at the selected protein. The residues THR45 and serine (SER46) made hydrogen bonding with the ligand. A bridged hydrogen bonding was observed with ligand and CYS44 residue. A π- π stacking interaction was exhibited with HIS41 (58%) amino acid residue (
