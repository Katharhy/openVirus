 <sup>pro</sup> exhibited polar as well as non-polar binding during MD-simulation. The plot of the backbone of the protein structures enumerated during the MD-simulation aligned to the initial structure for the RMSD analysis. As illustrated in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E, after 20-sec initial fluctuations due to the equilibration, the RMSD for the protein structures remained between 0.8 Å–1.7 Å till 70 nsec of simulation which indicates that the association with the ligand and protein was good. After 70 nsec, the RMSD of the ligand-protein complex varied considerably. This indicates that the ligand-protein complex was unstable compared to tipiracil and aprepitant. A bridged hydrogen bonding was observed with the residues HIS163 and HIS164 and the ligand. Similarly, the ligand through a water moiety interacted with CYS44 and GLU166 residues. Among them, the interaction with CYS44 seemed to be negligible. A π-π stacking interaction (considered for ∼87%) was observed with HIS41 amino acid residue (
