<p id="p0075">Barnidipine bound to M
 <sup>pro</sup> exhibited a combination of polar (water bridges), as well as non-polar (hydrophobic) interactions during MD-simulations. The RMSD plot of the backbone of the protein structures enumerated during the MD-simulation aligned to the initial structure for the RMSD analysis. As illustrated in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B, after 20 nsec initial fluctuations due to the equilibration, the RMSD for the protein-ligand complex varied between 1.0 Å–3.0 Å until the end of the simulation. Initially, the ligand made seldom contact with the protein. But more frequent contacts were made with the ligand after 50 nsec. Hence the binding is weaker compared to aprepitant. The amino acid residue GLU166 made bridged hydrogen bond as well as direct hydrogen bond with the ligand. A π-cation stacking interaction was exhibited with HIS41 amino acid residue (41%) (
