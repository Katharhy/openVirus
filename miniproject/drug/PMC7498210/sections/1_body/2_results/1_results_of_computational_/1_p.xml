<p id="p0055">Initial docking of ⁓2800 drugs was to recognize how drugs bind to target major protease M
 <sup>pro</sup>. The docking findings provided sufficient knowledge on binding affinity and orientation of ligand-protein interactions to inhibit protein activity. In the SP-docking on 500 top drugs were able to interact via hydrogen bonding with the active site of M
 <sup>pro</sup>. Based on docking score and visual interpretations, the drugs aprepitant, barnidipine, tipiracil, arbutin, and terbutaline were found to be significantly interacting with M
 <sup>pro</sup> residues compared to all other drugs (
