<p id="p0050">Based on the molecular interaction and visual analysis of SP-docking results, the top-ranked drugs were taken for the Molecular Dynamics simulation (MD-simulation) study. The MD-simulation was run on Desmond Module (
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The water-soaked solvent system was used to predictions. Using the System Builder tool in Desmond, the water-soaked solvated system was generated. The TIP3P model of water considered for solvating the system. The orthorhombic simulation was the box with periodic boundary condition generated with a buffer distance of minimum 10 Å from the outer surface of the protein. The system was neutralized by adding a suitable number of counter-ions. The isosmotic condition was maintained by adding 0.15 M NaCl to the simulation box. A predefined equilibration protocol was run before the production run of the simulation. The MD simulation was run at 300°K temperature at atmospheric pressure of 1.013 bar. A total of 100 nsec simulation was run during which 1000 frames were saved to the trajectory. The Simulation Interaction Diagram was used for the analysis of the MD-simulation trajectory.
