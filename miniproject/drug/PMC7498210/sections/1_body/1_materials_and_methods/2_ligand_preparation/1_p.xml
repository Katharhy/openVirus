 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). By using LigPrep the 3D coordinates for the molecules were generated. The Epik module predicted the ionization state at pH 7.4, the tautomer forms were generated, and the chirality was defined. Finally, drug-molecules were geometry minimized using OPLS3e force-field (
