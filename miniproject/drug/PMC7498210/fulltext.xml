Though drugs like remdesivir, favipiravir, and dexamethasone found beneficial for COVID-19 management, they have limitations clinically, and vaccine development takes a long time. The researchers have reported key proteins which could act as druggable targets. Among them, the major protease M<sup>pro</sup> is first published, plays a prominent role in viral replication and an attractive drug-target for drug discovery. Hence, to target M<sup>pro</sup> and inhibit it, we accomplished the virtual screening of US-FDA approved drugs using well-known drug repurposing approach by computer-aided tools.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The protein M<sup>pro</sup>, PDB-ID 6LU7 was imported to Maestro graphical user interphase of Schr&#x000f6;dinger software.

In the past, coronavirus caused epidemics such as SARS and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) in 2013 and 2018, respectively in China, and Saudi Arabia (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). COVID-19 was first recognized as intense pneumonia in a medical facility in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China. Later the virus was renamed as SARS-CoV-2. Within a few months, the epidemic spread globally and declared as a pandemic by WHO. The signs and symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, weakness, headache, haemoptysis, diarrhoea, dyspnoea, and lymphopenia. The clinical features identified by chest CT-scans are pneumonia with unusual features such as RNAaemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, the occurrence of the ground-glass opacity and severe end-organ injury that lead to the death of infected human (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p id="p0015">The spread of virus is very rapid, the mortality rate of COVID-19 is low compared to SARS and MERS. Currently, there is no curative therapy available, and the vaccines have not been developed. The main reason being the poorly understood pathology of COVID-19 and the differences across the geography besides the mutations in virus (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The SARS-CoV-2 spreads mainly through respiratory droplets or droplet nuclei between individuals (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Hence, social distancing and preventing the spread by respiratory droplets has become the mainstay of COVID-19 management rather than the drug treatment and vaccination (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p id="p0020">Many drug discovery groups have applied the drug repurposing or repositioning to speed-up and bring out curative therapy (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The repurposed drugs remdesivir and favipiravir are currently approved by US-FDA for treatment of COVID-19 act by inhibiting the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). These drugs have limitation in terms of its cost-effectiveness and adverse drug reactions such as hyperuricaemia, teratogenicity and QT-prolongation (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Similarly, the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant class of drugs corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, is approved by US-FDA. The corticosteroids have limitations in terms of its dose-dependent toxicities and drug-disease interactions.</p><p id="p0025">Target selection and validation are the crucial steps in drug repurposing. One of the recently reported druggable target major protease M<sup>pro</sup> is the first protein crystallography structure published in PDB on January 26, 2020 (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). M<sup>pro</sup> is also known as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL<sup>pro</sup>). Currently, the target M<sup>pro</sup> is validated, and some studies have reported drug repurposing (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). None of these studies is focussed on FDA approved drugs for repurposing. Hence, in this study, we tried drug repurposing using FDA approved drugs. We discovered a new compounds, whose binding could have potentials as SARS-CoV-2 replication inhibitors with less toxic and affordable compared to the currently available drugs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Computational Simulations</title><p id="p0030">The computational simulations were carried out in Maestro graphical user interphase of Schr&#x000f6;dinger (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.schrodinger.com" id="intref0010">www.schrodinger.com</ext-link>) on a desktop workstation with Ubuntu platform, with Intel&#x000ae; Xenon&#x000ae; Gold 6130 CPU @ 2.10&#x000a0;GHz x 64 processors, Quadro P620/PCle/SSE2 graphics card and 134.8&#x000a0;GB RAM.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Ligand Preparation</title><p id="p0035">The US-FDA approved drugs (&#x02053;2800) were downloaded from DrugBank database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.drugbank.ca" id="intref0015">www.drugbank.ca</ext-link>), were optimized using LigPrep (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).

In the crystal structure of M<sup>pro</sup> the native compound N3 (also known as peptide-like inhibitor PRD_002214) binds to the substrate-binding pocket by covalent bonding (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Because the native molecule binding mechanism is covalent bonding it cannot be compared with the molecules of current interest as they are non-covalent ligand binder.</p><p id="p0100">We have carried out the virtual screening of US-FDA approved drugs from the DrugBank database. The virtual screening is a powerful method in drug discovery by computational modelling for hit identification as a starting point for a medicinal chemist to synthesize new chemical entity as well as for drug repurposing. This method reduces the time and cost of drug discovery (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Researchers have followed virtual screening by targeting M<sup>pro</sup> and shortlisted 50 top-drugs based on docking scores (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In our study, after the initial virtual screening of &#x02053;2800 drugs, five drugs are shortlisted based on docking score and visual analysis of SP-docking and MD-simulation. These drugs are first time reported by us for targeting M<sup>pro</sup>. The drug aprepitant is used as an antiemetic in chemotherapy-induced emesis and post operatives emesis (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Aprepitant is an antagonist of Neurokinin 1 receptor (NK-1R), it was proposed to be beneficial as adjuvant therapy with anti-HIV drugs (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In the current studies, aprepitant is found a better drug based on its results of interactions and molecular simulations studies.</p><p id="p0105">The drug barnidipine, a calcium channel blocker and an antihypertensive agent was short listed because of its significant interaction with M<sup>pro</sup> (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In the current study, it was a hit-drug can be screened for inhibiting replication of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19. The drug tipiracil is currently used along with an anticancer agent trifluridine for treatment of advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer. Tipiracil prevents the degradation of trifluridine by inhibiting the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase, whereby, increases the concentration anticancer agent trifluridine at the cite of action. At therapeutic doses, tipiracil has no reported adverse events (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In this study, the data infers that the tipiracil interaction with M<sup>pro</sup> is much more durable and stable in both SP-docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Thus, the repurposing of tipiracil will have advantages compared to other selected molecules.</p><p id="p0110">The drug arbutin is a prodrug of hydroquinone. Chemically arbutin is glycosylated hydroquinone, an inhibitor of melanin formation and a skin-lightening agent. Hydroquinones are known tyrosinase inhibitors, and hence arbutin is repurposed to treat melanogenesis or hyperpigmentation (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Arbutin is officially used therapeutically for hyperpigmentation and other skin related problems (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The data from this work suggests that arbutin can be repurposed to treat COVID-19 if explored further. The drug terbutaline sometimes used to prevent premature labour, is also the medicine for asthma, wheezing and COPD (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Because of its lung specificity, terbutaline will have advantages if it is found useful in further in&#x000a0;vitro enzyme inhibition studies.</p><p id="p0115">In the recent literature on COVID-19 drug discovery, there are many reports with the thought of repurposing. Researchers have reported repurposing possibilities of many existing antiviral drugs like remdesivir and favipiravir have been officially approved for COVID-19 treatment. Similarly, dexamethasone is an immunosuppressant is repurposed for COVID-19 to reduce the cytokine storm and whereby reduce the mortality. The anti-HIV drugs such as ritonavir and nelfinavir, have been proposed for repurposing in COVID-19 by targeting to M<sup>pro</sup> (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The antiviral drugs such as solutegravir, raltegravir, paritaprevir, bictegravir and dolutegravir were also suggested in another report (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Similarly, anti-hepatitis-C virus drugs paritaprevir and simeprevir was suggested in another report as a covalent inhibitor of M<sup>pro</sup> (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Limitation of these drugs being high adverse events and many drug-drug/drug-disease interactions. In another study, drugs such as simeprevir, ergotamine, bromocriptine and tadalafil are proposed by the researcher (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). There was a virtual screening report on peptides drugs such as nafarelin and icatibant for repurposing to COVD-19 (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Similarly, the drugs leupeptin, hemisulphate, pepstatin A, nelfinavir, birinapant, lypression and octreotide have been reported by targeting M<sup>pro</sup> in virtual screening (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). These studies strengthen and support our hypothesis of drug repurposing from an entirely new class of drugs which are not screened for treating any infections. One of our ambition is to give avenues for repurposing rather than the novelty of selected drugs in comparison with the other reports.</p><p id="p0120">The limitations of current management of COVID-19 are many, but the adverse events and the cost-effectiveness is most important (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Any drug that was suggested had a lot of economic and managerial impact on supply and demand apart from the therapeutic efficacy potency and toxicity. In this view, we propose that the shortlisted drugs in this study will have a higher ratio of benefits and can be further studied and repurposed in clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0125">The SP-docking of USFDA approved drugs resulted in five potential SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors. These drugs include aprepitant, barnidipine, tipiracil, arbutin and terbutaline. Among these five drug-hits, aprepitant and tipiracil were found strongest in binding M<sup>pro</sup> by MD-simulation studies. Further, these drugs are cost-effective, least toxic and currently used in therapy for other diseases. Thus, the present study provides an insight into the inhibition of major protease M<sup>pro</sup> of SARS-CoV-2 using computation tools and shortlisted five drugs. Further, testing theses drugs, especially aprepitant and tipiracil, by in&#x000a0;vitro M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitory activity and in&#x000a0;vitro antiviral activity can be fast-tracked for repurposing in COVID-19 clinical trials.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"
