<p>In a study conducted to investigate the potential of different animal species to act as the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, it was found that both ferrets and cats can be infected via experimental inoculation of the virus. In addition, infected cats efficiently transmitted the disease to naive cats (

The infected ferrets also shed virus via multiple routes, such as saliva, nasal washes, feces, and urine, postinfection, making them an ideal animal model for studying disease transmission (
