<p>The comprehensive sequence analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome identified that the CoV from Wuhan is a recombinant virus of the bat coronavirus and another coronavirus of unknown origin. The recombination was found to have happened within the viral spike glycoprotein, which recognizes the cell surface receptor. Further analysis of the genome based on codon usage identified the snake as the most probable animal reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 (

 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). The involvement of bat-derived materials in causing the current outbreak cannot be ruled out. High risk is involved in the production of bat-derived materials for TCM practices involving the handling of wild bats. The use of bats for TCM practices will remain a severe risk for the occurrence of zoonotic coronavirus epidemics in the future (
