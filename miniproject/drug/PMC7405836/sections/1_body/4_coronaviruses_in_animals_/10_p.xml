<p>Human-wildlife interactions, which are increasing in the context of climate change (
 <xref rid="B142" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>), are further considered high risk and responsible for the emergence of SARS-CoV. COVID-19 is also suspected of having a similar mode of origin. Hence, to prevent the occurrence of another zoonotic spillover (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), exhaustive coordinated efforts are needed to identify the high-risk pathogens harbored by wild animal populations, conducting surveillance among the people who are susceptible to zoonotic spillover events (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and to improve the biosecurity measures associated with the wildlife trade (
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>). The serological surveillance studies conducted in people living in proximity to bat caves had earlier identified the serological confirmation of SARS-related CoVs in humans. People living at the wildlife-human interface, mainly in rural China, are regularly exposed to SARS-related CoVs (
 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>). These findings will not have any significance until a significant outbreak occurs due to a virus-like SARS-CoV-2.
