<p>Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) was first identified in suckling piglets having severe enteritis and belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>). The outbreak was associated with considerable scale mortality of piglets (24,693 deaths) across four farms in China (
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>). The virus isolated from the piglets was almost identical to and had 95% genomic similarity with horseshoe bat (
 <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> species) coronavirus HKU2, suggesting a bat origin of the pig virus (

 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>). It is also imperative to note that the SADS-CoV outbreak started in Guangdong province, near the location of the SARS pandemic origin (
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>). Before this outbreak, pigs were not known to be infected with bat-origin coronaviruses. This indicates that the bat-origin coronavirus jumped to pig by breaking the species barrier. The next step of this jump might not end well, since pigs are considered the mixing vessel for influenza A viruses due to their ability to be infected by both human and avian influenza A viruses (
