<p>The host spectrum of coronavirus increased when a novel coronavirus, namely, SW1, was recognized in the liver tissue of a captive beluga whale (
 <italic>Delphinapterus leucas</italic>) (
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>). In recent decades, several novel coronaviruses were identified from different animal species. Bats can harbor these viruses without manifesting any clinical disease but are persistently infected (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). They are the only mammals with the capacity for self-powered flight, which enables them to migrate long distances, unlike land mammals. Bats are distributed worldwide and also account for about a fifth of all mammalian species (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). This makes them the ideal reservoir host for many viral agents and also the source of novel coronaviruses that have yet to be identified. It has become a necessity to study the diversity of coronavirus in the bat population to prevent future outbreaks that could jeopardize livestock and public health. The repeated outbreaks caused by bat-origin coronaviruses calls for the development of efficient molecular surveillance strategies for studying 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> among animals (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), especially in the 
 <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> bat family (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). Chinese bats have high commercial value, since they are used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Therefore, the handling of bats for trading purposes poses a considerable risk of transmitting zoonotic CoV epidemics (
