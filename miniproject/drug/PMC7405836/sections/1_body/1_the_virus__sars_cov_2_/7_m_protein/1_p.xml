<p>The M protein is the most abundant viral protein present in the virion particle, giving a definite shape to the viral envelope (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). It binds to the nucleocapsid and acts as a central organizer of coronavirus assembly (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Coronavirus M proteins are highly diverse in amino acid contents but maintain overall structural similarity within different genera (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). The M protein has three transmembrane domains, flanked by a short amino terminus outside the virion and a long carboxy terminus inside the virion (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Overall, the viral scaffold is maintained by M-M interaction. Of note, the M protein of SARS-CoV-2 does not have an amino acid substitution compared to that of SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).
