<p>Coronaviruses possess an unsegmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of around 30 kb, enclosed by a 5′-cap and 3′-poly(A) tail (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is 29,891 bp long, with a G+C content of 38% (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). These viruses are encircled with an envelope containing viral nucleocapsid. The nucleocapsids in CoVs are arranged in helical symmetry, which reflects an atypical attribute in positive-sense RNA viruses (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The electron micrographs of SARS-CoV-2 revealed a diverging spherical outline with some degree of pleomorphism, virion diameters varying from 60 to 140 nm, and distinct spikes of 9 to 12 nm, giving the virus the appearance of a solar corona (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The CoV genome is arranged linearly as 5′-leader-UTR-replicase-structural genes (S-E-M-N)-3′ UTR-poly(A) (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Accessory genes, such as 3a/b, 4a/b, and the hemagglutinin-esterase gene (HE), are also seen intermingled with the structural genes (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 has also been found to be arranged similarly and encodes several accessory proteins, although it lacks the HE, which is characteristic of some betacoronaviruses (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The positive-sense genome of CoVs serves as the mRNA and is translated to polyprotein 1a/1ab (pp1a/1ab) (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). A replication-transcription complex (RTC) is formed in double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) by nonstructural proteins (nsps), encoded by the polyprotein gene (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Subsequently, the RTC synthesizes a nested set of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) via discontinuous transcription (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).
