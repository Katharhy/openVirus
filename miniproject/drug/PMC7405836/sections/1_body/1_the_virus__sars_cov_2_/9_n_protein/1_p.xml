<p>The N protein of coronavirus is multipurpose. Among several functions, it plays a role in complex formation with the viral genome, facilitates M protein interaction needed during virion assembly, and enhances the transcription efficiency of the virus (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). It contains three highly conserved and distinct domains, namely, an NTD, an RNA-binding domain or a linker region (LKR), and a CTD (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). The NTD binds with the 3â€² end of the viral genome, perhaps via electrostatic interactions, and is highly diverged both in length and sequence (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). The charged LKR is serine and arginine rich and is also known as the SR (serine and arginine) domain (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). The LKR is capable of direct interaction with 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> RNA interaction and is responsible for cell signaling (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). It also modulates the antiviral response of the host by working as an antagonist for interferon (IFN) and RNA interference (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Compared to that of SARS-CoV, the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 possess five amino acid mutations, where two are in the intrinsically dispersed region (IDR; positions 25 and 26), one each in the NTD (position 103), LKR (position 217), and CTD (position 334) (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).
