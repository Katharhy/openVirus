<p>In the unrooted phylogenetic tree of different betacoronaviruses based on the S protein, virus sequences from different subgenera grouped into separate clusters. SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Wuhan and other countries exhibited a close relationship and appeared in a single cluster (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The CoVs from the subgenus 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> appeared jointly in SplitsTree and divided into three subclusters, namely, SARS-CoV-2, bat-SARS-like-CoV (bat-SL-CoV), and SARS-CoV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). In the case of other subgenera, like 
 <italic>Merbecovirus</italic>, all of the sequences grouped in a single cluster, whereas in 
 <italic>Embecovirus</italic>, different species, comprised of canine respiratory CoVs, bovine CoVs, equine CoVs, and human CoV strain (OC43), grouped in a common cluster. Isolates in the subgenera 
 <italic>Nobecovorus</italic> and 
 <italic>Hibecovirus</italic> were found to be placed separately away from other reported SARS-CoVs but shared a bat origin.
