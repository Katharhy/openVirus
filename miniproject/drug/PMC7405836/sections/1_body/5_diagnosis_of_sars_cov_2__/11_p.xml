 <xref rid="B352" ref-type="bibr">352</xref>). A reverse transcriptional loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), namely, iLACO, has been developed for rapid and colorimetric detection of this virus (
 <xref rid="B354" ref-type="bibr">354</xref>). RT-LAMP serves as a simple, rapid, and sensitive diagnostic method that does not require sophisticated equipment or skilled personnel (
 <xref rid="B349" ref-type="bibr">349</xref>). An interactive web-based dashboard for tracking SARS-CoV-2 in a real-time mode has been designed (
 <xref rid="B238" ref-type="bibr">238</xref>). A smartphone-integrated home-based point-of-care testing (POCT) tool, a paper-based POCT combined with LAMP, is a useful point-of-care diagnostic (
 <xref rid="B353" ref-type="bibr">353</xref>). An Abbott ID Now COVID-19 molecular POCT-based test, using isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology, has been designed as a point-of-care test for very rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in just 5 min (

 <underline>s</underline>pecific 
 <underline>h</underline>igh-sensitivity 
 <underline>e</underline>nzymatic 
 <underline>r</underline>eporter un
 <underline>lock</underline>ing) diagnostic for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 without the requirement of specialized instrumentation has been reported to be very useful in the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 (360). A CRISPR-Cas12-based lateral flow assay also has been developed for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B346" ref-type="bibr">346</xref>). Artificial intelligence, by means of a three-dimensional deep-learning model, has been developed for sensitive and specific diagnosis of COVID-19 via CT images (
