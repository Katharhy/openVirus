<p>The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in fecal samples has posed grave public health concerns. In addition to the direct transmission mainly occurring via droplets of sneezing and coughing, other routes, such as fecal excretion and environmental and fomite contamination, are contributing to SARS-CoV-2 transmission and spread (

 <xref rid="B252" ref-type="bibr">252</xref>). Fecal excretion has also been documented for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, along with the potential to stay viable in situations aiding fecal-oral transmission. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 has every possibility to be transmitted through this mode. Fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in regions having low standards of hygiene and poor sanitation, may have grave consequences with regard to the high spread of this virus. Ethanol and disinfectants containing chlorine or bleach are effective against coronaviruses (

 <xref rid="B252" ref-type="bibr">252</xref>). Appropriate precautions need to be followed strictly while handling the stools of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Biowaste materials and sewage from hospitals must be adequately disinfected, treated, and disposed of properly. The significance of frequent and good hand hygiene and sanitation practices needs to be given due emphasis (

Future explorative research needs to be conducted with regard to the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, along with focusing on environmental investigations to find out if this virus could stay viable in situations and atmospheres facilitating such potent routes of transmission. The correlation of fecal concentrations of viral RNA with disease severity needs to be determined, along with assessing the gastrointestinal symptoms and the possibility of fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection during the COVID-19 incubation period or convalescence phases of the disease (
