<p>The results of the studies related to SARS-CoV-2 viral loads reflect active replication of this virus in the upper respiratory tract and prolonged viral shedding after symptoms disappear, including via stool. Thus, the current case definition needs to be updated along with a reassessment of the strategies to be adopted for restraining the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak spread (

In some cases, the viral load studies of SARS-CoV-2 have also been useful to recommend precautionary measures when handling specific samples, e.g., feces. In a recent survey from 17 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with available data (representing days 0 to 13 after onset), stool samples from nine cases (53%; days 0 to 11 after onset) were positive on RT-PCR analysis. Although the viral loads were lower than those of respiratory samples (range, 550 copies per ml to 1.21 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> copies per ml), this has essential biosafety implications (
