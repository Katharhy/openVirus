<p>SARS-CoV-2 invades the lung parenchyma, resulting in severe interstitial inflammation of the lungs. This is evident on computed tomography (CT) images as ground-glass opacity in the lungs. This lesion initially involves a single lobe but later expands to multiple lung lobes (

The histological assessment of lung biopsy samples obtained from COVID-19-infected patients revealed diffuse alveolar damage, cellular fibromyxoid exudates, hyaline membrane formation, and desquamation of pneumocytes, indicative of acute respiratory distress syndrome (

The degree of lymphocytopenia gives an idea about disease prognosis, as it is found to be positively correlated with disease severity (
