<p>Since the living mammals sold in the wet market are suspected to be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, there is a need for strengthening the regulatory mechanism for wild animal trade (

The total number of COVID-19 confirmed cases is on a continuous rise and the cure rate is relatively low, making disease control very difficult to achieve. The Chinese government is making continuous efforts to contain the disease by taking emergency control and prevention measures. They have already built a hospital for patients affected by this virus and are currently building several more for accommodating the continuously increasing infected population (

The effective control of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 requires high-level interventions like intensive contact tracing, as well as the quarantine of people with suspected infection and the isolation of infected individuals. The implementation of rigorous control and preventive measures together might control the R

The substantial importation of COVID-19 presymptomatic cases from Wuhan has resulted in independent, self-sustaining outbreaks across major cities both within the country and across the globe. The majority of Chinese cities are now facing localized outbreaks of COVID-19 (
