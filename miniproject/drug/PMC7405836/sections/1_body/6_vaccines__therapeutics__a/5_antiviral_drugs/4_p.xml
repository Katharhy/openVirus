<p>Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug known to possess antiviral activity due to its ability to block virus-cell fusion by raising the endosomal pH necessary for fusion. It also interferes with virus-receptor binding by interfering with the terminal glycosylation of SARS-CoV cellular receptors, such as ACE2 (

The preliminary clinical trials using hydroxychloroquine, another aminoquinoline drug, gave promising results. The COVID-19 patients received 600 mg of hydroxychloroquine daily along with azithromycin as a single-arm protocol. This protocol was found to be associated with a noteworthy reduction in viral load. Finally, it resulted in a complete cure (

However, in another case study, the authors raised concerns over the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, since no observable effect was seen when they were used. In some cases, the treatment was discontinued due to the prolongation of the QT interval (
