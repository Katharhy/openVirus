A molecular docking study, conducted in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 using different commercially available antipolymerase drugs, identified that drugs such as ribavirin, remdesivir, galidesivir, tenofovir, and sofosbuvir bind RdRp tightly, indicating their vast potential to be used against COVID-19 (
