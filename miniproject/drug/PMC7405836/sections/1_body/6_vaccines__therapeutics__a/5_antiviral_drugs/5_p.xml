<p>Recently, another FDA-approved drug, ivermectin, was reported to inhibit the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> replication of SARS-CoV-2. The findings from this study indicate that a single treatment of this drug was able to induce an âˆ¼5,000-fold reduction in the viral RNA at 48 h in cell culture. (

However, altering the vehicles used in the formulations, the pharmacokinetic properties can be modified, thereby having significant control over the systemic concentration of ivermectin (
 <xref rid="B338" ref-type="bibr">338</xref>). Based on the pharmacokinetic simulation, it was also found that ivermectin may have limited therapeutic utility in managing COVID-19, since the inhibitory concentration that has to be achieved for effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity is far higher than the maximum plasma concentration achieved by administering the approved dose (
 <xref rid="B340" ref-type="bibr">340</xref>). However, ivermectin, being a host-directed agent, exhibits antiviral activity by targeting a critical cellular process of the mammalian cell. Therefore, the administration of ivermectin, even at lower doses, will reduce the viral load at a minor level. This slight decrease will provide a great advantage to the immune system for mounting a large-scale antiviral response against SARS-CoV-2 (

 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies and randomized clinical control trials are required to understand the mechanism as well as the clinical utility of this promising drug.
