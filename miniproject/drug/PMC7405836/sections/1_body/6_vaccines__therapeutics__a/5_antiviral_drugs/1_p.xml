<p>Several classes of routinely used antiviral drugs, like oseltamivir (neuraminidase inhibitor), acyclovir, ganciclovir, and ribavirin, do not have any effect on COVID-19 and, hence, are not recommended (
 <xref rid="B187" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>). Oseltamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor, has been explored in Chinese hospitals for treating suspected COVID-19 cases, although proven efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 is still lacking for this drug (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiviral potential of FAD-approved drugs, 
 <italic>viz.</italic>, ribavirin, penciclovir, nitazoxanide, nafamostat, and chloroquine, tested in comparison to remdesivir and favipiravir (broad-spectrum antiviral drugs) revealed remdesivir and chloroquine to be highly effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="B194" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>). Ribavirin, penciclovir, and favipiravir might not possess noteworthy 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antiviral actions for SARS-CoV-2, since higher concentrations of these nucleoside analogs are needed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> to lessen the viral infection. Both remdesivir and chloroquine are being used in humans to treat other diseases, and such safer drugs can be explored for assessing their effectiveness in COVID-19 patients.
