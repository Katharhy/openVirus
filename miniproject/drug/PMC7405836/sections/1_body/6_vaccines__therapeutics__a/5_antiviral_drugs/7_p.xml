<p>Among the evaluated compounds, 4-(cyclopent-1-en-3-ylamino)-5-[2-(4-iodophenyl)hydrazinyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol and 4-(cyclopent-1-en-3-ylamino)-5-[2-(4-chlorophenyl)hydrazinyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol were found to be the most potent. These compounds were used for 
 <italic>in silico</italic> studies, and molecular docking was accomplished into the active binding site of MERS-CoV helicase nsp13 (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Further studies are required for evaluating the therapeutic potential of these newly identified compounds in the management of COVID-19 infection.
