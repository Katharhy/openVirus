<p>All of these therapeutic approaches have revealed both

 <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-CoV potential. Although 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> research carried out with these therapeutics showed efficacy, most need appropriate support from randomized animal or human trials. Therefore, they might be of limited applicability and require trials against SARS-CoV-2 to gain practical usefulness. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 leads to the exacerbation of pneumonia as a consequence of the imbalance in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The virus-induced pulmonary inflammatory responses may be reduced by the administration of ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT1R) (
