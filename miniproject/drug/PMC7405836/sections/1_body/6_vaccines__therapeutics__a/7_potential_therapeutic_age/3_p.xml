<p>Several investigations have suggested the use of small-molecule inhibitors for the potential control of SARS-CoV infections. Drugs of the FDA-approved compound library were screened to identify four small-molecule inhibitors of MERS-CoV (chlorpromazine, chloroquine, loperamide, and lopinavir) that inhibited viral replication. These compounds also hinder SARS-CoV and human CoVs (

Therapeutic strategies involving the use of specific antibodies or compounds that neutralize cytokines and their receptors will help to restrain the host inflammatory responses. Such drugs acting specifically in the respiratory tract will help to reduce virus-triggered immune pathologies in COVID-19 (

The later stages of coronavirus-induced inflammatory cascades are characterized by the release of proinflammatory interleukin-1 (IL-1) family members, such as IL-1 and IL-33. Hence, there exists a possibility that the inflammation associated with coronavirus can be inhibited by utilizing anti-inflammatory cytokines that belong to the IL-1 family (

Hence, those drugs that modulate the biological activity of this protein, like ibuprofen, might have some therapeutic application in managing the disease (
