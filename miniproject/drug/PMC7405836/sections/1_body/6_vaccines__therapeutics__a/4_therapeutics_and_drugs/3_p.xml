<p>COVID-19 patients showing severe signs are treated symptomatically along with oxygen therapy. In such cases where the patients progress toward respiratory failure and become refractory to oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation is necessitated. The COVID-19-induced septic shock can be managed by providing adequate hemodynamic support (

Therapeutic agents that have anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity can be broadly classified into three categories: drugs that block virus entry into the host cell, drugs that block viral replication as well as its survival within the host cell, and drugs that attenuate the exaggerated host immune response (

Hence, they may benefit from the use of timely anti-inflammation treatment. Anti-inflammatory therapy using drugs like glucocorticoids, cytokine inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine should be done only after analyzing the risk/benefit ratio in COVID-19 patients (
 <xref rid="B301" ref-type="bibr">301</xref>). There have not been any studies concerning the application of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) to COVID-19-infected patients. However, reasonable pieces of evidence are available that link NSAID uses with the occurrence of respiratory and cardiovascular adverse effects. Hence, as a cautionary approach, it is better to recommend the use of NSAIDs as the first-line option for managing COVID-19 symptoms (

The guidelines that were put forward to manage critically ill adults suggest the use of systemic corticosteroids in mechanically ventilated adults with ARDS (
 <xref rid="B303" ref-type="bibr">303</xref>). The generalized use of corticosteroids is not indicated in COVID-19, since there are some concerns associated with the use of corticosteroids in viral pneumonia. Stem cell therapy using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is another hopeful strategy that can be used in clinical cases of COVID-19 owing to its potential immunomodulatory capacity. It may have a beneficial role in attenuating the cytokine storm that is observed in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby reducing mortality. Among the different types of MSCs, expanded umbilical cord MSCs can be considered a potential therapeutic agent that requires further validation for managing critically ill COVID-19 patients (
