<p>However, our previous attempts to develop a universal vaccine that is effective for both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV based on T-cell epitope similarity pointed out the possibility of cross-reactivity among coronaviruses (
 <xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>). That can be made possible by selected potential vaccine targets that are common to both viruses. SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be closely related to SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B174" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>). Hence, knowledge and understanding of S protein-based vaccine development in SARS-CoV will help to identify potential S protein vaccine candidates in SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, vaccine strategies based on the whole S protein, S protein subunits, or specific potential epitopes of S protein appear to be the most promising vaccine candidates against coronaviruses. The RBD of the S1 subunit of S protein has a superior capacity to induce neutralizing antibodies. This property of the RBD can be utilized for designing potential SARS-CoV vaccines either by using RBD-containing recombinant proteins or recombinant vectors that encode RBD (
 <xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>). Hence, the superior genetic similarity existing between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV can be utilized to repurpose vaccines that have proven 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> efficacy against SARS-CoV to be utilized for SARS-CoV-2. The possibility of cross-protection in COVID-19 was evaluated by comparing the S protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 with that of SARS-CoV. The comparative analysis confirmed that the variable residues were found concentrated on the S1 subunit of S protein, an important vaccine target of the virus (
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>). Hence, the possibility of SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies providing cross-protection to COVID-19 might be lower. Further genetic analysis is required between SARS-CoV-2 and different strains of SARS-CoV and SARS-like (SL) CoVs to evaluate the possibility of repurposed vaccines against COVID-19. This strategy will be helpful in the scenario of an outbreak, since much time can be saved, because preliminary evaluation, including 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, already would be completed for such vaccine candidates.
