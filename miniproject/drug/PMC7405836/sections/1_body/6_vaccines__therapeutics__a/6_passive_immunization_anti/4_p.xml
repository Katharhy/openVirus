<p>The exploration of fully human antibodies (human single-chain antibodies; HuscFvs) or humanized nanobodies (single-domain antibodies; sdAb, VH/VHH) could aid in blocking virus replication, as these agents can traverse the virus-infected cell membranes (transbodies) and can interfere with the biological characteristics of the replicating virus proteins. Such examples include transbodies to the influenza virus, hepatitis C virus, Ebola virus, and dengue virus (

Producing similar transbodies against intracellular proteins of coronaviruses, such as papain-like proteases (PLpro), cysteine-like protease (3CLpro), or other nsps, which are essential for replication and transcription of the virus, might formulate a practical move forward for a safer and potent passive immunization approach for virus-exposed persons and rendering therapy to infected patients.
