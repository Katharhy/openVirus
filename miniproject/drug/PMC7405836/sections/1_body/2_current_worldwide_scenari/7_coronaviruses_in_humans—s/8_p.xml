<p>The current scientific evidence available on MERS infection suggests that the significant reservoir host, as well as the animal source of MERS infection in humans, is the dromedary camels (

The infected dromedary camels may not show any visible signs of infection, making it challenging to identify animals actively excreting MERS-CoV that has the potential to infect humans. However, they may shed MERS-CoV through milk, urine, feces, and nasal and eye discharge and can also be found in the raw organs (
