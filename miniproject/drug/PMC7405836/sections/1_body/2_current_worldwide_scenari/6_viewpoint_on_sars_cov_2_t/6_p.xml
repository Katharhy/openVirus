<p>Even though individuals of all ages and sexes are susceptible to COVID-19, older people with an underlying chronic disease are more likely to become severely infected (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). Recently, individuals with asymptomatic infection were also found to act as a source of infection to susceptible individuals (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). Both the asymptomatic and symptomatic patients secrete similar viral loads, which indicates that the transmission capacity of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients is very high. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 transmission can happen early in the course of infection (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). Atypical clinical manifestations have also been reported in COVID-19 in which the only reporting symptom was fatigue. Such patients may lack respiratory signs, such as fever, cough, and sputum (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). Hence, the clinicians must be on the look-out for the possible occurrence of atypical clinical manifestations to avoid the possibility of missed diagnosis. The early transmission ability of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be similar to or slightly higher than that of SARS-CoV, reflecting that it could be controlled despite moderate to high transmissibility (
