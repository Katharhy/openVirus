<p>The novel coronavirus was identified within 1 month (28 days) of the outbreak. This is impressively fast compared to the time taken to identify SARS-CoV reported in Foshan, Guangdong Province, China (125 days) (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). Immediately after the confirmation of viral etiology, the Chinese virologists rapidly released the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, which played a crucial role in controlling the spread of this newly emerged novel coronavirus to other parts of the world (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). The possible origin of SARS-CoV-2 and the first mode of disease transmission are not yet identified (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). Analysis of the initial cluster of infections suggests that the infected individuals had a common exposure point, a seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). The restaurants of this market are well-known for providing different types of wild animals for human consumption (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). The Huanan South China Seafood Market also sells live animals, such as poultry, bats, snakes, and marmots (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). This might be the point where zoonotic (animal-to-human) transmission occurred (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Although SARS-CoV-2 is alleged to have originated from an animal host (zoonotic origin) with further human-to-human transmission (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), the likelihood of foodborne transmission should be ruled out with further investigations, since it is a latent possibility (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Additionally, other potential and expected routes would be associated with transmission, as in other respiratory viruses, by direct contact, such as shaking contaminated hands, or by direct contact with contaminated surfaces (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Still, whether blood transfusion and organ transplantation (
 <xref rid="B276" ref-type="bibr">276</xref>), as well as transplacental and perinatal routes, are possible routes for SARS-CoV-2 transmission needs to be determined (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>).
