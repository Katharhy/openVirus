  <p>S-gene SplitsTree analysis. Shown is the spike (S) glycoprotein gene-based phylogenetic analysis (SplitsTree 4.0) of SAR-CoV-2 isolates (39 isolates). The SARS-CoV-2 isolates were analyzed with related CoVs from past human outbreaks and of animal origin, including MERS-CoV, bovine coronavirus, canine coronavirus, bat coronaviruses, bat-SL-SARS-CoV, and equine CoV. The analysis includes all five defined subgenera of 
   <italic>Betacoronaviruses</italic>, namely, 
   <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic>, 
   <italic>Embecovirus</italic>, 
   <italic>Merbecovirus</italic>, 
   <italic>Nobecovirus</italic>, and 
   <italic>Hibecovirus</italic>. The isolates in the gray area are from the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 from around the world. The nearest neighbors of SARS-CoV-2 are the bat-SL-CoV, encircled in yellow.
