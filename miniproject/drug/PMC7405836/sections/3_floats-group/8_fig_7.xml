  <p>Coronavirus origins. Coronavirus is the most prominent example of an emerging virus that has crossed the species barrier from wild animals to humans, like SARS and MERS. The origin of SARS-CoV-2 is also suspected to be from an intermediate animal host. The possibility of crossing the species barrier again for the fourth time cannot be ruled out.</p>
