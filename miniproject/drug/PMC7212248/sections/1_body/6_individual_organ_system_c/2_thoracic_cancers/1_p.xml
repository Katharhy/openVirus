<p id="Par10">This cohort represents patients with a higher risk for deterioration of pulmonary function secondary to existing lung diseases, pneumonitis due to other infections, radiation pneumonitis, immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated pneumonia and tumour progression all which can mask an underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection. CT imaging is essential for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the absence of microbiological tests and the CT picture might be confusing in these patients. Hence, a careful history of exposure, along with strong index suspicion, is required to rule out COVID-19. Smoking, one of the commonest risk factors in lung cancer, has not been independently shown to affect the mortality in SARS-CoV-2 patient; however, pre-existing chronic obstructive lung disease is associated with increased mortality [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] reported post-operative mortality in one out of two patients with lung cancer, who were detected SARS-CoV-2-positive after surgery. Xin et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], Yan et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] have reported specific recommendations for the management of lung cancer in the COVID-19 epidemic, but these articles are published only in the Chinese language and hence difficult to interpret for others.
