<p id="Par8">The SARS-CoV-2 is shed in intestinal cells. Also, the human colorectal adenocarcinoma-derived LoVo cell line has been shown to be susceptible to SAR-CoV producing a sustainable infection which persists after multiple passages. Intestinal biopsies from infected patients have demonstrated viral particles on electron microscopy without any lytic effects or inclusion bodies on light microscopy [

Hence, any elective gastrointestinal surgery/endoscopic procedures can pose a threat of transmission to surgeons and health care workers. Cases that clearly require emergency intervention like obstruction, perforation and massive bleeding obviously cannot be deferred. Hu et al. [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and Chen et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] have reported their experience in managing colorectal and gastrointestinal malignancies during this pandemic and recommended stage-based treatment strategies. The American College of Surgeons [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] have also suggested their take on the same issue; however, these are based on expert opinion rather than any strong evidence.
