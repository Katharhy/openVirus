<p id="Par14">To summarise, in the absence of actual data on cancer surgery care during this pandemic, clinical decisions should be based on careful consideration of disease-related and patient-related factors. While some of the cancer surgeries can be safely delayed for some time, how long we can delay surgeries safely cannot be answered/explained by any means. Thorough evaluation and discussion by an expert and experienced multidisciplinary team appears to be the most effective way forward; however, the pandemic is likely to have an adverse impact on a number of cancer patients due to the inevitable delay caused in their treatment. In the future, while such pandemics may still crop up and cannot be prevented, the health care system and infrastructure should be boosted in anticipation, to combat illnesses such as cancer during these natural calamities.</p>
