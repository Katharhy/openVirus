<p id="Par11">Oropharyngeal malignancies pose a clear threat of aerosol exposure even with simple clinical examination. Elective surgery of the upper airways requiring mandatory post-operative assisted mechanical ventilation, elective tracheostomies and extensive reconstructions should be preferably be deferred on case-to-case basis. Direct and fibre optic laryngoscopy should be deferred. If it has to be done, then use adequate anaesthesia, avoid looking directly through the lens and attach a monitor. Neck node FNAC can be opted over endoscopic biopsy of hypopharyngeal/laryngeal malignancy wherever possible. Emergency tracheostomy is a very high-risk procedure, hence adequate PPE, use of adequate anaesthesia to abolish cough reflex, and use of cuffed (preferably double lumen) tubes to avoid repeated suctioning are necessary. There is currently no literature on experience from COVID-19 in head and neck malignancies, and there is a lack of clear recommendations on triage in these cases.</p>
