  <title>SARS-Cov spike glycoprotein.</title>
  <p>The coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 spike (S) glycoprotein is responsible for viral entry into the cell and it is the major target of antibody recognition. SARS-Cov-2 S is an ectodomain trimer. All three coronaviruses causing severe acuter respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov), Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 are closely related and contain a transmembrane spike, S, glycoprotein with two functional subunits able to bind the cells (S1 subunit) and responsible for fusion of the viral and cellular membrane (S2 subunit). SARS-Cov-2 spike S shows a closed and an open conformation (depicted), where only the closed conformation binds the human ACE2 receptor-binding domain. The structure shown was obtained by Cryo-EM (closed: PBD = 6VXX at 2.8 Å resolution; open: PBD = 6VYB at 3.2 Å resolution) was released on 11 March 2020 from Walls et al.
