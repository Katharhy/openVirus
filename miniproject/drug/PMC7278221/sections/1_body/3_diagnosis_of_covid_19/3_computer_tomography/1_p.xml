<p id="Par24">The COVID-19 patients presented some typical characteristics on the chest computed tomography (CT) image. Ground-glass opacity was the most frequent, with subsequent consolidations, air bronchogram, irregular or smooth interlobular septal thickening, and thickening of the nearby pleura, with predominantly lower and peripheral lobe involvement

In the early February, 2020, some experts in China suggested CT as one of the best clinical diagnostic criteria together with epidemiology, clinical, and laboratory characteristics to pronounce the clinically diagnosed COVID-19 when PCR tests were not available. Nonetheless, not all the patients had the typical chest CT images (e.g., asymptomatic COVID-19 cases). Absence of CT or radiographic abnormality was observed in as high as 17.9% patients with non-severe disease and in 2.9% cases with severe disease
