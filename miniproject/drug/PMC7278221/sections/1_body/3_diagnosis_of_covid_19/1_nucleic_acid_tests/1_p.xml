<p id="Par18">The definitive diagnosis of the disease relies on the identification of viral genomic RNA using either PCR-based technology or deep sequencing. The detailed PCR-based methods have been reviewed elsewhere

 </sup>. The presence of sufficient viral genome for amplification at the site of sample collection is the precondition of the tests. Therefore, collecting the appropriate specimen from patients at the right time using the adequate protocol is a key in diagnosis of the infection. Besides in the respiratory tract, viral particles have also been detected in the blood, lacrimal fluid, urine, and feces

 </sup>. In a recent study, the virus was detected in different types of samples, such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (93% positive), pharyngeal swabs (32%), fibrobronchoscope brush (46%), nasal swabs (63%), feces (29%), sputum (72%), and blood (1%)

 </sup>. However, the samples were not from the same patients at the same time, making it impossible to compare the sensitivity of the PCR test in different types of specimens.
