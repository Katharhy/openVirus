<p id="Par19">As a viral pneumonia, respiratory tract specimens from COVID-19 patients are first of choice to collect for the detection of viral nuclear acid. Collecting and testing upper respiratory specimens would be ideal considering the feasibility in clinical practice. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab are the optimal manner for swab viral testing. These samples can even be collected by patients themselves. Self-collected saliva specimens had been test and yield positive results in most of the infected patients, indicating that it is an adequate non-invasive test for monitoring and diagnosis of the infections

 </sup>. To increase the sensitivity of the diagnosis, it is preferably to collect multiple different types of specimens. However, negative naso-oro-pharyngeal swab could not completely rule out COVID-9 (ref.

 </sup>). Cases with repeated negative PCR for the virus in naso-oro-pharyngeal tests but positive in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples have been reported

 </sup>. It is therefore necessary to collect BALF via bronchoscopy in patients highly suspected of COVID-19, although this procedure could significantly increase the safety danger to healthcare personnel through the creation of aerosol droplets. This is an important issue, considering that in Italy alone, over 170 doctors have died so far!
