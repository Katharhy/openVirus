<p id="Par20">As soon as possible on the earliest days of symptoms, swabs should be collected from the upper respiratory tract. Recent studies showed that the viral load in the upper airway samples peaks within the first week and the virus was cleared at a median of 9 days from infection

 </sup>. Similar shedding patterns were seen for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV: RNA swab positivity was evident within the first week of MERS infection, while it peaked at 7–10 days after symptom onset in SARS. The dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in the lower respiratory tract specimens is still unclear. In MERS, MERS-CoV viral load peaked between week 2 and 3 in lower airways specimens, while the SARS-CoV RNA-positive rates in lower airways samples remained higher for 3 weeks after beginning of illness in SARS

 </sup>. It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 also shares a comparable viral shedding pattern in the lower respiratory tract specimens. This may explain why some patients progressed despite PCR turned negative in the upper respiratory specimens
