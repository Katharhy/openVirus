 </sup>. The median duration from symptoms onset to the first negative PCR results was 12 days in non-intensive care units group, as compared with 26 days in the ICU groups. In critical ill patients, the time of viral shedding can be as long as 52 days. The slower clearance of the virus in the critical ill patients might be explained by both higher viral load at baseline and impaired immune responses. In a recent study, the mean SARS-CoV-2 viral load of critical ill patients was circa 60 times higher than that of moderate cases, indicating that higher viral loads is linked to severe clinical outcomes

 </sup>. In addition, the critical ill patients also showed impaired immunity characterized by lymphopenia and lower CD4 T cell counts, which were associated with the duration of viral shedding

 </sup>. More importantly, SARS-CoV-2 isolated from feces was of replicability. Despite the uncertainty of transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in feces, it indeed challenged the quarantine given the high infectivity of the virus. Notably, PCR turned to be positive again in a small proportion of patients, although no infection cases of these close contactors had been reported. Therefore, we recommend that patients recovered and discharged should be continue to quarantine for another 14 days.
