<p id="Par13">In this review, we update the latest clinical characteristics, diagnosis strategies, as well as clinical management of the COVID-19 in China. We decided to compare the data of China and Italy because these were the first two countries hit by the pandemic at the highest level; therefore, this experience may be of relevance for other countries. Being the first two countries we feel appropriate to evaluate the evolution of the disease as well as the early result of the treatment, in order to offer a different baseline to other countries. It is also interesting to compare two countries, with a very significant difference in population, where the morbidity and mortality has been so different and unrelated to the size of the country.</p>
