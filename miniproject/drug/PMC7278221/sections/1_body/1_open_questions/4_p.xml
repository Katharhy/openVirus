<p id="Par12">The SARS-CoV-2 virus is structurally and functionally closely related to the other coronaviruses causing Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In particular, it is the external protein of the virus, the glycoprotein spike (S) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), that is able to bind and recognize the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), primed by the transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2), and/or CD147 (extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer), and therefore infect the host cells

The viral genomic sequences assembled from samples in Shanghai together with uploaded sequences in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID,

Based on current data, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have a mutation rate of around 25 mutations per year, which is much lower than that of influenza virus
