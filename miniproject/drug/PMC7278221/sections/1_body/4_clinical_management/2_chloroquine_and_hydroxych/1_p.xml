<p id="Par26">Chloroquine (CQ) and its related drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), both of which are well-known for their effectiveness in treating malarial and autoimmune diseases, have also recently been repurposed to treat COVID-19. In vitro studies showed that both CQ and HCQ were of excellent antiviral activity against SAR-CoV-2 with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.13 and 0.72 μM, respectively, which are reachable in humans when admitted

 </sup>. In fact, CQ and HCQ have been shown to have antiviral activities to different viruses including dengue virus, chikungunya virus, Ebola virus, etc. Any effect found has been limited to in vitro culture. There is no in vivo efficacy reported. Many randomized controlled trials are undergoing to evaluate the efficacy of CQ and HCQ in treating or even in preventing COVID-19. We completed the first randomized, control, open-label trial to evaluate the antiviral activity and safety of HCQ in treating COVID-19. Unfortunately, in this pilot study with 30 patients, we failed to observe any benefit of adding HCQ on top of the standard of care

More recently, a study was completed in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University with 62 COVID-19 patients
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. This study was based on a follow-up survey, showing that none of the 80 SLE patients who took long-term oral HCQ showed SARS-CoV-2 infection or appeared to have related symptoms. The study found that the cough remission time and the body temperature recovery time were strongly reduced in the HCQ treatment group. Over 80% (25 of 31) of the patients in HCQ treatment group showed improvement in pneumonia compared with the matched controls (54.8%, 17 of 31). Importantly, 61.3% of patients in the HCQ treated group showed significant pneumonia absorption. Among the 31 patients in the HCQ treated group, 2 of them had mild adverse reactions, one developed rash and one patient experienced a headache. Clearly, these results warrant further randomized, controlled studies. Remarkably, HCQ is a strong immune modulator and has been used widely for the therapy of systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. It exerts its effects likely through inhibiting the secretion of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 from macrophages/monocytes, which are a key cell population in ARDS development in COVID-19 patients. Thus HCQ application should be limited to patients who have started to develop or already developed ARDS. Since immune response at the early stage is critical for controlling infection and the antiviral effect of HCQ is still in question. In addition, the safety of CQ/HCQ should also be taken into consideration. CQ/HCQ are associated with cardiac arrhythmias, hypoglycemia, and neuropsychiatric effects
