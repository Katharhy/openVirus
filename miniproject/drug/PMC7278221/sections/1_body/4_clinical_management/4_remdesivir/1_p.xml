 <sub>90</sub> value of remdesivir versus SARS-CoV-2 was 1.76 μM, indicating its active concentration could likely be obtained in vivo

 </sup>. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial, remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement. However, when given with symptom duration of 10 days or less, patients receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo

 </sup>. This study was underpowered as it failed to enroll the estimated number of participants. However, preliminary results from another NIH clinical trial shows remdesivir was associated with 31% faster time to recovery from advanced COVID-19 and a marginal survival benefit, with a mortality rate of 8.0% for the group receiving remdesivir versus 11.6% for the placebo group (
