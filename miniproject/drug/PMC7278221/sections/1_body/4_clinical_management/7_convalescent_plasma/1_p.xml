<p id="Par33">Convalescent plasma is also a potentially promising strategy to treat COVID-19. In a recent case study, the clinical status of all the five critically ill COVID-19 patients receiving convalescent plasma showed a significant improvement within 1 week following the infusion, normalization of body temperature, as well as scores of the sequential organ failure assessment. Moreover, within 1â€“12 days following the infusion, the neutralizing antibody titers of the patients improved and the respiratory samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (ref.

 </sup>). In another study of 10 severe cases, the viral titers were undetectable following the infusion in seven patients who had previously high viremia

 </sup>. Previous studies on other respiratory viral diseases provided some evidences on the efficacy of convalescent plasma on treating severe and critical viral diseases. Several studies in SARS patients reported that the use of convalescent plasma was linked to reduced hospital stay and reduced mortality
