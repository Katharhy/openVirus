<p id="Par34">Nevertheless, there are still issues we need to tackle. The first question is when to collect plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients. Recent work by To et al.

 </sup> showed that, day 10 after symptom onset, both IgG and IgM antibodies increased in the majority of patients, while seroconversion was observed within the first 3 weeks. Importantly, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibody levels against the internal nucleoprotein and the spike S1 domain correlated with neutralizing activity. Therefore, it would be ideally to collect convalescent plasma from week 3 after symptom onset. Despite hundreds of patients had recovered from COVID-19, eligible convalescent plasma is quite limited as the donors have to pass physical and laboratory examination, and plasma should also be tested for SARS-CoV-2 nuclear acid, HIV-1, HBV, and HCV, as well as antibody titers, to list a few. The second question is deciding which patients and when should receive the convalescent plasma. The effects of convalescent plasma are difficult to observed when used in critical patients with multiple organ failure, as the viral load in this kind of population is quite high. Hence it is preferably to use convalescent plasma in mild patients whose diseases was deteriorating in their early phase of diseases. Normally, in COVID-19, the viral load peaked at the first week of illness, and then slowly decline during the subsequent week

 </sup>. Accordingly, in principle, the most effective to administer the convalescent plasma is at the early phases of the disease. The biggest challenge is that it is quite difficult to identify which patient will deteriorate in the early stage. Several risk factors including older age, male, multiple comorbidities, elevated IL-6, and elevation in D-dimer levels that are associated with bad outcomes may be used as surrogate markers

 </sup>. Provided further studies demonstrate its efficacy in appropriately selected patients, the next step would be the production of humanized antibody at biotechnological level.
