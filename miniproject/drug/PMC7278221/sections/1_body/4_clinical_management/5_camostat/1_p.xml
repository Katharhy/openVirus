 </sup> showed the specificity of the serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate as an active compond against TMPRSS2 which is required for viral infection. Camostat mesylate seems rather specific, since SARS-Cov-2 infection requires TMPRSS2 for the priming of the viral S protein. Clinical trial of camostat mesylate or its derivatives are therefore required
