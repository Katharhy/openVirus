<p id="Par35">It is still not clear why some patients progressed while others recovered, which underlying biological marker would be of essential benefit for the management of the patients. Indeed, several reports are still in wide contrast. The duration from onset of symptoms to viral clearance is significantly longer in severe and critical ill SARS-CoV-2-infected patients compared with that in the mild cases

 </sup>. Notably, elevated level of a bundle of pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed in severe and critical ill patients, which include interferon-γ inducible protein 10, interleukin (IL)−2, IL-7, IL-6, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (refs.
