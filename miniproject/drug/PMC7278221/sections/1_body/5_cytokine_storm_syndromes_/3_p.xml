<p id="Par37">Many therapeutic drugs are now available to suppress immune response. Among these drugs, corticosteroid is the most widely used. However, the utility of corticosteroid in treating COVID-19 is still debating. Most guidelines on COVID-19 currently do not recommend application of corticosteroid as data are very limited. On the one hand, corticosteroid apparently delay clearance of MERS-CoV from respiratory tract and SARS-CoV from blood, respectively

 </sup>. On the other hand, clinical studies reported that low or physiologic dose of corticosteroids treatment could have clinical benefits to earlier reversal of shock, shorter stay in ICU, and less mechanical ventilation although it did not reduce mortality caused by primary lung infections
