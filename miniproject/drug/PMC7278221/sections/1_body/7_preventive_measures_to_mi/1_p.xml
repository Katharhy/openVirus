<p id="Par41">Some models had attempted to quantify the impact of different strategies to prevent the potential spread of COVID-19 that should be carefully considered for policy makers in planning the next steps. In interpreting these models, we should keep in mind that they assume that variations in the replication rate of SARS-CoV-2 - an evaluation of transmission - are an immediate response to the interventions implemented, rather than broader gradual behavioral changes. While first models, however, addressed a set of variables before locking down, on the number of cases and avoided deaths, more recently new models are struggling to predict the effect of gradual normalization of public life of different strategies. In fact, despite the fact that in Italy, Spain, and Germany the increase in number of new SARS-CoV-2 infections has been reducing in recent days, the political measures (on early April 2020) for restricting contacts at national level continue to be in place. In a recent report from the Leopoldina Nationale Akademia der Wissenchaften

Assuming, if optimally implemented, that the rate of new infections caused by an distinct person could be lower than 1.0, the aforementioned measures might strongly impact in reducing further spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a simultaneous gradual relaxation of restrictive measures imposed on public life
