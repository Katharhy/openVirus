Since its first report in December 2019, despite great efforts made in almost every country worldwide, this disease continues to spread globally, especially in most parts of Europe, Iran, and the United States. Here, we update the recent understanding in clinical characteristics, diagnosis strategies, as well as clinical management of COVID-19 in China as compared to Italy, with the purpose to integrate the China experience with the global efforts to outline references for prevention, basic research, treatment as well as final control of the disease. Being the first two countries we feel appropriate to evaluate the evolution of the disease as well as the early result of the treatment, in order to offer a different baseline to other countries. It is also interesting to compare two countries, with a very significant difference in population, where the morbidity and mortality has been so different, and unrelated to the size of the country.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Viral infection</kwd><kwd>Respiratory tract diseases</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Facts</title><p id="Par2">

Figures <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> show the current set of data of the pandemic, with a special attention to China and Italy. With the great efforts mostly based on strict containment measures, China has successfully emerged out of the first wave of the epidemic at the beginning of April 2020, when the social order slowly returned to the norms. Although different precautionary measures have been taken at national level in the EU to limit and to monitor the entrance of potential COVID-19 cases from China, the first symptomatic cases have been reported before the end of February in a number of EU countries including Italy, Spain, Germany, and, just weeks later, UK. In this context, Italy is one of the first and hardest hit country in Europe, with over 219,000 cases and 30,500 deaths reported.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Spread and dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic.</title><p>Spread and dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic on a worldwide scale (<bold>a</bold>), source Worldmeter (www.worldmeters.info), and on Italy (<bold>b</bold>), modified with permission from <italic>PNAS USA</italic>, 2020. 10.1073/pnas.2004978117.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41419_2020_2603_Fig1_HTML" id="d30e399"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>COVID-19 pandemic in different countries.</title><p>Cumulative numbers of cases (<bold>a</bold>) and deaths (<bold>b</bold>) in China, European, and the United States.

Based on current data, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have a mutation rate of around 25 mutations per year, which is much lower than that of influenza virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.

Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> compares the major characteristics of COVID-19 in China versus Italy. Patients in Italy were more older compared to patients in China, with more numbers of comorbidities. The number and severity of these co-morbidity has been a major factor influencing the outcome; this was particularly evident where the virus diffused into old pension homes. Indeed, while the mortality was 3.1% in Italy, with the exception of the Milan area (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) where it was 6.8%, within the residences for old people it peaked to 24% (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.epicentro.iss.it/">https://www.epicentro.iss.it/</ext-link>). In this case, out of 3859 death, only 133 were confirmed by swabs, while 1310 had all symptoms but they were not tested. Disease severity was strongly age dependent, primarily due to the presence of comorbidities. Therefore, the proportions of severe and critical patients in Italy were higher than that in China, partially leading to a higher mortality.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Asymptomatic patients</title><p id="Par17">A proportion of the patients showed no symptoms at enrollment as they were at very early stage of the diseases. These patients could either recover without developing symptom or would continue to develop symptoms. However, the former group of patients never have any symptoms or signs, but their respiratory tract specimens are PCR positive for the virus. The exact number of the proportion of asymptomatic patients requires longitudinal study with repeated PCR tests. In a study that followed 13 patients in Wuhan, China, 31% of them never developed symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In another study performed on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, repeated PCR testing of 3711 quarantined passengers and crew members showed that asymptomatic proportion is around 18%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. More recently, the proportion of infected people have mild or asymptomatic were estimated to represent some 60% of all infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Notably, asymptomatic and symptomatic patients show comparable viral load, suggesting that these patients have strong transmission potentials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Indeed, viral transmission from asymptomatic carriers have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In a recent study from China, Chen et al. followed up 2147 close contactors of 191 patients (161 symptomatic and 30 asymptomatic). They found that the infection rates of transmission rate in symptomatic cases was 6.3% comparing with 4.1% in asymptomatic patients, indicating the importance of identification and isolation of asymptomatic patients in the effort of containment the spread of the virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Importantly, for large-scale screening, antibody testing should be combined with PCR to avoid asymptomatic viral spreading.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Diagnosis of COVID-19</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Nucleic acid tests</title><p id="Par18">The definitive diagnosis of the disease relies on the identification of viral genomic RNA using either PCR-based technology or deep sequencing. The detailed PCR-based methods have been reviewed elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The presence of sufficient viral genome for amplification at the site of sample collection is the precondition of the tests. Therefore, collecting the appropriate specimen from patients at the right time using the adequate protocol is a key in diagnosis of the infection. Besides in the respiratory tract, viral particles have also been detected in the blood, lacrimal fluid, urine, and feces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In a recent study, the virus was detected in different types of samples, such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (93% positive), pharyngeal swabs (32%), fibrobronchoscope brush (46%), nasal swabs (63%), feces (29%), sputum (72%), and blood (1%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, the samples were not from the same patients at the same time, making it impossible to compare the sensitivity of the PCR test in different types of specimens.</p><p id="Par19">As a viral pneumonia, respiratory tract specimens from COVID-19 patients are first of choice to collect for the detection of viral nuclear acid. Collecting and testing upper respiratory specimens would be ideal considering the feasibility in clinical practice. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab are the optimal manner for swab viral testing. These samples can even be collected by patients themselves. Self-collected saliva specimens had been test and yield positive results in most of the infected patients, indicating that it is an adequate non-invasive test for monitoring and diagnosis of the infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. To increase the sensitivity of the diagnosis, it is preferably to collect multiple different types of specimens. However, negative naso-oro-pharyngeal swab could not completely rule out COVID-9 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>). Cases with repeated negative PCR for the virus in naso-oro-pharyngeal tests but positive in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. It is therefore necessary to collect BALF via bronchoscopy in patients highly suspected of COVID-19, although this procedure could significantly increase the safety danger to healthcare personnel through the creation of aerosol droplets. This is an important issue, considering that in Italy alone, over 170 doctors have died so far!</p><p id="Par20">As soon as possible on the earliest days of symptoms, swabs should be collected from the upper respiratory tract. Recent studies showed that the viral load in the upper airway samples peaks within the first week and the virus was cleared at a median of 9 days from infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Similar shedding patterns were seen for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV: RNA swab positivity was evident within the first week of MERS infection, while it peaked at 7&#x02013;10 days after symptom onset in SARS. The dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in the lower respiratory tract specimens is still unclear. In MERS, MERS-CoV viral load peaked between week 2 and 3 in lower airways specimens, while the SARS-CoV RNA-positive rates in lower airways samples remained higher for 3 weeks after beginning of illness in SARS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 also shares a comparable viral shedding pattern in the lower respiratory tract specimens. This may explain why some patients progressed despite PCR turned negative in the upper respiratory specimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">Despite the high accuracy of the PCR tests, these nucleic acid tests highly depend on the procedures of sample collecting, in addition to high labor and time costing. The test protocol is generally expensive and complex, and therefore difficult to be broadly applied in resource limited locations. Transferring samples to a central laboratory not only decrease the accuracy of the tests either by sample decay due to incorrect storage or contamination but also further delay the test results. A false-positive test could result in an unnecessary quarantine and therapy while a false-negative diagnosis may allow infected patients to spread the virus. Therefore, other methods are also needed to serve as a supplement. Most importantly, as the virus spreading many healthcare personnel have caused wanton community transmission before correct testing allowed isolation and tracking. Therefore, tests that are able to be scaled up quickly are urgently needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Serological tests</title><p id="Par22">Serological assays detect both SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies IgM, IgA, and IgG, which are produced both at the early and later phases of the disease, respectively. Unlike PCR tests, antibody tests could be less accurate and require longer time to be established as routine tests. However, serological tests are portable, user-friendly, and can produce results in 10&#x02013;30&#x02009;min at least at the qualitative level. Moreover, they request very limited sample volume: one drop of blood from a pinprick is sufficient to detect the antibodies. Therefore, they can be established as decentralized point-of-care (POC) tests. In a cohort comprised of 82 confirmed and 58 probable (qPCR test is negative despite other indications of COVID-19 including symptoms and epidemiology) COVID-19 cases, the positive detection rate is extremely high (98.6%) when PCR is performed in conjunction with IgM ELISA for every patient as compared to qPCR analysis alone (51.9%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Therefore, the serological tests could be used together with nuclei acid detection to increase the sensitivity of tests. In China, some of these kits have received fast-track approval from the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). In the USA, only one serological test has been approved by the date of submission. These tests are of good accuracy with sensitivity range from 87.3% to 97.2% and specificity range from 95.6% to 100%. The detailed serological tests has been reviewed elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">However, the sensitivity of serological assays is influenced by both the time of sample collection as well as human immune response status. In the study by Guo et al., as high as 22.0% (18/82) of the PCR confirmed cases were found to be negative by an IgM antibody tests. Most of the COVID-19 patients were able to generate antibody within 10 days after symptoms onset. Suspected patients who tested IgM/IgG negative in their early phase of disease could have repeated IgM/IgG tests<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, if nucleic acid tests are not available. In addition, the serological assays can also provide historic information about viral exposure, which are important for epidemiology studies.

Nonetheless, not all the patients had the typical chest CT images (e.g., asymptomatic COVID-19 cases).

There is no in vivo efficacy reported. Many randomized controlled trials are undergoing to evaluate the efficacy of CQ and HCQ in treating or even in preventing COVID-19. We completed the first randomized, control, open-label trial to evaluate the antiviral activity and safety of HCQ in treating COVID-19. Unfortunately, in this pilot study with 30 patients, we failed to observe any benefit of adding HCQ on top of the standard of care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. However, more recently, another study from France showed that HCQ was effective against SARS-CoV-2, especially when combined with azithromycin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. These two studies were both limited by the small sample size. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has launched a trial to investigate the effectiveness of CQ in COVID-19 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-continues-facilitate-development-treatments">https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-continues-facilitate-development-treatments</ext-link>). More recently, a study was completed in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University with 62 COVID-19 patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. This study was based on a follow-up survey, showing that none of the 80 SLE patients who took long-term oral HCQ showed SARS-CoV-2 infection or appeared to have related symptoms. The study found that the cough remission time and the body temperature recovery time were strongly reduced in the HCQ treatment group. Over 80% (25 of 31) of the patients in HCQ treatment group showed improvement in pneumonia compared with the matched controls (54.8%, 17 of 31). Importantly, 61.3% of patients in the HCQ treated group showed significant pneumonia absorption. Among the 31 patients in the HCQ treated group, 2 of them had mild adverse reactions, one developed rash and one patient experienced a headache. Clearly, these results warrant further randomized, controlled studies. Remarkably, HCQ is a strong immune modulator and has been used widely for the therapy of systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. It exerts its effects likely through inhibiting the secretion of IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-6 from macrophages/monocytes, which are a key cell population in ARDS development in COVID-19 patients. Thus HCQ application should be limited to patients who have started to develop or already developed ARDS. Since immune response at the early stage is critical for controlling infection and the antiviral effect of HCQ is still in question. In addition, the safety of CQ/HCQ should also be taken into consideration. CQ/HCQ are associated with cardiac arrhythmias, hypoglycemia, and neuropsychiatric effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Therefore, these compounds should not be recommended for mild patients or for prevention purpose, at least for now.</p><p id="Par27">Moreover, the combination of HCQ with antibiotic drug azithromycin has been reported to have added benefit. Since azithromycin is known to reversibly binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit of the 70S ribosome to inhibit the translocation step of protein synthesis, whether it has antiviral effect is not known. It is also not known whether azithromycin synergize with HCQ to provide better antiviral activity. A recent prospective study failed to find antiviral activity or clinical benefit of this combination for the treatment of our hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>). Further investigations are needed. Needless to say, at late stage of ARDS, controlling secondary bacterial infection should not take lightly.</p><p id="Par28">In addition to treatment, CQ/HCQ has also been suggested for prophylaxis of COVID-19 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>).

The combination of LPV/r with additional ribavirin was reported to be able to reduce the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality in SARS patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, LPV/r and interferon &#x003b2; were found to have better efficacy compared with controls for MERS-CoV infection in animal experiments and case reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. LPV/r was therefore repurposed to treat COVID-19, as SARS-CoV-2 was genetically close to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. However, in a retrospective study with 134 patients (more than 95% patients were mild cases), we recently find that administration of LPV/r along with interferon alpha inhaling was not associated with faster virological clearance or clinical improvement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. More recently, a randomized, controlled study conducted in Wuhan, China also failed to identify beneficial effect of LPV/r beyond standard therapy in hospitalized patients with severe Covid-19 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>). More importantly, in another randomized control study with a small sample size, LPV/r was associated with adverse events not only failed to show antiviral activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Based on these available data, it is likely that LPV/r and other HIV-1 protease inhibitors including darunavir are not effective in treating COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Remdesivir</title><p id="Par30">Another promising drug is the adenosine analog remdesivir (GS-5734) that is incorporated into nascent viral RNA chains where it causes a pre-mature termination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Remdesivir is also an experimental drug that was generated for the therapy of the Ebola viral infection. Notably, remdesivir has shown antiviral efficacy in treating SARS and MERS in animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Recently, in vitro study showed that, in Vero E6 cells, EC<sub>90</sub> value of remdesivir versus SARS-CoV-2 was 1.76&#x02009;&#x003bc;M, indicating its active concentration could likely be obtained in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques, therapeutic remdesivir treatment was found to reduce viral load when given early<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. In the USA, the first COVID-19 patient was treated with intravenous remdesivir and recovered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. In a recent cohort of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, compassionate-use remdesivir was associated with clinical improvement in 36 of 53 patients (68%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial, remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement. However, when given with symptom duration of 10 days or less, patients receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. This study was underpowered as it failed to enroll the estimated number of participants. However, preliminary results from another NIH clinical trial shows remdesivir was associated with 31% faster time to recovery from advanced COVID-19 and a marginal survival benefit, with a mortality rate of 8.0% for the group receiving remdesivir versus 11.6% for the placebo group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.059)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>.

In a recent case study, the clinical status of all the five critically ill COVID-19 patients receiving convalescent plasma showed a significant improvement within 1 week following the infusion, normalization of body temperature, as well as scores of the sequential organ failure assessment. Moreover, within 1&#x02013;12 days following the infusion, the neutralizing antibody titers of the patients improved and the respiratory samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>). In another study of 10 severe cases, the viral titers were undetectable following the infusion in seven patients who had previously high viremia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. Previous studies on other respiratory viral diseases provided some evidences on the efficacy of convalescent plasma on treating severe and critical viral diseases. Several studies in SARS patients reported that the use of convalescent plasma was linked to reduced hospital stay and reduced mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Clinical trials also showed that in patients with severe H1N1 influenza A, in the 2009 pandemic, therapy with convalescent plasma from patients who recovered, especially within 5 days of symptom onset, resulted in a lower viral load and lower mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. Subsequent analysis showed that the mortality of patients with severe acute viral respiratory infections was reduced after therapy with convalescent plasma, while absence of adverse events or complications were observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par34">Nevertheless, there are still issues we need to tackle. The first question is when to collect plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients. Recent work by To et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> showed that, day 10 after symptom onset, both IgG and IgM antibodies increased in the majority of patients, while seroconversion was observed within the first 3 weeks. Importantly, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibody levels against the internal nucleoprotein and the spike S1 domain correlated with neutralizing activity. Therefore, it would be ideally to collect convalescent plasma from week 3 after symptom onset. Despite hundreds of patients had recovered from COVID-19, eligible convalescent plasma is quite limited as the donors have to pass physical and laboratory examination, and plasma should also be tested for SARS-CoV-2 nuclear acid, HIV-1, HBV, and HCV, as well as antibody titers, to list a few. The second question is deciding which patients and when should receive the convalescent plasma. The effects of convalescent plasma are difficult to observed when used in critical patients with multiple organ failure, as the viral load in this kind of population is quite high. Hence it is preferably to use convalescent plasma in mild patients whose diseases was deteriorating in their early phase of diseases. Normally, in COVID-19, the viral load peaked at the first week of illness, and then slowly decline during the subsequent week<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Accordingly, in principle, the most effective to administer the convalescent plasma is at the early phases of the disease. The biggest challenge is that it is quite difficult to identify which patient will deteriorate in the early stage. Several risk factors including older age, male, multiple comorbidities, elevated IL-6, and elevation in D-dimer levels that are associated with bad outcomes may be used as surrogate markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Provided further studies demonstrate its efficacy in appropriately selected patients, the next step would be the production of humanized antibody at biotechnological level.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Cytokine storm syndromes and its management</title><p id="Par35">It is still not clear why some patients progressed while others recovered, which underlying biological marker would be of essential benefit for the management of the patients. Indeed, several reports are still in wide contrast. The duration from onset of symptoms to viral clearance is significantly longer in severe and critical ill SARS-CoV-2-infected patients compared with that in the mild cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Notably, elevated level of a bundle of pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed in severe and critical ill patients, which include interferon-&#x003b3; inducible protein 10, interleukin (IL)&#x02212;2, IL-7, IL-6, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-&#x003b1;, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>). More importantly, in a recent retrospective, multicenter study conducted in Wuhan, China, increased plasma levels of ferritin and IL-6 were identified as predictors of fatality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 induced excessive and abnormal non-effective response that leads to organ dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. The inflammation persists in some patients despite the viral clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. Taken together, these evidences support the importance of dampening the overly exuberant immune responses besides antiviral therapy in reducing the mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>, as we discussed previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par36">The dual role of the immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup> is crucial and still under investigation to clarify the strength and duration of the immune response both for the perspective of post-infection protection and re-infection, but also, and most relevant, for the efficacy of the future vaccine.</p><p id="Par37">Many therapeutic drugs are now available to suppress immune response. Among these drugs, corticosteroid is the most widely used. However, the utility of corticosteroid in treating COVID-19 is still debating. Most guidelines on COVID-19 currently do not recommend application of corticosteroid as data are very limited. On the one hand, corticosteroid apparently delay clearance of MERS-CoV from respiratory tract and SARS-CoV from blood, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. On the other hand, clinical studies reported that low or physiologic dose of corticosteroids treatment could have clinical benefits to earlier reversal of shock, shorter stay in ICU, and less mechanical ventilation although it did not reduce mortality caused by primary lung infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>. In patients with severe H1N1-illness, low dose of corticosteroids also lead to lower mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>. Several clinical trials are now in progress to evaluate the benefit of corticosteroids in treating COVID-19. When waiting for the results, proper use of low-dose corticosteroids at the right time might has survival advantages for severe/critically ill patients with COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par38">CQ and HCQ might also be able to modulate the over activated immune response. They alter the pH and disrupt autophagy and lysosomal activity, destabilize membrane, and disrupt signaling pathways and transcriptional activity, subsequently inhibiting antigen presentation, immune activation, MHC class II expression, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines, and deregulation of co-stimulatory molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup>. However, whether its suppression on the immune response may lead to delay of SARS-CoV-2 clearance is still unclear. In some viral diseases including HIV infection, HCQ administration was associated with increased viral replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par39">Other therapeutic drugs that under investigation include the IL-1 inhibitor, IL-6 inhibitor, and JAK-STAT signal pathway inhibitors. Treatment with IL-1 blockade, in a phase 3 randomized controlled trial in sepsis patients with macrophage activation syndrome, resulted in a drastic improvement in the 28-day survival rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>. IL-6 inhibitor, which was used as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and CRS associated with CAR-T cell therapies for cancer, has now repurposed to treating COVID-19 in severe and critical patients as recommended by a Chinese government guideline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref></sup>.

Upstream of that, the treatment with inhibitors of TNF-&#x003b2; could be applied, but there are no data available so far.

The median duration from symptoms onset to the first negative PCR results was 12 days in non-intensive care units group, as compared with 26 days in the ICU groups. In critical ill patients, the time of viral shedding can be as long as 52 days. The slower clearance of the virus in the critical ill patients might be explained by both higher viral load at baseline and impaired immune responses. In a recent study, the mean SARS-CoV-2 viral load of critical ill patients was circa 60 times higher than that of moderate cases, indicating that higher viral loads is linked to severe clinical outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref></sup>.

Despite the uncertainty of transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in feces, it indeed challenged the quarantine given the high infectivity of the virus.

In interpreting these models, we should keep in mind that they assume that variations in the replication rate of SARS-CoV-2 - an evaluation of transmission - are an immediate response to the interventions implemented, rather than broader gradual behavioral changes. While first models, however, addressed a set of variables before locking down, on the number of cases and avoided deaths, more recently new models are struggling to predict the effect of gradual normalization of public life of different strategies. In fact, despite the fact that in Italy, Spain, and Germany the increase in number of new SARS-CoV-2 infections has been reducing in recent days, the political measures (on early April 2020) for restricting contacts at national level continue to be in place. In a recent report from the Leopoldina Nationale Akademia der Wissenchaften<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref></sup>, authors concluded that in addition to the current recommendations (hygiene, physical distancing), also nose and mouth protection, testing, use of digital data and targeted quarantine should be reinforced, see Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and also ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref></sup>.

While waiting for an effective vaccine for COVID-19 and for a clear specific treatment, current management is highly depended on supportive therapy. The best way to reduce the mortality is therefore related first of all to risk reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This might be achieved by combining six main actions: social distance, masks, hygiene recommendations, contact tracing, extensive use of early diagnosis tools, and confirmed and suspected cases quarantine.
