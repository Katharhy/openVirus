<p id="para20">Although the final reckoning of the 2020 milestone cannot be made until next year, 2019 figures reveal that key targets are a long way from being met. Worldwide, 81% of people living with HIV are diagnosed, 82% of people diagnosed are on treatment, and 88% of people on treatment have viral suppression. This means that globally 59% of people with HIV are virally suppressed, a substantial shortfall from the 73% expected under 90-90-90. Figures reveal great disparities. Successes include eSwatini and Switzerland, which have achieved 85% viral suppression among people living with HIV, the target under the 95-95-95 goals for 2030. 12 other countries have met the 90-90-90 goals: Australia, Botswana, Cambodia, Ireland, Namibia, the Netherlands, Rwanda, Spain, Thailand, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Although some countries are making great strides for people at risk of and living with HIV, many are not. Indeed, whole regions are seeing worsening HIV epidemics, growing inequalities, and increasing stigma affecting those most at risk.</p>
