<p>The COVID-19 E-protein is a short and integral membrane protein that contains 76-109 amino acids, size ranging between 8.4 and 12 kDa, consist of 35 α-helices and 40 loops. The protein has short hydrophilic amino terminus consisting of 7–12 amino acids, followed by a large hydrophobic transmembrane domain of 25 amino acids long hydrophilic C-terminal domain (shown in box). The hydrophobic region can generate oligomerization and form an ion-conductive pore in membranes, it plays a significant role in the assembly of the viral genome. This protein is involved in several aspects of the virus life cycle, such as assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis (Schoeman &amp; Fielding, 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). E protein’s ion channel activity is found in the transmembrane region of the protein (Verdiá-Báguena et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Wilson et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The membrane potential has been regulated by E-protein controlling the ion flow between the intracellular and extracellular environment. The ion conductivity triggered by E-protein via the manipulation of COVID-19 genome seems to be a novel route involved in virus pathogenesis. Although, the E-protein has been interacted with other coronavirus proteins as well as host cell proteins. E-protein’s ion channel activity and the alteration of coronavirus cell ion balance by E-protein is a necessary process for virus production but the effect of E-protein ion channel activity in virus pathogenesis remains elusive.
