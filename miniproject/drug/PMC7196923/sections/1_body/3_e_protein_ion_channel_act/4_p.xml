<p>Few efforts have been found that mutation of the E-protein in the extracellular membrane could disrupt the ion-conductivity and the normal viral assembly (Torres et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Verdiá-Báguena et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), hence control the E protein dynamics is a promising target for preventing pathogenesis associated with the COVID-19 (Pervushin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). For example, Nieto-torres et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) have demonstrated that, Mice infected with COVID-19 viruses exhibited E-protein ion channel activity, with wild-type E-protein sequence, that restored ion transport, resulting in the mice death with the loss of weight. In contrast, mice infected with mutant E-protein showed lack of ion channel activity and has result they recovered from the disease and most survived. This evidence confirmed that ion channel activity correlated well with the virus growth. The strong E-protein ion channel activity is generated a higher chance for the mortality of mice is observed. Hence, inhibitor target to E-protein process can help to prevent virus production. In this respect, Wilson et al., showed that hexamethylene amiloride inhibitor has shown to block the E-protein ion channel conductance in cell membrane and inhibits replication of the parent coronavirus in cultured cells (Wilson et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Recently, Gupta et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) have identified the medicinal properties of Belachinal, Macaflavanone E and Vibsanol B inhibitors which are successfully passed the ADMET test and Lipinski’s rule 5 s. These compounds are reduced the random motion of the human COVID-19 E protein in terms of inhibiting the function of the human “COVID-19 E” protein. So far, our understanding about the mechanism of the E-protein ion channel activity in the viral assembly is an ongoing debate. This is one of the most important research topics to investigated which deals with E-protein ion channel activity in viral production to reduce the mortality rate of diseased human by deletion of E-protein by inhibitor.
