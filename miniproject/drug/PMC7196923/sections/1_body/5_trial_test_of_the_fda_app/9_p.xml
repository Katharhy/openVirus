Based on the report, Gromica et al., (Muralidharan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) have utilized computational docking approach to analysed the effect of synergism of these drugs against the COVID-19 main protease. They found that the combination of three drugs, lopinavir, oseltamivir and ritonavir, showed a better binding energy than that of individual drug, and they reported the protein in complexed with three drugs are stable during the simulations.
