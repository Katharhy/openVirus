<p>Mulangu et al. (2019) have conducted a trial of four investigational therapies for Ebola virus diseased patients. A total of 681 patients were registered between November 18, 2018 and August 9, 2019. The patients were assigned 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive ZMapp (a triple monoclonal antibody agent), remdesivir (a nucleotide analogue RNA polymerase inhibitor), Mab114 (a single human monoclonal antibody derived from an Ebola survivor), and REGN-EB3 (a coformulated mixture of three human IgG1 monoclonal antibodies). Both Mab114 and REGN-EB3 groups were superior than ZMAP and remdesivir group in reducing mortality for Ebola patients, primary groups have faster rate of viral clearance than later groups. Remdesivir has been promised antiviral drug against RNA viruses, including SARS/MERS, in cultured cell, mice and nonhuman primate model (Sheahan et al., 2017). It is under the clinical development for Ebola virus treatment and typically it is distributed in the entire human body including lung after oral administration. Sheahan et al. (2017) tested a Remdesivir inhibitor that has shown activity against Ebola virus as a potential agent to be used to combat coronaviruses. Unfortunately, it could not be help to Ebola patients during the 2019 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A coronavirus research at the university of Iowa suggested that Remdesivir antiviral acting much more potential if patient takes it early, patients with mild symptoms (Kai Kupferschmidt &amp; Cohen,
