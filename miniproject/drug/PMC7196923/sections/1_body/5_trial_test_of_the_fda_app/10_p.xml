<p>The CPAM (china international exchange and promotive association for medical and health care) recommends to take lopinavir 400 mg, ritonavir 100 mg (two tablets by mouth twice in daily) or chloroquine (500 mg tablet by mouth twice in daily) for older patients or patients with under underlying conditions and serious symptoms. In case chloroquine is unavailable, consider to use of hydroxychloroquine (400 mg by mouth once daily). It cannot be recommended to take ribavirin and interferon drug because of the high risk for side effects but these drugs may be considered if treatment with lopinavir, ritonavir, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are ineffective (Chu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Gao et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Huang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Y. H. Jin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). To this end, some drugs have become promises, other are being ruled out including lopinavir and ritonavir, mix of two drugs used to treat HIV disease. So far, trial test results are confirmed as FDA-approved therapeutics or drugs have not helped to treat, cure or prevent COVID-19.
