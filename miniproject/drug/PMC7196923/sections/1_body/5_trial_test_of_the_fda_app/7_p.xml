They have examined a total of 36 patients, 20 hydroxychloroquine-treated patients and 16 control patients. Among hydroxychloroquine-treated patients, six patients received azithromycin with 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg per day for the next four days. At day 6, 100% patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination have cured comparing with 57.1% in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine only, and 12.5% in the control group. Finally, they found that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination have cured the COVID-19 patients but the drawback of this study is used a very small size of survey.
