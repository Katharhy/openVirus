<p>Nowadays, the drug repurposing has been used to identify potential drugs against coronavirus. Enormous efforts have been paid for the ability to reuse FDA approved/preclinical trial drugs for the disease. In the literature, we find several promised drugs candidate targeted to multiple virus protein (Graham et al.,

 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). The WHO has provided the permission to doctors and scientist carry out the trial test with the combination of different FDA-approved drugs for COVID-19 treatment. In the view of urgency and current need, to reduce the cost, time and risks of the drug development process, scientists are involved in reusing already approved drug candidates to test in COVID-19 patients. In a short time, the response of the scientific community is such that involve enormous efforts to develop a novel therapy and treatment. For example, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, old drugs, have been used to treat malarial, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and sun allergies for more than sixty years. The activity of hydroxychloroquine on viruses is probably same as that of chloroquine since the mechanism of the action of these two molecules is identical. Chloroquine as an antimalarial and autoimmune disease drugs has shown a synergistically enhancing effect as antiviral drugs

This may negatively influence-receptor binding and abrogate the infection, with further ramifications by the elevation of vesicular pH, resulting the spread of SARSCov in cell culture has been prevented (Vincent et al.,
