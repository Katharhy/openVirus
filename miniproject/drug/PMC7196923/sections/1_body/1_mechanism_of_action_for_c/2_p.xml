<p>Human have long been infected by coronavirus as it is one of those responsible for the common cold. It is a contagious viral infection that can be spread through inhalation or ingestion of viral droplets as a result coughing and sneezing and touching infected surface are primary sources of infection. The coronavirus genome is comprised of âˆ¼30000 nucleotides. It encodes four structural proteins, Nucleocapsid (N) protein, Membrane (M) protein, Spike (S) protein and Envelop (E) protein and several non-structural proteins (nsp) (

The capsid is the protein shell, inside the capsid, there is nuclear capsid or N-protein which is bound to the virus single positive strand RNA that allows the virus to hijack human cells and turn them into virus factories. The N protein coats the viral RNA genome which plays a vital role in its replication and transcription. The N-terminal of the N protein which is binding to genomic and sub-genomic RNAs in MHV and IBV virions and process the viral replication and transcription. This is one of the important open research problems the developing of an effective drug targeting to prevent the contacts between N-terminal of N-protein and single positive RNA strand which can stop viral replication and transcription. Sarma et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) reported that two important class of compounds, theophylline and pyrimidone drugs as possible inhibitors of RNA binding to the N terminal domain of N protein of coronavirus, thus opening new avenues for in vitro validations.
