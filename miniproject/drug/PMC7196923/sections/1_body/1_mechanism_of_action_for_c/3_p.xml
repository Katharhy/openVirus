<p>The M-protein is most abundant in the viral surface and it is believed to be the central organizer for the coronavirus assembly. The S-protein is integrated over the surface of the virus, it mediates attachment of the virus to the host cell surface receptors and fusion between the viral and host cell membranes to facilitate viral entry into the host cell (Kirchdoerfer et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The E-protein is a small membrane protein composed âˆ¼76 to 109 amino-acid and minor component of the virus particle, it plays an important role in virus assembly, membrane permeability of the host cell and virus-host cell interaction (Gupta et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). A lipid envelop encapsulates the genetic material. Hemagglutinin-esterase dimer (HE) have been located on the surface of the viral. The HE protein may be involved in virus entry, is not required for replication, but appears to be important for infection of the natural host-cell (Lissenberg et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). State-of-the-art cryo-EM experiments have revealed the full structure of the Spike (S) protein in the close [pdb id: 6VXX] (Walls et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) and open (prefusion) states [pdb id: 6VYB] (Wrapp et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Such glycoprotein is made of three identical chains with 1273 amino acid each and it is composed by two well-defined protein domain regions: S1 and S2 subunits which are associated to cell recognition and the fusion of viral and cellular membranes respectively. The latter process occurs through different protein conformational changes that remain still uncharacterized.
