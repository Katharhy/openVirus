<p>The mechanism of viral entry and replication and RNA packing in the human cell is mapped in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>. The coronavirus spike (S) protein attaches to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors that is found on the surface of many human cells, including those in the lungs allowing virus entry. The coronavirus S protein is subjected to proteolytic cleavages by host proteases (i.e. trypsin and furin), in two sites located at the boundary between the S1 and S2 subunits (S1/S2 site). In a later stage happens the cleavage of the S2 domain (S2â€² site) in order to release the fusion peptide. This event will trigger the activation of the membrane fusion mechanism. Searching for antibodies can find support on molecular targeting which can utilize the structural information (aa sequence) of the binding region which is found in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. In this way this protocol could device a treatment to block the viral entry. Typically, human cell ingests the virus in a process called endocytosis. Once entered the cytoplasm, it has been suggested most likely that COVID-19 employs a unique three-step method for membrane fusion, involving receptor-binding and induced conformational changes in Spike (S) glycoprotein followed by cathepsin L proteolysis through intracellular proteases and further activation of membrane fusion mechanism within endosomes (Simmons et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Then, the endosome opens to release virus to the cytoplasm, and uncoating of viral nucleocapsid (N) is started via proteasomes which typically can hydrolyse endogenous proteins, but they are also capable of degrading exogenous proteins such as the SARS nucleocapsid protein (Q. Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). A different two-step mechanism has been suggested (Li, 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and in this case the virion binds to a receptor on the target host cell surface through its S1 subunit and the Spike is cleaved by host proteases (Hasan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) and then it is expected the fusion at low pH between viral and host target membranes via S2 subunit. Finally, the viral genetic material a single stranded RNA is fully released into the cytoplasm. There takes place the replication and transcription processes which are mediated by the so-called replication/transcription complex (RTC). Such complex is encoded in the viral genome and it is made of non-structural proteins (nsp). The RTC is believed to induced double-membrane structures in the cytoplasm of the infected cell (Van Hemert et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Following the positive RNA genome is translated to generate replicase proteins from open reading frame 1a/b (ORF 1a/b) (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). These proteins use the genome as a template to generated full-length negative sense RNAs, which subsequently serve as templates in generating addition full-length genomes. Structural viral proteins, M, S and E are synthesized in the cytoplasm and then inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>), and transfer to endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (Masters, 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Song et al., 2004). Also, in the cytoplasm nucleocapsids are formed from the encapsidation of replicated genomes by N protein, and as a result they coalesce within the ERGIC membrane in order to self-assembly into new virions. Finally, novel virions are exported from infected cells by transport to the cell membrane in smooth-walled vesicles and then secreted via a process called exocytosis, so that can infect other cells. In the meantime, the stress of viral production on the endoplasmic reticulum eventually leads to cell death. However, the mechanism of action for novel COVID-19 is still unknown (Masters, 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).
