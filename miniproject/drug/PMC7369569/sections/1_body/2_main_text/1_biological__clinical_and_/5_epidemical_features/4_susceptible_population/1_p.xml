 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The general public is susceptible, and the data are still being updated daily. The elderly population and patients with basic diseases are more susceptible to severe illness after infection, and children and infants can also be infected by SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. SARS-CoV had a tendency to affect healthier and younger persons, with a mean patient age of 39.9 years (range 1–91), and the male to female ratio was 1∶1.3, with a slight female predominance. MERS-CoV had a tendency to affect the elderly and frail populations, especially males, with a mean age of 56 years (range 14–94), and the male to female ratio was 3.3∶1 with a male predominance [
