<p id="Par36">A commonly used measure of infectivity is the basic reproduction number (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>), which is the average number of people infected who pass the virus on to others without intervention. In other words, the value is equivalent to how many people can be infected by an average patient. The larger the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is, the harder it is to control the epidemic. Researchers have estimated the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> to be in the range of 2.8–3.9, assuming extreme cases, which means that on average a COVID-19 patient passes the virus on to 2.8–3.9 healthy persons [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In comparison, the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> of MERS has been reported to be less than 1, and the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> of SARS is estimated to be 3. Considering that the disease is now widespread around the world, the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> of COVID-19 may change and could be higher than those of SARS and MERS.
