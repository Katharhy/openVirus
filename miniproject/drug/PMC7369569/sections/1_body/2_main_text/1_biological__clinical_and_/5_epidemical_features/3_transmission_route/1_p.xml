<p id="Par34">Viruses can directly infect people but can also infect one or more kinds of animals. Although these animals themselves do not cause disease, they can act as vectors for the virus and transmit it to humans; during this process, some viruses may mutate and evolve new characteristics. According to the experimental results of Peng et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through respiratory droplets and direct contact, confirming that while the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 is aerosols, other routes of transmission may exist. Moreover, a recent experiment conducted with recovering patients found that SARS-CoV-2 can also exist in the patientâ€™s stool, suggesting that the fecal-oral route may be a route of transmisson [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. By analyzing case data, Hui et al. also found that direct person-to-person transmission through close contact can also spread SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. MERS-CoV was mainly transmitted through close contact with infected family members or infected individuals in the hospital. Xiao et al. identified seven hypothesized transmission modes based on the three main transmission routes (long-range airborne, close contact, and fomite), and the infection risks associated with each hypothesis were estimated using the multiagent modeling framework. This showed that transmission occurred via both the long-range airborne and close contact routes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Based on the available data, all three coronaviruses can be transmitted by breathing respiratory droplets that contain virions, which indicates that wearing masks is an effective means of protecting susceptible people. All three coronaviruses are transmitted from animals to humans and from humans to humans.
