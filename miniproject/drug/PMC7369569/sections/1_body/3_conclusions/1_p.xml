<p id="Par44">The SARS-CoV-2 has a certain degree of homology with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Compared to the previous SARS and MERS outbreaks, we found that COVID-19 has a few similarities with regard to the infection source and clinical symptoms, but it also some differences. For example, COVID-19 shares some routes of transmission in common with SARS and MERS, such as respiratory droplets, but COVID-19 can also be transmitted by the fecal-oral route [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. It is important to consider all transmission routes when seeking to control the epidemic and protect medical staff and the general public. The epidemiological research on the source of infection and the route of transmission could help prevent the further spread of the epidemic. Different clinical symptoms could be used for the differential diagnosis of patients infected by coronaviruses. The medicines or therapeutic regimens that proved to be effective for SARS or MERS offer new approaches to the clinical treatment of COVID-19, which is essential in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic. The Chinese government’s control strategies in Wuhan and the active cooperation of the people have substantially contributed to China’s efforts to control the outbreak, which is important to the global efforts to combat the epidemic. Testing medications that have been shown to have antiviral effects against SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV may accelerate the pace of drug development in this emergency situation.
