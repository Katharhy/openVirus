<p id="Par18">This review aims to summarize the biological, clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 and to elucidate the current clinical diagnosis and treatment. The comparison of the similarities and differences among the three viruses might be useful for further research on the treatment of COVID-19. Learning from past experience with fighting epidemics, it is very important to understand the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the virus to control the epidemic, and this review summarizes the existing research and shows a targeted comparative analysis of the characteristics of the three related viruses to provide the scientific basis for later epidemic prevention and control measures. Based on the studies published in the last few weeks, this review shows the characteristics of the spread, diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Recently, many scientists have reported that the pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19 is mainly related to ACE2. The binding affinities of remdesivir, chloroquine, Ciclenosid, Niclosamide and Lopinavirus to ACE2 were determined and compared.</p>
