<p id="Par17">According to the experiment by Peng et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], COVID-19 uses ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor; ACE2 is distributed on the epithelial cells of the alveoli, trachea, bronchi, serous bronchial glands, alveolar monocytes and macrophages in the respiratory tract. ACE2 is also widely expressed on the mucosa, such as the eyelid, nasal cavity, lip, and oral cavity. The pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19 is clear, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The virus enters the target cells via ACE2 and then releases single-strand RNA (ssRNA), which combines with the ribosome in the target cell and is translated to RNA replicase. The RNA replicas copy the ssRNA to produce negative-strand RNA, positive-strand RNA and RNA fragments, which combine with the ribosome to produce a protein shell. The protein shell and the positive-strand RNA form the new SARS-CoV-2 virions, which are released to infect more target cells (Fig.
