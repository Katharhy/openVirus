<p id="p0120">A variety of non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitors are currently being developed, such as alisporivir, SCY-635, NIM811, and CRV431. CyPA target affinity for these inhibitors has been extensively validated in HCV. Furthermore, some studies have found that many of these inhibitors can effectively inhibit the replication of hCoV-229E, indicating its potential as a treatment for human CoV infection.</p>
