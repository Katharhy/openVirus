<p id="p0110">As an important intracellular protein in RNA viruses, Cyps have been shown to play an important part in virus replication. In addition, CyPA is considered to be a potential drug target for CoVs, and its inhibitory ligand CsA has been reported to inhibit the replication process of several CoVs. However, as an immunosuppressant inhibitor, the side effects caused by CsA in clinical applications cannot be ignored. The development of non-immunosuppressive inhibitors based on CsA's structure has begun to attract attention.</p>
