<p id="p0050">CsA is a ligand that can bind to CyPA. Upon binding, the molecular structure of CsA changes significantly compared with its unbound structure. The original hydrogen bonds in the molecules are broken, and a new hydrogen bond is formed [
 <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In addition, proline-containing peptides are converted from cis to trans, so that the resulting compound can be combined with CaN, while neither CsA nor CyPA alone can bind to CaN. CsA, with a molecular size of 11 amino acid cyclopeptides, has a surface bound to CyPA's PPIase trench, as well as a surface that can bond with CaN
