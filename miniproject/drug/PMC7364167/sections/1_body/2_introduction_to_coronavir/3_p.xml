<p id="p0020">Coronaviruses contain four major structural proteins, which include spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and these proteins all encoded at 3â€² end ORF in the genome. Functionally, S glycoproteins are involved as the main antigens in receptor binding and cell fusion [
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], while M proteins are primarily involved in germination and envelope formation, and play a significant role in subsequent viral particle assembly [
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The spike protein is essential for viral-cell receptor binding and this implies that the M protein is essential for receptor binding [
