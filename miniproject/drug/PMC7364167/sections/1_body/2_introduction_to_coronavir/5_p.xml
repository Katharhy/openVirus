<p id="p0030">At present, there is no specific treatment for coronavirus, and there is no effective treatment plan for severely ill patients. Repurposing of individual drugs, e.g. Remdisivir showed first positive effects on the duration and intensity of COVID-19. However, such drugs are far from preventing infection or disease. In deciding how to treat coronavirus infection, especially the recent COVID-19 infection, it is important and desirable to find general therapeutic targets and effective therapeutic drugs with broad-spectrum effects. Cyclophilins were identified to be essential for CoV infection. Their inhibitors restrictcoronavirus replication, providing a basis for the targeted development of pan coronavirus inhibitors.</p>
