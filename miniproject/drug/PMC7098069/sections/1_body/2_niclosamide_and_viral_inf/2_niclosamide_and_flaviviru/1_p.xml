<p>Flavivirus, a genus of viruses in the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, includes the Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus four serotypes (DENV 1–4), West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Many of these viruses are significant human pathogens. Among these viruses, ZIKV is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that is transmitted primarily by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. ZIKV infection can cause infants to be born with microcephaly and can trigger neurologic conditions in adults such as Guillain–Barré syndrome, neuropathy, and myelitis.

 </sup> Outbreaks of ZIKV infection have been recorded several times (2015 in Brazil, the latest one), and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared ZIKV to be a global public health emergency. Xu et al. used caspase-3 activity as the primary screening assay and discovered niclosamide as a potent inhibitor of ZIKV infection, displaying an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.37 μM against the intracellular ZIKV RNA level.

 </sup> The time-of-addition studies indicated that niclosamide inhibits ZIKV infection at a postentry stage, probably in a viral RNA replication step. Our research team also identified niclosamide as a potent anti-ZIKV inhibitor through an independent quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) campaign and found that niclosamide directly inhibits flavivirus NS2B-NS3 interactions.

 </sup> Protease complex NS2B-NS3 is essential for flaviviral polyprotein processing.

 </sup> Our team also found that niclosamide is a broad-spectrum inhibitor against other flaviviruses including DENV-2, WNV, JEV, and YFV, with potencies similar to that for ZIKV.
