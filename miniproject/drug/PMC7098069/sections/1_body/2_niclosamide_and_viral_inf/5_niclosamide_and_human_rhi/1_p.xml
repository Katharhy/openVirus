<p>Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are nonenveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the genus 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> of the family 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>. There are more than 100 different HRV strains classified into three species (HRV Aâ€“C). HRVs are widespread among humans and the primary cause of the common cold, posing serious health risks for patients with asthma, chronic pulmonary disease, and severe bronchiolitis in infants and children.

 </sup> Niclosamide is a weak lipophilic acid and was reported to inhibit pH-dependent HRV infection with low micromolar IC
 <sub>50</sub> values; it suppresses HRV entry by blocking the acidification of the endolysosomal compartments, acting as a proton carrier.
