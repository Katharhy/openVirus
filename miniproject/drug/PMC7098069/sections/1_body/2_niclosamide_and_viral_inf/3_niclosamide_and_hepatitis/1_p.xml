<p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an enveloped positive-sense single-strand RNA virus of the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> which is transmitted mainly through blood infection. HCV can cause both acute and chronic hepatitis, and hepatitis C is a major cause of liver cancer. It was estimated that about 71 million people have chronic HCV infections worldwide.

 </sup> At present, there is no effective vaccine against hepatitis C, although clinically approved therapeutics are available. Niclosamide was reported to show very promising activity against HCV replication with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.16 μM.

 </sup> It likely inhibits HCV replication via modulation of the host cell process similar to that of its derivatives nitazoxanide and tizoxanide.

 </sup> However, chronic HCV infection requires long-term (several months) antiviral treatment, which may make a host-targeted approach less attractive.
