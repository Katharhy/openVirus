<p>Ebola virus (EBOV) is an enveloped negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> of the family 
 <italic>Filoviridae</italic>. EBOV is introduced into humans from wild animals and spreads in the human population through person-to-person transmission. Ebola virus disease (EVD), known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, has a high fatality rate, ranging from 25 to 90% in past outbreaks. Through a systematic screen of FDA-approved drugs, niclosamide was identified as one of the most potent EBOV inhibitors with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.5 Î¼M, although its 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy has not yet been evaluated in animal models.
