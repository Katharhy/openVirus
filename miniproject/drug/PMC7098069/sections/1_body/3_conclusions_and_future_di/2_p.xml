<p>The outbreak of COVID-19 has been declared to be a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO, and the development of effective therapies for fast-spreading fatal COVID-19 is in an urgent need. 3CL protease is a key enzyme that is responsible for proteolytic processing and is indispensable for viral replication and the infection process.

 </sup> Recently, the high-resolution crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease has been solved by Zihe Rao and Haitao Yang (PDB ID: 6LU7,

  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>), and this may significantly facilitate the discovery of potent small-molecule inhibitors of COVID-19 by targeting SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease via high-throughput virtual screening of compound libraries or existing drug libraries for drug repurposing. In addition, Wrapp et al. have determined a cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein trimer in the prefusion conformation that will also facilitate vaccine development and the discovery of antiviral therapeutics for COVID-19.

 </sup> Although these crystal structures may provide new insights and helpful information for future drug discovery, extensive efforts are needed to identify effective binding pockets for small molecules and validate the drug targets.
