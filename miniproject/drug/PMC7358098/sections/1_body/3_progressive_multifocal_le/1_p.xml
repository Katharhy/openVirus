<p>Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare, often lethal disease of the central nervous system caused by the JC polyomavirus (JCV).
 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> In general, JCV infection is indolent and asymptomatic, but may become symptomatic and fatal in immunocompromised patients, for example, patients infected with HIV, lymphoproliferative malignancies or those undergoing immunosuppressive therapies.
 <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45 46</xref> Currently, no proven therapeutic strategy for this disease has been established. Based on evidence that T cell exhaustion might affect the course of JCV infections, ICIs are currently tested for treatment of PML.
 <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> For example, Cortese 
 <italic>et al</italic>
 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> assessed the safety and efficacy of PD-1 inhibition by pembrolizumab with different predisposing conditions (n=8). In this small cohort, five patients achieved a clinical benefit or stabilization of PML and a decrease in JCV viral load. Contrasting results were observed in another study, three kidney transplant recipients suffering from PML were treated with nivolumab and all three patients died within 8 weeks with evidence of disease progression.
 <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> As an explanation for this adverse outcome,
 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> the authors speculate that immunosuppressive therapy (ie, calcineurin inhibitors) might have led to persistent T cell dysfunction and lymphopenia. The authors further point out that patients with severe lymphopenia also did not respond favorably to ICI treatment. Hence, they concluded that ICI may be ineffective in such patients.
 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48 49</xref> In contrast, a number of case reports describe favorable outcomes for patients with PML receiving ICI. For example, Hoang 
 <italic>et al</italic>
 <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> described a biopsy-confirmed PML case in which the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab seems to have stimulated immune activation resulting in effective disease control in the patient with a concomitant hematological malignancy.
