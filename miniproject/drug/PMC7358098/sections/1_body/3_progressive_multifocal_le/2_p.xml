<p>Together, at present, there are few studies on the safety and/or efficacy of ICI in patients with PML. The available studies do not show consistent results which, might be due to the great heterogeneity of predisposing conditions leading to PML. Despite these difficulties, the present data suggest that the underlying cause of immunosuppression, pretreatment, and laboratory parameters, such as lymphopenia, have relevant effects on the success of ICI therapy of PML. This notion may be extrapolated to ICI treatment of cancer in patients with PML. To the best of our knowledge, however, there exist no definite data on patients with PML receiving ICI treatment because of coexisting cancer. Of course, the use of immunosuppressive comedication for ICI-induced irAEs is challenging in this particular patient population. Thus, prospective studies are necessary to determine whether ICIs are a safe and effective approach for PML and PML-associated cancers.</p>
