<p>Cancer cells may escape immune surveillance through a variety of mechanisms, including the activation of immune checkpoint pathways that serve to suppress immune responses against tumor cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) boost antitumor immune responses by interrupting coinhibitory signaling pathways to promote immune-mediated killing of tumor cells. The introduction of ICI in 2011 for therapy has been a revolutionary milestone in the management of many solid cancers and hematological malignancies (eg, melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinomas, colorectal cancer, renal cell carcinoma, urothelial cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma).
