<p>Full activation of T lymphocytes predominantly depends on several different signals. Indeed, T lymphocyte activation is regulated both by costimulators and coinhibitors known as immune checkpoints.
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Antigen-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and T cell receptor (TCR) binding associated with the activation of costimulatory receptors (ie, CD28) enables T lymphocytes to proliferate, differentiate and migrate toward specific antigens. By contrast, when antigen-MHC and TCR binding is associated with signaling of coinhibitory receptors (ie, CTLA-4), T cell activation will be suppressed. CTLA-4 is not expressed in naïve T lymphocytes, but is quickly induced on T cell activation. Importantly, CTLA-4 predominantly regulates the amplitude of T cell activation during the early priming phase in lymphoid organs.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 3 5</xref> The binding of CTLA-4 to B7 proteins is in direct competition with CD28 costimulatory signals, and the ratio between CD28 and CTLA-4 binding determines activation of T lymphocytes versus anergy, and represents an important mechanism in the prevention of excessive immune responses. Hence, the main task of CTLA-4 is to stop autoreactive T lymphocytes at the initial stages of activation, predominantly in lymphoid tissues, to prevent autoimmunity.
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Thus, it is not surprising that it is also expressed on regulatory T cells (Tregs). Similar to Tregs, PD-1 plays an important role in limiting immune responses in peripheral tissues. The interaction of PD-1 with its ligands (PD-L1/2) inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion mediated by TCRs.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3 5</xref> The PD‐1 receptor is physiologically expressed by activated T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and Tregs. PD‐L1 is expressed on several cells, including tumor cells and some host cells such as myeloid, lymphoid and epithelial cells. The interaction between PD‐1 and PD‐L1 blocks CD8+ cytotoxic T cell proliferation and survival, leads to apoptosis of tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes, and promotes differentiation of CD4+ T lymphocytes into Tregs.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 5 6</xref> Most cancer cells possess the ability to express inhibitory ligands such as PD-L1, for example, in response to interferons (IFN). This process can limit normal anticancer immune responses, thus assisting in immune escape. Hence, ICI do not result in killing tumor cells directly but enhance or restore immune responses and endogenous antitumor activity.
