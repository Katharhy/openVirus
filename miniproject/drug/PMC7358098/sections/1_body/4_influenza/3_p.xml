 <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> reported a small cohort of ICI-treated cancer patients that had received influenza vaccinations and subsequently experienced higher rates of irAEs than expected (n=23). Later studies investigating larger patient cohorts did not confirm such an increase of frequency or severity of irAEs in patients on ICI who previously received influenza vaccination.

 <italic>et al</italic>
 <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> do not indicate an increase in incidence or severity of irAE in patients with cancer on ICI who received influenza vaccinations. Twenty per cent (75/370) of patients experienced a new irAE (any grade), of those 48% received corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants. In the latter subgroup, no negative influence on vaccination outcome was reported.

 <italic>et al</italic>
 <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> should be pointed out. They actually demonstrated that the administration of a influenza vaccination was not correlated with an increased risk of subsequent myocarditis among patients on ICI. Indeed, rates of vaccination were lower among patients who did develop ICI-induced myocarditis, and the vaccination was associated with a lower risk of other irAEs, in particular ICI-induced pneumonitis.
 <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> Unfortunately, there is little data available whether ICI would be beneficial in the management of severe influenza cases. In this context, Yu 
 <italic>et al</italic>
 <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref> reported that influenza infection substantially increases the number of highly PD-1 positive innate lymphoid cells in the lungs of mice. Anti-PD-1 treatment resulted in reduction of total lung innate lymphoid cells with almost complete loss of PD-1 highly positive cells. Hence, they suggested that anti-PD-1 treatment may provide an effective approach for both disease prevention and treatment.
