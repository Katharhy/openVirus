<p>Influenza, a highly contagious respiratory disease, is responsible for a significant economic burden on the healthcare systems. The co-circulating influenza A (subtype: H1N1, H3N2) and B (lineage: Victoria, Yamagata) viruses cause seasonal epidemics which affect a major part of the global population annually and cause more than 645,000 influenza-associated deaths worldwide.
 <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53 54</xref> Since patients with cancer are at higher risk of influenza-associated complications, vaccination, the primary preventive tool against influenza, is recommended. Particularly, ICI-treated patients produce robust humoral and cellular immune responses. Still it is important to note that Bersanelli 
 <italic>et al</italic>
 <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> reported that the post-vaccination occurrence of the influenza syndrome (fever ≥38°C and the presence of at least one respiratory symptom together with generalized symptoms) was significantly increased in patients with cancer receiving ICI. In this study, the lack of efficacy of vaccination was more pronounced among the elderly.
 <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> Importantly, influenza vaccination did not negatively impact the efficacy of the anticancer effects of ICI treatment. Moreover, the same authors reported that ICI-treated cancer patients who received influenza vaccination and/or developed influenza syndrome showed longer overall survival. The effect of immunosuppressive therapy for ICI-induced irAE on the influenza syndrome was not addressed in these studies.
