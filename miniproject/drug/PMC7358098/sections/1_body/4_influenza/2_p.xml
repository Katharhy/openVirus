<p>In rare cases, influenza infection and vaccination are associated with the occurrence of organ-specific autoimmune conditions, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rapid onset muscle weakness caused by the immune system attacking peripheral nerves. The risk of influenza vaccine-induced Guillain-Barré syndrome is extremely small. Notably, however, Yuen

Indeed, the hypothesis that influenza vaccination may induce adverse immune responses in ICI-treated patients is corroborated by results from animal experiments showing increased T cell responses to viral antigens under PD-1 inhibition.
