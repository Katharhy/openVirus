<p>Taken together, ICI appears to be safe and effective in cancer patients with concurrent HBV or HCV. Thus, HBV and HCV infection should not contraindicate ICI.
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 35</xref> Even though the risk of virus reactivation and virus-related hepatotoxicity appears to be low, it is recommended that patients with active HBV or HCV should routinely be monitored and treated with antiviral agents if indicated, in particular in patients receiving immunosuppressive medication for ICI-induced irAE.
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Since PD-1 plays a significant role in the natural history of both HBV-induced and HCV-induced hepatitis, there is a rationale for the use of ICI in these conditions. Initial studies indicate that anti-PD-1 treatment is safe in chronic HBV and HCV infection, but further trials are needed to determine whether ICI can be used to gain HBV long-term remission.
