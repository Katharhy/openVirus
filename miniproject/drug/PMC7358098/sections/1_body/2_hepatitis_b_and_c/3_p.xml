<p>It is well known that HBV-specific exhaustion of T cells is maintained by ongoing HBV-antigen stimulation. Furthermore, PD-L1/2 expression, secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines, for example, IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF-ß), dysfunction of dendritic cells, enhanced numbers of PD-1+ NK cells, Tregs, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells negatively influence HBV-specific T cell immunity.
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 8 34 35</xref> Similar to HBV infection, chronic HCV infection is also associated with increased PD-1 and TIM-3 expression as another marker for T cell exhaustion.

 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> recently reported a phase I proof-of-concept trial demonstrating that PD-1 inhibition through nivolumab resulted in prolonged suppression of HCV replication in some patients with chronic infection. Based on these encouraging results, further exploration of PD-1 pathway inhibition is warranted for other chronic viral diseases, possibly in combination with direct-acting antiviral regimens.
