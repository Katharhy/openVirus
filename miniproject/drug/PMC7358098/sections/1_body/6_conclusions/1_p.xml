<p>Based on the data presented in this review and in line with the recommendations of the Study Group for Infections in Compromised Hosts, we assume that PD-1/PD-L1- and/or CTLA-4-based ICI treatment does not seem to independently enhance the risk of infection or cause more virulent course of disease.
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Hence, the above discussed viral infections should not be considered as contraindications per se for patients who are scheduled for or are on ICI. Over the course of ICI treatment, however, supportive immunosuppressive therapies may be required to treat ICI-associated irAEs, which in turn may increase the risk of new or reactivation of persisting viral infections. Hence, physicians caring for patients receiving immunosuppressants for treatment of ICI-induced irAEs should maintain close surveillance for the occurrence of symptoms or signs suggestive of new infection or worsening of preexisting viral infections.
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> For almost all aforementioned viral infections, there are convincing data that disease-associated T cell exhaustion is a fundamental immune escape mechanism. Accordingly, increasing lines of evidence suggest that ICIs represent not only an effective antitumor treatment regimen in such patients but also a potential approach in the management of the viral infection per se.
