<p>Together, experience and evidence are growing with regard to the use of ICI in patients with the novel infectious disease COVID-19. In comparison to chemotherapeutic regimens ICI cannot be considered immunosuppressive. Hematological irAEs caused by ICI are very infrequent, with only few cases reported. In a meta-analysis of 9324 patients, the frequency of neutropenia was smaller than 1%.
 <xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref> Previously reported reactivation of viral infections (ie, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B) under ICI therapy were mostly observed following immunosuppressive treatment of irAEs. Hence, it does not appear reasonable to assume that patients undergoing ICI are at higher risk of becoming infected by SARS-COV-2 or other infectious agents compared with patients without ICI treatment.
