<p>To date, very limited data are available addressing the clinical outcome of ICI-treated cancer patients also suffering from COVID-19 infection.
 <xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74–77</xref> The blockade of PD-1+ on CD8+ lymphocytes by ICI treatment might be reasonable in patients with COVID-19 in order to abrogate functional T cell exhaustion and restore vigorous T lymphocytic cytotoxicity against both the tumor and the viral antigens. However, as discussed by Chiappelli 
 <italic>et al</italic>,
 <xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref> this may work only at the initial and intermediate stage when PD-1 expression on cytotoxic T cells ranges between low and medium levels. At the more advanced stage, when PD-1 expression is high on CD8+ T lymphocytes, T lymphocyte exhaustion is likely irreversible, and thus, ICI will no longer have an effect.
 <xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref> The excess of cytokines is also of great significance with respect to the cytokine release syndrome (CRS, ‘cytokine storm’), a phenomenon of massive inflammatory reaction, where cytokines (eg, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α) are rapidly produced in large amounts in response to infectious agents.
 <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref> Similar to SARS-COV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV), SARS-COV-2 is associated with increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines in the serum, which are suspected to cause pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage.
 <xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref> However, unlike SARS-COV and MERS-COV, SARS-COV-2 infection appears to be associated with the activation of both T helper 1 (Th-1) and Th-2 lymphocytes. SARS-COV-2 predominantly targets epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, leading to severe alveolar damage. However, COVID-19 also shows evidence for changes in the lung stroma, suggesting that also pulmonary fibrosis is induced at some time point.
 <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> Moreover, similar to SARS-COV and MERS-COV, SARS-COV-2 may also pose the risk of autoimmunity due to cross-reactivity of the induced immune reaction to both viral (eg, spike surface proteins) and host protein epitopes. Lyons-Weiler
 <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> recently hypothesized that based on homology with human proteins, such pathogenic priming involving autoimmunity might also occur with SARS-COV-2. Similar to the results of previous SARS-COV animal experiments, Agrawall 
 <italic>et al</italic>
 <xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref> reported that mice vaccinated against MERS-COV developed severe Th-2-driven immunopathologies in the lung following post-vaccination MERS-COV challenge.
 <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58 78</xref> Given the data existing so far on possible autoimmunity particular in the advanced stage of COVID-19, the administration of ICI could pose the risk of immune overactivation and aggravation of autoimmune processes.
