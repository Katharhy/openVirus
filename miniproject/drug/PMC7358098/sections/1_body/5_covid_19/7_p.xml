<p>On the basis of preliminary basic research data and clinical observations in patients with COVID-19, one may assume that ICI could safely be employed in cancer patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection and even COVID-19. As long as there is no clear evidence, however, it remains a case-by-case scenario depending on many factors discussed above, particularly with respect to how advanced the cancer and/or COVID-19 are.

 <xref rid="R92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref> observed that PD-1 blockade exposure was not associated with increased risk of severity of COVID-19 in patients with lung cancer.

 <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71 73 76 79</xref> Additionally, a combination of ICI with an anti-IL-6 antibody is an attractive approach to reduce the risks of both irAEs and possible cytokine excess frequently observed in severe COVID-19 cases.
 <xref rid="R93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref> A study following this strategy is currently recruiting patients. The objective of this prospective, controlled, randomized, multicenter study is to compare the efficacy of the combined administration of a chloroquine analog, nivolumab, and tocilizumab versus standard of care in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer who have COVID-19 and are not eligible to a resuscitation unit (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04333914). Patients will be randomized into two different cohorts: (1) asymptomatic or mild symptoms: chloroquine analog versus nivolumab versus standard of care (1:1:1); (2) moderate/severe symptoms: chloroquine analog versus tocilizumab versus standard of care (1:1:1). It has to be stressed, however, that hydroxychloroquine use has been reported to be ineffective or even associated with higher mortality and therefore should only be considered in the context of well-designed controlled and regulatory approved clinical trials. Furthermore, two protocols have been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov investigating ICI in COVID-19 patients without cancer: In a phase II randomized trial, the protocol CORIMUNO19-NIVO will evaluate the efficacy and safety of nivolumab alone versus standard of care in COVID-19 patients hospitalized in an ICU (NCT04343144), and in an open-label, controlled, single-center pilot study, nivolumab will be employed in adult patients with COVID-19 aiming to investigate the efficacy and safety of nivolumab in relation to viral clearance (NCT04356508).
