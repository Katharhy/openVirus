<p>A novel approach to ICI in cancer and viral infections, particularly COVID-19, represents CD200 checkpoint reversal.
 <xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref> The CD200 immune checkpoint causes suppression of the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, that is, IL-2 and IFN-ү, and enhances the production of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and Tregs that are implicated in impaired antitumor and antiviral immune responses.
 <xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref> Anti-CD200 targeted treatments have shown promising effects in animal models accompanied by downregulation of inhibitory PD-1 receptors.
 <xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref> In a murine coronavirus model, the checkpoint inhibitory CD200-CD200R1 system has been demonstrated to downregulate the single strand RNA virus sensor toll-like receptor seven in myeloid-derived cells and respective interventions restored IFN-ү levels resulting in enhanced virus elimination.
