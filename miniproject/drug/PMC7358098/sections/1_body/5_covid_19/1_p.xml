<p>In March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), was officially proclaimed a pandemic by the WHO. Up through end of April, 2020, almost 3 million cases of COVID-19 were confirmed with more than 200,000 deaths reported worldwide.
 <xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref> COVID-19 is predominantly characterized by high fever, dry cough, fatigue, and eventually pneumonia, and can cause death in severe cases. To date, most published data on COVID-19 have been generated in China. In 14% of confirmed cases, the course of disease was severe and in 5% critical. The so-called case fatality rate (CFR) was as high as 1%, thereby being much greater than the CFR usually observed in seasonal influenza (approximately 0.1%). However, current infection rates as well as CFR still have to be considered with caution.
 <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref> Risk for severe disease and death is strongly associated with older age (in particular &gt;70 years), cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer.
 <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68–70</xref> Laboratory predictors for severe and fatal disease predominantly include elevated lactate dehydrogenase, pro-calcitonin, and D-dimers, increased serum levels of cytokines IL-6, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), as well as decreased lymphocyte counts, particularly CD8+ T and NK cells.
