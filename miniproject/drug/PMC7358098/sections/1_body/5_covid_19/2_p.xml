<p>Indeed, Biao

 <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref> recently demonstrated that the number of total T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood was significantly decreased in patients with COVID-19. This was particularly pronounced in older patients and in patients who needed intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. Importantly, lymphopenia was negatively associated with patient survival. Biao 
 <italic>et al</italic>
 <xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69–71</xref> also showed that T cell counts of patients who recovered increased, while IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α levels decreased.
 <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref> Since the cytokine increases were paralleled by a decrease in lymphocytes, Diao 
 <italic>et al</italic>
 <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref> speculated that elevated proinflammatory cytokines may promote the reduction of T lymphocytes in patients with COVID-19. However, this observation has to be substantiated in future studies.
 <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref> Additionally, as assessed by flow cytometry of peripheral blood, T cells of severely affected patients are characterized by a much higher PD-1 expression than healthy controls.
 <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref> Specifically, enhanced PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells was observed when patients progressed from prodromal to symptomatic stages, indicating that T lymphocyte exhaustion—similar to other viral infections—is a hallmark of COVID-19 as well. The expression of critical inhibitory checkpoint proteins of T cell exhaustion, including PD-1 and Tim-3, and the increase of TNF-α, IL-10 and other cytokines (which actually all may modulate the expression of PD-1 and Tim-3) are likely to mediate T cell lymphopenia in patients with COVID-19 through programmed cell death.
