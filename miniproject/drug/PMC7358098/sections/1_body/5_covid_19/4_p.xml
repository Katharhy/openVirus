<p>Similar to the ‘cytokine storm’ observed in patients with advanced COVID-19, CRS has been observed in rare cases as irAEs in patients receiving ICI.
 <xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79 80</xref> Furthermore, one of the observed irAE of anti-PD-1-based ICI is autoimmune pneumonitis, which may occur in up to 5% of all treated patients.
 <xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79–81</xref> Patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with ICI may even experience autoimmune pneumonitis in up to 20% of cases.
 <xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref> Since the clinical symptoms and radiographic findings in irAE-induced pneumonitis are similar to those of COVID-19 pneumonitis, it may be in some cases difficult to arrive at proper diagnostic conclusions as the basis for appropriate management. The occurrence of irAEs frequently necessitates the use of systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive/immunomodulating agents such as mycophenolate acid or TNF-α blockers. Whether the use of systemic corticosteroids is harmful in the setting of COVID-19 is unclear. The use of glucocorticoids in patients with SARS-COV-associated and MERS-COV-associated pneumonitis is still controversial because of divergent clinical outcomes reported in the existing literature.
 <xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref> Still, high-dose glucocorticoids are one of the most frequently used adjuncts in acute respiratory distress syndrome, even though the effectiveness of steroids in the management of acute lung injury is ambiguous.
 <xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref> This is also true for COVID-19. Nevertheless, it seems that early and short-time use of low-dose methylprednisolone may be one feasible approach in SARS-COV-2-related pneumonitis and respiratory distress syndrome.
 <xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref> Hence, possible ICI-induced irAEs could be safely managed with methylprednisolone in the setting of COVID-19. Based on the observation of cytokine excess (eg, TNF-α), during advanced stages of COVID-19, one may speculate that TNF-α blockers such as infliximab may not only be beneficial for the management of ICI-induced irAEs, but also for COVID-19.
 <xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref> Notably, cytokine IL-6 antibodies (eg, tocilizumab) are currently under intense investigation in patients with COVID-19. Tocilizumab is already approved in the USA to manage CRS occurring after chimeric antigen receptor T cell treatment.
 <xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref> Notably, it has been demonstrated that tocilizumab is effective in the management of irAEs occurring in ICI-treated patients who are refractory to corticosteroids.
 <xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref> Furthermore, there is currently an ongoing phase II trial investigating a combination of tocilizumab with anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 therapy in order to diminish irAEs in unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma patients (NCT03999749).
