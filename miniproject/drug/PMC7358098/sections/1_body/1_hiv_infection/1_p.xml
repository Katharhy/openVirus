<p>Antiretroviral therapy has significantly decreased the incidence of AIDS and thus the mortality of HIV infection. However, complete eradication of HIV with antiviral agents has not yet been achieved, presumably because HIV persists in cellular reservoirs. The major HIV reservoir is a small pool of latently infected resting memory CD4+ lymphocytes carrying an integrated form of the viral genome that lacks the ability to produce viral proteins.
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In HIV-infected subjects receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), inhibitory checkpoint proteins such as PD-1 are expressed on persisting infected T cells. Indeed, there is a wealth of evidence that high expression of PD-1 on CD4+ lymphocytes clearly correlates with HIV persistence.
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 13</xref> However, different inhibitory checkpoint proteins are differentially expressed by T cell subtypes; for example, PD-1 expression is increased in memory T cells and Tregs, whereas CTLA-4 is highly expressed in both memory T cells and Tregs.
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 14</xref> Interestingly, the frequency of PD-1 expression on CD4+ andâ€‰CD8+ lymphocytes appears to strongly correlate with disease outcome. Specifically, in untreated patients with HIV, high PD-1 expression has been shown to correlate with a decrease in CD4+ T lymphocytes during both acute and chronic infection.
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8 15</xref> Similar to PD-1 upregulation, overexpression of CTLA-4 on CD4+ T lymphocytes more frequently correlates with progressive disease.
