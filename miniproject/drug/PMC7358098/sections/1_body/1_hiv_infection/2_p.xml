<p>HIV persistence can be reversed by ICI in vitro,
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8 17</xref> and in preclinical animal models, T cell exhaustion is ameliorated by PD-1 blockade.
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Together, the above discussed pathomechanism and preliminary experimental data warrant studies regarding safety and efficacy of ICI in HIV-infected patients. Interestingly, even though patients living with HIV on HAART have a life expectancy similar to the general population, these patients still have an increased risk to develop cancer.
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> In this context, initial observations on HIV-positive cancer patients treated with ICI are emerging. In a systematic review, of 73 HIV-infected patients who received ICI therapy for advanced cancer, anti-PD-1 monotherapy was the most frequently employed regimen (n=62).
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In this cohort, grade III or higher irAEs were observed in 8.6% of patients. HIV remained suppressed in 93% of patients and CD4+ lymphocyte count increased in patients with available pretreatment and post-treatment HIV load and CD4 cell count data, respectively. None of the previous studies reported the occurrence of immune reactivation inflammatory syndrome during ICI therapy.
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Similar to the safety profile, efficacy of ICI was favorable with an objective response of 63% in Kaposi sarcoma, 30% in non-small cell lung carcinoma, and 27% in melanoma.
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Prompted by these encouraging results, phase I and II trials investigating ICIs in HIV-infected patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas are currently conducted.
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> Accordingly, a task force formed by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recently recommended the inclusion of HIV-infected patients in oncology trials, particularly patients with CD4+ counts higher than 350 cells/µL, thus representing a group of patients with intact immunological function and survival comparable with the general population.
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Moreover, data from the first clinical trial investigating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of CTLA-4 inhibition (ipilimumab) in patients with chronic HIV infection in the absence of concurrent malignancies were recently reported.
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Although only based on a limited number of patients (n=24), this study did not reveal any safety concerns that would preclude further investigation of using CLTA-4 inhibition to enhance the immune response against HIV. One patient who developed facial palsy received medium dose prednisone; still, no worsening of his HIV infection was observed.
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Furthermore, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase I dose-escalating study testing PD-1 inhibition (nivolumab) in HAART-treated HIV-infected adults without concurrent cancer (n=8), even a single, low-dose infusion appeared to enhance HIV-specific immunity.
