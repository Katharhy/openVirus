<p>Several of the influenza proteins have been studied in fly culture cells or in the whole fly. The influenza M2 was expressed in the wing and the eye, causing wing defects and a total loss of eye tissue. Males were found to have a more severe phenotype than females. Importantly, amantadine was shown to rescue the M2 phenotype, suggesting 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a reliable system for anti-influenza drug studies. As the expressed M2 was functional as an ion channel, transgenic flies were used to screen for mutations in ion transport or pH homeostasis-related genes of the host. Using flies with the relevant mutations and crossing them with the M2 transgenic flies, it was found that

 <italic>vha55</italic>, 
 <italic>vha68-1</italic> and 
 <italic>vha68-2</italic> were the strongest modifiers of M2-mediated phenotype. These four genes encode for the different subunits of the V

 <sub>0</sub> ATPase. To confirm that the results obtained are not specific to flies, MDCK cells were treated with bafilomycin, a drug that targets the V

 <sub>0</sub> ATPase, prior to influenza infection and this reduced infectivity [
