<p>The use of the 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> system for the study of viruses is not extensive yet, but is becoming more attractive (reviewed in Hughes et al., 2012 [
 <xref rid="B11-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]). A common approach has been the expression of a viral protein in a particular organ of the fly and following the physiological, phenotypic or pathological effects. The expression of proteins of the Epstein-Barr and SARS viruses in the 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye, or of HIV proteins in the wings or in fat bodies led to the discovery of mechanistic aspects of the proteins and their partners within the host [

 <xref rid="B213-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">213</xref>]. Many studies in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells in culture have revealed the mechanism of action of viral proteins. This approach was useful, for example, for proteins of Hepatitis B, HIV and West Nile viruses [
