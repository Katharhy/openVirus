<p>Yet another type of yeast, 
 <italic>Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris)</italic>, is also very useful for research, mainly for efficient expression of proteins [
 <xref rid="B123-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. It was used, as such, for studying influenza proteins, including the vRNP complex that was reconstituted in it. The three components of the viral polymerase complex (PA, PB1 and PB2) were expressed in 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic> by inserting all three genes into the chromosome [
 <xref rid="B124-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. The yeast cells were able to express the protein and when the viral polymerase was purified, the complex was able to synthesize RNA in vitro. Similarly, A/swan/Poland/305-135V08/2006 (H5N1) HA gene was expressed in 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic> and the protein was purified for mouse immunization. This recombinant HA was found to be effective in eliciting a high immune response in mice [
 <xref rid="B125-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. As 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic> is used mainly for large-scale protein production and antibody screening, it will not be further discussed here.
