<p>Another important use of the yeast model is to study human proteins known to be targets of the influenza virus. Many of these proteins have homologs in yeast, providing a convenient system for addressing their function in the simple eukaryote and deduce their role in the infection process in man. An example would be the Mx proteins. 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has a Mx-related GTPase known as Vps1, and another protein, Mgm1, both of which have a high similarity to Mx [
