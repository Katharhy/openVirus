<p>The above studies demonstrate the efficiency of yeast for high-throughput drug screening in living cells, increasing the number of potential drugs in the pipeline. The same yeast systems could be used to study already known inhibitors and to identify mutations in the viral proteins that cause drug resistance (see in Hahnenberger et al., [
