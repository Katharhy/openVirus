<p>Given that NECs can be derived from patients, certain social factors, such as smoking, can be studied specifically in such cells in relation to influenza. NECs derived from smokers expressed lower levels of anti-viral cytokine IFN-Î± and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine IP-6, resulting in increased influenza-induced cytotoxicity compared to NECs from non-smokers.

It should be noted that the use of primary cultures is the only way in which responses of smokers and patients to influenza infection could have been tested.
