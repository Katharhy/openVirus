<p>Adult human nasal epithelial stem/progenitor cells (hNESPCs) from nasal biopsy specimens of both healthy subjects and patients with allergic rhinitis have been established [
 <xref rid="B259-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">259</xref>]. The in vitro- passaged hNESPCs retain the capability of full differentiation into human nasal epithelium cells (hNECs). When these hNECs were infected with the A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2) virus, the progeny virus could be detected from 16 hpi. Infected hNECs were found to elicit similar immune responses to other known models. Interestingly, there was individual variation among the patient-derived immune responses and apoptotic cell death, which is reflective of different responses to the same virus in a population. Infection of hNECs has uncovered novel host signaling mechanisms which the influenza virus can stimulate. For example, H3N2 infection of hNECs resulted in an increased expression of oncostatin M (OSM), which is part of the IL-6 type cytokine group [

Other interesting observations using patient-derived NECs include the effects of estrogenic compounds on NECs derived from male and female donors, showing that estrogen exhibited protective effects upon infection in female, but not male, NECs.
