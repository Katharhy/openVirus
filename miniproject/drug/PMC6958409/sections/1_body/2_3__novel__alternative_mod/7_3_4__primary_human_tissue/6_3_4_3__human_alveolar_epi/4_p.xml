<p>AECs were shown to be primarily targeted by H1N1 viruses (A/California/07/2009, A/New York/1682/2009 (NY1682), A/California/04/2009 (CA04)) [
 <xref rid="B297-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">297</xref>]. AECs from different donors had different susceptibilities to the viruses. Obese donors showed significantly increased infection rates compared to non-obese donors. The link between infection rates and obesity could have been monitored only in the patients-derived primary cultures. HA sequences were studied and the A214T substitution decreased NY1682 infectivity of AECs significantly which could explain the differences observed between the various H1N1 viruses. In the context of H5N1 and H1N1 infections [

Using specific cell populations and co-cultures with other cell types, different host processes can be elucidated in the context of influenza to further understand hostâ€“virus interactions in specific cell types. Examples of novel host processes in ATII cells are the activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [
