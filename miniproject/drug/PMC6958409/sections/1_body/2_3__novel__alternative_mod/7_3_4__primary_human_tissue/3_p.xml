<p>The use of primary culture allows close inspection of the very specific cell types that were preferentially infected by the virus. Different influenza viruses (human and avian source) tended to infect different human respiratory cells (nasal and trachea-bronchial cells) [
 <xref rid="B249-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>]. Human viruses infect non-ciliated cells while avian ones infect ciliated cells (tracheo-bronchial epithelial cells). This was attributed to different distribution of α2,6- and α2,3-linked sialic acids. For the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain (H1N1pdm), low levels of viral replication was observed in Alveolar Type I cells (ATI) compared to normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) and nasopharyngeal epithelial (NPE) cells [

Both ATI cells and NHBE cells represent the lower respiratory tract, which is the site of potential influenza-related complications, while the NPE cells represent the upper respiratory tract that is involved in viral transmission. This demonstrates that primary cells can be used to study novel viral strains for virulence potential and transmissibility. Various respiratory tissues obtained from patients and human alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) have been used to understand the cellular tropism of different avian H5N6 viruses. Using ex vivo lung and bronchus cultures, all the H5N6 viruses in the study were able to infect these tissues. The viruses were able to infect both ciliated and non-ciliated cells in bronchial tissue and type-II AECs [
