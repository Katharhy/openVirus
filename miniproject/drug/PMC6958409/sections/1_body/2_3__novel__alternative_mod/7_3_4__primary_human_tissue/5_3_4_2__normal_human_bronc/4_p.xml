<p>To better understand the effects and functions of viral proteins in infection, reverse genetics-derived viruses carrying target mutations in NP and/or PB2 proteins have been used [
 <xref rid="B272-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">272</xref>]. Reverse genetic performed with A/Duck/Alberta/35/1976 (H1N1) showed synergistic effects between NP and PB2 mutations. Infected NHBE cells were shown to have lower conductance of the chloride ion channel cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) [
 <xref rid="B273-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">273</xref>]. This may be due to the virus targeting the CFTR for early lysosomal degradation and affecting ion transport in the host. In the case of viral HA, various mutations affected the virus’ ability to infect cells. This was seen with the H9N2 virus [
 <xref rid="B274-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">274</xref>], H5N1 virus [
 <xref rid="B275-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">275</xref>] and the pandemic 1918 strain [
 <xref rid="B276-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">276</xref>]. HA mutations were also studied in relation with neuraminidase inhibitor resistance [
 <xref rid="B277-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">277</xref>]. Studies with NHBE cells also showed that decreased neuraminidase activity was required for H5N1 virus adaptation to the human airway epithelium [
 <xref rid="B278-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">278</xref>]. Studying both HA and NA, viruses found to have avian-like surface glycoproteins exhibited reduced infectivity at 32 °C in NHBE, which would be required for human-to-human transmission [
