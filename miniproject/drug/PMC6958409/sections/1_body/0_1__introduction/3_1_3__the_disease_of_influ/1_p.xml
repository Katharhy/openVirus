Influenza viruses evolve constantly with antigenic shifts (reassortment of viral segments, resulting in dramatically different viruses) and drifts (small antigenic changes to increase immune evasion). Due to viral adaptation and reassortment, highly virulent strains may appear and result in local epidemics or global pandemics such as the 1918 H1N1 Spanish pandemic, 2005 H5N1 Bird flu and the 2009 H1N1 Swine flu [
