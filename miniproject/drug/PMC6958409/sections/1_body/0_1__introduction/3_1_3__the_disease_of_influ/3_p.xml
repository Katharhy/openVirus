<p>Given the scarcity of efficient anti-influenza drugs, the major strategy to prevent or control seasonal influenza epidemics is the annual influenza vaccination programme. Due to its varied effectiveness year to year, pandemics and epidemics still appear when the vaccine is mismatched with the predominant antigenic strains. One of the main methods to produce the influenza vaccine is through fertilized embryonated chicken eggs. First, the circulating virus is reassorted with a high-growth strain (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934). The vaccine strain is selected for high growth properties and contains HA and NA derived from the circulating strain. The selected strain is then amplified in eggs and the virus is harvested and inactivated. A serious disadvantage of the method is that the virus can become mismatched due to viral adaptation to egg culture, which affects vaccine efficacy [

However, so far to date, only one vaccine, Flucelvax, has been approved by the FDA. Also, given that the vaccine was produced from egg-derived virus strains, egg adaptations may still exist in this vaccine [

Notably, the new experimental models described in this review could assist not only in understanding the virus biochemistry and physiology, but also in overcoming the current limitations of vaccine production. For example, this can be done via surface display in yeast [
