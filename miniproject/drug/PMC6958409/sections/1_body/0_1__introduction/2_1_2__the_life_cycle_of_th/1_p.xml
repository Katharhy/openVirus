<p>The Influenza virus belongs the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family, which are negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that cause respiratory diseases [
 <xref rid="B13-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. There are three types of influenza viruses, named A, B and C. The most prolific member is Influenza A, which infects a large number of hosts and is the main cause of the seasonal and pandemic influenza [
 <xref rid="B3-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Its genome is composed of symmetrical helixes in eight segments that are numbered according to their decreasing lengths. The segments encode surface glycoproteins [haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA)], matrix protein (M1), matrix ion channel (M2), viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex [composed of nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase basic subunits (PB1 and PB2) and polymerase acid subunit (PA)], and nuclear export protein (NEP/non-structural protein NS2) [

 <xref rid="B15-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These proteins, such as PB1-F2 and PA-X, are functional and are known to be immunomodulatory, modulating the host response to the virus [
 <xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The influenza A virus can be further classified into different subtypes based on their HA and NA glycoproteins. Of the 18 haemagglutinin and 11 neuraminidase subtypes known today [
 <xref rid="B17-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], only the H1, H2, H3, N1 and N2 subtypes have caused epidemics in humans [
