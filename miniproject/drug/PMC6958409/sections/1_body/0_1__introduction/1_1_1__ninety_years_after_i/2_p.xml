<p>Indeed, significant advances have been made in understanding influenza. Major mechanistic aspects of the viral infection process and of the viral life cycle have been revealed [

 <xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the fact that influenza still prevails demonstrates, unambiguously and painfully, that these drugs and vaccines are not as efficient as the vaccination and therapies of other diseases. Multiple reasons for this inefficiency in vaccination and therapy exist. Influenza viruses have high mutation rates and this seems to be a primary hurdle for the development of efficient and effective vaccines. These mutations could also account for the rapid evolution of drug-resistant influenza strainsb (C8)(C9) [
