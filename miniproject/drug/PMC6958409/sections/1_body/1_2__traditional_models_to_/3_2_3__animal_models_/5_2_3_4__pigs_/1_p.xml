<p>Since influenza A is the main cause of respiratory disease in pigs, this animal can be used as a model to study influenza (reviewed by Rajao et al., 2015 [

The immune system of pigs is also similar to that of humans, but is not fully understood yet compared to that of other animal models. Limitations of such a model are the cost of husbandry and a larger space needed to house the animals compared to mice.
