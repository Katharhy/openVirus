<p>Ferrets rank among the best animal models of influenza. The lung physiology of the ferret is highly similar to that of humans [
 <xref rid="B35-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. They share many of the clinical symptoms presented by humans following influenza infection and are susceptible to the human influenza virus [
 <xref rid="B88-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Thus, no prior adaptation of the virus to the ferret is necessary. Furthermore, the virus transmits easily among ferrets [
 <xref rid="B88-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], recapitulating virus spread in humans. Given the similarity of the physiological response to influenza virus between ferrets and humans, ferrets have been used to study influenza proteins [

 <xref rid="B95-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] and to assess the effectiveness of anti-viral compounds at ameliorating disease progression [

 <xref rid="B96-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>,

 <xref rid="B98-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. However, the limitation of ferrets is that while they are highly susceptible to infection, intramuscular or other immunization routes with noninfectious antigen results in the poor antibody response. In the light of the importance of immunogenicity studies of existing or novel vaccines, this is a huge drawback for the use of ferrets [
