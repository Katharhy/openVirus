<p>The mouse is widely used because of its low cost, small size and ease of husbandry [

 <xref rid="B30-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, a significant drawback of the mouse model is that wild mice are in fact not susceptible to influenza because they express the antiviral protein Mx1 which is part of a GTPase family with known antiviral functions [

 <xref rid="B93-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], and laboratory viral strains require prior adaptation to mice. As such, many laboratory mice strains do not display disease following infection with primary human influenza virus isolates [
 <xref rid="B30-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This is, in part, due to the preference of human influenza A virus for α2,6-linked sialic acid receptors on the surface of the host cell. While humans express the α2,6-linked sialic acid receptor in the upper respiratory tract, where influenza virus commonly replicates, mice express the α2,3-linked sialic acid in both the upper and lower respiratory tract [
 <xref rid="B89-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Moreover, mice do not display the same clinical signs during acute viral infection as they do not exhibit fever, unlike in humans [
