<p>Due to the similar genetics and physiology of monkeys to humans, non-human primates (specifically macaques) have similar immune responses to humans in regard to influenza infection ([

 <xref rid="B30-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]). Non-human primates are used to study highly pathogenic virus strains where the host cytokine response is believed to be involved in disease pathology and to study the efficacy of drugs and vaccinations against such strains. However, high costs, complex husbandry requirements and ethical issues make such primates less accessible for routine influenza studies [
