<p>The use of mammalian and avian models seems to be a logical first choice, under the assumption that the influenza virus naturally infects these models. It is also further assumed that the infection machinery and the life cycle of the virus within these model organisms are similar to that in humans. Notably, however, these assumptions do not hold for all models. For example, while ferrets are highly susceptible to the virus and are a good model from this perspective [

Thus, although mice are widely used as a model organism for influenza, primarily because it is cost-effective and permissive for genetic manipulation and has many mutant and transgenic animals available, mice might not be the ideal model for studying influenza due to differences in disease pathogenesis and limited infective viral strains [
 <xref rid="B30-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Also, in some monkeys, while the virus does replicate in pulmonary cells, seasonal strains do not cause pathogenic symptoms (unless highly virulent viral strains are used) [
 <xref rid="B30-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Thus, as even nonhuman primates cannot fully reproduce human viral infection, there is no optimal animal model system that manifests all aspects of the human disease.
