<p>Therefore, to study the properties and functions of viral proteins, either the intrinsic features or those that appear following interaction with other proteins (viral or human), isolated systems, including in vitro systems have been applied. Influenza proteins have been expressed and purified as recombinant proteins from different sources, including bacteria and mammalian cells. Most proteins were assayed in vitro and some were crystalized [

These experimental systems are not unique to viral proteins, but are rather common techniques in biological research and will therefore not be described here. Yet, the study of the biochemistry of each viral protein could be advanced through the use of the alternative models discussed in the review.
