<p>The first animals that investigators were able to infect with the human influenza virus were ferrets [

 <xref rid="B29-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Yet, as convenient experimental models were required, rodents, including mice, hamsters, cotton rats and guinea pigs, became widely used [
 <xref rid="B30-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Pigs are also used because the pathology of influenza in their lungs is similar to its manifestation in humans [
 <xref rid="B31-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Pigs are even suspected as intermediate hosts of the virus [
 <xref rid="B32-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Models that are evolutionarily closer to human, and therefore considered more relevant, are nonhuman primates, such as various macaques (Rhesus, Pig-tailed and Cynomolgus), Squirrel monkeys and African green monkeys (reviewed in Bouvier et al., 2015 [
 <xref rid="B29-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and Thangavel et al., 2014 [
 <xref rid="B33-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). In addition, avian models, such as chickens, are also used, but mainly for veterinary purposes [
