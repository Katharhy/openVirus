<p id="Par2">Infectious diseases, from Spanish flu to COVID-19 are frequently emerging and posing greater global health threats than terrorism resulting enormous losses to individual health, economies and social wellbeing [

Over past 20 years, infectious diseases related to coronavirus (CoV) including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS- 2002; 8000 infected cases and 774 deaths), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-2012; 858 casualties and 2494 infected cases) and ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are repeatedly evolving from zoonotic reservoirs to brandishes severe health calamity on global inhabitants [

Few months back in late December 2019, pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan China which later named as COVID-19 due to immersion of new strain of CoV namely SARS CoV-2 as causative agent of respiratory tract infection. Due to its vibrant outreach around the globe, World Health Organization (WHO) declared in January 2020 public health emergency of international concern and consequently pandemic in March 2020 [

Though technologies are available to detect causing agent rapidly with targeting therapeutic agents but still there is need to have diagnostic tools that provide aid in early detection. Here we provide an overview on the CoV outbreaks and contribution of technologies with the emphasis on the future management for detection of such infectious diseases.
