<p id="Par3">Coronavirus (CoV) are circulating in nature since creation of world but their origin is unclear although they exists in animals and human as well. Scientific efforts disclosed their hierarchy and include them in order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, subgenus Sarbecovirus and genus and genus beta Coronavirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Under microscopic observation, these viruses look like tennis ball with prickle like projection on their outer covering or membrane which give them crown like shape as well as helps them to attach and enter in the host (animals or human) system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. After entering into the host cell, they releases their RNA genome and using host cell machinery produce their progeny in massive quantity which not only infect host organ/cells to make them ill but on expulsion transmits to another host to cause infections thus known to be infection causing agents [

CoV infections including respiratory, bronchitis, pneumonia, renal impairment, gastrointestinal, and neurological diseases are prevalent in both animals and human. Prevalence of CoV infection in human was marked with mild common cold (B814) in 1965. Since then to 2019, seven new strains of CoV belong to genus alpha and beta coronaviruses are being identified to cause human infectious diseases globally (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Out of seven, four strains including 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1 are maintained and circulating within human population with mild cold/infection
