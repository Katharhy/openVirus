<p id="Par13">Since, its discovery Crispr technology provide cutting edge routes for the disease diagnosis, prevention and cure using indispensable tools including sgRNA and Cas enzyme. Currently specific high sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking (SHERLOCK) relied on Cas13 enzyme has been used for detection, monitoring and genotyping of COVID-19 viral signatures from samples [

Conversely, DNA endonuclease targeted CRISPR transreporter (DETECTR) also used to sense target RNA sequence from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs from COVID-19 patients with help of sgRNA and Cas12. Notably, the future development of portable microfluidic based cartridges and reagents to run the assay could enable point-of-care testing outside of the clinical diagnostic laboratory [
