<p id="Par11">In recent COVID-19 outbreak, DNA sequencing technology as molecular diagnostic tool has shown a remarkable paradigm in the early disease diagnosis, medication and management of infections via identifying mutated or drug resistance genes. MinION, (nanopore sequencing) is one of portable DNA sequencing gadget which detect causative SARS-CoV-2 sequence within one hour through extraction of nucleic acid from samples followed by amplification and bioinformatics analysis [
