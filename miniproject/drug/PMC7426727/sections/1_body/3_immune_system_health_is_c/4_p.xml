Additionally, the risk of dying can also increase when the baseline inflammatory state that occurs with chronic diseases is challenged by exposure to an infectious agent, such as SARS-CoV-2. The most severe consequences from COVID-19 and influenza stem from a degraded/dysfunctional immune system, and the exploitation of the degraded immune system by the virus. For a healthy immune system, the virus would be unable to overcome its strong defenses, and would be neutralized.
