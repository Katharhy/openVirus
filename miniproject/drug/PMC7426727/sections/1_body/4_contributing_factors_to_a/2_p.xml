<p id="p0085">A recent study examined the adverse impacts of toxic lifestyle, iatrogenic, biotoxic, environmental/occupational, and psychosocial/socioeconomic factors on the health of the immune system directly or indirectly (
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Kostoff et al., 2020</xref>). Depending on how one aggregated the results, there were anywhere from 1000â€“2000+ factors that contributed to immune system degradation, and that number was viewed as a gross under-estimate. Some of the factors in this recent study that were shown repeatedly to degrade the immune system include:
