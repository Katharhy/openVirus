<p id="p0135">Assume that any combination of three of the four hazardous elements would not be sufficient to result in pneumonia, and would result in no symptoms. Assume further that four experiments are conducted to identify the marginal impact of each constituent: each experiment starts with three of the four elements, and the fourth is added. In each of the four experiments, the final result using all four elements will be fatal pneumonia. One could conclude (when assigning responsibility/causation for the death to a single entity) that the marginal impact of adding the fourth element was fatal pneumonia.</p>
