 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, the four experiments are reflected by the four mixtures shown. In all four cases, the element shown at the top of the mixture is the fourth element added in the experiment. So, for the first experiment (reflected by mixture M
 <sub>a</sub>), where C4 (SARS-CoV-2) was the final element added to the mixture, one could conclude that SARS-CoV-2 was the cause of death, since its addition enabled the emergence of fatal COVID-19. Test kits would show the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in biological samples, and that could be used as confirmation.
