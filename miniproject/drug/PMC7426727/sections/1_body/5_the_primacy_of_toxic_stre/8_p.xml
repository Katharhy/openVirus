<p id="p0150">This procedure would be repeated for all four elements, and show that if one chose to select a single element for cause of death, 
 <italic>it could be any of the four based on the marginal impact</italic>. So, once the choice of variables is switched from the combination of constituents as a single element to each constituent of the combination as a single element (in the present case, where the switch was made from one variable (combination of constituents) to four variables (each combination constituent)), cause for death could be assigned to 
 <italic>any</italic> of the four elements. The process is quite arbitrary: the assignment of death to any single entity could be considered a political act, done for political (and financial) reasons, and not for scientific reasons!
