<p id="p0055">The mammalian virome includes diverse commensal and pathogenic viruses that evoke a broad range of immune responses from the host. A subset of the virome (in particular, zoonotic viruses that appear to be pathogenic in humans) challenges the immune system continually. This process appears to be a dual-edged sword. Healthy immune systems respond optimally to viral challenges and are further strengthened by the continual challenges, offering additional protection against other viral challenges. Degraded/dysfunctional immune systems over-respond or under-respond to viral challenges, and are thus unable to prevent the occurrence of a life-threatening clinical course.</p>
