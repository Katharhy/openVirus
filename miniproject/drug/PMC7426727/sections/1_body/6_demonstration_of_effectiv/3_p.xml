<p id="p0180">Thus, a more protective quarantine (for the current pandemic and against future pandemics) would be to impose effective ‘quarantines’ for the public against the intrinsically toxic constituents of the virus-toxic stressors combination nexus (e.g., pesticides, PFOS, PCBs, nerve agents, wireless radiation, etc.). Whether they would have the same very-short-term benefits as the present quarantine/lockdown is questionable, given the lag times before these preventive measures become effective. From the long-term perspective, the broader quarantine on the constituents of the combination of toxic stressors would be very protective against future viral attacks on the most vulnerable demographic, including protection against the annual influenza infections.</p>
