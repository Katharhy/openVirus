<p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a respiratory disease that led to the fatal Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In late 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was first reported in Wuhan, China that later led to a true crisis worldwide (Huang et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Coronaviruses (CoVs) are large enveloped non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses. They generally cause mild enteric and respiratory diseases in animals and humans (Glass et al., 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Most human CoVs, such as hCoV-229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1 usually cause only mild respiratory diseases (Fouchier et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV-2 (Fouchier et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). In contrast to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2-infected patients rarely show prominent upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms. On presentation, most infected individuals exhibit dry cough (83–99%), and dyspnea (59.4–82%) with findings of bilateral ground-glass opacities on radiographic images (Guo et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Huang et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In most severe cases the characteristic symptom is respiratory distress (~55%) Grasselli et al.
