<p>Considering the significant SARS-CoV-2 related risk factors for hospitalization and mortality among patients with metabolic diseases, including obesity, arterial hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes that may reflect overall activation of the RAS system, modulation of RAS activation through the ACE2/(Ang1-7)/MAS pathway should be considered for treatment of this disease. Furthermore, our clinical observation and published clinical data suggest a unique clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 patients: most patients present with relatively preserved hemodynamics and lack of lactic acidosis. But they have respiratory distress, appear to be in a hypercoagulable state (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Menter et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), exhibit progressive renal failure (Cheng et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), have stroke like features and myocardial injury (Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Clinical observational studies indicate that in most cases the respiratory distress occurs many days (in general about 14 days) after the infection, suggesting that this may not be a direct effect of the initial viral infection but rather the hosts reaction to the loss of function of ACE2 and dysregulation of Ang II/ACE2 pathways as well activation of host proteases. Our central hypothesis is that the binding of the coronavirus spike protein to ACE2 leads to shedding of ACE2 receptors by various proteases, which in turn leads to the loss of protective function of the ACE2/MAS axis in the lungs and other organs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition to the loss of protective function of ACE2/MAS, activation of classical pathway (ACE/RAS/Ang II) and alternative pathways through tissue specific proteases, including cathepsins, chymase-like proteases, leads to an excessive production of Ang II at the tissue level. This process may further shift the balance of protective Ang (1-7)/MAS and ACE2 function to the detrimental effects of increased Ang II contributing to lung epithelial and endovascular injury. Therefore, induction of the downstream pathway of ACE2, by activating the ACE2/Ang1-7/MAS axis may prove a useful strategy in preventing lung and cardiovascular damage associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections. Because decreased ACE2/MAS activity augments the Ang II/AT1R activity and its hazardous consequence on increased pulmonary vascular endothelial/epithelial injury and lung pathology. Inhibiting the activity of proteases necessary for cleavage of viral spike proteins: for instance inhibition of enzymatic activity of ADAM17 and TMPRSS2 could serve as other novel therapeutic targets. This could potentially block viral interaction with the receptor and its entry into the cells. Identification of specific proteases and development of inhibitors targeting proteases necessary for cleavage of spike proteins may prove to be viable. In addition, exploiting the protective effect of Ang1-7 or its analogs, such as AVE0991 AVE0991 (Pinheiro et al., 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) against deleterious effect of increased Ang II is feasible and might be effective for the symptomatic treatment of these patients.
