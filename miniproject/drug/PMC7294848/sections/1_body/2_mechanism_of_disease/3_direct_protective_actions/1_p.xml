<p>In addition to its protective role in the cardiovascular system, ACE2 has a direct protective role in alveolar epithelial cells. In the lungs ACE2 has numerous physiological functions, most of which are protective against lung injury. Similar to the endothelial site, ACE2 degrades the octapeptide Ang II by removing a single amino acid from the C-terminal end of the peptide to generate the heptapeptide Ang1-7. Our laboratory and others have shown that ACE2 protects against lung injury by: (a) degrading Ang II, which is vasoconstrictive and proapoptotic for lung epithelial cells (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) and profibrotic (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Uhal et al., 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), and (b) by producing the peptide Ang1-7, which inhibits the actions of Ang II through binding to the MAS receptor (Gopallawa and Uhal, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In support of this protective role for ACE2, pharmaceutical preparations of recombinant ACE2, when administered to experimental animals, protect against lung cell death, inhibit acute lung injury and prevent lung fibrosis after chronic injury to the lungs (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Rey-Parra et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). As further evidence, the application of a specific competitive inhibitor of ACE2, DX600, to primary cultures of isolated ACEs increases the level of Ang II released into the serum-free culture medium by autocrine mechanisms, reduces the amount of released Ang1-7 and, importantly, induces apoptosis inhibitable by the AT1 receptor blocker (Menter et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Thus, functional ACE2 normally expressed by alveolar epithelial cells can be viewed as a critical survival factor for these lung cells. In addition, the enzymatic product of ACE2, the Ang1-7, itself protects against lung cells death by antagonizing that actions of Ang II (le Tran and Forster, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). If Ang1-7 is applied to cultures of lung epithelial cells, it can prevent lung cell death in response to either Ang II or the ER stress inducer MG132 (Nguyen and Uhal, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The Ang1-7 receptor MAS and the JNK-selective phosphatase MKP-2 appear to be critical in this protective action of Ang1-7 response, becauses iRNAs or antisense knockdowns of MAS or MKP-2 can eliminate the ability of Ang1-7 to prevent lung cell death (Gopallawa and Uhal, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Indeed, Ang1-7 itself and congeners of the peptide, such as cyclic Ang1-7 (Gopallawa and Uhal, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), have already been shown to protect the lungs in preclinical models of acute lung injury (Simoes e Silva et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Gopallawa and Uhal, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).
