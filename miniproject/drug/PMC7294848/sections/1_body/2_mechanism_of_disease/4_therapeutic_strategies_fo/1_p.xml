<p>Currently, there are no targeted drugs specifically against SARS-CoV-2. Recent efforts have been put forward of drug repurposing by screening of various available antiviral agents with the aim to identify possible treatments. Among those, lopinavir, originally used for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus, was identified to have potential antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, a randomized-controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection showed no benefit of lopanavir (Cao et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Other studies suggested that remdesivir (GS5734) an inhibitor of RNA polymerase, originally developed to treat Ebola infections, has 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against multiple RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (Mulangu et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Experimental data suggested that at micromolar concentration of remdesivir and chloroquine potentially blocked virus infection (Wang M. et al., 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Current clinical trials are ongoing to assess the efficacy of remdesivir treatment alone or in conjunction with chloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are considered inhibitors of endosomal trafficking of SARS-CoV-2, these drugs are used as potential therapeutics. Both drugs are antimalarial drugs that are also used as antiinflammatory drugs in various autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, Lupus erythematosus, and respiratory diseases such as sarcoidosis (Martin et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Talreja et al., 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Despite the high media coverage, currently, there are no randomized clinical trials to support their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it is conceivable that their efficacy may vary in different stages of virion life cycle and virus interaction with the host. These drugs may be beneficial in early stages of the infection, when the virus requires endosomal uptake. In fact, during the preparation of this manuscript, several non-randomized clinical trials have suggested a lack of significant efficacy of antimalarial drugs in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Magagnoli et al., 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
