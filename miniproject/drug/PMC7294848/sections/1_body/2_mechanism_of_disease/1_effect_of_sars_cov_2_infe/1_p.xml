<p>Because of the central role of ACE2 receptor as the viral entry point, the understanding of the functional role of ACE/angiotensin receptor (AT) and ACE2/MAS receptor is critical for the understanding of the pathophysiological changes due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding of the molecular downstream effects of angiotensin (Ang) on cellular signaling may explain the observed clinical picture of severe respiratory distress, myocardial injury, renal failure, and increased mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection among the aging population and subjects with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (Zhou et al.,
