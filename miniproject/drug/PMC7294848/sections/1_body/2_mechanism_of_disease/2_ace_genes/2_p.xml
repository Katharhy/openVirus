<p>It is very important to note, especially in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, that besides the classical RAS/ACE mediated Ang II formation, formation of Ang II can occur through alternative pathways by various proteases. These include tryptensin, cathepsin G, tonin, kallikrein, neutral endopeptidase, and chymase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). These proteases can cleave Ang I to form Ang II (Kramkowski et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Lorenz, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Becari et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Uehara et al., 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Most of these proteases are localized in specific tissues (lungs, myocardium, arterioles, kidney, or brain) and are not sensitive to ACE inhibitors. Interestingly, targeted inhibition of ACE using ACE inhibitors, only decreased Ang II levels for a short period of time, and Ang II levels return to baseline 1 week after treatment with ACE inhibitors (Mento and Wilkes, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). Furthermore, it has been shown that application of ACE and Ang II receptor blocker (ARB) inhibitors in animal models leads to an increase in the expression of ACE2 (Ishiyama et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Part of protective function of ACE and ARBs is considered to be due to upregulation of ACE2. Therefore, it is possible that upregulation of ACE2 may provide more available receptors for viral entry and hence a higher viral load associated with poor prognosis (Chu et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). This also suggests that in subjects, who are on ACE inhibitors, the activation of alternative pathways may play a significant role in the formation of Ang II (Diaz, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Currently, a clinical trial is ongoing to assess the effect of ACE/ARB inhibitors (

If the alternative pathways in the formation of Ang II are important, it is highly unlikely that the ACE/ARB inhibitors play a role on the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
