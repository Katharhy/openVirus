<p>ACE2 acts as a ligand through its recently identified MAS1 receptor, which is a G-protein–coupled receptor (Donoghue et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Santos et al., 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). ACE2 is a monocarboxypeptidase, which cleaves Ang I into a non-apeptide, Ang 1-9 and Ang II into a heptapeptide, Ang 1-7 (Santos et al., 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Marian, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Both peptides have vasodilatory and antiproliferative and protective functions by activating the MAS/G receptor. The ACE2/Ang 1-7/MAS1 axis provides an endogenous counter-regulatory mechanism within the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) that balances the deleterious effects of the ACE/Ang II/AT1 receptor axis (Santos et al., 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Mice deficient in MAS1 or ACE2 receptors exhibit cardiac systolic dysfunction, increased blood pressure, myocardial interstitial fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction, and exhibit increased susceptibility to intravascular thrombosis, chronic kidney disease, metabolic abnormalities, and various other biological abnormalities that regulate the cardiovascular system (Yamamoto et al., 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Tikellis and Thomas, 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). ACE2 activation prevents the deleterious effects of Ang II on the cells and organisms, such as cell death, fibrosis, angiogenesis, and thrombosis formation (Fraga-Silva et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Tikellis and Thomas, 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Recent autopsy results on SARS-CoV-2 infected humans showed diffuse alveolar damage with massive capillary congestion accompanied by microthrombi in vascular beds but a paucity of inflammatory infiltrates (Menter et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). However, pathological examination on autopsies have not investigated if SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to total destruction of ACE2 receptors on the alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells. Interestingly, in an animal model of SARS-CoV, Oudit et al. found a marked decreased ACE2 expression in the heart of infected mice (Oudit et al., 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The key product of ACE2 activity is Ang-(1-7), which is considered a biologically active member of the RAS. By binding to MAS, it induces many beneficial actions, such as vasodilation, inhibition of cell growth, and protection from alveolar epithelial cell injury. In addition, it has antifibrotic, anti-thrombotic, and antiarrhythmogenic effects (le Tran and Forster, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Schindler et al., 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). It has been shown that the ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-MAS axis has a protective effect on the brain and prevents ischemic stroke (Jiang et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).
