<p>Sequence analysis suggests that ACE and ACE2 exhibit 42% amino acid homology and ACE2 has evolved through gene duplication (Donoghue et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). ACE2 maps to chromosome Xp22, spans 39.98 kb of genomic DNA, and contains 20 introns and 18 exons (Turner et al., 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). The ACE2 gene encodes a type I membrane-bound glycoprotein composed of 805 amino acids (Marian, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Functional domains include a C-terminal transmembrane anchoring region (carboxy-terminal domain), N-terminal signal peptide region and an HEXXH zinc binding metalloprotease motif (catalytic domain) (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Cerdà-Costa and Xavier Gomis-Rüth, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). ACE receptors are expressed in almost all tissues, while ACE2 is expressed on alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells. ACE2 is highly expressed in capillary rich organs such as lungs and kidneys but also in the gut and brain (Hamming et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Tikellis and Thomas, 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Roca-Ho et al., 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Genetic polymorphisms of ACE and ACE2 are associated with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetes (Crackower et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Ramachandran et al., 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Jang and Kim, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Fehr and Perlman, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Despite the structural homology between ACE and ACE2, they have divergent physiological function. ACE regulates the Renin Angiotensin Aldesterone system (RAS). ACE2 counterbalances the deleterious effect of the ACE/RAS pathway through its downstream ACE2/Angiotensin (1-7)/MAS axis. The critical role of RAS has been shown in the pathogenesis of metabolic inflammatory diseases (de Kloet et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Classical activation of angiotensin II depends on renin and ACE activity. Prorenin (a 46KD protein) is the inactive precursor of renin. Upon activation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JG) of the afferent arterioles of the kidneys, specialized proteases cleave prorenin to renin. Once renin is released into the blood, it cleaves angiotensinogen into angiotensin (Ang) I. Ang I is physiologically inactive, but acts as a precursor of Ang II. The conversion of Ang I to Ang II is catalyzed by ACE. ACE is expressed primarily in the vascular endothelium of the lungs and kidneys (Wakahara et al., 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), but also on the epithelium of the lungs and upper respiratory system. After Ang I is converted to Ang II, it binds to angiotensin II type I (AT) and type II receptors in the kidney, adrenal cortex, arterioles, and the brain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Ang II acts on the adrenal cortex to stimulate the release of aldosterone (Xue et al., 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), leading to sodium and water retention. While the effects of Ang II are rapid, the effects of aldosterone are retarted due to slower effects on downstream targeted gene transcription. The overall physiological net effects of RAS activation is an increase in total body sodium, total body water, and increased vascular tone. Furthermore, the binding of Ang II to AT receptors results in vasoconstriction (Gustafsson and Holstein-Rathlou, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), endothelial injury (Watanabe et al., 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), endovascular thrombosis (Tay and Lip, 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) and increase blood volume. Increased Ang II is associated with hypertension and accelerated thrombosis in arterioles by activating the coagulation cascade (both thrombin and platelets) (Senchenkova et al., 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Singh and Karnik, 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Interestingly, the thrombogenic effects of AngII on the platelets was not reversible by application of aspirin (Jagroop and Mikhailidis, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). At the cellular level, angiotensin II induces various signaling pathways, including serine/threonine kinase, ERK, JNK/MAPK as well as PKC (Malhotra et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Studies have shown that Ang II effectively induces IL-6 and TNF-α, possibly through serine tyrosine kinases, ERK/JNK MAPK activation, G protein coupled receptor activation or through interaction with mineralocorticoid receptors (Funakoshi et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Han et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Ruiz-Ortega et al., 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Luther et al., 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Ang II is a potent activator of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and hence an inducer of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Garrido and Griendling, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Furthermore, Ang II activates neutrophils and macrophages flux to the affected tissues and inhibits the production of nitric oxide and hence promotes vascular injury (Kato et al., 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Nabah et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). These considerations provide new visions to develop targeted therapies, as Ang II functions as a pluripotent mediator to enhance cytokines (IL-6, TNFα, and others), oxidative injury by ROS, endothelial injury by inhibiting NO synthesis and vasoconstriction. Therefore, inhibition of only one of its targets for instance IL-6 may not provide significant therapeutic benefit in these patients. Currently, there is an ongoing clinical trial to study the effect of monoclonal antibodies against IL-6 receptor (
