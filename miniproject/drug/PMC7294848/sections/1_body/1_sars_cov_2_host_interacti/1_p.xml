<p>SARS-CoV-2 is single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus, containing ~26–32 kilobase (kb) genome. The viral envelope consists of a lipid bilayer, where the viral membrane (M), envelope (E), and spike (S) structural proteins are anchored. Unlike other corona viruses, SARS-CoV-2 does not use aminopeptidase N (APN) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) as a receptor (Raj et al., 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes a novel metallocarboxyl peptidase angiotensin receptor (ACE) 2 to gain entry into human cells (Donoghue et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Turner et al., 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Similar to other CoV, during viral entry into the host cell, the spike proteins (S) on the envelope of SARS-CoV-2 are cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits (Kirchdoerfer et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). S2 does not interact with the receptor but it harbors the functional elements required for membrane fusion of the virion. The S1 protein/receptor interaction is the pivotal determinant for SARS-CoV-2 to infect a host species. S1 contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) and directly binds to the peptidase domain (PD) of ACE 2 to gain entry into host cells (Turner et al., 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Yan et al., 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Despite high similarity between the RBD of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, several amino acid variations are observed in the middle of the binding domain of SARS-CoV-2, which provide an increased affinity to bind to ACE2 more effectively (Wang Q. et al., 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Yan et al., 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Peptidase activity of ACE2 is critical for the virion to gain access into the host cytosol. Similar to SARS-CoV, proteolytic cleavage of S1 containing the receptor binding domain (RBD) at the C-terminus of S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 is required to initiate interaction with PD of the ACE2 receptor (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Yan et al., 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Cleavage of S1 protein is achieved by acid-dependent proteolytic cleavage by one or several host proteases, including cathepsins, transmembrane protease serine protease (TMPRSS)2, TMPRSS4, or human airway trypsin-like protease (Hoffmann et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The exact protease has not been identified. Proteolytic cleavage is followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Furthermore, it has been shown that S protein cleavage occurs at two different sites within the S2 portion of the protein, with the first cleavage important for separating the RBD and fusion domains of the S protein and the second for exposing the fusion peptide (cleavage at S2′) (Belouzard et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Binding of S1 to the ACE2 receptor triggers the cleavage of ACE2 by a disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17)/tumor necrosis factor-converting enzyme (TACE) at the ectodomain sites (Lambert et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Heurich et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Oarhe et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Additionally, TMPRSS2 cleaves ACE2 at the intracellular C-terminal domain (Heurich et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Hoffmann et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Both cleavages (ectodomain and endodomain) by ADAM17 and TMPRSS2 facilitate effective cellular viral entry. It appears that this process leads to shedding of host ACE2 receptor (Belouzard et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) that may contribute to the loss of ACE2 function and systemic release of S1/ACE2 complex.
