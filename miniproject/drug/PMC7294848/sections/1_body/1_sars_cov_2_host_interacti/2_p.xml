<p>Generally fusion with the host plasma membrane occurs within acidified endosomes that requires cleavage at S2â€² exposing a fusion peptide that inserts into the membrane. The potential beneficial effect of chloroquine on SARS-CoV-2 is due to its effect on the endosomal uptake and acidification. The process of fusion with the host membrane is followed by the formation of a funnel like structure built by two heptad repeats in the S2 protein in an antiparallel six-helix bundle facilitating the fusion and release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. The viral replication genome of CoVs contains a variable number (World Health Organization,

Two-thirds of viral RNA, mainly located in the first ORF (ORF1a/b) translates two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, and this encodes 16 non-structural proteins (NSP), while the remaining ORFs encode accessory and structural proteins (Fehr and Perlman, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The rest of the virus genome encodes four essential structural proteins, including spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein, matrix (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein (Fehr and Perlman, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). After replication and subgenomic RNA synthesis, the viral structural proteins, S, E, and M are translated and inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), followed by movement along the secretory pathway into the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate (Krijnse-Locker et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Fehr and Perlman, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The M protein directs most protein-protein interactions. For assembly of virus, the interaction of M protein with E protein is required to form Virus-Like Particles (VLPs), suggesting these two proteins function together to produce coronavirus envelopes.
