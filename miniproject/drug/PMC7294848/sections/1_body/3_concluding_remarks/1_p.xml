<p>Based on the importance of ACE2 as a counterbalance to the deleterious effects of Ang II, the loss of ACE2 and Ang(1-7) may be detrimental to the organism. Surprisingly, little is known about the effect of SARS-CoV-2 virus binding to ACE2 and how the viral binding on this receptor may modulate the ACE2 enzymatic activity impact its role as a “survival factor.” Critical questions that are yet to be answered include: (1) What effect does SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 have on its enzymatic activity, and on its protective actions toward lung epithelial cells and lung injury? (2) What effect(s) does SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung epithelial cells/endothelial cells have on ACE2 expression in the lungs and other organs? (3) Do known inhibitors or activators of ACE2 have any effect(s) on the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2 receptor and/or infection of lung epithelial cells? Regardless, these are questions of fundamental importance to our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology that need to be answered soon.</p>
