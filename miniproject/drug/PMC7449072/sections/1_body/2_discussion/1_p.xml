<p id="Par50">To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first clinical case in West and Central Africa of complete four-class multidrug resistance to all antiretrovirals available in resource-limited settings with complete loss of DRV/r and DTG efficacies. Of note, previous report from Cameroon showed a case of successful raltegravir-containing ART for managing a case of multidrug-class-resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, patients with similar therapeutic management within the country might merit a close monitoring to ensure a successful management in case of ART failure with multi-drug resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Fewer cases of four-class HIVDR have been recently reported mainly in East and southern African countries, with previous RAL-exposure contributing to ineffectiveness of DTG [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Though these previously reported clinical cases were attributed to multi-factorial events, the present clinical case was due to recurrent poor adherence, leading to selection and accumulation of RAMs, followed by exposure to suboptimal drug regimens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Specifically, previous exposure to RAL (a drug with a low-genetic barrier to resistance) in a context of poor adherence contributed to selecting mutations (E138KQ, G140A, Q148R) conferring cross-resistance to DTG [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In a context with 60–80% ADR after ART failure and with documented to RAL has been documented, limiting the use of RAL would preserve DTG for long-term use [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; and in case of previous exposure to RAL, transition to DTG-based regimens should be guided by GRT in people without VL-suppression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and if adopted, DTG-dose should be appropriate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition to non-adherence, consistent low CD4-cell counts (despite a relative increase of CD4 after a nadir of 39cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> is attribuable to the use of more potent antiretrovirals), high-VL since ART-initiation, and advanced-age (i.e. &gt; 60 years) are risk-factors that might have contributed to ART-failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Additionally, the recombinant virus (HIV-1 CRF18_cpx) may explain to a certain extend the rapid emergence of drug-resistance and the predictive CCR5-tropism [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The case finding calls essentially for surveillance of acquired (ADR) drug resistance to INSTI in the DTG-era [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. As patient remains clinically stable and sexually active, special patient/family-centered adherence approaches are necessary to limit risk of transmission of four-class drug resistant virus, which may have implications for scale-up of DTG-based ART in resource-limited settings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Without any active therapeutic option locally, use of innovative drug combinations consisting preferentially of enfuvirtide, MRV and ibalizumab, is highly recommended (

Also, as patients on DTG-containing regimens with high baseline VL (&gt; 500,000 copies/mL) might experience challenges in viral suppression, close monitoring as well as specific case surveillance should be required even in resource-limited settings like Cameroon [
