<p id="Par48">The second GRT (December 01, 2017) covered PR and RT regions. Detected RAMs were M41L, K70Q, V75I, Q151M, M184V and T215F for NRTI; K103N and V108I for NNRTI; and L10F, K20I, M36I, M46I, I47V, I54L, L63H, L76V, V82S and L89I for PI/r. These mutations revealed high-level resistance to all NRTIs, first generation NNRTIs (EFV and NVP) and to all PI/r, including DRV/r. Another GRT, covering HIV-1 integrase (IN) region, performed on the sample plasma aliquot, revealed major RAMs, L74I, E138KQ, G140A, Q148R, and E157Q, to integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI) including raltegravir, dolutegravir, bictegravir and elvitegravir. Viral tropism revealed a CCR5-tropic virus, defined by a false positive rate (FPR) of 60.9%, suggesting eligibility for maraviroc (MRV).</p>
