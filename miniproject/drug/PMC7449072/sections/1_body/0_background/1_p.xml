<p id="Par42">Management of treatment-experienced HIV-patients remains very challenging in resource-limited settings where drug options are limited, poor adherence is frequent, and treatment monitoring (viral load essentially) remains sub-optimal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. ART program was launched in Cameroon by May 2003, and genotyping drug resistance testing (GRT) is recommended essentially after failing a PI/r-based regimen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Following the recent World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations, most resource-limited settings, including Cameroon, are transitioning to dolutegravir (DTG)-based regimens for first-, second- and/or third-line ART [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], with no evidence of DTG-resistance reported in West-Central Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and fewer cases in East Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Of note, few studies reported lower rates of cross-resistance between raltegravir (first-generation integrase strand-transfer inhibitor) and dolutegravir (second-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitor) in Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Exposure to raltegravir has been previously reported in managing patients with multi-resistant HIV in Africa, but little is known on their effects after transitioning to dolutegarvir-containing regimens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Understanding the implications of prior exposure to raltegravir in routine clinical practice would serve as footprint for optimal ART-policies in this transition era, particularly in West and Central Africa and also in all resource-limited settings like Cameroon.
