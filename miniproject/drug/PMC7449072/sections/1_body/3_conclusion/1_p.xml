<p id="Par51">In the era of transition to DTG-based regimens in resource-limited settings, this clinical case highlights the need for routine ADR population-based surveys to understand the extent of HIVDR to INSTI. Importantly, optimised care/treatment on DTG-containing regimen, alongside adherence support and close VL monitoring, would sustain the efficacy of this therapeutic option. Finally, individual case surveillance after failure to third-line requires genotyping and policies for access to newer drugs in resource-limited settings with similar ART landscapes.</p>
