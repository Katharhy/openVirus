<p>The control of viral infection requires an optimal and innate coordinated host antiviral immunity. This response is activated by various sensors, including pattern recognition receptors (PRR), which recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Although for many viruses, viral RNA is a PAMP classically detected by different sensors, including Toll-Like Receptors (TLR)3 (which senses double stranded (ds)RNA), TLR7 and TLR8 [which sense single stranded (ss)RNA], RIG-I (which senses short dsRNA and ssRNA specific motifs), and MDA-5 (which senses long dsRNA) (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), the study of these cells in anti-CoV responses has been hampered by their general poor permissibility to the virus

 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). In that respect, although the specific PRR involved was not identified, the M protein of SARS-CoV was indeed shown to induce interferon (IFN)-β in a TLR-related-TRAF3-independent mechanism in HEK293 cells (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Regarding the lung, the differentiated Calu-3 cell line [when cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI)] is the model of choice: in that set-up, SARS-CoV infection triggered an inflammatory response characterized by increased production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, gamma interferon (IFN-γ), inducible protein 10 (IP-10), and activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). However, the kinetics of this response was extremely slow, and importantly, type I IFN, an important mediator of anti-viral responses, was undetected.
