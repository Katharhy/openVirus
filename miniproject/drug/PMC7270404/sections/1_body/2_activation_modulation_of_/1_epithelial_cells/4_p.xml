<p>As mentioned above, TTSPs can activate virus-ligands (HA and S protein), but they are also able to modulate cell signaling pathways. For example, recombinant HAT is able to activate mucin gene expression in NCI-H292 lung epithelial cells (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> in epithelial cells and in a murine model that 
 <italic>Influenza H3N2</italic> is able to upregulate mucin expression and that this is dependent on human (or mouse) HAT upregulation and TACE activity (

 <italic>in vivo</italic> that poly IC (TLR3 ligand) induces the expression of a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators (CCL2, KC, and IL-1) through the expression of TMPRSS2 (
