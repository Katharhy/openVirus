<p>In complement to the mechanism proposed above, increased lung inflammatory protease (neutrophil elastase and metalloprotease) activity has been demonstrated in ARDS (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>), with a concomitant imbalance between protease and protease inhibitors activity (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). In addition, although not yet measured, to our knowledge, in SARS murine models, we and others have shown increased protease-mediated lung damage in mice infected with 
 <italic>Influenza</italic> (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). Additionally, in a MERS-CoV murine model, it was shown that excessive complement activation was partly responsible for exacerbated lung inflammation (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>).
