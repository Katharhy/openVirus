Although the number of trials that are ongoing or “under recruitment” is expectedly very high, the range of molecules tested is relatively narrow and aimed at targeting mainly antivirals. These include remdesivir (21 hits), lopinavir/ritonavir (also used in AIDS), as well as interferons (46 hits). Also falling in that category are trials testing molecules aiming to block viral entry at the cellular surface by targeting ACE-inhibitors (32 hits) or the membrane proteases of the TTSP family (see above) using camostat mesilate (5 hits). Repurposing of non-antiviral drugs may offer new promising options, such as with Ivermectin—an FDA-approved anti-parasitic drug widely available and recently shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2
