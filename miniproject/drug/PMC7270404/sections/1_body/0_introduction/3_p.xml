<p>The following sections will give an overview of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning SARS-CoV virus infections and how lung and systemic host innate immune responses affect survival either positively, through downregulating the initial viral load, or negatively, by triggering uncontrolled inflammation. A particular emphasis will be put on the description of the host cellular signaling pathways and proteases involved with a view on tackling these therapeutically.</p>
