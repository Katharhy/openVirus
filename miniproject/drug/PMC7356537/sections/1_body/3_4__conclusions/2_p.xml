<p>Given the limited heterogeneity of data published in recent months, the potential overlapping symptomatology between ACS and SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the underestimation of ACS cases during Covid-19 outbreak, more reliable data are needed to estimate the real prevalence of ACS during this pandemic. Although reports to date suggest that cTn elevation in Covid-19 may be related more to myocardial injury or type 2 MI than to type 1 MI, consistent with our analysis, more data are needed to properly understand all mechanisms that may induce ACS in SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
