<p>A different relative risk of MI with several respiratory infections has been described by Kwong et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Incidence ratios for AMI within 7 days after detection of influenza B, influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus, and other viruses were 10.11 (95% CI, 4.37 to 23.38), 5.17 (95% CI, 3.02 to 8.84), 3.51 (95% CI, 1.11 to 11.12), and 2.77 (95% CI, 1.23 to 6.24), respectively. Additionally, Guan et al. analyzed the potential relationship between AMI and previous influenza virus infection, and found that AMI was associated with the presence of IgG antibodies to influenza virus A, B, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV1-2), cytomegalovirus (CMV), HSV-1 and HSV-2, adenovirus (ADV), rhinovirus (RV), and chlamydia pneumonia with different OR (in particular, adjusted OR for influenza A 5.5, 95% CI: 1.3–23.0; adjusted OR for influenza B: 20.3, 95% CI: 5.6–40.8) [

Those findings suggest a stronger correlation between influenza B virus infection and AMI; however, evidence on the mechanisms that may lead to different AMI rates in relationship with some viral infections are lacking. Limitations regarding laboratory testing, baseline characteristics (comorbidities and vaccinations), and clinical courses of the infections (mild or severe) may affect the estimation of the absolute risk of AMI during or after different viral infections.
