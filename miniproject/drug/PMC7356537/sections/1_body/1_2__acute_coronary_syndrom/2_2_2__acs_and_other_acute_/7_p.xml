<p>Moreover, the pooled results of the aforementioned meta-analysis from Barnes et al. demonstrated an association between influenza vaccination and a lower risk of composite CV events, with a pooled OR of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.56 to 0.91), equating to an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 29% (95% CI: 9% to 44%) against AMI [

This finding is in line with other results from another meta-analysis from Udell et al., which showed that the influenza vaccine given to high-risk patients, such as patients with CAD, reduced their risk of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) (patients treated with influenza vaccine and MACE (2.9%) vs. patients treated with placebo or control and MACE (4.7%); RR, 0.64 (95% CI: 0.48â€“0.86),
