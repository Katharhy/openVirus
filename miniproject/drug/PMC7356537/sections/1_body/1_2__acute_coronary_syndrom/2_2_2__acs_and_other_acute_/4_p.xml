<p>Two other studies have evaluated the prevalence of respiratory infections and influenza among patients with angiographically confirmed MI [
 <xref rid="B49-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and STEMI [
 <xref rid="B50-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], respectively. Ruane et al. confirmed that respiratory infections can trigger MI [
 <xref rid="B50-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and Caussin et al. showed that influenza epidemic may be associated with a significant excess relative risk of STEMI [
 <xref rid="B49-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. These results have to be underlined, since these authors only analyzed cases with angiographically confirmed MI, limiting the potential bias of other studies based on retrospective database analysis related to the inclusion of cases with myocardial injury (potentially misdiagnosed as MI), especially considering the association between cTn elevation and sepsis.
