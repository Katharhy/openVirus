<p>Acute coronary syndromes and MI were also noted to occur in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an infectious disease that afflicted a total of 8096 people in 29 countries in 2003, with a mortality around 9.6% [
 <xref rid="B54-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In a prospective study of 75 patients hospitalized with SARS, AMI was the cause of death in 2 out of 5 fatal cases [

A study from Singapore reported post-mortem examinations in 8 patients who died suddenly and unexpectedly from SARS; 1 out of 8 patient had subendocardial infarction with occlusive coronary disease (as well as AMI on presentation with SARS), while 4 patients had pulmonary thromboembolism and 1 patient developed marantic valvular vegetations, along with infarction in the heart, kidneys, spleen, and brain [

Additionally, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and has afflicted 2519 patients with 866 associated deaths (case-fatality rate: 34.4%) in 27 countries [
 <xref rid="B55-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], has been related to CV diseases. A systematic analysis of 637 MERS patients showed that 30% of cases had underlying cardiac diseases, 50% had hypertension, 50% had diabetes, and 16% had obesity [

Alhogbani reported a case of a 60-year-old patient with MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection who presented with respiratory symptoms, chest pain, TnT elevation, diffuse T-wave inversion, and severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction; acute myocarditis was then diagnosed with cardiac magnetic resonance, which excluded an ischemic cardiomyopathy [
