<p>More recent studies have documented an increased risk of MI with influenza, pneumonia, acute bronchitis, and other chest infections [

 <xref rid="B46-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Other retrospective studies suggested that hospitalization for pneumonia was associated with both short and long-term increased risk of CV events; in an analysis performed by Medina et al., 318 out of 1271 patients (25%) developed CV events over 10 years after pneumonia hospitalization [

A meta-analysis of 10 caseâ€“control studies conducted by Barnes et al. demonstrated a two-fold increased risk of AMI in patients with recent influenza infection or respiratory tract infection; a recent influenza infection, influenza-like illness, or other respiratory tract infection was significantly more likely in AMI cases, with a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 2.01 (95% confidence interval CI: 1.47 to 2.76) [

From a large American database, among 1, 884, 985 admissions for AMI from January 2013 to December 2014, influenza or other viral respiratory infections accounted for 1.1% of the patients (9885 and 11485 patients respectively) and were associated with worse outcomes and higher in-hospital case fatality (approximately 13%) [
