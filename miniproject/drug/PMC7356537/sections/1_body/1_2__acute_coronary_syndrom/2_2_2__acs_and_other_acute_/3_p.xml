<p>Vejpongsa et al. also showed that AMI patients with concomitant influenza infection or other viral respiratory infections were less likely to receive cardiac catheterization across all age groups when compared with patients with AMI alone (22% vs. 43.8% vs. 58.8%,

However, amongst those patients who underwent coronary catheterization in the three different groups, more than half required revascularization; the rate of revascularization was lower in those with concomitant influenza than those without, suggesting that clinicians had appropriately identified which patients should undergo coronary angiography [

These interesting findings should be highlighted and related to what is currently happening during this Covid-19 pandemic, given that patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus seem to undergo cardiac catheterization less, likely due to high risk of infection spreading.
