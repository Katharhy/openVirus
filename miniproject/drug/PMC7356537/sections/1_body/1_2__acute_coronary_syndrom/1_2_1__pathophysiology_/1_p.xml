<p>Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) reflect a spectrum of pathological conditions compatible with acute myocardial ischemia or infarction that are usually due to an abrupt reduction in coronary blood flow [
 <xref rid="B11-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The clinical spectrum of ACS may range from myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation (STEMI), which generally reflects an acute total coronary occlusion, to myocardial infarction without ST-segment elevation (NSTEMI) or unstable angina (UA), with or without myocardial injury, respectively [
 <xref rid="B12-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The current fourth universal definition defines myocardial infarction (MI) as the presence of acute myocardial injury, detected by an elevated cardiac troponin (cTn) value above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit (URL), in the setting of evidence of acute myocardial ischemia related to symptoms, electrocardiogram (ECG), imaging changes, or angiographic findings [
 <xref rid="B13-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, cTn I and T, regulatory components of the contractile apparatus of myocardial cells, are the preferred biomarkers for the evaluation of myocardial injury and have been used worldwide. It should be underlined that any type of myocardial injury can result in significant cTn release into the blood, but cTn elevation does not allow for discrimination between the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B14-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Several clinical conditions related to the mismatch between oxygen supply and demand, such as respiratory failure (predominantly hypoxaemia) and infectious disease (particularly sepsis), may induce or lead to myocardial injury or to type 2 MI [
