<p>Identification of type 2 MI can be challenging due to more frequent atypical clinical presentations (such as with dyspnoea), higher prevalence of comorbidities that may mask ischemia [
 <xref rid="B17-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and lower frequency of ischemic electrocardiographic findings (Q waves or new ST-T wave changes) and new regional wall motion abnormalities. Moreover, culprit lesions can be identified in a small percentage of cases by coronary angiography [

 <xref rid="B23-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In particular, the risk of MI in the context of respiratory infectious disease reaches a peak at the onset of infections and is proportional to the severity of illness [
 <xref rid="B22-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Acute respiratory failure with consequent severe hypoxaemia contributes to reduce oxygen supply and determines activation of the sympathetic system, which increases heart rate, cardiac output, and contractility, factors that can increase myocardial oxygen demand [

 <xref rid="B25-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Incidence of myocardial injury or infarction in critically ill patients may go unrecognized [
 <xref rid="B26-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], as post-mortem studies have suggested, where a prevalence of undiagnosed acute myocardial infarction (AMI) ranging from 5% to 25% in patients who died from acute respiratory failure was observed [
