<p>Another possible mechanism implicated in the association between respiratory tract infections and ACS is the pro-inflammatory state. Since this association has been established for a variety of pathogens and sites of infection, it is likely that the causal agent and the host response could have a crucial role in eliciting an inflammatory pattern that may trigger ACS [

 <xref rid="B29-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. An inflammatory state at any other site generates circulating cytokines, such as interleukins 1, 6, and 8 and tumor necrosis factor Î±, which can activate inflammatory cells in atherosclerotic plaques [

 <xref rid="B32-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] have shown that inflammatory activity in atheromatous plaques increases after an infectious stimulus. When activated, intraplaque inflammatory cells, especially macrophages and T-cells, upregulate host response proteins, including metalloproteinases and peptidases, which degrade components of the extracellular matrix and promote an oxidative burst, all of which contribute to destabilization of plaques [

 <xref rid="B34-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. When the plaque surface becomes disrupted, thrombogenic elements (collagen, phospholipids, tissue factor, and platelet-adhesive matrix molecules) are exposed, leading to the acute formation of a thrombus, which is the typical mechanism related to type 1 MI [
 <xref rid="B35-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Moreover, inflammation promotes a prothrombotic state, which could further increase the risk of microangiopathy in multiple organs [
 <xref rid="B36-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and coronary thrombosis at sites of plaque disruption [
 <xref rid="B37-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The inflammatory reaction in the coronary arteries impairs fibrinolysis through the inhibition of action of antithrombin, protein C system, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor, three major coagulation-inhibiting proteins that facilitate thrombosis [

 <xref rid="B39-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Finally, influenza viruses and other viral respiratory infections are associated with expression of genes that have been linked to platelet activation and to an increased risk of MI [
