<p>Several mechanisms that could explain the onset of acute myocardial injury related to myocardial ischemia in SARS-CoV-2 infection have been proposed. Some of them may resemble the ones identified for other respiratory infectious agents, such a pro-inflammatory state and a cytokine storm (which could cause plaque instability), or a prothrombotic state and hypoxaemia-related damage due to acute respiratory failure. The rise in cTn tracks with other inflammatory biomarkers, such as D-dimer, interleukin-6, and lactate dehydrogenase, raises the possibility that this may reflect cytokine storm more than isolated myocardial injury [

On the other hand, some reports of patients presenting with cardiac symptoms, ECG changes, or new wall motion abnormalities may suggest a different pattern, such as viral myocarditis and stress cardiomyopathy. The underutilization of coronary angiography during this outbreak due to the high infectious risk makes it more difficult to establish a definite differential diagnosis in many cases.
