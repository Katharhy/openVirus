<p>Furthermore, specific damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection might be related to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, which have been shown to represent the entry point into human cells for some coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 receptors are widely expressed in both the lungs and the CV system; therefore, ACE2- related signalling pathways might also have a role in myocardial injury. At the time of writing, a lot of studies are ongoing all over the world, which will hopefully tell us more about the link between ACE2 receptors, Covid-19, and CV diseases.</p>
