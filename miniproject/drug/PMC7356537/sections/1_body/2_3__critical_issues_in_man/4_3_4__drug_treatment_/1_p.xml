<p>Among drugs commonly used to treat ACS patients, care should be taken when administering antiplatelet therapy. Clopidogrel and ticagrelor have specific interactions with lopinavir–ritonavir, a combination of antiviral drugs that have previously been used to treat SARS and MERS, having inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in vitro and in an animal models [

 <xref rid="B98-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. In though in a randomized, controlled, open-label trial conducted by Cao et al., hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19 showed no benefit with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care, this drug combination is still used worldwide and is awaiting future trials that may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit [
 <xref rid="B99-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Lopinavir–ritonavir should not be used in combination with clopidogrel or ticagrelor due to their potent CYP3A4 inhibition [
