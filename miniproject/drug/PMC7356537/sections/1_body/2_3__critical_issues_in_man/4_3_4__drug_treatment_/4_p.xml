<p>Antivirals drugs used for SARS-CoV-2 infection treatment may have potential interactions with oral anticoagulants (OACs). Several case reports have highlighted the necessity of augmented doses of warfarin in patients treated with ribavirin; the international normalized ratio (INR) should be monitored carefully in these patients [

 <xref rid="B110-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Due to the inhibitory effect of lopinavirâ€“ritonavir on CYP3A4, which is involved in the hepatic clearance of some novel OACs, rivaroxaban should be avoided and apixaban should be administered at 50% of the standard dose [
