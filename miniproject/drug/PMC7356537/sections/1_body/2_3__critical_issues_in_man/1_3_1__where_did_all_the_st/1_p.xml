<p>The relevant impact of Covid-19 pandemic is related to the diagnosis and management of patients with ACS who were not hospitalized for confirmed or suspected Covid-19. Diagnosis and treatment of ACS—especially STEMI—start from the point of first medical contact (FMC), defined as the time point when the patient is initially assessed by a physician, paramedic, nurse, or trained medical personnel who can interpret the ECG and deliver medical interventions in the pre-hospital or in-hospital setting [

Prompt activation of emergency medical services (EMS) is crucial, since ischemic time duration is a major determinant of infarct size in patients with STEMI, while prompt recognition and early management are critical in reducing morbidity and mortality related to ACS [

It has been postulated that in the midst of this healthcare crisis, hospital admissions for ACS have dramatically decreased, mostly due to the fact that patients do not activate EMS because of the “do not come to the hospital” policy and due the fact that hospitals are now perceived as dangerous places. Prof. B. Casadei, Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at the University of Oxford and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) president, stated that in the worst hit areas, hospital admissions for ACS were reduced by up to 75% [

Those findings were corroborated by De Filippo et al., who performed a retrospective analysis on consecutive patients who were admitted at 15 hospitals in northern Italy for ACS. They showed that the mean admission rate for ACS during the study period (20 February 2020, to 31 March 2020) was 13.3 admissions per day vs. 18.0 admissions per day during the earlier period in the same year vs. 18.9 admissions per day during the same timeframe of the previous year [
