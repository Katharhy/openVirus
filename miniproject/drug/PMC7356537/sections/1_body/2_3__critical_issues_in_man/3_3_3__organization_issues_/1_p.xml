<p>Catheterization lab staff needs time to set up protective gear. According to latest recommendations, appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) should include gowns, surgical gloves, protective eyewear, full face shields, disposable caps, shoe covers, and a N95/99/100 mask [

Tam et al., in a previously mentioned letter, found that device times in catheterization labs were higher during the Covid-19 outbreak when compared to 2018–2019 times during office and non-office hours, respectively (catheterization lab: 33 min (IQ: range 21–37) vs. 20.5 min (IQ: range 16–27.75) vs. 24 min (IQ: range 18–30), respectively) [

Importantly, most catheterization labs have either normal or positive ventilation systems and are not designed for infection isolation, meaning that terminals must be cleaned following the procedure is needed, leading to eventual further delays for subsequent procedures [
