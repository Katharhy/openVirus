<p>During this pandemic, finding a balance between risks related to untimely treatment of ACS patients and SARS-CoV-2 infection control has become a global challenge. Commonly, regional reperfusion strategies are established to maximize efficiency in treatments, since primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)—bypassing the ED—is the routine treatment for STEMI patients [

Several trials and meta-analyses endorsed by European and American Guidelines have clearly established the superiority of primary PCI compared to thrombolysis over the years. As early as 1997, a quantitative review published by Weaver et al. based on outcomes at hospital discharge or at 30 days demonstrated that primary PCI was superior to thrombolytic therapy for treatment of patients with AMI (

 <italic>n</italic> = 1290) compared with 6.5% for patients treated with thrombolysis (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1316), representing a 34% reduction (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.46–0.94;

 <italic>n</italic> = 6763) by Boersma et al. demonstrated that primary PCI was associated with significantly lower 30-day mortality rate compared to thrombolysis (adjusted OR, 0.63; 95% CI (0.42–0.84)), regardless of treatment delay [
