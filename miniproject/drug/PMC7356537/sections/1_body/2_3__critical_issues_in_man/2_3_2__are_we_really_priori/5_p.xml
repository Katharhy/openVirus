<p>Indeed, despite Lombardy being considered an area with cluster transmission of SARS-CoV-2 since late February 2020, most 
 <italic>“hubs”</italic> are performing primary PCI without waiting for screening test results in order to avoid important delays and reliance on thrombolysis. Stefanini et al. performed a retrospective analysis on 28 Covid-19 patients who were admitted for STEMI: they found that 24 patients (85.7%) did not have a SARS-CoV-2 test result at the time of coronary angiography and that 11 patients (39.3%) did not have obstructive CAD [

In line with the aforementioned analysis, in our tertiary care center (“Ospedale Luigi Sacco”, Milan, Italy) located in the heart of the Italian epidemic, no cases of ACS requiring PCI were reported among more than 900 patients admitted for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as of May 5, 2020, suggesting a possible link between SARS-CoV-2 and type 2 MI or myocarditis–stress cardiomyopathy. A case report from Hu et al. described a 37-years-old male patient presenting with chest pain and dyspnea, with ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads, elevation of TnT, and severe depression of LV ejection fraction (27%), in which an emergency coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) revealed no coronary stenosis and a diagnosis of fulminant myocarditis was made [

Another case report from Inciardi et al. described a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 that had severe fatigue, no chest pain, minimal diffuse ST-segment elevation (more prominent in the inferior and lateral leads), an ST-segment depression with T-wave inversion in lead V1 and aVR, severe LV dysfunction, and no evidence of obstructive CAD at time of urgent coronary angiography, who was then diagnosed with acute myopericarditis [

A first case series from New York City (USA) described 18 Covid-19 patients with ST-segment elevation indicating potential AMI; among those patients, 9 (50%) underwent coronary angiography, 6 out of 9 (67%) had obstructive disease, and 5 (56%) underwent PCI [

All these findings should be underlined by considering that in such cases, thrombolytic therapy—if used—may have increased the hemorrhagic risk without adding any benefit on the ischemic side. Since reperfusion seems not to be mandatory in a great number of patients (possibly due to the previously highlighted link between respiratory infections and type 2 MI), relying on systematic thrombolysis seem not to be justified from these initial European and American reports [

 <xref rid="B88-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Hence, also based on those findings, the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI), American College of Cardiology (ACC), American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), and American Heart Association (AHA) published guidance on the management of AMI during the Covid-19 pandemic in the US [

 <xref rid="B90-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. These guidelines state that after a first evaluation in the ED to assess the infectious risks, STEMI patients should undergo primary PCI whenever possible if it can be provided within an adequate time frame from the symptoms onset and STEMI diagnosis. STEMI patients should be transferred to the catheterization laboratory as rapidly as possible, and although door-to-balloon times are expected to be longer during the Covid-19 pandemic, a primary PCI strategy should remain the first choice. Thrombolytic therapy should not be the standard of care strategy and should be limited to particular situations, such as in non-PCI capable hospital or when PCI cannot be performed within an acceptable time frame. Those latest recommendations are more consistent with general European and American Guidelines on STEMI [

 <xref rid="B91-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], confirming that primary PCI remains the reperfusion therapy of choice if feasible within an acceptable time frame from STEMI diagnosis.
