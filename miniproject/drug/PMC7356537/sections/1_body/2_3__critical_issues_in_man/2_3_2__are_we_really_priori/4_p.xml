<p>Despite this clinical evidence, to cope with the abrupt Covid-19 outbreak, case decisions were individualized at the beginning of the pandemic, taking into account the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure versus the risk of delaying diagnosis or therapy. Subsequently, Peking Union Medical College Hospital and Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital proposed recommendations in China, which are summarized as follows [

 <xref rid="B83-jcm-09-01683" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]: with regard to STEMI patients, thrombolytic therapy was recommended over primary PCI if Covid-19 was confirmed or could not be excluded within a short time, while for NSTEMI–UA, the priority was to exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection first, since door-to-balloon time is less crucial in those patients than in STEMIs. These recommendations were endorsed by Daniels et al., who stated that thrombolysis might be the best compromise of prompt reperfusion for the patient, buying time for a complete diagnosis to be made [

According to Peking’s protocol, blood tests, pharyngeal swab or sputum specimen, or blood samples should be performed for detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid before starting treatment, in addition to chest computed tomography (CT) scanning and evaluation by infectious disease specialists [

These recommendations are undoubtedly useful for minimizing and controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but data on the outcomes of ACS patients are needed to confirm that delaying treatment and use of thrombolysis as a first therapy to treat STEMI in confirmed or suspected Covid-19 patients are not associated with worse outcomes.
