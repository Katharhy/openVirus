<p>Tam et al. also postulated that many STEMI patients do not seek care at all, which may contribute to a global underestimation of ACS cases [

In Italy—particularly in Lombardy—similarly to in several other European countries and US states, the healthcare system has also been facing a huge overload, causing unbearable consequences on resources for cardiology, since the availability of ward and cardiology care unit (CCU) beds have been drastically reduced and admissions for elective procedures have been suspended (such as coronary catheterizations). The EMS is now focused on dealing with the Covid-19 outbreak, so less resources are available to cope with other emergencies such as ACS, due to limited means of support and healthcare staff, who are either sick or committed to handling the Covid-19 emergency. In order to avoid SARS-CoV-2 spreading, on 8 March 2020, the government of Lombardy identified 13 hospitals with catheterization laboratories acting as

 <italic>“spokes”</italic>, in order to gather cardiovascular emergencies in certain coronary care units (CCUs) all across the region [

 <italic>“hub”</italic> catheterization laboratory when activating EMS. Moreover, 
 <italic>“hubs”</italic> must have more than 1 catheterization lab, and at least 1 of those should be dedicated to suspected or diagnosed Covid-19 patients, so that the most appropriate protocol can be followed. Major impacts of this healthcare policy are expected, since delays in seeking and delivering care due to patient fears of contracting an infection from the healthcare system and longer times taken to reach 
 <italic>“hubs”</italic> could have harmful impacts on ACS patients outcomes.
