<p>Out of a total of 2700 PCR positive patients, 689 patients (25.5%) were acutely ill and remained hospitalized for at least 24 h. Of these 689 patients 71.1% were 60 years or older; 58.1% were male; and 32.7% were treated with RASi. Out of 689 patients 525 did not experience an outcome, whereas 164 (23.8%) experienced ICU and/or death (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Eighty-four percent of the patients admitted to ICU needed respirator treatment. Mean risk time from having been admitted for 1 day till ICU was only 2.04 further days (SD 2.29; range 0–10). Medical treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, statins, antithrombotic drugs, and RASi were equally prevalent among outcome groups, while beta-blockers and spironolactone seem unevenly distributed with higher prevalence among patients, who were admitted to the ICU or died (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Glucose-lowering drugs tended to be unevenly distributed between groups (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.087). In logistic regression analyses incorporating sex, age, risk-time, and selected medical treatment, we found that male sex, increasing age, and the use of beta-blockers independently increased odds for ICU-admission or death, but RASi treatment did not.
