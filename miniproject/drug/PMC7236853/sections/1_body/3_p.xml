<p>Current consensus [
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] recommends not changing RASi treatment in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whereas we found other heart failure medication to be of importance, probably mainly reflecting the underlying cardiac phenotype and comorbidity, our data do not suggest any significant influence from chronic RASi treatment and hence our data bring some reassurance to the consensus of not changing RASi medication. Randomized studies on RASi treatment intervention in patients at risk of COVID-19 should consider timing the intervention early in the course of the disease or well before infection, since if patients do develop ARDS they do so after a very short time period.
