<p id="p0045">Our cross-sectional study included 34 patients with HoFH (mean age: 42.53 ± 14.07 years, 55.9% female, 25 with genetically confirmed diagnosis of HoFH). The median follow-up duration in the center was 6 years. Overall, 70.6% of the cases had had documented CV disease (including aortic stenosis). All patients were on maximal doses of statins (rosuvastatin 40 mg or atorvastatin 80 mg daily) combined with ezetimibe. Fourteen (41.2%) patients were on regular weekly therapeutic LA with the clinical diagnosis of HoFH

One patient who had a severe recurrent increase in LDL-C levels after liver transplantation was on evolocumab therapy, and 1 patient was receiving inclisiran without LA, with the ORION-5 protocol. Overall, 9 (26.5%) patients were receiving new-generation LLT. Based on the findings of the survey, we can summarize the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak under 5 headings.
