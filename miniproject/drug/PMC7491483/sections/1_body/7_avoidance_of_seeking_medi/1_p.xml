<p id="p0070">Most of the study population (73.5%) reported that they would not go to a hospital even if they had a severe complaint during the COVID-19 outbreak. The picture was the same for those with a history of CV disease; 67% reported that they would avoid going to a hospital even if they had a complaint like a chest pain, which might be a sign of a fatal heart attack. Avoidance of seeking medical care was not associated with the anxiety level, the duration of follow-up in the center, and age. This striking finding of avoidance of seeking medical care in patients with HoFH was completely due to fear of contracting the coronavirus in health care services. This observation is extremely important as the study population constituted of patients with very high health literacy and highly aware patients of their own CV risk. The fear that these patients declared might be the underlying cause of the reduced and late number of admissions of acute coronary syndromes, reported during the COVID-19 breakout.
