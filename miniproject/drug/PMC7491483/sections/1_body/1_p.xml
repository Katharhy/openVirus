<p id="p0035">Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a rare chronic genetic disease with very high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels leading to early atherosclerosis.

 </xref> Aggressively reducing LDL-C levels is crucial for the survival of patients with HoFH by delaying the progression of atherosclerosis and decreasing the incidence of major cardiovascular (CV) events.

 </xref> Regular LDL apheresis (LA), in combination with standard lipid-lowering therapy (LLT), is the most effective means of lowering LDL-C. In addition, preventive lifestyle interventions including cessation of smoking, exercise, and a heart-healthy diet are fundamental for these patients.
