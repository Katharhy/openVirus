<p id="p0080">However, access to LA, which is a lifesaving therapy for patients with HoFH was significantly restricted during the pandemic. All the patients with HoFH (n = 14) on regular LA had no access to LA treatment since the emergence of the COVID-19 outbreak. The institutional apheresis center had to postpone the LA sessions as the center was occupied with COVID-19 patients. Among those 14 patients, 7 were already on additional new-generation LLT. Further evaluation of these patients who could not get access to LA during the pandemic also revealed that patients receiving additional new-generation LLT had a lower anxiety level than nonusers (85.7% vs 42.9%) (
