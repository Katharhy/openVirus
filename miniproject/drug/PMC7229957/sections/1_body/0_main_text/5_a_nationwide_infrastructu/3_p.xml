<p id="p0055">NCI is initiating a longitudinal cohort of cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, called NCI COVID-19 in Cancer Patients Study (NCCaPS). Working through the NCI clinical trials networks and NCI-designated cancer centers, our target is to enroll more than 2,000 patients of all ages with the goal of generating a comprehensive dataset of cancer types, treatments, medications, symptoms, and outcomes. The study will follow the patients for an extended period and will inform our understanding of the risks and course of the virus in people with cancer.</p>
