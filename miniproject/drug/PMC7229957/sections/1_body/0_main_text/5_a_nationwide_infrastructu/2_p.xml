<p id="p0050">Based on the widespread reports of cytokine storm associated with COVID-19, NCI is conducting a compassionate-use trial of tocilizumab (Actimra), which blocks the inflammatory protein IL-6. Cytokine release syndrome, a hyperactive immune response, is one of the potentially fatal adverse effects of cancer immunotherapies that NCI researchers are familiar with and are studying. Given their experience with this syndrome, NCI quickly launched the trial and is conducting it with adult and pediatric patients affected by cancer and COVID-19 who have severe respiratory complications thought to be caused by cytokine storm. The protocol will evaluate whether the anti-IL6R antibody will reduce time on ventilators and time in the intensive care unit for these patients. Genentech, the drug manufacturer, is making the drug available to up to 200 patients who are not able to enroll in their ongoing phase III clinical trials of the drug.</p>
