<p id="p0035">The HPV Serology Lab at FNLCR has been temporarily repurposed to work on antibody testing for the novel coronavirus. Outside scientists and companies developing tests to identify antibodies in the blood of those who have been infected and have evidence of immunity against COVID-19 have submitted tests to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Within a month, FNLCR became a major testing site to rapidly and rigorously validate the performance of those tests on behalf of FDA. It is still not clear whether the presence of positive antibodies in the blood is indicative of resistance to reinfection with the virus. This is the subject of ongoing research.</p>
