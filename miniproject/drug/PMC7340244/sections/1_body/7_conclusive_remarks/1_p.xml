<p>More than half a century after its discovery, it is frustrating to admit that KD is believed to be triggered by an infection, but that its direct unequivocal cause is unclear. Besides, at the age of 95, dr. Kawasaki remains very active and continues to support families with KD children through different nonprofit organizations. New theories about KD hypothesize that the disorder might be conceived as an autoinflammatory condition,

Even if several data might suggest that KD is an infection-related clinical syndrome, which can develop only in children with a predisposing genetic background, our knowledge on both the infectious agents involved and genetic characteristics of susceptible children remains poor. Understanding the molecular players responsible for dysregulation of the immune response in KD will foster the development of improved predictive tools and a more rational use of therapeutic agents to decrease the risk of CAA in all children with KD.
