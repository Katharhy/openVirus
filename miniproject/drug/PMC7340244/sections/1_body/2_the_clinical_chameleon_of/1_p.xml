<p>The classic diagnosis of KD has been historically based on the presence of 5 days of fever and a typical constellation of nonspecific clinical signs described in 1967 by dr. Kawasaki: upholding the diagnosis of KD requires that highly swinging fever is combined with at least 4 out of 5 "main" clinical features: [a] bilateral non-exudative conjunctivitis, [b] unilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, [c] polymorphous rash, [d] changes in the extremities (mainly in the form of angioedema) or in the perineal region (an early-onset desquamating rash) and [e] changes in the lips and/or oral cavity (dry fissured or reddened lips with a strawberry-like tongue).

Treatment of KD requires intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aspirin during the first ten days of illness, and its ultimate goal is avoiding the occurrence of CAA.
 <xref rid="b9-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Mostly in the case of resistance to IVIG, inflammatory cells reach the vasa vasorum of coronary arteries with the risk of fragmentation of the internal lamina and damage to the media, resulting in the formation of CAA.
 <xref rid="b10-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Higher values of C-reactive protein and younger age at onset are crucial points in determining respectively a failure in response to IVIG and a higher risk that the disease could be complicated by CAA.

However, despite increased awareness, the number of patients with KD presenting with incomplete or atypical features is increasing across the world. Incomplete cases of KD are characterized by less than four main clinical signs and atypical ones by a broad range of unusual clinical features, including aseptic meningitis, peripheral facial nerve palsy, liver impairment with jaundice, gallbladder hydrops, pneumonia-like disease, and even macrophage activation syndrome.
