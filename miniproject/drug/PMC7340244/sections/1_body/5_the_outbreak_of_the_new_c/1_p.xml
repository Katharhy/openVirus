<p>The latest outbreak of the new coronavirus (HCoV) infection (named SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting pandemic threat to health worldwide has required strict social containment measures since February 2020, but has also spread the suspicion that this peculiar infection might trigger KD. As a matter of fact, HCoV has been associated with many reports of KD in the past: for instance, in a prospective casecontrolled study among Taiwanese children it was isolated in 7.1% of cases.
 <xref rid="b47-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> In 2005 Esper et al. identified a novel human HCoV, named "New Haven," in the respiratory secretions from 8/11 children with KD.

 <xref rid="b49-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> The contribution of HCoV-229E infection in the development of KD was also brought in question by Shirato et al., who used immunofluorescence testing to detect virus-neutralizing antibodies in 15 patients with KD before IVIG treatment.
 <xref rid="b50-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> The first case of KD associated with a concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection was a 6-month infant hospitalized in Palo Alto (California, USA). However, the clinical significance of patient's positive testing remained unclear in the setting of KD.

 <xref rid="b52-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> In April 2020, Verdoni et al. reported a 30-fold increased incidence of KD-like syndrome in children living in the Bergamo province of Italy, after the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic began in that same area, also showing higher rates of heart involvement and general features of macrophage activation or shock syndrome. The evidence of contact with the virus was confirmed by the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in 8 out of 10 reported patients.
 <xref rid="b53-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> This study had the limitation of being based on a small case series, but suggested in-depth genetic analysis to investigate the potential susceptibility to KD after a triggering effect of SARS-CoV-2.
