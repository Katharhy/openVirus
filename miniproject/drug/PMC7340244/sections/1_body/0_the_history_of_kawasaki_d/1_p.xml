<p>Almost 60 years ago, dr. Tomisaku Kawasaki noted, for the first time, a strange association of symptoms in a 4-year-old boy who was hospitalized at the Chiba University. The child had prolonged high fever, conjunctivitis, a widespread rash all over the body, and a bright-red tongue. However, he could not explain that disease, thinking to an allergy or any infectious diseases. Antibiotics were ineffective in treating that boy's symptoms, which subsided only after two weeks, also revealing specific desquamation of the fingers and toes. One year later, another child was hospitalized with those same symptoms, and dr. Kawasaki convinced himself that a mysterious illness could affect children. In 1967 he published a 44-page report of all hospitalized patients having that illness (that he named "acute febrile mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome") in the Japanese journal "Arerugi", usually dedicated to allergology, which was based on a diligent 6-year observation of 50 patients.
