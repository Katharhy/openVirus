<p>Searching for papers dedicated to KD and published in the last 35 years through PubMed (matching the terms "KD" and "virus" or "viral infection"), a list of viral agents hypothetically associated with KD can be drawn (see 
 <xref rid="t1-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Viral respiratory infections have been commonly found at the diagnosis of KD,
 <xref rid="b21-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> but they do not seem to affect patients' response to IVIG or influence the overall outcome.
 <xref rid="b22-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The oldest reports date back to 1983 when rotavirus was found in the feces of children with KD
 <xref rid="b23-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and to 1985 when parainfluenza virus and adenovirus were encountered.
 <xref rid="b24-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="b25-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> A molecular-based adenovirus detection is relatively frequent in KD patients but should be interpreted with caution.
 <xref rid="b26-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Indeed, 24 out of 25 children with adenovirus disease mimicking features of KD had a higher viral burden compared to those with KD and incidental adenovirus detection.
 <xref rid="b27-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Anecdotal reports had been associated KD to human herpesvirus-6, parvovirus B19 and cytomegalovirus.
 <xref rid="b28-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="b31-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> However, the highest number of KD reports has been related to Epstein-Barr virus,
 <xref rid="b32-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="b33-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> while KD cases with a concomitant infection caused by measles virus,
 <xref rid="b34-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> herpesvirus,
 <xref rid="b35-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> varicella-zoster virus,
 <xref rid="b36-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> influenza virus,
 <xref rid="b37-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="b38-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> coxsackie virus,
 <xref rid="b39-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> and bocavirus are mostly isolated reports.
 <xref rid="b40-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> In particular for bocavirus, its nucleic acid was found in the nasopharyngeal, serum and stool samples from 5/16 (31.2%) patients with KD by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
 <xref rid="b41-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> A prospective study by Bajolle et al. revealed that bocavirus was present in the serum of 3/32 (9%) and in the nasopharyngeal aspirate of 7/32 (21.8%) patients with KD, who probably had a previous bocavirus infection heralding KD.
 <xref rid="b42-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Metagenomic sequencing and PCR detected torque teno virus 7 in only 2/11 (18%) patients with KD prospectively evaluated for one year,
 <xref rid="b43-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> while the most recent reports have highlighted the association of KD with Epstein-Barr virus,
 <xref rid="b44-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> parvovirus B19
 <xref rid="b45-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> and influenza virus.
