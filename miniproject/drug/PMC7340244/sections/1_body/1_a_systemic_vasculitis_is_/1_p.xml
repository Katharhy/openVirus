<p>In plain terms, KD is a systemic vasculitis that mainly and typically occurs in infants and children less than five years: the most ominous complication of patients with KD is the occurrence of coronary artery abnormalities (CAA).

Vascular lesions of KD may start in the tunica interna and externa of medium-sized muscular arteries, such as the coronary arteries, but also in arterioles, venules and capillaries, while inflammation disseminates to large arteries including the coronary arteries.

An influx of neutrophils can be observed in the early stages of KD, with a rapid transition to large mononuclear cells in concert with lymphocytes and IgA plasma cells. Destruction of the internal elastic lamina and an eventual fibroblast proliferation can occur later. This active inflammation is replaced over several weeks to months by progressive fibrosis, with scar formation and remodeling.
