<p>Ultimately, viruses may be confounding bystanders in many descriptions of KD. However, intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies sharing morphologic features among several different RNA viral families have been found in autoptic tissues of patients deceased for KD.
 <xref rid="b55-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> Rowley et al. speculated that the development of KD could follow ubiquitous RNA viruses causing an asymptomatic infection or a very mild disease in the vast majority of children, but specifically "KD" in a subset of genetically selected people.
 <xref rid="b56-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> In addition, a pilot study investigating KD pathogenesis revealed specific viral signatures in 4/7 patients with KD via high-throughput sequencing on blood specimens, although 2 were corresponding to their vaccinal history (oral poliovirus and measles/mumps/rubella vaccine) and 2 to bocavirus and rhinovirus, which could suggest a temporal association with the disease.
 <xref rid="b57-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> Different studies have also found that an imbalance in the gut microbiota might interfere with the normal function of innate and adaptive immunity, and that variable microbiota interactions with environmental factors, mainly infectious agents, might drive the development of KD in a genetically susceptible child.
 <xref rid="b58-mjhid-12-1-e2020039" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> However, to date, no definite link has been irrefutably found between any viral agents and KD.
