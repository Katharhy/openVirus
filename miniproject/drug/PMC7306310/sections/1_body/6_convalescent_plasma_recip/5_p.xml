<p>Facing the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Blood Alliance (EBA), together with the European Commission's Directorate-General for Informatics (DIGIT) and Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE), has been developing an open database hosted on a platform by the European Commission with the aim to collect, monitor, and share all information on convalescent plasma.

 </sup> Blood establishments will organize collection, enter donor data in the database to supply plasma to hospitals, and research projects and the industry; afterwards, the patient outcomes of transfusion can serve as the basis of aggregated data, reports, and pragmatic assessment of convalescent plasma effectiveness. According to the guidance document by the European Commission, the data should include gender, age, comorbidities, time point of transfusion, number, volume and antibody titer of the unit, other therapies administered, clinical symptoms (prior to transfusion, 5 days later and at discharge for survivors), serious adverse events, and length of hospitalization.
