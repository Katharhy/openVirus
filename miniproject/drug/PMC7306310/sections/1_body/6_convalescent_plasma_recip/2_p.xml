<p>Convalescent plasma administration seems to be a safe procedure free from serious adverse effects. Meticulous selection of donors can minimize the risk of TRALI. Another potentially concerning phenomenon pertains to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of coronavirus entry. This has been reported in viral diseases and refers to an enhancement of disease in the presence of certain antibodies.

 </sup> Keeping in mind the high titers of neutralizing antibodies that convalescent plasma includes against the same virus (SARS-CoV-2), as well as the previously documented safe experience in SARS and MERS, the occurrence of ADE does not seem to represent a major problem; however, surveillance is warranted.
