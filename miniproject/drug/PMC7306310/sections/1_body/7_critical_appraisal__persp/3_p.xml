<p>A pivotal and controversial point is the time of convalescent plasma administration in COVID-19; that should be as early as possible to maximize efficacy, but at the same time oriented to severe cases. To this direction, the examination of risk markers and integrating clinical (gender, age, comorbidities) and biochemical aspects in a comprehensive risk stratification can provide a valuable tool for decision making, promptly tracing those patients with forthcoming poor prognosis who would most need early intervention with convalescent plasma. Emerging markers with such potential are lymphocytopenia, elevated procalcitonin, ferritin, D-dimer, and C-reactive protein.
