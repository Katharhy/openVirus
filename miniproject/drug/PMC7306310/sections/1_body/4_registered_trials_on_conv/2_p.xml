<p>A cardinal point pertains to the timing of convalescent plasma administration in the study protocols, but the majority of studies did not provide this information. However, some studies necessitated an interval of 3 to 7 days from the beginning of illness (NCT04333251) or, less strictly, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) lasting less than 10 days (NCT04321421). Variable degrees of severity have been adopted as inclusion criteria; some studies focus on severe cases, whereas there were also studies focusing on less severe cases, as intubation (NCT04327349) or critical illness (NCT04332380) was an exclusion criterion. The total amount of convalescent plasma ranges from 1 to 3 units.</p>
