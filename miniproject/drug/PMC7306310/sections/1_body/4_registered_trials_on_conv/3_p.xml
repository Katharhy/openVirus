<p>A particularly interesting study protocol (NCT04323800) involves the use of convalescent plasma as a prophylaxis for COVID-19. According to this protocol, convalescent plasma administration will be tested within 120â€Šhours after high-risk contact exposure with a person with confirmed COVID-19. Individuals at high risk for a severe COVID-19 illness will be recruited, including elderly subjects and patients suffering from chronic conditions. This strategy of prophylaxis has been successfully implemented in the prevention of other viral diseases via passive immunity, such as the case of administration of hepatitis B immune globulin, human rabies immune globulin, and polyclonal hyperimmune globulin for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or more recently palivizumab, a humanized murine monoclonal antibody for high-risk infants.

 </sup> In addition to these studies, reports in the media have been appearing about other countries, such as Canada, starting to test convalescent plasma in COVID-19.
