<p>So far, information on immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is rather limited. According to studies in process, a detailed analysis of 9 cases with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms revealed that seroconversion occurred 6 to 12 days after onset of symptoms, while antibodies were not detectable between day 3 and 6, and all patients showed neutralizing antibodies after 2 weeks. Seroconversion coincided with a slow but steady decline of sputum viral load.

 </sup> In another study, the majority of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected persons seroconverted by 2 weeks after disease onset.

 </sup> A study on 173 COVID-19 patients showed that the presence of antibodies was less than 40% within the first week since onset, increasing to 94.3% for IgM and 79.8% for IgG since day 15 after onset, and higher titer of total antibodies correlated with worsened clinical classification.

 </sup> To further assess the time for seroconversion and its correlation with disease severity and antibody titers, additional longitudinal studies evaluating large numbers of serum samples from COVID-19 patients with a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms are needed.
