<p>In the case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), a protocol of convalescent plasma therapy for patients with the disease was established in 2015. According to this protocol, subjects with an anti-MERS-coronavirus indirect fluorescent antibody titer of 1:160 or more would be screened for eligibility for plasma donation in line with standard donation criteria, provided that they were free of clinical or laboratory evidence of active MERS infection.

 </sup> Nevertheless, challenges of this approach were highlighted in the Korean MERS outbreak where Ko et al supported that donor plasma with a neutralization activity of a titer 1:80 or more in the plaque reduction neutralization test should be adopted, whereas ELISA IgG could provide an alternative for the neutralization test in conditions where the former is not available.
