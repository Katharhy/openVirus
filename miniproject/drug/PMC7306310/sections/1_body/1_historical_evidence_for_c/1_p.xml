<p>In recent history, convalescent plasma has been successfully used in viral outbreaks and epidemics. In as early as the 1918â€“1925 Spanish influenza pandemic, studies evaluated convalescent blood products to treat pneumonia due to Spanish influenza in hospitals, presenting assessment versus a control or comparison group. A meta-analysis conducted almost a century later (2006) showed a sizable reduction in overall crude fatality rate, from 37% among controls to 16% among patients treated with convalescent plasma. Benefit was maximized among patients receiving the treatment early, namely within the first four days of pneumonia complications.

 </sup> Although these early epidemiological studies had been rather rudimentary in their design and were not blinded, randomized, nor placebo-controlled, they underlined the beneficial role of convalescent plasma that prompted modern researchers to support a role of this regimen in a possible future H5N1 influenza pandemic. Convalescent serum had also been used during the first half of the 20th century for measles,
