<p>Regarding donors, the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) Working Party set an interval of 14 days or more after full recovery and necessitated a non-reactivity of the sample for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), syphilis, and locally transmitted infections. As a means to avoid the incidence of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)—a serious condition emerging within 6 hours from transfusion—donors should preferably be either males or females who have never been pregnant, including abortions.

 </sup> On April 4, 2020, the European Commission issued the guidance document on the collection and transfusion of convalescent COVID-19 plasma, adopting similar criteria regarding donor eligibility. Notably, the titers of neutralizing antibodies for donors according to the document were set at a level greater than 1:320, although it was recognized that lower thresholds could also be effective.
