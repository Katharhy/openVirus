 </sup> first presented the experience on critically ill patients in Shenzhen (China). All patients received a single dose of 400 mL convalescent plasma from donors with neutralizing antibody titer ranging between 1:80 and 1:480. After the transfusion, the titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM in recipients increased in a time-dependent manner. Three patients were discharged, whereas the remaining 2 remained hospitalized until the end of the study, with improvement in body temperature and clinical and biochemical indices. Notably, convalescent plasma was administered relatively late during the disease in all patients, namely between days 19 and 22 of hospitalization, except for 1 patient who received the treatment on day 10.

 </sup> All patients at the time of convalescent plasma administration had detectable IgM and IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies titers ranging from 1:40 to 1:160. All titers of antibodies increased in a time-dependent manner after transfusion.
