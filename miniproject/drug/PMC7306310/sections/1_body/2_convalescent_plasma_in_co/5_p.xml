<p>In line with the published case series concerning the optimal timing of convalescent plasma administration, a recent review by Tiberghien et al

  <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
 </sup> has presented a strategy of administration for high-risk patients (older than age 70 or dependent on oxygen with a baseline oxygen saturation &lt;94%). According to preliminary remarks by the aforementioned research team, early treatment with convalescent plasma (not later than day 5) is preferred before seroconversion for SARS-CoV-2, which may occur on days 6 to 12. A regimen proposed by Tiberghien et al is the slow transfusion of two plasma units, under careful monitoring, for patients whose weight is within the 50 to 80â€Škg range. The volume is adjusted according to weight, whereas a second infusion of 2 additional units 1 or 2 days later can also be considered.

 </sup> The need for early administration is in line with observations in other diseases, such as pneumococcal pneumonia, where no benefit is noted if the antibody is administered after day 3 of the disease.
