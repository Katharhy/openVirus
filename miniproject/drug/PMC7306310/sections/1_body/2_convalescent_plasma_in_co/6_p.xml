<p>In light of the promising evidence from case series presented above, there is a clear need for randomized controlled trials on large patient numbers to evaluate the efficacy of the process. Apart from sample size and the non-comparative, non-randomized study design, numerous limitations hamper the interpretation of the aforementioned studies, such as the superimposition of effects mediated by other antiviral treatments, antibiotics, and glucocorticoids administered concomitantly with convalescent plasma. As a whole, these studies indicate that patients receiving transfusions earlier than 14 days post infection may benefit from convalescent plasma treatment.</p>
