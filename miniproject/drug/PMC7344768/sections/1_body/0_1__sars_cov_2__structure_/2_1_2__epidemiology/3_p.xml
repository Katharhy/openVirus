<p>According to the WHO situation report on COVID-19 dated 28 May 2020, a total of 5,593,631 confirmed cases with 353,334 deaths have been reported globally. The USA alone has reported 1,658,896 confirmed cases and 98,119 deaths due to COVID-19 so far [
 <xref rid="B11-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The majority of cases have been reported from European and American continents, whereas numbers are less in African and Asian continents but are increasing rapidly. Globally, cases are doubling every 4â€“5 days [

 <xref rid="B25-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. African and Asian nations are at higher risk due to their large population and poor healthcare facilities. COVID-19 has already surpassed SARS and MERS in quantity of cases and deaths, although it has a lower fatality rate than the latter two [

 <xref rid="B8-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The higher infectibility of SARS-CoV-2 can be attributed to its ability to remain infectious outside the human body for a long duration of time. Van Doremalen et al. demonstrated that under similar incubation conditions of temperature and humidity, over 7 days, SARS-CoV-2 remain viable on common surfaces such as plastic and stainless steel for 6.8 and 5.6 h, respectively [

 <xref rid="B30-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A Chinese research group has reported presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the stool of patients. This can amount to a greater severity of infectivity of the virus, as the chance of spread through urban sewage is always there [
