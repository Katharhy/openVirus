<p>COVID-19, SARS and MERS share a number of common symptoms, fever, dry cough, dyspnoea and bilateral ground-glass opacities in the lungs [
 <xref rid="B42-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Discomfort in breathing is also reported among the patients. Less common symptoms are headache, fatigue, chest tightness and diarrhea [
 <xref rid="B9-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Previously, diarrhea was reported in patients suffering from MERS but not SARS [
 <xref rid="B9-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It was reported from blood examination of the patients that they also had leucopenia, mild lymphopenia, elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT) and α-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase (α-HBDH) [

 <xref rid="B42-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In acute cases, it could lead to pneumonia, liver damage, kidney failure and death [

 <xref rid="B43-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Acute liver damage in patients with SARS or Influenza has been reported in the past [
 <xref rid="B24-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Severe cases of COVID-19 yield multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, acidosis and cytokine storms in the body which may lead to death [
 <xref rid="B44-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. COVID-19 patients also exhibited bilateral focal consolidation, ground-glass opacities, lobar consolidation and diffused patchy consolidation in chest radiography [
 <xref rid="B4-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The three viruses have similar zoonotic transmission from mammals to humans but unlike SARS and MERS, SARS-CoV-2 rarely causes runny nose and gastrointestinal symptoms [
