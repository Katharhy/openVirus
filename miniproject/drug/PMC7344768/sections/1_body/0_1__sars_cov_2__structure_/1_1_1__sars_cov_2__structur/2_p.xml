<p>The mutation rates in RNA viruses are as high as one million-fold greater than their host. Mutation-selection forces keep the virus close to threshold beyond which they may go extinct due to large scale deleterious mutations [
 <xref rid="B12-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, mutation rates are high, including spike glycoprotein that is the ACE2 binding region important for virus entry into the cells. Other highly mutated regions are ORF1ab, ORF8 and NSP-1 alongside the spike glycoprotein region [
 <xref rid="B13-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These overwhelming mutations are the leading cause of concern in the process of development of therapeutic interventions. Also, any gain of function mutation at vital cellular entry pathways of SARS-CoV-2 can make the virus more infectious. Furthermore, the combination of antivirals administered to COVID-19 patients may enhance the mutation rate [

The prevalence and genetic diversity of SARS-CoVs in humans, bats and other mammals and their proximal existence will cause frequent recombination and spillovers and will become the source of future infections as noted by Dr. Zheng-Li while describing the genetic evolution of coronaviruses [
