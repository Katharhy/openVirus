<p>The infection caused by novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 has turned into a pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from the samples of 4 patients in Wuhan on 21 December 2019 [
 <xref rid="B1-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive, single-stranded RNA virus [
 <xref rid="B2-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It appears that SARS-CoV-2 is an animal coronavirus that originated from a bat and phylogenetically belongs to the genus beta-coronavirus (subgenus: Sarbecovirus) and shares considerable similarities to human coronaviruses responsible for earlier outbreak: SARS and MERS [
 <xref rid="B1-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.3%, 89%, and 82% nucleotide similarity with bat CoV RaTG13, SARS-like CoV ZXC21, and SARS-CoV, respectively [
 <xref rid="B5-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Though SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS with 77.2% amino acid similarity [
 <xref rid="B4-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The spike proteins of both are homologous with 80% identity and are responsible for binding to the receptor, and membrane fusion. SARS-CoV-2 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mammalian receptor like SARS-CoV for cellular entry for human-to-human transmission [
 <xref rid="B3-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, SARS-CoV-2 possesses a longer spike protein in comparison to SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B3-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Being lineage B (subgenus Sarbecovirus) of betacoronaviruses, that includes SARS-CoV-2 and Bat SL-CoV-WIV1, their primary mode of transmission is through droplet and fecal-oral route [
 <xref rid="B7-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 infects the lung alveolar epithelial cells using receptor-mediated endocytosis via angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) as an entry receptor [
 <xref rid="B2-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Further, the higher rate of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 has been attributed to higher rigidity of the outer protein coat which makes it more resilient as compared to SARS and MERS [
 <xref rid="B8-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The higher infectibility of SARS-CoV-2 could also be due to its lower fatality rate as compared to SARS and MERS [
 <xref rid="B9-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. SARS affected 29 countries whereas MERS affected 27 countries and were responsible for 774 and 858 deaths, respectively, around the globe [
 <xref rid="B10-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The latest situation reports by World Health Organization (WHO) on the COVID-19 pandemic states that it has already claimed more than 353,334 lives worldwide which is manifold greater than the total amount of fatalities of SARS and MERS combined [
 <xref rid="B3-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The initial mode of virus entry from bats to humans at Huanan Seafood Market is still not clear [
 <xref rid="B3-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is expected that an intermediate organism might be involved in this transmission.
