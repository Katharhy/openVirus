<p>Presently, several research groups are engaged in the development of a non-human primate model to study SARS-CoV-2 infection for testing potential vaccines and antivirals. In addition to providing a better understanding of virusâ€“host interactions, it will prove instrumental in drug and vaccine development [

African Green, Rhesus and Cynomolgus Monkeys have been previously tested for successful replication of SARS virus [

Though the infection model for SARS-CoV-2 in these non-human primates shows successful replication, the African green monkey appears as a better model as it requires lower, close to natural dose for infection and develops advanced respiratory disease [
