<p>It can be concluded that among all other factors, delayed response from responsible agencies, putting economic and geopolitical benefits above human life and ill-awareness among the agencies as well as the general public has helped shape the COVID-19 epidemic into a pandemic.

Also, is the recurrent infection, reinfection or second attack of SARS-CoV-2 possible or not and with what frequency? </p>
