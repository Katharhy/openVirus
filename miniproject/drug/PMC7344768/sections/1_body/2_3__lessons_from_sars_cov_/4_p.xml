<p>The development of fast, reliable and cost-effective diagnostic methods is a matter of priority. To find a cure for COVID-19, vaccine development and repurposing of drugs as antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 have been started, but a major hurdle is the unavailability of a suitable animal model to study the disease and pre-clinical trials [

In absence of any reliable treatment, identification in infected individuals and their subsequent isolation is the best bet to contain the pandemic. Current diagnostic approaches for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections are based on RT-PCR that detects the presence of viral nucleic acid in the patient sample or a serological approach which detects IgG or/and IgM antibodies formed against the causative viral antigens. Another serological approach relies on detecting the SARS-CoV-2 antigens but has not been utilized much for development of diagnostic kits/methods. Though RT-PCR based diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 remains the benchmark for diagnosis of the disease, faster serology based diagnostic tests are being used to screen SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals, owing to its ability to give a result in a shorter time compared to RT-PCR based methods, and also its ease of implementation in mass testing for SARS-CoV-2. The diagnostic kits approved by the FDA, USA are based on detecting IgG and IgM antibodies produced in the body in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The registered serological kits claim to provide a result in 15 min in the laboratory.
