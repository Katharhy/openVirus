<p>The response to COVID‐19 is rapidly evolving and gastroenterologists should regularly review local, institutional and international recommendations. Despite limited data, patients with IBD are theoretically at increased risk of COVID‐19 due to proximity to medical facilities and immunosuppression. There are therefore several recommendations that clinics and patients can implement to reduce risks. 
 <list list-type="order" id="apt15779-list-0007">
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <italic>Optimise health and treat malnutrition:</italic> Nutrition should be optimised as malnutrition can disrupt the innate immune response, including complement and mucosal secretory antibody formation, and is associated with increased infection risk in IBD patients.

    <italic>Immunisation:</italic> Immunisation of patients should be strongly encouraged to reduce preventable co‐infection with other viruses: Patients should receive pneumococcus (PCV13 and PPSV 23) and influenza (quadrivalent inactivated vaccine) vaccination.

    <italic>Reduce transmission:</italic> SARS‐CoV‐2 undergoes human‐to‐human transmission and strategies to reduce transmission should be instigated in populations at risk.
    <xref rid="apt15779-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">

    </xref> Patients should wash hands with soap and water for 20 seconds or use an alcohol rub, practice social distancing by working from home, standing 2 m apart from people, avoid touching nose, eyes and mouth and avoiding non‐essential travel.

    <italic>Avoid healthcare facilities:</italic> A large proportion of healthcare workers have been infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. Hence, it must be anticipated that super spreading within hospitals may occur.
    <xref rid="apt15779-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">
     <sup>28</sup>
    </xref> Therefore, patients should preferably avoid hospitals and medical facilities. Suitable patients should have appointments via telehealth allowing for reduced exposure of patients and staff alike to COVID‐19.

    </xref> Doctors should attempt to limit non‐urgent pathology requests and avoid commencing thiopurines or tofacitinib that require frequent blood monitoring early on. Finally, elective surgery and endoscopy should be postponed. Only urgent endoscopic procedures should occur and if patients require a procedure they should have prior screening for COVID‐19 if symptomatic. In addition, to limit pharmacy visits and travel on public transport, prescriptions can be changed to a 3‐month supply or patients can arrange to have medications delivered by post depending on what is available in their local area.

    <italic>Infusion centre management: </italic>To reduce the risk of transmission within the infusion centre, patients who are presenting for infusions should be contacted 1‐2 days prior to determine their risk of COVID‐19. This should include screening for COVID‐19 symptoms, confirming no direct contact with a confirmed COVID‐19 case and asking about flu‐like symptoms. If they have any risk factor, the infusion should be delayed. On attendance, patients should be re‐screened for symptoms and have their temperature checked. Alternate entry points for infusion patients to avoid contact with hospitalised patients should be arranged or where possible the infusion centre can be moved to a ‘clean’ COVID‐19 free area. In addition, social distancing between patients chairs should occur and a single nurse per patient arranged to prevent infection spread. Finally, where possible, infliximab infusions should be converted to a 30‐minute protocol where safe to do so to limit the duration patients are in the infusion centre.
