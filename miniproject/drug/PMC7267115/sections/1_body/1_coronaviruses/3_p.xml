 </xref> These viruses are all known to cause respiratory symptoms ranging broadly in severity, both between the different viruses and in different hosts infected with the same virus. Most spread easily and result in relatively mild illness in immunocompetent patients, with certain strains being responsible for almost 30% of the common cold.
