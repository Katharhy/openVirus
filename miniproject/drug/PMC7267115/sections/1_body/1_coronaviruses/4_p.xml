<p>Other coronaviruses (CoVs), including the SARS‐CoV and the MERS‐CoV, have previously emerged as epidemics with significant mortality and socioeconomic impact. Compared to SARS‐CoV‐2, MERS‐CoV causes a much more severe illness, with a case‐fatality rate (CFR) of up to 30%, but appears to have a lower person‐to‐person transmission, limiting its global impact.
