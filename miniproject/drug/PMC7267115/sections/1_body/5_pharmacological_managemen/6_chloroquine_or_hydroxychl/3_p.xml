<p>Compared to controls, chloroquine had a superior effect in 100 patients in China infected with COVID‐19 in terms of a reduction in exacerbation of pneumonia, duration of symptoms and delay in viral clearance.

 </xref> Chloroquine is not accessible in Australia and it has been suggested that hydroxychloroquine could be an effective alternative given that it is an identical molecule to chloroquine apart from the addition of a hydroxyl group.

 </xref> In a French study, 20 COVID‐19 positive patients (&gt;12 years of age) received hydroxychloroquine 200 mg three times a day for 10 days after a mean of 4 ± 2.6 days from the onset of symptoms. At day 6, virological clearance was 57% in those receiving hydroxychloroquine compared with 12.5% in the control group (

 </xref> A limitation of this study was the exclusion of patients who discontinued treatment, including three patients who were transferred to ICU. Furthermore, the combination of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine should be considered with caution given additive potential of QT prolongation. More evidence is required before this treatment can be recommended.
