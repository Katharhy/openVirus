<p>Corticosteroids systemically reduce inflammation by turning off multiple inflammatory genes. In patients with COVID‐19, a systemic inflammatory response syndrome can perpetuate lung injury with persistent inflammation resulting in ongoing pulmonary damage even subsequent to viral suppression.

 </xref> Whether this indicates that those already on steroids for management of other medical illnesses are at increased risk of adverse outcomes with COVID‐19 remains uncertain; however, steroids are widely known to increase the risk of opportunistic infections and respiratory infections including influenza, pneumonia and severe infections and are associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation and mortality in IBD patients, particularly at doses of prednisolone or its equivalent ≥20 mg.

 </xref> Therefore, due to the possible risks with systemic corticosteroids, IBD patients should taper their systemic corticosteroids to the lowest tolerated dose with complete weaning where possible. Patients should also be advised not to self‐commence systemic corticosteroids to control IBD symptoms unless under the direction of their gastroenterologist. Where possible if patients come into contact with a COVID‐19 patient or develop COVID‐19 symptoms they should also taper corticosteroids.
