<p>Sulfasalazine and the 5‐ASA medications are used as first‐line induction and maintenance treatment for UC. 5‐ASAs have very mild immunosuppressive activity and they are often well tolerated with minimal side effects. There are no reports of these medications being associated with an increased risk of infection and studies of large cohorts evaluating the safety profile of 5‐ASAs do not demonstrate an increased risk of serious or opportunistic infections.
