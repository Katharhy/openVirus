<p>Immunomodulators are commonly used in the management of IBD, as monotherapy or combination therapy, with a view to maintaining remission in isolation or enhancing the pharmacologic profile of the biologics. These agents, previously used predominantly in the chemotherapy and transplant setting, act to alter immune function by causing apoptosis of T cells, integral in host defence against viral pathogens.
