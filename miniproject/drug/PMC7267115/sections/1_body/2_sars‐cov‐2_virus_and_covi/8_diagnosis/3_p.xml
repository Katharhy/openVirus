<p>Recommendations on whom to test for COVID‐19 will vary depending on the local guidelines, availability of testing kits and regional transmission dynamics. In high‐risk settings where an outbreak has occurred, all patients with clinical features consistent with COVID‐19 should be considered for testing. In non‐outbreak areas, a case of COVID‐19 should be suspected and tested for if a patient has clinical features suggestive of COVID‐19 and fits epidemiologic criteria for example international travel or contact with a confirmed COVID‐19 case. A patient is also considered a suspect case of COVID‐19 regardless of their history if they are admitted to hospital with acute respiratory illness or unexplained fever.</p>
