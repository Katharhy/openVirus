 </xref> there is also a theoretical increased risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection via the gut in IBD patients. Despite this, there is no current evidence of increased infection rates or worse disease severity of COVID‐19 in IBD patients. Indeed, so far, no patient with IBD has been reported to have contracted COVID‐19 from the tertiary IBD centres in Wuhan where the virus originated

 </xref> and, despite IBD being a reasonably common condition, very low rates have been described in an international COVID‐IBD registry as of 11 April 2020. At time of writing, 457 (270 Crohn's disease [CD]; 185 UC/unspecified) cases of COVID‐19 in IBD had been reported with 26% of CD and 36% of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients requiring hospitalisation and 3% of CD and 5% of UC patients requiring ICU. Fifteen deaths have been reported.

 </xref> This appears to be a notable under‐representation of COVID‐19 infection in IBD patients compared to the prevalence of IBD and COVID‐19 separately in the community. As yet, it is unclear if this is secondary to low COVID‐19 infection rates or to significant under‐reporting of COVID‐19 infection in IBD patients.
