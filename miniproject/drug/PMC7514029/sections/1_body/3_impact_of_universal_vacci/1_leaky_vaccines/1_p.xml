<p>In contrast to conventional vaccines, some universal vaccines will likely permit a limited amount of infection and may not block onward transmission. A better understanding of how transmission will be reduced by vaccination is important to anticipate the population-level benefits of universal influenza vaccines and the potential for escape variants [

A reduction in transmission will affect influenza dynamics in three ways: (1) Vaccination will decrease circulation of influenza in the community and, hence, reduce the probability of infection in unvaccinated individuals (the so-called herd immunity effect). (2) By reducing opportunities for influenza infection, vaccination may generate pockets of unprotected individuals who are more susceptible to new influenza strains than if they had been naturally infected. This may be particularly important in pandemic seasons [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. (3) Additionally, as previously noted, a leaky vaccine allowing for viral shedding and onward transmission could promote viral evolution away from the immune sites targeted by the vaccine or other antigenic regions of the virus. The interplay of these different mechanisms will determine the net population benefits and evolutionary consequences of a new vaccine [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Because novel influenza variants emerge and circulate globally, increased vaccine pressure in a highly vaccinated population could potentially have trickle down effects in other areas of the world that do not have yet access to the vaccine.
