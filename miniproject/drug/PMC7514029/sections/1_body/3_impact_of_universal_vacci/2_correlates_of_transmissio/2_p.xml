<p>In the absence of direct information on transmission, identification of correlates would be useful, especially if one could rely on variables that are more easily monitored, such as virus shedding or clinical symptoms. Model projections of the population benefits of T-cell based vaccines have used viral shedding data in ferrets vaccinated with NP+M2 recombinant adenovirus vaccines to calibrate transmission effects [
