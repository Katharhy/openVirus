<p>Animal models have been used to study influenza transmission potential since the seminal work of Andrewes and Glover in the 1940s and Kilbourne and Schulman in the 1960s [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. More recent work suggests a correlation between secondary attack rates in households and risk of influenza transmission by respiratory droplets in ferrets, which is auspicious for predictive models based on animal experiments [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Whether there is a relationship between transmission in humans and other influenza models (guinea pigs or mice) remains to be seen. These experiments are costly, and a variety of viruses need to be tested to validate the predictive ability of animal models. A large range of human-to-human transmission potential has been reported for influenza A viruses, from zoonotic viruses that transmit poorly between humans to endemic viruses that generate large epidemics (reproduction number R~0.2 for H5N1 virus to R~3.0 for the 1918 pandemic H1N1 virus [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]). Whether animal models can recapitulate such a broad range of transmissibility remains unclear.
