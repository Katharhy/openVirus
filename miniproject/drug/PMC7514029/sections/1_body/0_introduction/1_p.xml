<p>In today’s interconnected world, human influenza A viruses emerge, evolve, and spread globally, eluding host defenses and the best efforts of vaccine manufacturers. A current public health goal is to develop influenza vaccines that provide broad protection against all influenza A viruses capable of infecting humans [

These “universal influenza vaccines” would significantly reduce global morbidity and mortality from seasonal influenza epidemics, while also protecting populations against the potential emergence of novel pandemic influenza viruses from animal reservoirs, including swine and poultry. This article explores the potential population-level consequences of universal vaccines on immunity, viral evolution, and transmission and identifies gaps in extant experimental and observational data. Two recent articles [
