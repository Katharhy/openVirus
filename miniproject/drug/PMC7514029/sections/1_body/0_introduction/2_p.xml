<p>Although influenza B viruses cocirculate with influenza A viruses and cause annual epidemics, our review is limited to influenza A viruses since they are responsible for most of the annual burden of influenza epidemics, have greater evolutionary rates than influenza B viruses, and exert a unique pandemic threat [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In consequence, influenza A viruses are a major target for universal influenza vaccine development. We focus on universal vaccines candidates that target the hemagglutinin (HA) stem, a conserved region of the main surface protein of the influenza virus, since this is a relatively new field that is generating questions that are ripe for computational modeling. We also discuss universal vaccines constructs based on highly conserved proteins such as nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix (M), which have inspired prior modeling work [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We take a broad view of computational modeling to include quantitative analyses of epidemiological and phylogenetic data and simulations of disease dynamics under various epidemiological and intervention scenarios.
