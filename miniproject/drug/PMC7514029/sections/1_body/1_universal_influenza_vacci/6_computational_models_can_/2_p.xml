<p>While immune imprinting may generate lifelong antibody responses to conserved epitopes and offer partial protection against certain zoonotic strains and pandemics, it may also have detrimental effects during seasonal outbreaks. When a new influenza virus variant emerges through the process of antigenic drift, some individuals may recall memory B cells that target variable epitopes of the HA head of related strains seen earlier in life, but these responses may not be sufficiently well-matched to block infection. For example, individuals who had their first exposure to H1N1 in the period from 1977 to 1986 may have focused their response to a particular epitope of the HA head (K166) that was similar to, and protective against, the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. When this region of H1N1 viruses acquired substitutions during the 2013 to 2014 influenza epidemic, these middle-aged cohorts experienced higher disease burden than in prior seasons and responded more poorly to seasonal influenza vaccines [
