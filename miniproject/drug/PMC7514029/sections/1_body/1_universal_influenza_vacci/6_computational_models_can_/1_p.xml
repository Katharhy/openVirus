<p>Support for imprinting can be found in epidemiological analyses of population-level surveillance data, particularly by comparing the risk of influenza infection in birth cohorts imprinted by different influenza histories (

A long-standing epidemiological puzzle had been the stark contrast in the age mortality profiles of individuals infected with avian-origin H5N1 and H7N9 viruses in Asia. A recent study revisited these data under the imprinting hypothesis, highlighting how the

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008583.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Individuals born prior to 1968 are likely imprinted by group 1 HA (H1N1 or H2N2 viruses); these individuals are more susceptible to zoonotic viruses carrying a group 2 HA, such as H7N9. Conversely, younger individuals born after 1968 are more likely to be first exposed to group 2 HAs (H3N2 viruses) and may, therefore, be more susceptible to zoonotic viruses belonging to the other group, including H5N1. These epidemiological observations are consistent with the theory of imprinting at the HA group level. Monoclonal antibodies to the HA stem are generally specific to an HA group (reviewed in [
