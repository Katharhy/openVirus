<p>While the theory of OAS has been in the literature for decades, the immunological basis for the phenomenon is poorly understood. The first exposure to influenza in childhood has been shown to generate a very narrow antibody response, with little cross-reactivity to other influenza hemagglutinin subtypes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Subsequent exposure to a related influenza virus that has undergone antigenic drift stimulates a small subset of memory B cell clones that respond to regions of the HA head and/or stem that are cross-reactive with those encountered earlier [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Responses to previously seen epitopes can increase year after year as long as strains cross-reactive at that site are circulating (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008583.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Early influenza infections can therefore leave a lifelong imprint or “bias” in an individual’s immune repertoire [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and, in turn, population-level immunity is expected to be biased and structured by birth year. Imprinting could also affect other aspects of influenza immunity, including antibody responses to the NA [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] or T-cell responses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].
