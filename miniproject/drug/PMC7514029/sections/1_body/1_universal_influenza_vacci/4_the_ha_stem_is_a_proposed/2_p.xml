<p>Designing vaccines that generate strong HA stem-specific responses is difficult in practice because the HA stem is typically immunosubdominant to the HA head [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Thus, innovative vaccination strategies based on chimeric HAs or stabilized headless stems have been used to focus the immune response away from the immunodominant head to the less immunogenic stem. These strategies elicit broad cross-protective immunity against a wide range of influenza subtypes and historical strains in animal models, and Phase I clinical trials of such vaccines have been initiated [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. While monoclonal antibodies directed against the HA stem exhibit neutralizing activity in vitro, they also act via mechanisms like antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, which do not block viral entry into cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Due to these immune mechanisms, and/or imperfect cross-reactivity with circulating stem epitopes, an HA stem-based vaccine may be an infection-permissive or “leaky” vaccine.
