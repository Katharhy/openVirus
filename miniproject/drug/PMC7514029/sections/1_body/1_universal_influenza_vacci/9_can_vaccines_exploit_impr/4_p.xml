<p>Taken together, these examples illustrate the complexity of influenza immune responses and how computational modeling could be useful to disentangle competing biological mechanisms, project the fate of different birth cohorts responding to seasonal and universal influenza vaccination, and integrate important aspects of influenza epidemiology. High-quality data will be important to inform such models. Modeling will also be useful to synthesize different lines of evidence from a diverse set of experimental and observational studies that have been launched to aid universal influenza vaccine development.</p>
