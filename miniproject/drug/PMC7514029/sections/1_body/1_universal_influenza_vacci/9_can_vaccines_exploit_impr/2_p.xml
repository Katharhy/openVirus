<p>In the United States, it is recommended that infants be immunized at six months of age with tri- or quadrivalent inactivated vaccines containing both group 1 and group 2 strains. It remains unclear whether a first exposure to influenza in the form of conventional vaccines could influence immune imprinting and, in turn, responses to novel pandemic strains, differently than priming by natural infection. Ideally, universal vaccines could imprint na√Øve children with broad antigenic diversity; exposure to a full spectrum of antigens including the HA stem and conserved proteins such as M2 and NP could be beneficial. So far, it is well-accepted that the strength of immune memory conferred by conventional vaccines is weaker than that of natural infection [
