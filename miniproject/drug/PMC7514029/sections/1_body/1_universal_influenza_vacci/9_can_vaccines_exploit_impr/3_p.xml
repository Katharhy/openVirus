<p>If studies determine that OAS cannot be overcome by vaccination or later life influenza exposures, a universal influenza strategy that establishes broadly protective influenza immunity in children might not be effective for the elderly, who are vulnerable to influenza. The ability of the elderly to adjust to rapidly drifting influenza strains declines with age, potentially due to decreased somatic hypermutation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], reduced B cell clonal diversity [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], or other aspects of immune senescence. Repeat annual immunization with conventional vaccines may narrow immune responses in the elderly even further [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. While Phase I trials of inactivated adjuvanted vaccines targeting the H1 stem have shown promising immunogenicity results in adults [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], data on the strength and duration of protection are not available yet. Meanwhile, T-cell vaccines have been shown to elicit responses in healthy adults who have experienced multiple influenza exposures [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and provide protection against challenge virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Efforts directed toward stimulating T-cells with the influenza internal proteins NP and M1, M2, using multiple peptides, viral vectors, and DNA constructs are among the most advanced universal influenza vaccine programs [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Phase I and Phase II clinical trials have shown promise in eliciting CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses, reducing viral shedding and symptoms, and producing broadly cross-reactive responses. However, a Phase IIB clinical trial of an NP+M1 vaccine was recently discontinued for failing to meet a predefined endpoint of reduction in incidence and viral shedding [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. It is plausible that an optimal universal vaccine will require multiple antigens (e.g., HA stem, NA, NP, M2, and/or M1) to elicit B cell and T-cell mediated immunity and provide long-lasting protection across birth cohorts or age groups that have already been imprinted. Moreover, different combinations of antigens inducing different breadth, duration, and strength of protection might be developed as products intended for different age cohorts.
