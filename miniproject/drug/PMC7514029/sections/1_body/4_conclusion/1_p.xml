<p>The field of universal influenza vaccines is rapidly expanding and generating a vast amount of immunological, virologic, and clinical information, along with important questions on how to optimize these vaccines to maximize protection and minimize harm. Computational modeling can help synthesize these new data streams and contribute to the identification or confirmation of the mechanisms driving immune imprinting on a population level. In parallel, evolutionary studies need to clarify how selection pressures operate at the individual and population levels and drive the global emergence of new strains due to pressure from natural infection, vaccination, or antiviral drugs. Further research is needed to clarify the host and immunologic conditions that increase or decrease the rate of viral evolution and quantify the evolutionary constraints on the different regions of the virus. Combined with data from transmission studies in humans and animals, this information can be used to project the population benefits of universal influenza vaccines. The push towards universal influenza vaccines may generate a complex vaccine landscape with co-existence of different formulations targeting different antigens in different birth and age cohorts. Computational modeling offers a valuable tool to anticipate the benefits of such ambitious programs, while balancing the risks from endemic influenza strains and unpredictable pandemic viruses. Moving forward, it will be important to mine the vast amount of data generated in clinical studies to ensure that the risk-benefits of these vaccine programs have been carefully assessed.</p>
