<p>In a second notable case study, in 2007, seasonal H1N1 viruses emerged with a NA gene carrying a single amino acid substitution (H274Y) that conferred resistance to a newer antiviral, oseltamivir. Again, the drug resistant viruses rapidly disseminated globally, an observation that was particularly alarming because (1) oseltamivir is a first-line drug and widely stockpiled for use in a pandemic and (2) oseltamivir-resistant viruses had low observed fitness in experimental studies [

However, experimental studies have elucidated the role of “permissive” mutations in the NA that predate the H274Y change and have reconfigured the protein to make it capable of acquiring resistance mutations without loss of fitness [

This study of oseltamivir resistance demonstrates the importance of genetic context and the range of evolutionary pathways by which influenza viruses circumvent functional constraints. Epistatic interactions and compensatory mutations remain an understudied but highly relevant area of evolutionary research. In the same vein, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-escape variants are thought to be limited by strong functional constraints and the high polymorphism of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) [

However, a CTL-escape mutation located in a conserved region of the internal NP protein spread rapidly during the 1993 to 1994 epidemic, providing further demonstration of the evolutionary plasticity of influenza A viruses and our inability to predict evolutionary constraints from available data [
