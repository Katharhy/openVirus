<p>The antigenic evolution of the virus in humans is thought to be driven by host immune pressure resulting from natural infection, with little evidence for vaccines affecting the long-term epidemiology or evolution of the virus [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. However, it is important to explore the potential for a broadly protective vaccine to modulate influenza virus evolution, since the vaccine could redirect the immune response towards proteins not targeted by natural immunity, potentially introducing new selection pressures. Selection could also be strengthened during a pandemic, with high vaccine utilization on a global scale. It has been theorized that a broadly protective influenza vaccine, targeting conserved proteins NP and M2 and deployed at sufficiently high levels, could actually slow the evolutionary rate of the virus by substantially reducing the number of infected individuals [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. At the same time, a widely deployed universal influenza vaccine could select for escape mutants in sites that were not previously under immune pressure, especially if this vaccine does not provide sterilizing immunity (infection-permissive or “leaky” vaccines). The risk of escape mutants from a leaky universal influenza vaccine has been considered low because existing vaccine candidates tend to target conserved regions of the influenza virus, which show limited genetic variability in circulating strains. However, restrictions on influenza evolution observed in experimental settings are not always borne out in the real world. For example, the influenza A virus has evolved resistance to antiviral drugs in genetic regions where experimental evidence had suggested that resistance mutations would impair viral fitness [
