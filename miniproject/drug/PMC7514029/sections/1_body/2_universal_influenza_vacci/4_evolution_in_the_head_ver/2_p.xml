<p>The capacity of influenza viruses to evolve resistance to antiviral drugs does not necessarily translate to vaccines. In general, resistance to drugs evolves far more rapidly than to vaccines, for multiple reasons [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Drugs are delivered therapeutically, when viral diversity and pathogen populations within a host are high. In contrast, prophylactic administration of vaccines typically prevents or limits infection so that the potential to generate new virus variants is lower. Additionally, drugs tend to target a single biological pathway, and their effects can often be diminished by a single mutation. In contrast, vaccines induce polyclonal immune responses that target multiple antigens and are dependent on host cofactors (e.g., HLAs) that are intrinsically diverse, limiting viral escape at the population level. Therefore, resistance is less likely to emerge in influenza vaccines that prevent or reduce transmission and more likely to emerge in vaccines that narrowly target a small number of epitopes (for example, peptide-based vaccines). This is true whether targeting the HA stem or internal proteins and regardless of whether the targets are thought to be functionally constrained. As a result, the optimal strategy could be to engineer vaccine cocktails targeting multiple immunologic sites, such as MP + NP, or MP + NP + NA + HA stem. Large-scale deep-sequencing analysis of intrahost evolution and transmission events in prospective and household transmission studies across the globe may also be useful to understand how influenza escape mutants arise in individuals and propagate in large populations.
