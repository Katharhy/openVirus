<p>Experimental data indicate that the HA head region has a higher mutational tolerance than the HA stem [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], but in vitro studies have demonstrated that escape mutants from broadly neutralizing antibodies can still occur in the stem [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Stem escape mutants arise at a lower frequency than head escape mutants [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], especially under polyclonal immune response. However, stem escape mutants can replicate and some variants do not seem to have impaired replication fitness in vitro and retain virulence in mice [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. It is possible that the high conservation of the HA stem in nature arises from the region not being targeted by host antibodies, due to the strong immunodominance of the HA head. If this is the case, by retargeting immune responses towards the stem, vaccination could in theory induce higher selection pressure on the stem. Systematic in vitro exploration of the viability of mutations in the HA stem is useful [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], but genetic context is critical. Large-scale bioinformatic studies of circulating virus variants may inform how specific mutations would fare on a population level, or in a different viral genetic background.
