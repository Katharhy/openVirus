<p>Although there is a relatively large diversity of zoonotic viruses in bats, viral diseases in bats are mild [
 <xref rid="joim13128-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>]. Since bats have developed unique mechanisms to control both excessive inflammation and having robust interferon antiviral responses [
 <xref rid="joim13128-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>], they may provide a biomimetic solution for the COVID‐19 pandemic. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is characterized by a lack of robust type I/III IFN signatures from infected cell lines [
 <xref rid="joim13128-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>] and patients with severe COVID‐19 demonstrate a profoundly impaired IFN‐I response as compared to mild or moderate cases [
 <xref rid="joim13128-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>]. In COVID‐19 infection, ORF3b – one of the viral proteins which is dominantly expressed – is a potent INF antagonist [
 <xref rid="joim13128-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>]. Coronaviruses are known to have multiple other mechanisms for evasion of the host immune response. Bats share many of the immunological features of other mammals but an understanding of the unique host–viral interaction in bats may help understand the pathogenesis of emerging zoonoses in humans. The long co‐evolutionary history of bats and viruses has led to immunological adaptation of bats and the resident viruses allowing for apathogenic infection. Some of these unique immunological differences in bats that have been studied include constitutive expression of INF‐signalling molecules, impaired formation of inflammasomes, absence of a number of NK‐cell receptors, lack of somatic hypermutation in immunoglobulin heavy chain genes and an altered INF‐stimulated gene profile, which is not associated with an acute inflammatory response [
 <xref rid="joim13128-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>]. The links between 'trained immunity' after live vaccinations, such as Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG), and reduced severity of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection [
 <xref rid="joim13128-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>] as well recent positive results in an open‐label randomized trial of COVID‐19‐infected patients with a triple regimen including INF beta‐1b [
 <xref rid="joim13128-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>], support observations made in bats that a robust INF system plays a key role in protection against SARS‐CoV‐2. Further understanding of evolutionary adaptation of both host and symbiont/pathogen may provide insights into both pathophysiology and potential therapeutic pathways.
