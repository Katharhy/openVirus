<p>The transformative impacts of the COVID‐19 pandemic on human welfare, socio‐economic and political structures are enormous. The planet is already experiencing an extraordinary loss of biodiversity (an ongoing sixth mass extinction) linked to human activity: illegal wildlife trade, habitat destruction, pollution, global warming and over‐consumption of a sugar‐rich high‐protein diet, superimposed on population growth [

Furthermore, a 'normal' food supply system has developed as factory farming, with massive numbers of livestock and poultry kept at high density, creating an environment ripe for the genesis of new viral diseases [
