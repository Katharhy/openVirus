<p>We contend that lessons from nature (biomimetics) provide solutions for understanding, treating and preventing emergent diseases. Biomimetic solutions, generated from insights from the natural world, may provide ingenious natural solutions not only for chronic noncommunicable lifestyle‐related diseases [

The increased susceptibility to severe disease observed in the elderly and individuals with burden of lifestyle disease, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, argues for impaired interferon (IFN) antiviral host defence mechanisms.
