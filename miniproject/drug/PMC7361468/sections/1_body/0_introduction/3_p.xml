<p>It is estimated that in the United States alone, three out of four new infectious diseases have emerged from human–animal contact [
 <xref rid="joim13128-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>] and zoonoses are responsible for &gt;2 billion cases of human illness and &gt;2 million human deaths each year [
 <xref rid="joim13128-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>]. Whilst the origin of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus is still not certain, most studies suggest it originated in bats and infected people were exposed via the sale of wild meat at a wet market in Wuhan, China [
 <xref rid="joim13128-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>]. Indeed, bats are believed to be one of the more common wildlife species that carry zoonotic disease potential for domestic animals and humans. Their special flight physiology, with high body temperatures, may have perfectly adapted viruses [

 <xref rid="joim13128-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>] to survive a febrile status in SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected human patients. Over the last century, human activity has destroyed natural habitats and wildlife to develop more anthropocentric landscapes [
 <xref rid="joim13128-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>], providing the basis for emerging disease 'hotspots' and the spillover of new viral zoonoses [
 <xref rid="joim13128-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>]. Exploitation of wildlife through hunting and trade facilitates close contact between wildlife and humans and has increased opportunities for animal–human interactions and facilitated zoonotic disease transmission [
 <xref rid="joim13128-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>]. In bats stressed by entrapment, habitat destruction, infections and climate change, spillover of the virus to other species is more likely to occur. Indeed, intestines of virus‐infected bats that were also co‐infected with fungus contained on average 60‐fold more coronavirus RNA than bats with virus alone [
 <xref rid="joim13128-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>]. Since SARS‐CoV‐2 recently was shown to infect intestinal cells of bats and the virus replicate in human intestinal organoids [
 <xref rid="joim13128-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>], there is a possibility of transmission to humans by contact with bat faeces, without need for an intermediate vector.
