<p>Although greatly resembled pathological features of COVID‐19 with SARS and MERS coronavirus infection, COVID‐19 patients were found to have the unique pathological feature presenting as bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates. Interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates dominated by lymphocytes were seen in both lungs, and multinucleated syncytial cells with atypical enlarged pneumocytes characterized by large nuclei, amphophilic granular cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli were identified in the intra‐alveolar spaces, showing viral cytopathic‐like changes.
