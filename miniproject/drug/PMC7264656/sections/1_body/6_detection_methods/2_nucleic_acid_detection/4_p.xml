<p>Although the viral nucleic acid test is currently the standard method for diagnosis of COVID‐19, the obvious limitations restrict its extensive use: (a) it usually takes 2‐3 hours to produce results; (b) real‐time PCR test requires certified laboratories, expensive equipment and trained technicians for operation; and (c) false negatives exist in real‐time RT‐PCR of COVID‐19.

 </xref> Recently, Abbott ID NOW molecular diagnostic platform technology developed ultra‐fast DNA or RNA amplification, combined with fluorescence detection system based on the nicking endonuclease amplification reaction (NEAR) technology, which could get bacterial or virus test results within 13 minutes or less (positive results within 5 minutes, negative results within 15 minutes). This technology will substantially speed up the population screening and COVID‐19 patient identification.
