<p>Detect SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleic acid by real‐time RT‐PCR via designing specific SARS‐CoV‐2 primers is crucial for COVID‐19 diagnosis. As above‐mentioned, SARS‐CoV‐2 has 79% and 50% identity with SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV, respectively

 </xref> Compared the genomic sequences of SARS‐CoV‐2 with SARS‐CoV, regions coding ORF1ab gene, S gene, ORF7b, ORF8 genes and N genes are different.

 </xref> In S gene, SARS‐CoV‐2 shows lower GC% and higher AT% than SARS‐CoV and MERS. As for N gene, SARS‐CoV‐2 shows little difference in GC% and AT% compared with SARS‐CoV and MERS. However, the over‐biased codons are different. SARS‐CoV‐2 has 6 codons, including TTG, CTT, ATT, ACT, GCT and AGA, whereas SARS‐CoV and MERS show 4 and 5 over‐biased codons, respectively.

 </xref> Therefore, in consideration of the specific sequence of SARS‐CoV‐2, real‐time RT‐PCR detection of ORF1ab and N genes is recommended widely. If only one target can be detected due to the restriction of laboratory test kit, at least the ORF1ab region, the most conservative and specific for the new coronavirus, should be detected. Normally, the N gene is recommended as a screening assay and the ORF1ab assay as a confirmatory one. A result of N gene positive/ORF1ab negative should be regarded as indeterminate and the case is recommended to do further test in a WHO reference laboratory.

 </xref> In addition to ORF1ab and N genes, the detection of S gene is also considered by many laboratories.
