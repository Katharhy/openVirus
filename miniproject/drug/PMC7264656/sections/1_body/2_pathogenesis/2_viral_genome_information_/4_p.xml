<p>Currently, the reported mutation rate of SARS‐CoV‐2 is generally low and there is no evidence that viral recombination has occurred. Moreover, many countries have not published relevant virus genome information or only a small amount of genome information, which is obviously difficult to truly reflect the full picture of the SARS‐CoV‐2 mutation. Consequently, whether the variants of SARS‐CoV‐2 could affect its reproduction and transmission need further studies to clarify.</p>
