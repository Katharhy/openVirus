<p>Since COVID‐19 outbreak, the novel coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2 causing the epidemic has been sequenced by worldwide scholars especially in China. A total of 9556 SARS‐CoV‐2 genome sequences have been uploaded in various global databases according to the data of the China National Center for Bioinformation 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019‐nCoVR) (Figure 
 <xref rid="jcmm15364-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Disclosure of the genome and amino acid sequence will contribute greatly to the viral classification and traceability, rapid nucleic acid detection of patients and understanding of the mechanism of viral infection and transmission. Especially, the clear viral sequence data could directly guide the selection of therapeutic agents and lay the foundation for subsequent vaccine and drug research and development.
