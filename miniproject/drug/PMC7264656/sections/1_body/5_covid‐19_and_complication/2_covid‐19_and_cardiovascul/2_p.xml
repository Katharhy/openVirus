<p>A study of 41 patients diagnosed with COVID‐19 showed that hypersensitive troponin I (hs‐cTnI) was increased substantially in five patients with the diagnosis of virus‐related cardiac injury. Four out of the five patients were admitted to the ICU, accounting for 31% of the total ICU patients.

 </xref> In a study of 138 COVID‐19 patients admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, from 1 January to 28 January 2020, compared with non‐ICU patients, 36 severe patients receiving care in the ICU were more likely to have one of the complications such as cardiac injury and arrhythmia.

 </xref> Recently, a systematic review and meta‐analysis for 1813 COVID‐19 patients indicated that cardiovascular disease and hypertension were strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission. However, they found that COPD was the most strongly predictive comorbidity for both severe disease (pOR 6.42, 95% CI 2.44‐16.9) and ICU admission (pOR 17.8, 95% CI 6.56‐48.2).
