<p>Data from a clinical study involving 59 COVID‐19 patients showed that 19% (11/59) and 27% (16/59) of patients had an elevated level of plasma creatinine and urea nitrogen, respectively. All patients who underwent renal parenchymal CT had abnormal imaging of the kidney, mainly manifesting as low CT values of the renal parenchyma.

 </xref> A study of 1099 COVID‐19 patients found that the incidence of creatinine &gt;133 micromol/L and acute kidney injury (AKI) were 4.3% and 2.9% in severe patients, respectively, whereas they were only 1% and 0.1%, respectively in non‐severe patients.

 </xref> Data from another study of 710 patients with COVID‐19 demonstrated that 44% of patients have proteinuria haematuria, 26.9% have haematuria and the prevalence of elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were 15.5% and 14.1%, respectively on admission. During the study period, AKI occurred in 3.2% patients. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated serum creatinine, elevated urea nitrogen, AKI, proteinuria and haematuria were the independent risk factors for in‐hospital death.
