<p>So far, the COVID‐19 patients of nine countries have surpassed 50 000 and they are American, Spain, Italy, Germany, France, The United Kingdom, China, Iran and Turkey in a descending order. The number of confirmed cases and deaths of COVID‐19 was higher than SARS‐CoV (more than 8000 confirmed cases and 800 deaths worldwide) and MERS‐CoV (2494 confirmed cases and 858 deaths worldwide).

 </xref> In a study of 99 COVID‐19 cases, nearly half of patients (49) were clustered and had exposure history.

 </xref> According to a survey conducted by Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on more than 40,000 COVID‐19 patients, about 56% of the patients were men and the median age was 59 years with 87% 30‐79 years of age, 3% 80 years or older and 2% under 20 years old.

 </xref> The overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 2.3%, in which the CFR of the elderly and patients with pre‐existing comorbid conditions was higher. The CFR of over 70‐year‐old and over 80‐year‐old (including 80 years old) was around 50.8% and 14.8% of the total number of deaths, respectively. No deaths occurred in the group aged 9 years and younger.

 </xref> The incubation period of COVID‐19 was 1‐14 days with mostly 3‐7 days, and the maximum incubation period could reach 24 days.

 </xref> A recent study constructed a model‐based analysis estimating the severity of COVID‐19 from the cases of 38 countries. The results showed that the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death and hospital discharge was 17.8 days (95% CI, 16.9‐19.2) and 24.7 days (22.9‐28.1), respectively. The case fatality ratio in China was 1.38% (1.23‐1.53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (6.4% [5.7‐7.2], ≥60 years) and up to 13.4% (11.2‐15.9) in those aged 80 years or older. Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (4.5% [1.8‐11.1] in those aged ≥60 years [n = 151]).
