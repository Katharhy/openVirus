<p>There are many COVID‐19 risk factors, and age, gender and blood type seem to be more important among them. In a retrospective, multicentre cohort study, older age is significantly correlated with COVID‐19, which is consistent with the higher incidence of older people. High Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and D‐dimer &gt;1 μg/L are also risk factors.

 </xref> Gender is another risk factor, and a lot of research have disclosed that higher prevalence of COVID‐19 in men than women.

 </xref> According to a research based on large population, A and O blood group displayed different association risks for COVID‐19. COVID‐19 patients with blood group A account for 37.75%, whereas the proportion is 32.16% in normal people. Respectively, the proportion of O group in COVID‐19 patients and normal people is 25.80% and 33.84%.

 </xref> This result is similar to the study focused on the relationship between ABO blood group and SARS‐CoV, which showed O blood group with a lower infection chance and anti‐A antibodies specifically inhibit the adhesion of SARS‐CoV S protein‐expressing cells to ACE2‐expressing cell lines.
