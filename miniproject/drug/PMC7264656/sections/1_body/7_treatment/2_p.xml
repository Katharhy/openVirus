<p>Based on the previously therapeutic experience of SARS and MERS, the potential treatments for COVID‐19 include antiviral drugs, plasma transfusion, vaccines and so on. Given the rapid outbreak and spread of COVID‐19, repurposing the existing antiviral drugs such as anti‐HIV drugs, anti‐HBV and anti‐HCV drugs is the fast and crucial experimentally therapeutic options and the clinical efficacy of these drugs requires clinical trials to prove.

 </xref> Recently, the WHO director general Tedros Adhanom has announced that WHO will lead clinical trials of four candidate drugs (remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon β and chloroquine) against COVID‐19 alone or in combination and more than 70 countries have joined WHO's Solidarity Trial to accelerate the search for an effective treatment.

In addition, stem cells are also expected to inhibit the overactivation of immune system, control acute pulmonary inflammation and improve the endogenous reparation for injured tissue,

A clinical trial (NCT04252118) of COVID‐19 stem cell therapy sponsored by Beijing 302 Hospital is under way.
