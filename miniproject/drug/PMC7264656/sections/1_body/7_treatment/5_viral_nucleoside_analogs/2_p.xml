<p>Favipiravir has shown an effective inhibition on Ebola, yellow fever, chikungunya, norovirus and enterovirus by restraining RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of RNA viruses.

 </xref> A recent study demonstrated that Favipiravir could suppress SARS‐CoV‐2 infection at a high concentration (half‐maximal effective concentration (EC50) = 61.88 μmol/L, half‐cytotoxic concentration (CC50) &gt;400 μmol/L, selectivity index (SI)&gt; 6.46).

 </xref> The efficacy of nucleotide analogs requires viral RdRps to recognize and successfully incorporate the active form of the inhibitors into the growing RNA strand, which is the possible inhibition mechanism of SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA polymerase by remdesivir effector molecules.

 </xref> The latest clinical trial studied the effect of compassionate use of remdesivir in severe COVID‐19 patients, and clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53 patients (68%), which indicated that remdesivir was effective in treating severe COVID‐19.
