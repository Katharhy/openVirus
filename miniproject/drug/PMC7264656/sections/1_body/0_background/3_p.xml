<p>Many diagnosis and treatment strategies have been taken to prevent the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 and isolation is the most effective way. Detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleic acid or specific IgM and IgG in serum has become a convenient way to identify COVID‐19. For hospitalized patients, drug treatment such as alpha interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, chloroquine phosphate and arbidol, and convalescent plasma therapy may be potential options. Convalescent plasma therapy is mainly used for the severe and critical cases.
