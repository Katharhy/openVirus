  <p>Chronic CTRA stimulation (due to isolation, social stress or low socioeconomic status i.e.) may lead to stimulation of pro-inflammatory profile (such as IL1B, IL6, or IL8 gene expression) and inhibition of antiviral genes, such as Interferon inducible (IFI) and Interferon stimulated (ISG) gene families. This may leave organisms more vulnerable to viral infections due to insufficient antiviral immune response gene expression.</p>
