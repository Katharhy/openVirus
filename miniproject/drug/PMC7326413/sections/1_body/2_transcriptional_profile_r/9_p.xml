<p id="p0140">It has been demonstrated that purpose in life (eudaimonic well-being) is successful against the adverse effects of loneliness in predicting leukocyte gene expression profiles. For example, the relationship between eudaimonia (a well-being status that includes happiness, virtue, morality, and a meaningful life) (

Together, this is useful to provide a rationale for the development of new intervention strategies to mitigate the health risks associated with loneliness not by directly targeting social interaction per se, but rather by promoting social well-being indirectly via the development of pro-social eudaimonic well-being. And also raises the possibility that psychological resilience factors can, at least in some circumstances, outweigh the effects of a well-established and quantitatively robust psychological risk factor such as perceived social isolation (
