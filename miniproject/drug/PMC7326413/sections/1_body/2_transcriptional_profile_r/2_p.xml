<p id="p0105">A field of research, related to the established field of behavioral genetics, seeks to identify the genes that influence social behavior, to understand the influence of these genes on the underlying neural and endocrine mechanisms and to explore the effects of the environment, especially the social environment, in the action of genes. Social genomics research field has been demonstrating that humans and other vertebrates activate a conserved pattern of gene transcriptional responses when they experience extended periods of threat or uncertainty (

A molecular pattern was observed, the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA), which is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system “fight-or-flight” response and is thought to have evolved to defend against physical injury during periods of heightened risk. The CTRA pattern involves up-regulated transcription of genes related to pro-inflammatory responses (such as 
 <italic>IL1B</italic>, 
 <italic>IL8</italic>, and 
 <italic>IL6</italic>), which play a key role in immune responses to wounding injuries and related bacterial infections. It also involves a complementary down-regulation of antiviral genes (e.g., 
 <italic>IFI</italic>- and 
 <italic>ISG</italic>-family genes) and genes involved in antibody synthesis (e.g., 
 <italic>IGJ</italic>). The CTRA supposedly evolved to fight against physical threats. However, among humans, it may also be triggered by non-physical threats, including threats to the symbolic self, such as social isolation (
