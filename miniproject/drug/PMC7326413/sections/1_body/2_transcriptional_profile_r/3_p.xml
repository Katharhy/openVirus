<p id="p0110">These transcriptional changes indicate a down-regulation of antiviral defenses and a corresponding up-regulation of proinflammatory wound-healing and antibacterial defenses (

However, chronic CTRA activation could leave an organism vulnerable to viral infection and subject to collateral damage from systemic inflammation, ultimately leading to disease, disability, and death (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Belsky and Snyder-Mackler, 2017</xref>). Studies in animal and cell culture systems have also shown that activation of fight-or-flight signaling pathways in the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays a major role in evoking CTRA gene expression profiles, whose activation is mediated by receptors that stimulates transcription factors such as NF-κB, GATA, and cAMP response element-binding protein to selectively up-regulate transcription of proinflammatory genes (e.g.,

 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Cole et al., 2010</xref>) while simultaneously inhibiting the activity of transcription factors, such as the interferon response facstor family, that control transcription of Type I interferon genes (e.g.,

 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Collado-Hidalgo et al., 2006</xref>). This increased pro-inflammatory gene expression and a suppression of anti-viral gene expression would happen because in conditions of social stress, the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory gene expression prepares the body to better deal with bodily injury and bacterial infection which is more likely under conditions of social stress either through hostile human contact, or increased predatory vulnerability due to separation from the social group. However it contributes to a paradoxical increase in inflammation-related diseases (cardiovascular disease and depression, caused by excessive proinflammatory immune response gene expression), and vulnerability to viral infections such as the common cold, caused by insufficient antiviral immune response gene expression, as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> . Thus, what evolutionarily served to respond to an imminent physical threat, today seems to be activated by social threats, whether real or imagined (
