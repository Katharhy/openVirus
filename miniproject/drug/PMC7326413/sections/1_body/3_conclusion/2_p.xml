<p id="p0150">The Covid-19 pandemic and interventions to mitigate the transmission of the virus bring public health issues related to social isolation, stress and vulnerable and low socioeconomic status groups. The possible change in the pattern of immune responses related to stress, as well as the gene expression profile, the CTRA, resulting from these situations are of concern, especially with regard to the immune response to viruses. Understanding the mechanisms through which social disadvantage, isolation and stress becomes biologically embedded and understanding this embedding may address social gradients in health, and allow better strategies to understand and deal with these issues. Thus, the present review aims to raise questions related to the effects of these conditions in patients infected or susceptible to contamination by Covid-19 to provide support to government officials, health agents and researchers so that they can consider these facts and direct their actions during the pandemic, as well as encourage studies to better understand these characteristics.</p>
