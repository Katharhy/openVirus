<p id="par0030">How can the history of medicine inform us in this controversy, especially during a novel death-dealing pandemic? Many discoveries over time have been made by people who are not part of the establishment e.g. James Lind (1716–1794), a British naval surgeon from Edinburgh, now considered the founder of EBM, carried out one of the first controlled clinical trials recorded in medical science, demonstrating that oranges and lemons could treat scurvy, but many years had to pass before the Royal Navy introduced them in the sailors’ diet

In orthopaedics in the UK, for many years, no major advances came out of university departments or teaching hospitals; artificial joints were developed by surgeons in district hospitals Charnley in Wrightington, McKee in Norwich, Ring in Redhill, and Ling in Exeter. McKee made his prototype hip replacements in his garden shed in the 1950s. Major advances are often made by people who are not main stream. Sterling Edwards, a pioneer in cardiovascular surgery kept cow hearts in his fridge at home to use when developing artificial grafts and valves. Then there is the Hungarian obstetrician Ignaz Semmelweiss (1818–1865), initiator of hand-washing following autopsies of obstetric patients to limit the risk of puerperal infection. He was mocked, criticised and hated, causing metal distress before subsequently being rehabilitated
