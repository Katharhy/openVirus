<p id="par0010">The antimalarial drug chloroquine and its safer derivative hydroxy-chloroquine (C
 <sub>18</sub>H
 <sub>26</sub>ClN
 <sub>3</sub>O) have been used since the 1940s to treat chronic inflammatory diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Sjögren syndrome 
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Chloroquine and hydroxy-chloroquine appear to block viral entry into cells by inhibiting glycosylation of host receptors, proteolytic processing, and endosomal acidification. These agents also have immuno-modulatory effects through attenuation of cytokine production and inhibition of autophagy and lysosomal activity in host cells

 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> but goes back to the 2002–2003 SARS epidemic in Asia. This treatment showed antiviral activity (in vitro) against SARS coronavirus

 <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and hydroxyl-chloroquine 
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> have also been found to have antiviral effects on COVID-19 in vitro, including inhibition of the viral entry and post-entry stages of infection.
