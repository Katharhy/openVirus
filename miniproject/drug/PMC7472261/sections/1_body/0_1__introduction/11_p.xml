<p>Moreover, data about the role of DRMs in INSTI and about the natural variability of integrase are predominantly available for viruses of subtype B, which represents less than 10% of the globally circulating viruses. However, because of the high variability in codon usage between subtypes, particular HIV-1 subtypes could have different genetic barriers for DRMs [
