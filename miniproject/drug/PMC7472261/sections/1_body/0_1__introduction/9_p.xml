<p>The L74I mutation is located in the catalytic core domain and is part of the hydrophobic cluster including L63, T97, F100/Y100, L101, L113/I113, and F121 near the active site of integrase [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00838" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In vitro selection experiments indicated that substitutions in the 74 position combined with major mutations (G140A/C/S, Q148 H/K/R) and other accessory mutations (V75I, T97A) can significantly reduce susceptibility to INSTI, whereas this mutation alone has minimal impact on INSTI susceptibility or HIV-1 replication capacity [
