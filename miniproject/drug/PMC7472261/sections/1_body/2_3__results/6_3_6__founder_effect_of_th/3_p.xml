<p>The phylogenetic tree is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00838-f003">Figure 3</xref>. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that A6 sequences formed a well-defined monophyletic subcluster among different sub-subtypes of subtype A. Within the A6 subcluster, there are a few branches with L74L, suggesting that in a few cases, L74I can revert to wild type. In addition to the majority of samples from Russia, clade A6 contains sequences from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Ukraine, Georgia, and Belarus, 7 sequences from Cyprus, and single sequences from England and Italy.
