<p>Notably, two outlier sequences from Italy (A6.IT.2002.60000. EU861977) and Russia (A6.RU.2000.RU00051. EF545108) with L74L were placed close to the root of the A6 tree. These sequences can be considered as close links to the potential founder of the monophyletic clade of sub-subtype A6. The sequences with L74L belonged to heterosexuals, identified before the burst of the large epidemic among the injectors. Clearly, the viruses with the L74I mutation spread as a result of a founder effect among injectors across FSU countries.</p>
