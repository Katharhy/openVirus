<p>Among ART-na√Øve patients, DRMs were detected in only 3 samples (1.3%). The major mutation, Q146P, was accompanied by the accessory mutation G163R in one patient and by itself in the second patient. The third patient had only the accessory mutation G163R. Thus, according to interpretation-predicted DR from the HIVdb Program, the first patient had high-level EVG and low-level RAL resistance, the second patient had high-level EVG resistance, and the third patient had low-level resistance to EVG and RAL. No patients in this group had mutations on the list of DRMs used for surveillance of transmitted HIV-1 DR (SDRM) [
