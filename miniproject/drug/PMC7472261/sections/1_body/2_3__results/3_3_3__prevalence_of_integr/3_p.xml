<p>DRMs were detected among 5 INSTI-naïve patients (2.7%). Two of the patients had major mutations, including R263K (1/183; 0.5%), which was associated with intermediate-level DTG, EVG resistance, and low-level RAL, BIC resistance, and unusual mutation in DR-position S147T, which does not reduce susceptibility to any INSTI. Additionally, 3 INSTI-naïve patients had accessory mutations: E157Q (2/183; 1.1%) and T97A (1/183; 0.5%), which alone have minimal impact on INSTI susceptibility or HIV-1 replication capacity. Only one mutation, R263K, was in the list of SDRMs.</p>
