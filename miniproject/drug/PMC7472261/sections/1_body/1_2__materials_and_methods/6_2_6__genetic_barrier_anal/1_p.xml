<p>For this analysis, we used the treatment-naïve A6 sequences obtained in this study and worldwide HIV-1 treatment-naïve A1 sequences (
 <italic>n</italic> = 100) and B sequences (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2577) obtained from the Los Alamos HIV Database (
 <uri xlink:href="www.hiv.lanl.gov" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.hiv.lanl.gov</uri> accessed 23 March 2020). The calculations of genetic barriers were performed as published previously [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00838" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. According to A.M. Vandamme [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00838" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] the transitions (replacement A→G and C↔T) occur 2.5 times more frequently than transversions (replacement A↔C, A↔T, G↔C, G↔T). Therefore, transitions were scored as 1 and transversions were scored as 2.5. Because of the high rate of APOBEC-mediated hypermutations (G to A) this type of transition was scored as 0.2 [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-12-00838" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The missing nucleotides were scored as −777. Python v 3.7 script was used to score the genetic barrier to the drug resistance-associated mutations. The genetic barrier was the sum of the scores for each studied amino acid position.
