  <p>The maximum likelihood (ML) tree of the pol region sequences of subtype A included 723 tips of clade A6 and 394 tips of the other subtype A (A, A1, A2, A3, and A4). Subtypes are displayed on the outside of the tree (colored ring). Branches are colored according to the status of the 74 codon in the sequences: Blue, red, green, and yellow for sequences with L74L, L74I, L74M, and L74V, respectively. The blue star indicates A6.IT.2002.60000. EU861977 and A6.RU.2000.RU00051. EF545108 sequences. The green star indicates the cluster of viruses with the L74M mutation.</p>
