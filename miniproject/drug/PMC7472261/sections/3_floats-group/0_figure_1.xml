 <caption>
  <p>Frequency of naturally occurring polymorphisms of the A6 sub-subtype. The reference sequence (HXB2 HIV-1 clade B) is shown in the top line. Letters and numbers below each position are the polymorphisms and their frequency (%). Highly polymorphic mutations (more than 50% in A6-sequences) are indicated in red. The N-terminal domain (NTD) is indicated in blue at positions 1–50, the catalytic core domain (CCD) is indicated in orange at positions 51–212 and the C-terminal domain (CTD) is indicated in pink at positions 213–288.</p>
