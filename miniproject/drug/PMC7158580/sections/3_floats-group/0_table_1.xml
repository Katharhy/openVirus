    <td align="left">Lengthy regulatory process to analytically validate a new diagnostic assay</td>
    <td align="left">Expand the use of prequalified platforms: prequalification of diagnostic platforms (including the instruments and their associated reagents) before outbreaks means that only pathogen-specific components will need to be qualified during an epidemic. This prequalification is an opportunity for regulators to fast track the approval of pathogen-specific assays for emergency use.</td>

   <tr>
    <td align="left">Insufficient global manufacturing capacity</td>
    <td align="left">Accelerate opportunities for platform diagnostic companies to expand their footprint within low-income and middle-income countries by establishing infrastructure (instruments, consumables, human resources) for routine clinical use so that it is ready in case of an epidemic, with trained staff and accessible support channels.</td>

   <tr>
    <td align="left">Unknown biology of Pathogen X hinders identification of an appropriate immunisation target</td>
    <td align="left">Expand databases of conserved pathogen sequences and targets to more quickly triage and identify homologies among pathogens. The database can be expanded by proactively researching new infectious agents in animals and humans. Develop broad-spectrum and narrow-spectrum antivirals and homologous targets, as identified in multiple pathogens.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="left">Insufficient available and standardised animal models</td>
    <td align="left">Standardise and validate animal models of disease transmission and pathogenesis that are sufficient for research and able to satisfy requirements for licensure (either through traditional, emergency use, or Animal Rule pathways). This process requires considerable investment in basic research and would probably run in parallel to clinical development if an emergency demands it. Expand curated databases of existing animal models and data to inform members of scientific advisory boards who are empowered to make decisions pertaining to standards for animal-use protocols and interpretation of study results.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="left">Insufficient standardised viral stock strains hinder preclinical research and manufacturing processes</td>
    <td align="left">Empower a centralised research unit to propagate protocols of the International Organization for Standardization for isolating and growing pathogens. Use innovative technologies such as synthetic biology to rapidly synthesise nucleotide sequences or even to predictively stockpile vaccine-ready viral seeds.</td>

   <tr>
    <td align="left">Few standardised clinical protocol designs</td>
    <td align="left">Standardise and pre-approve clinical trial designs and protocols before outbreaks to reduce their harried development during an epidemic. Establish pathogen-independent and adaptive master protocols of clinical trials that can expand and enrol patients as necessary during an epidemic. Increase accessibility of surveillance and epidemiological data to support clinical development planning and study design (eg, incidence and clinical characterisation of disease in symptomatic populations). Ensure that master clinical trial protocols that are prepositioned at the country level undergo conditional regulatory approval, and thus only require modification for modality and indication. Protocol development is a separate activity under the Epidemic Preparedness Research and Development Blueprint.

    <td align="left">Toxicology studies remain lengthy for small molecules, effectively hindering the de novo development of drugs to control epidemics</td>
    <td align="left">Continue to repurpose small molecule agents that have already undergone the required safety and toxicity studies. This process requires establishing intellectual property sharing agreements and compounding libraries of drugs that have already completed safety studies but were not commercially pursued. Pre-screen these compounds during an epidemic to identify signals of efficacy and then fast track them into clinical development.</td>
