<p id="para250">Clinical development could further be aided through instituting adaptive clinical trials using simplified and standardised protocols, which are overseen by a data safety monitoring board to centralise safety and efficacy review (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Adaptive trial approaches allow for the collapsing of study arms following interim analyses. Study acceleration and improved statistical power for the resulting study arms can result. Some of these approaches can also allow for meaningful data generation during fast-burning or sporadic outbreaks that otherwise would be too difficult to incorporate into standard trial designs.
