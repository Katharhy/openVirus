<p id="para260">Improving standards for assays across different laboratories and countries for parameters such as sensitivity and specificity as well as for data reporting and management systems can also facilitate the development of diagnostic products. This improvement will address the variability of standards and test methods across different diagnostic laboratories; additionally, it will facilitate and synchronise information sharing and conformance of data between countries, developers, and national and global cloud-based registries. Finally, expanding regional emergency reference laboratory consortia (especially in high-risk regions) and a base level of laboratory expertise (in all countries) can accelerate the solution of logistical and quality issues, and the overall mobilisation and delivery of diagnostics.</p>
