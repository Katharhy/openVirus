<p id="para150">The product development cycle remains lengthy for de-novo medical countermeasures: diagnostic tests typically take 2–5 years to develop and 5–10 years to complete development, before procurement can be initiated. The timeline for vaccines and small molecules is even longer, largely because of the requirement for human safety and efficacy data. Here, we list technological and process opportunities for shortening the development times of diagnostics, vaccines, clinical trials, and small molecules for Disease X (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref> ). Technological opportunities speed up discovery and translation of new products. Process opportunities facilitate early alignment and more effective collaborations. These opportunities cover both near-term (ie, immediately) and medium-term (ie, over 5–10 years), and are intended to be unaffected by the knowledge of the specific identity of the pathogen.
