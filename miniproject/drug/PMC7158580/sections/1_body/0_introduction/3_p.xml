     <p id="para50">Emerging pathogens continue to pose a serious threat to global health. More lives can be saved if medical countermeasures are deployed in time. We convened subject matter experts in preclinical development, clinical development, manufacturing, and regulatory assessment to discuss how the development and approval of medical countermeasures could be accelerated both before and during an epidemic.</p>

     <p id="para70">There are key challenges that span across preclinical, clinical, and the manufacturing phases of medical countermeasure product development, including low sample and reagent availability, challenges in manufacturing at scale, and efficient operation of harmonised clinical trials across borders.</p>

     <p id="para90">Because end-to-end product development is a complex process with many interdependent decisions, the intervention target product profile can be used to set standards so that medical countermeasure developers have a clear understanding of the hurdles that need to be met for successful development and use of their products.</p>
