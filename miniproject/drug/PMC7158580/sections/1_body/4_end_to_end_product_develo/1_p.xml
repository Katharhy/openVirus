<p id="para280">Effective decisions drive product development. Although these decisions are arrayed along product development timelines, they should be evaluated and decided holistically, not sequentially. We suggest that the first step after the identification of Disease X is the development of a global intervention target product profile (iTPP). The iTPP should be created by funders or oversight bodies, or both, with input from disease and product development experts, to provide clear guidance to medical countermeasure manufacturers with respect to what product attributes are needed to address a novel pathogen. Each key variable (eg, efficacy, stability, safety, storage conditions) will have minimum and optimistic targets. The minimum target sets the absolute lower bound of acceptable product attributes, whereas optimistic targets can be aspirational or provide guidance about specific attributes that might be problematic (eg, cost of goods or efficacy). Product developers can then create integrated product development plans that outline the complete scope of manufacturing as well as clinical and regulatory activities required to develop their product. It should be noted that a single iTPP could lead to multiple product candidates under development. Ideally, each of the products would be differentiated with respect to meeting various iTPP parameters. Use of these documents at the start of an epidemic can increase transparency between stakeholder organisations, improve communication, align interests, and focus resources on a common set of priorities. We provide a sample iTPP template for a vaccine targeting a novel pathogen in
