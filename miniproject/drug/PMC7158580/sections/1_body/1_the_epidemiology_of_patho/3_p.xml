 </xref> from an area where a convergence of risk factors and population dynamics will result in sustained person-to-person transmission. This premise does not negate the need for measures against other types of pathogens of pandemic importance, but the work on Disease X that we have done is modelled on the development of medical countermeasures against this particular pathogen archetype. However, the development of medical countermeasures does not demand that the epidemiology of Disease X is known, and many conserved elements of product development remain that do not vary on the basis of established pathophysiology or epidemiology. In the first instance, development of medical countermeasures for Disease X will inevitably include plans to detect cases and mobilise the movement of samples and data to developers.
