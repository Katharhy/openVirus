<p id="para300">Most medical products nowadays are global commodities with complex development and manufacturing pathways that often involve multiple jurisdictions. Depending on the epidemic situation, the benefit-to-risk ratio, and the regulatory pathway pursued, innovators might need to manufacture at risk without any assurances of return on their investment. These realities present challenges that can act as deterrents for innovators to enter the product development space in epidemic response. These challenges are particularly acute when the target population is located in an area with an unfamiliar regulatory landscape, or when the target population does not have the expertise to routinely handle new technologies and approaches, and most importantly, when the economic return on investment—if existing—is expected to be minimal. To resolve this issue, product developers should engage early with regulators in areas where medical countermeasures are manufactured and with regulators in target countries, as well as liaise with WHO programme and prequalification units. Together, they should align on appropriate non-clinical models and study designs, and deploy assistance in coordinating late-stage trials. This approach can clarify clinical trial endpoints that would be supportive for accelerated regulatory approval. Alternatively, several accelerated pathways exist that derive human efficacy data from animal surrogates or intermediate clinical endpoints, and provide considerable scientific and agency support.

Subsequent publications will aim to provide a detailed analysis of the key CMC activities and investments that will assist in reducing the time to manufacture licensed products for infectious diseases, and aim to improve coordination and understanding of the frameworks that would facilitate the use of accelerated regulatory pathways, including the use of animal surrogates for human efficacy and intermediate endpoints or biomarkers.
