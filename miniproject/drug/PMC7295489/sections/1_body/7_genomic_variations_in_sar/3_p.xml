 <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Rehman et al. (2020)</xref> were compared the Envelop (E), Nucleocapsid, Membrane (M), and Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV. It represented 7%, 8%, 7% and 19% amino acid sequence variations in E, M, N and S regions respectively (
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> ). Moreover, they also presented nine putative recombinants in SARS-CoV-2 and hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 is the recombinant of SARS and SARS-like CoVs. Six out of nine recombinants are in S motif which is important for viral pathogenicity. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) was analyzed and showed 73% sequence similarity with the pandemic RBD (

 <sup>−1</sup>, representing higher binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor (
