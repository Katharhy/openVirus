<p id="p0080">The genetic information of any life is preserved in its genome, and the annotation is the first step to explain the sequence. While the length of the SARS-CoV genome is above ~29 kb, it appears that only a few coding genes do not match the general characteristics of the viral genome and the group of minimal hereditary data. In previous studies, 156 variants were found in 95 samples available on NCBI databases and 116 variants were identified uniquely. In addition, these variants have 46 missense, 52 synonymous, 2 insertions, 1 deletion, and 14 non-coding alleles. The most common variant were found 8782C&gt;T (ORF1ab) in 13 samples, 28144T&gt;C (ORF8) in 14 samples and 29095C&gt;T (N) in 8 samples. The 8782C&gt;T and 28144T&gt;C coincided. Also, 29095C&gt;T was located in one of these subsets. Both 8782C&gt;T and 29095C&gt;T were synonymous; However, 28144T&gt;C causes amino acids to replace L84S in ORF8. For 46 missense variants, ORF1ab has 24 variants, that occupies 2/3 of the entire genome. All non-coding mutations are within 3′UTR or 5′UTR regions that have C&gt;T changes (
