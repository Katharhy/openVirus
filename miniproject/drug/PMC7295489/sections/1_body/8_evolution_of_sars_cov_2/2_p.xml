<p id="p0090">Distinguishing the origins of an emerging pathogen can be critical during the beginning periods of an outbreak as it may allow for containment measures to be precisely targeted. Before December 2019, four strains of Betacoronavirus, HKU1, MERS-CoV, OC43, and SARS-CoV, had been accounted to cause severe human infections (

 <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2020</xref>). The genome sequence of the new virus is 96.2% identical to that of the bat. SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13) has been collected in Wuhan, China, but is not identical to the genome of SARS-CoV (about 79%) or MERS-CoV (approximately 50%) as shown in
