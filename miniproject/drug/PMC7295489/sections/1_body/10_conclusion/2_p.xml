<p id="p0115">It is widely accepted that there are many viruses in their natural reservoirs for a very long time. The constant spread of viruses from natural hosts to humans and other animals is largely due to human activities. Data collected on genetic evolution, receptor binding and pathogenesis have shown that SARS-CoV is most likely caused by bats by sequential recombination of bat SARS-CoVs. The rapid proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 raises many questions, whether its development is driven by the mutation or any other mechanisms. So the Government and health authorities must develop and implement the guidelines for researchers and the public for the development of drugs and vaccines to reduce the spread rate of COVID-19.</p>
