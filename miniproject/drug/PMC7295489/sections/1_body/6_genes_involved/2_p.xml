<p id="p0075">Interestingly, the histopathologically ARDS has been identified in the patients of all type of cases such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 (

Elevated levels of cytokines and chemokines in COVID-19 patients including IL1β, IL1RA, IL7, IL8, IL9, IL10, basic FGF2, GCSF, GMCSF, IFN γ, IP10, MCP1, MIP1 α, MIP1 β, PDGFB, TNF α, and VEGFA were also observed. Additionally, a few patients with a severe infection in the intensive care unit also showed increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL2, IL7, IL10, GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1 α, and TNF α that were responsible for disease severity (
