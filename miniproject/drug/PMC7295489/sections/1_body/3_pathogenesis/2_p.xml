<p id="p0055">The SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory system targeting virus therefore the prime pathogenesis of the COVID-19 severe pneumonia, RNAaemia, combined with the incidence of ground-glass opacities, and acute cardiac injury. Also, some patients were exhibited non-respiratory symptoms such as the acute liver and heart injury, kidney failure, diarrhea, implying multiple organ involvement (

Crucially, viral replication is supposed to occur in the mucosal epithelium of the upper respiratory tract (nasal cavity and pharynx), in addition, proliferation is in the lower respiratory tract and gastrointestinal mucosa that results in the mild viremia (
