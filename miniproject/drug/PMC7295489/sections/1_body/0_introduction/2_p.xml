<p id="p0020">Before December 2019, very little was known about the coronaviruses (CoVs) because previously CoVs were not hit the global community so badly even though CoVs have been infected many species including humans and discussed for more than 70 years. 
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Bailey et al. (1949)</xref> were reported murine virus (JHM) for the first time in 1949. Molecular mechanisms and pathogenesis of different CoVs have been intensely studied in different animal species such as porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), and avian infectious bronchitis viruses (IBV). The CoVs having emergence and re-emergence history causing respiratory and intestinal infections in animals and humans (

Subsequently, a decade later in 2012, another Zoonotic highly pathogenic coronavirus emerged in Middle Eastern countries caused the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemic (

The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic situation got worldwide attention and became the utmost priority of the global health community due to the higher rate of human-human transmission. Previous studies have confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 adopted recombination and mutations strategies that help to adapt rapidly changing host environments through genotype adjustment via reproductive adaptability and ultimately escape from human immune reconnaissance (
