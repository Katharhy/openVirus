<p id="p0070">Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) occurs when non-neutralizing antiviral proteins facilitate virus entry into host cells, leading to increased infectivity in the cells. Recently, ADE is proposed as a responsible for the inflammation because of SARS-CoV-2 infection (
 <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2020</xref>). ADE can interact with virus–antibody complexes their receptors, and increasing the target cell infection (

These biomarkers propose both a molecular description and a feasible treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following SAS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, in severe cases, CD4 and CD8 T cells exhibited hyper-activation and high level of expression of cytotoxic granules CD8 T cells and pro-inflammatory CD4 T cells suggested immune responses against viral attack (
