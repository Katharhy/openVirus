<p>Overall critical care treatment goals include avoidance of volume overload, since overhydration may precipitate or exacerbate ARDS, maintenance of blood pressure (mean arterial pressure &gt;65â€‰mmHg) and good oxygenation. Renal treatment goals include supportive care and renal replacement therapy (RRT) [

 <xref rid="sfaa082-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore the decision of starting dialysis may be taken after putting in balance the traditional clinical indicators (with the prioritization of volume control) for RRT versus the risk of exposing healthcare workers to procedures that maybe are not needed in some of these patients and require additional manpower and machines. The type of RRT in COVID-19 CRS patients is another unanswered question. Once again, data from the non-COVID-19 population with AKI failed to find significant differences between several types of continuous therapies (continuous veno-venous haemofiltration, continuous veno-venous haemodialysis or continuous veno-venous haemodiafiltration) versus prolonged intermittent RRT [
