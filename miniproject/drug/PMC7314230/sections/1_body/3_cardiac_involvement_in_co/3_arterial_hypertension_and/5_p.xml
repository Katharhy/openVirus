<p>At the time of this report, the data do not support a COVID-19-related shift away from ACEis/ARBs in patients with heart failure, hypertension or myocardial infarction, irrespective of SARS-CoV-2 according to the latest Position Statement of the European Society of Cardiology Council on Hypertension [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and a joint statement from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association and Heart Failure Society of America posted online on 17 March [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This makes sense, as the upregulation of ACE2 (protein transcription) likely occurs over a protracted period of time, and halting these mediations will worsen cardiac status and overall COVID outcomes, thus measures to prevent COVID infection (social distancing and hand washing) remain more useful than ACEi/ARB medication cessation based on the available evidence.
