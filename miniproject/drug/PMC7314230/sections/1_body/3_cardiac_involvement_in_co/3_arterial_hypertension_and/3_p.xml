<p>There are conflicting data from studies demonstrating whether these drugs increase or have a minimal effect on ACE2 levels. Ferrario Carlos 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] noted increased ACE2 expression in rat myocardial tissue after 12â€‰days of lisinopril and losartan, similar to the findings of Ocaranza 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] after enalapril and Ishiyama 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] after losartan or olmesartan. However, other groups failed to show a difference in ACE2 expression with ACEis/ARBs versus controls in animals [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] or in humans [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Thus studies on myocardial ACE2 expression are not demonstrating a concordant signal. Nevertheless, pulmonary ACE2 expression remains understudied.
