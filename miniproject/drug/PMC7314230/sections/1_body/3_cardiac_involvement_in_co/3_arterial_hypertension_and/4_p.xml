SARS downregulated ACE2 by binding the SARS-CoV Spike protein to ACE2. Interestingly, when SARS-CoV Spike protein was injected into the bloodstream, renin–angiotensin blockade prevented further worsening of acute lung failure. In COVID-19 patients, it was noted that viral load, lung injury (via the partial pressure of oxygen:fraction of inspired oxygen ratio) and higher levels of angiotensin II were all positively correlated [

As a result, recombinant ACE2 protein to provide ‘false targets’ for viral binding, and to modulate the RAS, might be used to protect individuals with SARS by potentially lowering both the viral load and the deleterious effects of angiotensin II activity. Notably, a recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2; APN01, GSK2586881) has been found to be safe, with no negative haemodynamic effects in a small cohort of non-COVID-19 patients with ARDS [
