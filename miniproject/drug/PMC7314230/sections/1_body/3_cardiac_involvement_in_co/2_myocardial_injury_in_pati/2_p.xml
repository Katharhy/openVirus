<p>Myocardial injury can occur due to myocardial ischaemia or non-ischaemic myocardial processes, including myocarditis. Up to one in five COVID-19 patients will get acute myocardial injury (12–17% of cases) [

 <xref rid="sfaa082-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] observed a progressive increase (reaching the upper reference limit at Day 11) of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) levels in non-survivors, while hs-cTnI remained low in survivors. In a meta-analysis of four studies including a total of 341 patients, the standardized mean difference of cTnI levels was significantly higher in those with severe COVID-19 compared with milder disease [

The inflammatory response and haemodynamic changes associated with severe disease may confer a risk for atherosclerotic plaque rupture in susceptible patients. It is important to note a potential overlapping symptomatology between acute coronary syndrome and COVID-19. Interestingly, cardiac dysfunction overlapped with renal dysfunction, both occurring 2–4 days after the beginning of sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The increase in cTnI may relate to endotoxin production as is known to occur in sepsis [
