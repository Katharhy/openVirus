<p>A more aggressive form of cardiac involvement cited in the literature among patients with COVID-19 is fulminant myocarditis [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B16" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref>]. Chen 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] observed higher interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in patients with fulminant myocarditis in their series of 120 COVID patients. Zhou 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] also observed a worse prognosis in IL-6-elevated patients and this group had a higher likelihood of acute myocardial injury; the increase in IL-6 parallels the increase in hs-cTnI, raising the possibility that this reflects viral myocarditis. Ruan 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported on myocardial damage as a cause of death by fulminant myocarditis in five patients (7%) and a cause of respiratory failure in 22 patients. In one patient with fulminant COVID-19 myocarditis, early glucocorticoid and immunoglobulin initiation resulted in complete remission of symptoms and echocardiographic changes after 1 week and fully normalized myocardial injury markers at 3 weeks [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, even after a successful recovery from fulminant myocarditis, there is a lasting cardiac risk, with higher rates of cardiac death and heart transplantation in patients who developed fulminant forms of myocarditis compared with non-fulminant forms (47.7% of patients with fulminant versus 10.4% of patients with non-fulminant forms at the 7-year follow-up—data from a retrospective, international registry comprising a total of 220 patients) [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; this will remain to be determined in long-term follow-up studies of patients with COVID-19 myocarditis.
