<p>Case reports have noted the development of arterial pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in patients with COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], vascular inflammation being considered the main culprit of the hypercoagulable state and endothelial dysfunction. However, it is not clear if the risk of PTE is higher in patients with COVID-19 than other critically ill patients. Elevated D-dimer levels (&gt;1â€‰g/L) are strongly associated with in-hospital death in these patients [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In the setting of critically ill COVID-19 patients, although non-specific, an elevated D-dimer level coupled with respiratory deterioration evidenced by hypoxia or haemodynamic instability should raise suspicion for pulmonary embolism. In the absence of a clear indication for full anticoagulation, all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 should receive pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin [
