<p>It has been documented that COVID-19 causes myocarditis [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], acute myocardial infarction [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and exacerbation of heart failure [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This is actually not unique to COVID-19 and is a documented source of mortality in prior epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Interestingly, in COVID, the pulmonary risk is greater in those with pre-existing cardiac disease [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The SARS-CoV-2 infection causes acute myocardial injury, shock and arrhythmia in 7.2, 8.7 and 16.7% of patients, respectively, according to a recent epidemiological study [
