<p>Coronaviruses are a major pathogen for adults, children and animals, causing up to one-third of community-acquired respiratory tract infections in adults during epidemics. In December 2019, a novel coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] was identified from a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. At the time of this report, the virus is spreading globally and, in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.</p>
