<p>Once SARS-CoV-2 enters the bloodstream, the postulated mechanisms for kidney damage include sepsis, cytokine storm and direct cellular injury [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Although in a post-mortem analysis of SARS patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) using electron transmission microscopy, SARS-CoV was not detectable in any of the renal specimens [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], thus the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 in renal tissue is still under debate. Using polymerase chain reaction, Wang

 <xref rid="sfaa082-B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] did not identify the virus in the urine in any of the 72 urine specimens tested. However, using immunohistochemistry, 
 <italic>in situ</italic> SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein was detected in six post-mortem samples from patients with AKI [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Moreover, recent human tissue RNA sequencing data have demonstrated that ACE2 expression in the kidney tubules is nearly 100-fold higher than in the lungs [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Corroborating this with the increased binding affinity to ACE2 of the SARS-CoV-2, as compared with the SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], could support and explain the observed differences between the two infections in regard to a direct viral attack on the kidney. Other factors that may negatively interfere with kidney function are the presence of haemodynamic instability and concomitant medication, which may cause direct tubular toxicity or immunoallergic effects.
