<p>Previous studies of SARS and MERS-CoV infections reported a prevalence of AKI of 5–15% associated with a high mortality rate of up to 90% [

The most prominent findings were albuminuria or haematuria, found by dipstick assessment in almost one-third of patients on the first day of admission, and elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, found in 15.5% and 14.1% of patients, respectively [
