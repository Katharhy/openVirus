<p>Cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) comprises a number of conditions involving both the heart and kidneys, in which acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction in the other organ [

 <xref rid="sfaa082-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 enters the body using an evolutionarily evolved arm that binds human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on human pneumocytes [
 <xref rid="sfaa082-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. ACE2 also serves a role in lung protection and therefore viral binding to this receptor deregulates a lung-protective pathway. Furthermore, ACE2 is also expressed in the heart and kidney, providing a link between coronavirus infection and the cardiovascular and renal system. While infection progresses, ACE2 is downregulated, resulting in increased angiotensin II action and/or loss of the cardioprotective effects of angiotensins 1â€“7.
