<p>Our study has several limitations to be considered. First, the sample size is small and could have limited the power to detect differences in potential covariates such as HIV status and injecting-drug use; however, the proportion of WWUD in cohort studies of PWID actively are traditionally low and women are usually under-represented. Second, this study focuses exclusively in women who were attended in a harm reduction program and with a chaotic lifestyle, which may not be generalizable to other populations of WWUD or other types of substances abuse. Third, vulnerability was not assessed using gender- violence specific scales or scores [

 <xref rid="pone.0230886.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], we found our findings very relevant. Fourth, an information bias (interview face-to-face) is possible, but a trained female nurse and a short questionnaire could have minimized this issue. Fifth, the results on drug use and violent events were based on self-report measures rather than urine toxicology or other factual evidence. In the same way, the diagnostic of MHD was self-reported by patients and it was not assessed in-depth. This could have underestimated and explained the low prevalence found and be a bias due to this MHD is one of the most relevant vulnerability factors in WWID.
