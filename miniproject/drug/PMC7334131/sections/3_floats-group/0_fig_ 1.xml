  <p>Axial image (

   <bold>b</bold>). High-resolution chest-computed tomography on admission showed patchy ground-glass opacities (GGO). Consolidation was present in the dependent segments of both lungs with an asymmetric distribution, predominantly involving the left lower lobe. Distribution of lesions was mainly located in the medial lung. Acute CT axial (
   <bold>c</bold>) and image 2D coronal image reconstruction (
   <bold>d</bold>), of 7 days after admission, revealed marked progression of multiple, diffuse, and confluent GGO, even evolved into consolidation. Newly GGO were also distributed along peripheral or subpleural regions. A small amount of pleural effusion was also seen
