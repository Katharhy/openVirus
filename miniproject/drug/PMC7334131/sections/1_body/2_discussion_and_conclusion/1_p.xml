<p id="Par15">To our knowledge, there have been few reports of multiple cerebral arterial ischemic strokes in novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; although a recent Chinese study has demonstrated that acute cerebrovascular disease is not uncommon in COVID-19 patient [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. They reported 221 patients with COVID-19, 11 of (5%) whom developed acute ischemic stroke, 1 (0–5%) cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), and 1 (0–5%) cerebral hemorrhage. In their results, they emphasized that neurological COVID-19 patients were older and had multiple risk factors, more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, and inflammatory response in the state of blood hypercoagulable. However, also adult patient with the same risk factors, overweight or obesity, are at higher risk as in our case.
