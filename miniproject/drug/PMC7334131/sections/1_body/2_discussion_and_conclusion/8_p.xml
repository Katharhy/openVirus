<p id="Par22">The majority of viruses that have caused recent epidemics, with high lethality rates in people, are zoonoses originating from bats. Many of these viruses, including Coronaviruses, implicate the host response as an important contributor to the disease process; in this respect, dysregulated and excessive innate immune responses appear particularly important drivers of tissue damage during infection. It has been postulated that the reason why bats are the natural, healthy reservoir of these viruses may reside in their immune tolerance [
