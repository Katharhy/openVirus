    "We describe a case of a 47-year-old Italian, immunocompromised, and obese woman infected by COVID-19 presenting with fever (39.6 °C) and respiratory symptoms. Neurological examination was normal. Chest CT findings consist of bilateral interstitial pneumonia (visual score extension: 30%). The patient was treated with antiviral drugs and anti-inflammatory drugs with supportive care. Seven days after admission to Covid-19 Unit, the patient rapidly developed worsening respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She suddenly developed partial left hemispheric syndrome. A new HRCT scan of her thorax revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities in both lungs (visual score extension: 90%). Brain CT performed 2 h after sudden-onset left-sided weakness showed subtle low attenuation within the right insular ribbon and frontal lobe (ASPECT Score 8). Multiphasic CT angiography (MCTA) demonstrated occlusion of both the dominant inferior division of the right middle cerebral artery and the A2 segment of the right anterior cerebral artery. After 24 h, her pupils became dilated and unreactive, and brain CT demonstrated large bilateral infarctions of both the cerebellar and cerebral hemispheres. She had a rapid progression of interstitial pneumonia from COVID-19, developed multiple strokes, and died 1 day later. SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to predispose pluripathological subjects to cerebrovascular complications."
