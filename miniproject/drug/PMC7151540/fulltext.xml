Discovering that an infection control protocol is inadequate, or impractical to implement, in the real-world setting of a contagious patient during an infectious outbreak can have potentially severe consequences. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is already known to be associated with a high risk of transmission of disease to HCWs,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> and is likely to be more transmissible than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Within the ICU, potentially aerosol generating procedures such as manual ventilation and tracheal intubation are known to enhance transmission of respiratory viral disease to HCWs,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> and therefore introducing robust infection control processes as soon as possible is of paramount importance.</p><p id="p0015">Although several expert opinion pieces have been written regarding appropriate standards for infection control and prevention of transmission of COVID-19,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> few address operational issues, particularly the practical aspects of implementation, such as the ability to achieve an efficient, practical, and reproducible workflow in specific clinical settings. To examine system and operational issues related to our infection control guidelines, we designed and implemented a high-fidelity <italic>in situ</italic> clinical simulation to replicate admission, including tracheal intubation, of a patient with suspected or known COVID-19 infection. The main objective of the simulation was to test the ability of the HCW team to effectively implement use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and the practicality of the intubation protocol and preliminary outbreak infection control guidelines.</p><p id="p0020">Participants were a clinical team including volunteer doctors and nurses who underwent an <italic>in situ</italic> high-fidelity simulation. Additional supporting staff participants were also available to enter the simulation when requested by doctor or nurse participants. The simulation was managed by one experienced simulation manager outside the isolation room observing though a glass observation panel, and one within.</p><p id="p0025">The simulation was conducted in a fully appointed but unused and disinfected airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) with an anteroom and interlocking doors. A specified clean area located outside the anteroom was used for donning PPE. Doffing PPE took place at a station within the anteroom. A SimMan 3G (Laerdal Medical Ltd, Orpington, UK) was used to simulate a patient with clinical COVID-19 associated severe hypoxaemic respiratory failure and moderate arterial hypotension being admitted to the ICU. Tracheal intubation and placement of a central intravenous catheter was required. Workflow and processes were critically observed throughout by the simulation managers.</p><p id="p0030">A pre-designed management focused feedback rubric was used to debrief the participants at the end of the simulation. The domains for feedback and discussion included the following key events in chronological order: donning PPE, pre-intubation check, intubation procedure, and doffing PPE. Participants were encouraged to provide feedback and suggestions that may enhance the effectiveness of the protocol and improve clinical workflow. After each debriefing and critical review, changes to improve the guideline and workflow were instituted, and the revised protocol was tested in the subsequent simulation.</p><p id="p0035">We completed 11 individual simulations involving 44 participants (11 doctors and 33 nurses/supporting staff). Each simulation lasted 20&#x02013;30 min and debriefing lasted 30 min. Based on the observations of the simulation facilitators and the structured debriefing, several infection control-related workflow problems were observed (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>
and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>
). Observed safety threats, and those recorded during debriefing, addressed the following key domains: donning and doffing of PPE, advance preparation of intubation and ventilation strategies, technical understanding of circuit setup, environmental protection measures, communication difficulty, and accessibility of key drugs and equipment. Responses to eliminate or minimise the observed safety threats resulted in both guideline changes, modifications to the environment, and implementation of methods to improve workflow and ability of staff to follow infection control guidelines (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Repeated simulations resulted in no additional changes after the eighth simulation.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Observed safety threats recorded during debriefing and response actions taken to eliminate or minimise the specific safety threat identified.

Repeated simulations appear useful as new simulations yielded meaningful system/process deficits up to the seventh simulation. This meant that within 2 days relevant guideline modifications and workflow improvements could be fully evaluated and implemented.</p><p id="p0045">Anticipating the rapid progression of the COVID-19 pandemic, a potentially fatal respiratory disease, it is especially important to be prepared in the ICU to protect staff from transmission during high-risk procedures such as tracheal intubation. With the use of <italic>in situ</italic> simulation as described, we were able to create a workable guideline, visual aids, and workflow that allowed proper implementation of infection control in a real clinical setting. <italic>In situ</italic> simulation answers the questions &#x02018;What could be done better?&#x02019; and &#x02018;What is working well?&#x02018;.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> To answer these questions, key components of simulation are: 1) simulation should take place <italic>in situ</italic> (within the real workplace with normally available equipment and drugs) to re-create the work environment accurately; 2) participants should be working HCWs reflecting the makeup of the clinical environment (doctors, nurses, and supporting staff); 3) scenario should recreate a meaningful clinical event; 4) structured debriefing should be done by a combination of simulation experts and senior management staff to focus on the evaluation of guidelines, systems and workflow (in addition to providing for education of participants); and 5) should be repeated until further useful system observations cease to occur.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>
</p><p id="p0050">It is clear that our reported infection control protocol and improvements may not be directly applicable to other ICUs, as systems and processes should be specific to individual institutions and local practices. This report is limited in that the time constraints of an imminent outbreak did not allow a more formal evaluation of methodology, nor provide evidence that the intervention described improved actual practice, or contributed to the actual reduction of transmission to HCWs. Nevertheless, we believe <italic>in situ</italic> simulation provides a potentially useful tool to rehearse the safe care of patients in anticipation of treating an emerging infectious disease such as COVID-19.</p><sec id="sec1"><title>Declarations of interest</title><p id="p0055">The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list
