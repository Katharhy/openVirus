<p id="p0025">The simulation was conducted in a fully appointed but unused and disinfected airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) with an anteroom and interlocking doors. A specified clean area located outside the anteroom was used for donning PPE. Doffing PPE took place at a station within the anteroom. A SimMan 3G (Laerdal Medical Ltd, Orpington, UK) was used to simulate a patient with clinical COVID-19 associated severe hypoxaemic respiratory failure and moderate arterial hypotension being admitted to the ICU. Tracheal intubation and placement of a central intravenous catheter was required. Workflow and processes were critically observed throughout by the simulation managers.</p>
