<p id="p0035">We completed 11 individual simulations involving 44 participants (11 doctors and 33 nurses/supporting staff). Each simulation lasted 20–30 min and debriefing lasted 30 min. Based on the observations of the simulation facilitators and the structured debriefing, several infection control-related workflow problems were observed (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). Observed safety threats, and those recorded during debriefing, addressed the following key domains: donning and doffing of PPE, advance preparation of intubation and ventilation strategies, technical understanding of circuit setup, environmental protection measures, communication difficulty, and accessibility of key drugs and equipment. Responses to eliminate or minimise the observed safety threats resulted in both guideline changes, modifications to the environment, and implementation of methods to improve workflow and ability of staff to follow infection control guidelines (
