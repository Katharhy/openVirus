To examine system and operational issues related to our infection control guidelines, we designed and implemented a high-fidelity

The main objective of the simulation was to test the ability of the HCW team to effectively implement use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and the practicality of the intubation protocol and preliminary outbreak infection control guidelines.
