<p id="p0030">A pre-designed management focused feedback rubric was used to debrief the participants at the end of the simulation. The domains for feedback and discussion included the following key events in chronological order: donning PPE, pre-intubation check, intubation procedure, and doffing PPE. Participants were encouraged to provide feedback and suggestions that may enhance the effectiveness of the protocol and improve clinical workflow. After each debriefing and critical review, changes to improve the guideline and workflow were instituted, and the revised protocol was tested in the subsequent simulation.</p>
