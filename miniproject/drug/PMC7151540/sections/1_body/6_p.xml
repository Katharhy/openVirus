<p id="p0040">We recommend 
 <italic>in situ</italic> simulation methodology as a valuable tool to evaluate and improve system performance, in this case infection control guidelines before the occurrence of an anticipated real event. Repeated simulations appear useful as new simulations yielded meaningful system/process deficits up to the seventh simulation. This meant that within 2 days relevant guideline modifications and workflow improvements could be fully evaluated and implemented.
