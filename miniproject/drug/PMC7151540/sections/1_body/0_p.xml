 </xref> This approach is especially useful when approaching situations that would otherwise be difficult to study in the actual clinical setting because of practical constraints or inherent dangers to patients or healthcare workers (HCWs), such as preparing the response to an outbreak. Discovering that an infection control protocol is inadequate, or impractical to implement, in the real-world setting of a contagious patient during an infectious outbreak can have potentially severe consequences. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is already known to be associated with a high risk of transmission of disease to HCWs,
