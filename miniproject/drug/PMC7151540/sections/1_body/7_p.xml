<p id="p0045">Anticipating the rapid progression of the COVID-19 pandemic, a potentially fatal respiratory disease, it is especially important to be prepared in the ICU to protect staff from transmission during high-risk procedures such as tracheal intubation. With the use of 
 <italic>in situ</italic> simulation as described, we were able to create a workable guideline, visual aids, and workflow that allowed proper implementation of infection control in a real clinical setting. 
 <italic>In situ</italic> simulation answers the questions ‘What could be done better?’ and ‘What is working well?‘.

 </xref> To answer these questions, key components of simulation are: 1) simulation should take place 
 <italic>in situ</italic> (within the real workplace with normally available equipment and drugs) to re-create the work environment accurately; 2) participants should be working HCWs reflecting the makeup of the clinical environment (doctors, nurses, and supporting staff); 3) scenario should recreate a meaningful clinical event; 4) structured debriefing should be done by a combination of simulation experts and senior management staff to focus on the evaluation of guidelines, systems and workflow (in addition to providing for education of participants); and 5) should be repeated until further useful system observations cease to occur.
