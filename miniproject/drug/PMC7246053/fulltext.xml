We anticipate changes in how we interact with our patients and other providers, how patient workflow is designed, the methods used to conduct our teaching sessions, and how we perform procedures in different clinical settings. The objective of the present report is to review some of the changes to consider in the clinical and academic oral and maxillofacial surgery workflow and, allow for a smoother transition, with less risk to our patients and healthcare personnel. New infection control policies should be strictly enforced and monitored in all clinical and nonclinical settings, with an overall goal to decrease the risk of exposure and transmission. Screening for COVID-19 symptoms, testing when indicated, and establishing the epidemiologic linkage will be crucial to containing and preventing new COVID-19 cases until a vaccine or an alternate solution is available. Additionally, the shortage of essential supplies such as drugs and personal protective equipment, the design and ventilation of workspaces and waiting areas, the&#x000a0;increase in overhead costs, and the possible absence of staff, if quarantine is necessary, must be considered. This shift in our workflow and patient care paths will likely continue in the short-term at least through 2021 or the next 12 to 24&#x000a0;months. Thus, we must prioritize surgery, balancing patient preferences and healthcare personnel risks. We have an opportunity now to make changes and embrace telemedicine and other collaborative virtual platforms for teaching and clinical care. It is crucial that we maintain COVID-19 awareness, proper surveillance in our microenvironments, good clinical judgment, and ethical values to continue to deliver high-quality, economical, and accessible patient care.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="p0010">In the past 2&#x000a0;decades, beta coronaviruses have caused 3 major infection outbreaks, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (CoV) in 2002 to 2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV in 2012 and, more recently, SARS-CoV2 in 2019 and 2020. In 2005, Michael Osterholm from the Center for Infectious Research and Policy in Minneapolis, and other infectious disease experts, predicted the occurrence of an unavoidable influenza pandemic and recognized how unprepared our current healthcare systems were to manage such an event.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Unlike the previous 2 outbreaks, which were regional epidemics, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV2, spread within a few weeks across the globe, disrupting the social, economic, and emotional well-being of our societies. This rapid spread to every continent resulted, in part, from the effects of traveling and globalization and, in part, from the greater infectivity and transmission of SARS-CoV2.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>

<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Fauci et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> reported that each infected person was infecting &#x0223c;2 people in March 2020 (R<sub>0</sub> basic reproduction number, 2.2). SARS-CoV2 is a B lineage beta coronavirus, which is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. Similar to SARS-CoV, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is the main entry path for SARS-CoV2. Protease activation on the S (spike) protein facilitates coronavirus entry into the cells. The higher affinity (10- to 20-fold) of the S protein of SARS-CoV2 for the human ACE2 receptor might explain the rapid human-to-human transmission compared with that of SAR-CoV.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>
</p><p id="p0015">In the absence of a vaccine or effective antiviral therapies, the management of COVID-19 has centered on supportive care for those with severe symptoms, and the use of physical means such as quarantine and &#x0201c;social distancing&#x0201d; for mitigation of spread. Implementing the required physical distancing measures to prevent transmission of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) has been disruptive, to say the least, to our daily lives, patient care, business operations, and, to a lesser extent, to didactic activities. Concern exists that relaxing the social distancing arrangements too early, as the pandemic abates, could lead to a second wave of COVID-19 cases, extending the suffering and socioeconomic uncertainty in the long-term. The risk this could pose to our finite, already overburdened, healthcare personnel (HCP) and hospitals that have reached capacity should not be overlooked. Although these consequences are possible, some time-sensitive patient care activities are necessary to avoid worsening the prognosis of debilitating or life-threatening disorders.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</p><p id="p0020">As we transition from our strict physical distancing guidelines to less stringent regulations and return to our clinical care activities, several uncertainties remain. Unfortunately SARS-CoV2 is a novel virus, and many deficiencies exist in the understanding of its behavior. These include <italic>1)</italic> the exact case fatality rate is uncertain due to incomplete information on actual numbers of cases; <italic>2)</italic> the timing of infectiousness relative to the onset of symptoms; <italic>3)</italic> the large number of presymptomatic or asymptomatic infectious patients; <italic>4)</italic> the duration of the infectious period; and <italic>5)</italic> the accuracy of commercially available rapid diagnostic tests to determine whether a patient has COVID-19.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Second, all surgical and nonsurgical procedures performed by oral-maxillofacial surgeons convey a high risk to HCP. Although some of these uncertainties and challenges will be resolved as the data regarding the virus and the disease improve, we all have some apprehension and reservations regarding delivering care in such an environment.</p><p id="p0025">However, we have all experienced the positive effects that have resulted from this enforced change during the COVID-19 crisis. These have included collaborative online lectures, the use of telemedicine, and the emergence of numerous technological innovations (eg, voice user interface, chatbots) in healthcare delivery.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> The fact that we have all adopted these technologies rapidly is verification that &#x0201c;necessity is the mother of invention.&#x0201d; Such opportunities in a time of crisis can have tremendous effects in the short-term. The changes will be even more beneficial if we can refine and adopt these venerable technologies in the future into our mainstream workflow.</p><p id="p0030">The aim of this report is to review some of the considerations in oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) practice as we move from the current situation of strict social and physical distancing rules to phased clinical care during this evolving global pandemic. We included some pragmatic suggestions to leverage telemedicine for emergency care and nonurgent consultations, to adopt and scale machine-learning tools and chatbots to improve surgical workflow efficiency in the operating room (OR), changes in infection control policies, surgical prioritization, screening and testing for COVID-19, and considerations for effective didactic curriculum changes, research opportunities, and business considerations. The suggestions for infection control policies, optimization of personal protective equipment (PPE), diagnostic testing, and surgical prioritization should be considered in conjunction with, and be guided by one's institution, the local, state, and/or federal (ie, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS]) authorities, and other joint professional organizations.</p><sec id="sec1"><title>Considerations for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons for Reentry in COVID-19 Era</title><p id="p0035">Planning to return to our new normal requires engagement with our institutions and local and state administrative authorities and awareness of the COVID-19 situation and policies in our region (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>

The leadership in OMS has made tremendous efforts at the local, state, and national level to educate, disseminate, and share information about COVID-19 through national web conferences and the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons website. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons in various hospitals and academic medical centers rapidly made schedule changes to manage dental emergencies, odontogenic infections, maxillofacial injuries, and oncologic patients and take the necessary precautions. These precautions include airborne infection isolation rooms, negative pressure rooms, telemedicine triage, and the use of appropriate PPE for aerosol-generating procedures (including eye protection and filtered face respirators [N95], face shields, and powered air-purifying respirators [PAPRs]).</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>COVID-19 Surveillance (Screening, Testing, Tracing)</title><p id="p0045">Ongoing surveillance is crucial to containing any epidemic (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>
). Surveillance includes screening, testing, tracing, and monitoring the incidence of new cases. The CDC has recommended that all frontline HCP should be trained and prepared to screen patients for COVID-19. The results of testing should be reported to the local or state authorities and the CDC to allow for proper surveillance. Symptom questionnaires must be completed before scheduling an outpatient clinic visit and updated on arrival of the patient to capture all presymptomatic cases. COVID-19 screening should include questions regarding recent travel to hotspots, recent exposure to an infected individual, previous testing for, or a diagnosis of COVID-19, any current investigation (self or family member), close contact (&#x02265;15&#x000a0;minutes within 6&#x000a0;ft) with anyone with a diagnosis of COVID-19, and, any symptoms experienced within the previous 2 to 14&#x000a0;days. These symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and/or a new loss of taste or smell. The most common symptoms have been fever (83 to 99% of cases), cough (59 to 82%), fatigue (44 to 70%), and anorexia (40 to 84% of cases).<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref>

Many questions have ensured regarding testing, including the availability of validated rapid tests, who should be tested, and the process of obtaining specimens. The CDC has recommended that clinicians work with their local and state health departments to coordinate testing through public health laboratories. Also physicians should use clinical judgment to determine whether a patient who presents for care has symptoms of an influenza-like illness or symptoms compatible with COVID-19 to make a decision regarding testing (guidelines available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/priority-testing-patients.pdf" id="intref0020">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/priority-testing-patients.pdf</ext-link>).

Studies have revealed that respiratory viruses enter via the nasal mucosa and conjunctiva and, less often, through the mouth. Droplets generated while talking, coughing, or sneezing are usually believed to travel up to a distance of 1&#x000a0;meter (3&#x000a0;ft) but the distance can be farther than 1&#x000a0;meter<italic>.</italic> Experience during the previous SARS outbreaks revealed that the droplets could travel up to 6&#x000a0;ft. Hence, the recommendation for the use of a face mask when within 6 to 10 feet of another person. Factors to consider include the droplet size, source, density of secretions, temperature, humidity, velocity, and mechanism by which the droplets were propelled. Procedures such as an injection of a local anesthetic or examination of the oropharynx can cause patients to cough or sneeze, propelling droplets 6&#x000a0;ft or more. In contrast, droplet nuclei (dried droplets containing the pathogen), which are 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m or less in size have been associated with airborne transmission that can remain in the air for long periods and be transmitted over greater distances.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref>

The lower the score, the less risk to the patient, surgical team, and healthcare system as a whole (available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.facs.org/media/press-releases/2020/covid-scoring-system0414/worksheet" id="intref0060">https://www.facs.org/media/press-releases/2020/covid-scoring-system0414/worksheet</ext-link>). The developers are currently validating the MeNTS scoring system.<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref> It might serve as a good tool that can be implemented for OMS prioritization after further iterations and validation. The American College of Surgeons has recommended using this method or a similar method applicable to each institution. Ultimately, surgeons must be fair to their patients and make the best clinical and most ethical decision for their patients. For oral-maxillofacial surgeons, among the several medically necessary conditions we treat, apart from emergencies, the most time-sensitive procedures include treatment of malignancy (eg, oral cancer, salivary gland malignancy, osteosarcoma), neurologic injuries, aggressive benign jaw tumors, congenital craniofacial anomalies (eg,&#x000a0;cleft palate repair before speech development), and chronic pain conditions recalcitrant to medical therapy.</p><p id="p0170">Using these algorithms or scoring methods can help us monitor outcomes closely during the evolving COVID-19 situation. The threshold to allow surgery should decrease gradually as the threat of overusage of resources and the threat of COVID-19 becomes lower. Given that all our procedures will be high risk, we must weigh the patient and disease factors carefully. We must evaluate our facility needs and the risks to our patients and the alternative options of nonoperative treatment versus the implications of delaying treatment. For example, consider the case of a patient with severe OSA who is intolerant to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and would like to consider surgical options. Maxillo-mandibular advancement is a high-risk AGP with a greater requirement for resources owing to the possible necessity for postoperative ICU care or prolonged intubation in the case of a complication and the increased risk to the healthcare team and the patient. Having a frank discussion with these patients to consider compliance with a nonoperative alternative therapy, such as a CPAP with a different type of mask, at least temporarily or a hybrid method of CPAP with an oral device might pose less risk to all. However, delaying treatment for a patient who is noncompliant and unable to tolerate CPAP can increase the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, which would result in an overall bad outcome and the usage of more healthcare system resources.</p><p id="p0175">When we consider the procedure, patient, and disease factors in the context of minor OMS procedures performed in the ambulatory setting, the risk is more favorable. For example, a 65-year-old man has presented for extraction of multiple (5 to 6) carious, nonrestorable teeth with periodontal infection and moderately well-controlled hypertension and diabetes, controlled with oral medications. The procedure is time sensitive with no alternative options. Also, a delay of 2 to 6&#x000a0;weeks could make the outcome moderately worse but the difficulty of the operation would not change. Using the MeNTS scoring system, if the length of a procedure is short and can be performed in an ambulatory setting, the score would sum to 31, denoting a favorable risk to personnel and resource usage. Similarly, procedures such as the placement of implants and dentoalveolar surgery, which are ambulatory procedures, pose a greater risk to HCP but have lower resource usage, possibly implying an overall favorable risk. Whether we modify and use the MeNTS scoring method or an alternative, such scores must be validated for OMS procedures. In contrast, consider the options for a relatively healthy, young female patient who requires a Botox injection for intractable migraine headaches. The procedure has low to moderate risk, low resource usage, can directly improve the patient's quality of life, and, indirectly, decrease the use of other resources by possibly avoiding an emergency room visit.</p><p id="p0180">Head and neck oncology patients pose the greatest challenge given the time-sensitive nature of their condition, their age, medical comorbidities, and frailty along with high resource usage and risk to HCP. Shuman et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> proposed an ethical framework for head and neck cancer care affected by COVID-19. They highlighted the conflicting interests of clinical ethics versus public health ethics when considering population versus individual interests.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> They suggested considering the metrics of tumor progression, the risk of delay, and the use of alternative therapies (eg, radiotherapy) when applicable and feasible.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> In general, they suggested having a well-thought-out plan through a collective decision-making process with members of the tumor board and with consideration of the patient's preferences.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> For such situations, one could study treatment models developed for limited resource settings with a high volume of cancer care, such as the model described by Pramesh and Badwe<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> in the Tata Memorial Cancer Center, where more than 70,000 new patients with cancer, including a vast number with oral cancer, are treated annually. This disruption in surgical services resulting from COVID-19 for our patients with cancer is also likely to stimulate further interest in considering immunotherapies that are more novel. This is also the time to evaluate other existing technologies such as mobile telemedicine to diagnose cancer at early stages by decreasing the time required to refer patients to a specialist.</p><p id="p0185">Being aware of the COVID-19 hotspots and understanding the population demographics and the risk factors of the individuals susceptible to COVID-19 will be critical to successful planning. Data from the CDC have shown that the overall cumulative COVID-19&#x02013;associated hospitalization rate has been 29.2 per 100,000 persons, with the highest rates for persons aged 65&#x000a0;years and older (95.5 per 100,000 persons) and 50 to 64&#x000a0;years (47.2 per 100,000 persons). Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes were the most common underlying comorbid conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>
). Oral-maxillofacial surgeons working in inner city hospitals and outpatient clinics at academic institutions often see high-risk populations who have limited access to oral healthcare and who live in group homes, correctional facilities, nursing homes, or temporary shelters. These patients also often have chronic diseases such as poorly controlled diabetes, hypertension, and renal failure, as well as other chronic conditions and immunosuppressive disorders. In addition, to the limited access to healthcare, these people have other socioeconomic disadvantages, live in densely populated neighborhoods, have limited disposable income, and must frequently visit stores for food and essential supplies, increasing their risk of exposure and transmission of infection. Cases of COVID-19 have been increasing among incarcerated individuals and workers in state prisons in Texas, Georgia, California, Massachusetts, Michigan, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Washington.<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref>

The schedules must be modified to limit crowding and maintain safe distances in designated waiting areas. One method to accomplish this would be to continue video telemedicine triage services for consultations and to schedule surgical procedures more efficiently. The schedules should accommodate a patient's needs, and definitive treatment should be rendered whenever possible to avoid multiple visits. Streamlining procedures will allow for the performance of high-risk AGPs in designated areas with provisions for germicidal UV light disinfection, in addition to chemical disinfection, or in negative pressure rooms, using appropriate PPE (ie, surgical N95 respirator, eye protection, face shield, fluid-resistant disposable gown, booties). Performing OMS procedures during the pandemic and in the near future with additional PPE and new infection control guidelines can be time consuming, demanding, and tedious. Oral-maxillofacial surgeons should be careful to plan for additional time, delegate tasks, and request help from colleagues to reduce medical errors when working in stressful situations.<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref> Using a customized workflow for the specialist and the type of procedure with machine learning tools and chatbots could potentially make the tasks for the OR staff more straightforward and allow for seamless operation during shift changes and breaks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Ambulatory Anesthesia and Drug Shortages</title><p id="p0195">The American Society of Dental Anesthesiology has provided a guidance document for office-based anesthesia in the setting of COVID-19.

From the current trends in usage globally, the following drugs are likely to be affected: oxygen, propofol, midazolam, fentanyl, antibiotics, muscle relaxants, and steroids. Treatment of patients with COVID-19 requires the delivery of oxygen as the main treatment, which has implications for the functioning of hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers. One should consider the possible delays that could occur from supply chain interruptions and prepare accordingly.</p><p id="p0205">Global pandemics such as COVID-19 will not only expose several bottlenecks in the supply chain in the pharmaceutical industry, but will also collapse the delicate balance that exists between supply and demand at the end-user units. Typically, drug shortages can result from several causes. These include both business and market factors:<list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0210">A lack of transparency or communication about actual or probable product shortages</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0215">A lack of business incentives to enter a specific product market</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0220">Unpredictable changes in product demand, such as in the current situation</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0225">A reallocation of production lines</p></list-item><list-item id="u0030"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0230">Consolidation of companies</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="p0235">That 80% of raw materials in the pharmaceutical industry originate from outside the United States can be problematic. This will be especially true if single-source active product ingredients or raw material manufacturers face disruption to acquisition because of <italic>1)</italic> political instability and/or government interference; <italic>2)</italic> natural disasters or pandemics; and <italic>3)</italic> contamination during drug production, storage, or transport. Furthermore, the distribution of drugs can be affected directly by barriers to the international transport of medications and inventory practices by healthcare facilities and supply chain entities. These factors will affect smaller OMS practices because such practices often have little to no inventory cushion to compensate for short-term shortages. In addition, their inventory procurement capabilities will be vastly different from those of large healthcare facilities, and they cannot maintain an excess inventory. Also, a large gray market exists that influences the availability of different medications on a regular basis. Thus, oral-maxillofacial surgeons should plan to monitor their current supplies and orders and to estimate the costs and need for anesthetic drugs, such as propofol, fentanyl, and oxygen.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Implications for OMS Education</title><p id="p0240">The COVID-19 pandemic has paused almost all our traditional methods of education and training in our profession. This brings us to the question of whether the current training programs will meet the needs of the next generation of oral and maxillofacial surgeons and whether we will be able to relate the new knowledge base to undergraduate and postgraduate OMS education and training. Can we relate a national curriculum to the knowledge base for the board certification and recertification process? This might be the best time to create the national OMS curriculum for undergraduate and graduate training.</p><p id="p0245">Perhaps some of the most disruptive changes that have resulted from this pandemic have been in the area of resident and student education. Although massive open online courses have been in existence for more than a decade, they have not been used as much nor have they been evaluated for didactic surgical training. Online education and collaborations through data sharing platforms have been an integral part of fields such as engineering and business (eg, Github, Kaggle). These have led to numerous innovations and connected and benefited students across the globe. Equivalent platforms and methods of learning and teaching have been less common in medicine by the sheer nature of how we must practice medicine. However, as we move into an era of cloud-sharing platforms, virtual simulation, augmented reality and intelligence, chatbots, and robotic surgery, it might be feasible to collaborate and share knowledge and interact with others in the field without barriers.<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr"><sup>51</sup></xref> National and international online collaborative teaching courses have been having a tremendous effect on our trainees and transforming how they learn. These methods of audio- and video-assisted teaching and learning will need proper evaluation, with milestones for further validation, before incorporating them into the mainstream. Several undergraduate faculty across the United States have developed problem-based learning tools and simulation models for clinical scenarios in oral surgery (eg, objective structured clinical evaluation) to determine the clinical competency of our dental students at all levels. During the next few months as patient care resumes, we might have to rely more frequently on small group clinical teaching sessions (groups of 4 to 5 students) and problem-based learning and simulation-based teaching models, rather than on direct patient care.</p></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>Research Opportunities</title><p id="p0250">

</p></sec><sec id="sec9"><title>Business Changes to Consider for OMS Practices</title><p id="p0340">From the standpoint of practice business, no good comparison is available for the situation of a global pandemic. We can extrapolate some aspects from our experiences during natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina or similar events. During these uncertain times, the observed financial risk should not tempt us to restart our clinical operations earlier than the recommendations from our local and state authorities. It is imperative to follow their guidance, to avoid the risk of exposure of our HCP and patients, and to preserve the necessary resources for our professional colleagues during this period of scarcity.</p><p id="p0345">However, this is a great opportunity to think about how we practice and to test new digital platforms to collaborate with other specialists. One might consider requesting one's accountant to calculate the cash flow and expenses and provide a financial analysis and projection for the year ahead. Early conversations with one's banker regarding a line of credit for the business, the consolidation of loans with more favorable terms, and changes to current loan covenants can be helpful. Many banks will be open to loan forgiveness or interest-only payments. Also, contacting major vendors of practice equipment and negotiating loans and payment schedules can reduce some of the financial burden in the immediate future. It will be important to keep communication open with billing team members to decrease the accounts receivable and maximize the revenue from previous services. Before planning any HCP contract changes or furloughing staff, such items should be discussed with one's practice lawyer and the state labor laws should be reviewed to understand one's staff's rights, and one's own responsibilities. Insurance agents can review the business interruption insurance and coverage for a pandemic should be considered, if not already included, for the future. If still conducting business partially via televisits, the documentation and billing codes for these remote visits should be reviewed. It is a good time to reach out to professional colleagues to find out what they are doing, or as a way of more efficiently shepherding resources.</p></sec><sec id="sec10"><title>Support the Professional Community</title><p id="p0350">It is also important to keep our staff and referring dentists engaged and to keep them informed about any plans for reopening one's practice. We should reach out to our referring dentists and physicians to provide clinical support for emergency care. We should also keep them informed of our plans on how we intend to prioritize treatment for patients in accordance with our facility and state guidelines. The staff should be educated and trained to use the COVID-19 tools from state and federal websites regarding the new infection control policies, screening and testing for COVID-19. We should incorporate digital services and telemedicine to deliver care and create an inventory tool to estimate and calculate essential practice items (ie, PPE and drugs). Being a part of the broader solution is important, because any reentry must be in-line with others in the supply chain, including patients, community, ancillary staff, industry, and government. It would be prudent for oral-maxillofacial surgeons to take a fresh look at worst-case scenarios and develop contingency plans. Having a &#x0201c;living revival document&#x0201d; that can easily be updated or withdrawn as necessary is vital. Preparation for (or&#x000a0;at least discussion about) the next crisis (or the next phase of the present crisis) among stakeholders in each practice at this time is highly recommended. Just as debriefings after emergency practice drills will be the most informative, we learn the most while the crisis is unfolding. The challenges, responses, and scientific evidence should be well-documented.</p></sec><sec id="sec11"><title>Revenue Implications for OMS Training Programs</title><p id="p0355">All educational institutions and academic medical centers have lost revenue as the result of suspension of their programs and the increased costs of supporting the employees of the institutions. In addition, the economic downturn will continue the losses. This could lead to layoffs, which will be disruptive to many OMS programs, which do not have extensive employee numbers. We must find ways to reduce costs to protect the core and character of our programs. Hiring freezes, travel restrictions, and elimination of cost of living increases could all be cost-saving methods. Capital budget requests will probably be put on hold, most likely for 2&#x000a0;years. University and program endowments are often restricted to specific purposes set by the donors and cannot be used as a reserve fund. The decline in the investment market has resulted in a decline in the market value of the endowments. The monies spun off the principal of these endowments, which are used to support the institution's operations will also require cost reductions by individual operating units.</p><p id="p0360">It is important to undertake a very deliberate and transparent review of every aspect of an OMS program's budget, with the intent of eliminating unnecessary expenditures for the next 2&#x000a0;years. This process will not be easy. However, if undertaken immediately and by the OMS program leadership, cost reduction decisions will have fewer effects on the program. Leaders of OMS programs must give special attention to the budget processes to ensure that the professorships that are supported by institutional funds stay intact, providing solid justification for mission critical positions to be filled, and providing meaningful feedback and support to the faculty in lieu of salary increases for the next 2&#x000a0;years. They should prioritize and only support faculty travel determined to be essential to the mission of the program, looking to philanthropy to support capital budget projects that are aligned with the institution's master capital plan.</p><p id="p0365">In conclusion, these challenges we face will continue for at least the foreseeable future, including the next 12 to 24&#x000a0;months. The COVID-19 pandemic has opened our minds and forced us to mobilize and transition to a new and possibly more efficient healthcare delivery model through telemedicine and increased virtual collaboration. Digital technologies could have a high impact on healthcare delivery if we adopt, validate, and scale them for incorporation into our daily workflow. Prioritizing surgery will require objective methods and good clinical and ethical judgment on the part of the surgeon. The COVID-19 global pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of our healthcare systems. OMS professionals and leaders have an unprecedented opportunity to work with community, institutional, and professional leadership to implement care standards that address some of the flaws that have been recognized in our current healthcare system.
