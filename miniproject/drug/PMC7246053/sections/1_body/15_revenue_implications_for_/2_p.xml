<p id="p0360">It is important to undertake a very deliberate and transparent review of every aspect of an OMS program's budget, with the intent of eliminating unnecessary expenditures for the next 2 years. This process will not be easy. However, if undertaken immediately and by the OMS program leadership, cost reduction decisions will have fewer effects on the program. Leaders of OMS programs must give special attention to the budget processes to ensure that the professorships that are supported by institutional funds stay intact, providing solid justification for mission critical positions to be filled, and providing meaningful feedback and support to the faculty in lieu of salary increases for the next 2 years. They should prioritize and only support faculty travel determined to be essential to the mission of the program, looking to philanthropy to support capital budget projects that are aligned with the institution's master capital plan.</p>
