Since the first case in the United States was reported on January 20, 2020, COVID-19 has spread rapidly, affecting people in all 50 states, with 18 states reporting more than 10,000 cases (available at:

To date there are more than 6 million cases and 350,000 deaths in the world, with the United States accounting for 1.8 million cases and greater than 100,000 fatalities. The leadership in OMS has made tremendous efforts at the local, state, and national level to educate, disseminate, and share information about COVID-19 through national web conferences and the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons website. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons in various hospitals and academic medical centers rapidly made schedule changes to manage dental emergencies, odontogenic infections, maxillofacial injuries, and oncologic patients and take the necessary precautions. These precautions include airborne infection isolation rooms, negative pressure rooms, telemedicine triage, and the use of appropriate PPE for aerosol-generating procedures (including eye protection and filtered face respirators [N95], face shields, and powered air-purifying respirators [PAPRs]).
