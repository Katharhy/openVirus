<p id="p0015">In the absence of a vaccine or effective antiviral therapies, the management of COVID-19 has centered on supportive care for those with severe symptoms, and the use of physical means such as quarantine and “social distancing” for mitigation of spread. Implementing the required physical distancing measures to prevent transmission of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) has been disruptive, to say the least, to our daily lives, patient care, business operations, and, to a lesser extent, to didactic activities. Concern exists that relaxing the social distancing arrangements too early, as the pandemic abates, could lead to a second wave of COVID-19 cases, extending the suffering and socioeconomic uncertainty in the long-term. The risk this could pose to our finite, already overburdened, healthcare personnel (HCP) and hospitals that have reached capacity should not be overlooked. Although these consequences are possible, some time-sensitive patient care activities are necessary to avoid worsening the prognosis of debilitating or life-threatening disorders.
