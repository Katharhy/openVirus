<p id="p0080">Although SARS and COVID-19 are both transmitted by droplets, it is now clear that the infectivity and extent of spread of COVID-19 will far exceed that of SARS.

 </xref> The onset and duration of viral shedding and the infectious period relative to onset of symptoms are still not well understood for SARS-CoV2. In a recent study by Wölfel et al,

  <sup>29</sup>
 </xref> the greatest amounts of viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract were during the first 5 days as symptoms were developing. Also, live virus was isolated from 83% of the sputum samples but rarely (17%) from throat swabs in the first 8 days.

 </xref> pointed out that the presence of viral RNA in the specimens does not correlate with viral transmissibility and that previous studies in an animal model of H1N1 infection showed that a negative viral culture coincided with a decrease in the infectious period rather than the absence of viral RNA.
