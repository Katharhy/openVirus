 <italic>1)</italic> the need to have PPE to collect specimens; 
 <italic>2)</italic> the need to transport the samples as biohazardous waste; and 
 <italic>3)</italic> the need for reagents to purify RNA if possible. These could be removed by 
 <italic>1)</italic> having patients collect saliva samples at home and validating this process with nasal swabs and/or throat swabs; 
 <italic>2)</italic> using a viral inactivation buffer in the test tube used to collect the sample.
