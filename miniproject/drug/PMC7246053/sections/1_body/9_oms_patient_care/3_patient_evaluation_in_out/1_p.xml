<p id="p0155">We will be able to continue to perform some consultations for orthognathic surgery, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and dentoalveolar surgery via telephone- or video-assisted visits and choose to have in-person interactions during the pre- and postoperative period to decrease the risk of exposure and improve the workflow efficiency. When preparing patients for orthognathic, trauma, or temporomandibular joint surgery, alterations to traditional practice using a digital workflow model should be considered. During a preoperative planning visit, all attempts should be made to avoid the use of molded impressions and any intraoral imaging procedures that can lead to coughing and/or gagging and the generation of aerosol or droplets that will pose a risk to the staff. Instead, digital impressions, when the capability exists, should be considered or having the data transmitted from the referring orthodontist. Additionally, cone-beam computed tomography and virtual surgical planning will become an essential part of the workflow, if these have not already been incorporated as a standard part of the present workflow.</p>
