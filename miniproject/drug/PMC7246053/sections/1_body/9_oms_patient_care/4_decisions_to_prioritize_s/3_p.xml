<p id="p0170">Using these algorithms or scoring methods can help us monitor outcomes closely during the evolving COVID-19 situation. The threshold to allow surgery should decrease gradually as the threat of overusage of resources and the threat of COVID-19 becomes lower. Given that all our procedures will be high risk, we must weigh the patient and disease factors carefully. We must evaluate our facility needs and the risks to our patients and the alternative options of nonoperative treatment versus the implications of delaying treatment. For example, consider the case of a patient with severe OSA who is intolerant to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and would like to consider surgical options. Maxillo-mandibular advancement is a high-risk AGP with a greater requirement for resources owing to the possible necessity for postoperative ICU care or prolonged intubation in the case of a complication and the increased risk to the healthcare team and the patient. Having a frank discussion with these patients to consider compliance with a nonoperative alternative therapy, such as a CPAP with a different type of mask, at least temporarily or a hybrid method of CPAP with an oral device might pose less risk to all. However, delaying treatment for a patient who is noncompliant and unable to tolerate CPAP can increase the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, which would result in an overall bad outcome and the usage of more healthcare system resources.</p>
