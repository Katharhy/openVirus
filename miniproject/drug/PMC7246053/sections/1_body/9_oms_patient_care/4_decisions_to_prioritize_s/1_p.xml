<p id="p0160">Prioritizing surgical care is a major dilemma, as we gradually transition to patient care, especially for those patients who will require hospital admission and usage of more resources. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the CMS and other professional medical societies and organizations decided to halt all “elective,” “nonessential,” and “nonemergent” surgeries and preventive services. The CMS suggested a 3-tiered approach according to the acuity of the treatment or service, and conveyed that each organization or local institution should consider shared decision-making on a case-by-case basis. However, medical ethicists, Caplan and Thomas, argued that the terms “nonessential” and “elective” are fraught with confusion and emotion owing to the vagueness of these terms, making it difficult to decide who should qualify for surgery. Instead, they suggested a framework that would answer 2 crucial decision-making questions:

 <italic>2)</italic> whether the procedure is not life sustaining and does not require significant resources but will improve the patient's quality of life.

Thus, elective procedures can be divided into “essential” if an adverse outcome could occur owing to a delay in performing the procedure for an undetermined period and “nonessential” or “discretionary” if the procedure is not time sensitive.
