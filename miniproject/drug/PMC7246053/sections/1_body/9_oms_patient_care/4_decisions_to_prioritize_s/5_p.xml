This disruption in surgical services resulting from COVID-19 for our patients with cancer is also likely to stimulate further interest in considering immunotherapies that are more novel. This is also the time to evaluate other existing technologies such as mobile telemedicine to diagnose cancer at early stages by decreasing the time required to refer patients to a specialist.
