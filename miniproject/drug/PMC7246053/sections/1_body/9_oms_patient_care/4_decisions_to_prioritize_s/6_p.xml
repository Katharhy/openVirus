<p id="p0185">Being aware of the COVID-19 hotspots and understanding the population demographics and the risk factors of the individuals susceptible to COVID-19 will be critical to successful planning. Data from the CDC have shown that the overall cumulative COVID-19–associated hospitalization rate has been 29.2 per 100,000 persons, with the highest rates for persons aged 65 years and older (95.5 per 100,000 persons) and 50 to 64 years (47.2 per 100,000 persons). Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes were the most common underlying comorbid conditions (

Oral-maxillofacial surgeons working in inner city hospitals and outpatient clinics at academic institutions often see high-risk populations who have limited access to oral healthcare and who live in group homes, correctional facilities, nursing homes, or temporary shelters. These patients also often have chronic diseases such as poorly controlled diabetes, hypertension, and renal failure, as well as other chronic conditions and immunosuppressive disorders. In addition, to the limited access to healthcare, these people have other socioeconomic disadvantages, live in densely populated neighborhoods, have limited disposable income, and must frequently visit stores for food and essential supplies, increasing their risk of exposure and transmission of infection. Cases of COVID-19 have been increasing among incarcerated individuals and workers in state prisons in Texas, Georgia, California, Massachusetts, Michigan, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Washington.
