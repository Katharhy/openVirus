<p id="p0175">When we consider the procedure, patient, and disease factors in the context of minor OMS procedures performed in the ambulatory setting, the risk is more favorable. For example, a 65-year-old man has presented for extraction of multiple (5 to 6) carious, nonrestorable teeth with periodontal infection and moderately well-controlled hypertension and diabetes, controlled with oral medications. The procedure is time sensitive with no alternative options. Also, a delay of 2 to 6Â weeks could make the outcome moderately worse but the difficulty of the operation would not change. Using the MeNTS scoring system, if the length of a procedure is short and can be performed in an ambulatory setting, the score would sum to 31, denoting a favorable risk to personnel and resource usage. Similarly, procedures such as the placement of implants and dentoalveolar surgery, which are ambulatory procedures, pose a greater risk to HCP but have lower resource usage, possibly implying an overall favorable risk. Whether we modify and use the MeNTS scoring method or an alternative, such scores must be validated for OMS procedures. In contrast, consider the options for a relatively healthy, young female patient who requires a Botox injection for intractable migraine headaches. The procedure has low to moderate risk, low resource usage, can directly improve the patient's quality of life, and, indirectly, decrease the use of other resources by possibly avoiding an emergency room visit.</p>
