<p id="p0235">That 80% of raw materials in the pharmaceutical industry originate from outside the United States can be problematic. This will be especially true if single-source active product ingredients or raw material manufacturers face disruption to acquisition because of

 <italic>3)</italic> contamination during drug production, storage, or transport. Furthermore, the distribution of drugs can be affected directly by barriers to the international transport of medications and inventory practices by healthcare facilities and supply chain entities. These factors will affect smaller OMS practices because such practices often have little to no inventory cushion to compensate for short-term shortages. In addition, their inventory procurement capabilities will be vastly different from those of large healthcare facilities, and they cannot maintain an excess inventory. Also, a large gray market exists that influences the availability of different medications on a regular basis. Thus, oral-maxillofacial surgeons should plan to monitor their current supplies and orders and to estimate the costs and need for anesthetic drugs, such as propofol, fentanyl, and oxygen.
