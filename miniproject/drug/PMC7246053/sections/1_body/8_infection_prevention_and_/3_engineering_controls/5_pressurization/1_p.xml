<p id="p0120">Pressurization of side-by-side rooms with a pressure differential—positive pressure (ideally, &gt; +2.5 to 8 Pa) in 1 room and negative pressure (&gt; −2.5 Pa) in the next room (
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> ) can be used to treat patients with airborne infections. Typically, these rooms will require more than 12 cycles of air changes/hour and efficient filtrations systems that will allow air to flow away from the clean area or positive pressure room toward the negative pressure or depressurized area or less clean room (eg, room with the patient with an airborne disease). The times required for airborne contaminant removal from a room with 12 cycles of air changes/hour with 99% and 99.9% efficiency are 23 and 35 minutes, respectively.

 </xref> We should consider accommodating for additional time if using negative pressure rooms for AGPs in the outpatient setting.
