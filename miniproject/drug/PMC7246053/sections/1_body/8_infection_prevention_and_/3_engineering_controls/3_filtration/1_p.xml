<p id="p0110">Portable fan devices with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration can increase the effective air changes per hour of clean air into the patient's room, reducing the risk to individuals entering the room without respiratory protection. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) developed guidance for using portable HEPA filtration systems to create expedient patient isolation rooms in hospitals. It might be possible to use the expedient patient isolation room approach developed by NIOSH in outpatient clinic settings, if properly engineered. It involves establishing a high-ventilation-rate, negative-pressure, inner isolation zone that sits within a “clean,” larger ventilated zone. Placement of the HEPA filter in the correct position will allow the aerosolized inner zone air to be drawn toward the vent.</p>
