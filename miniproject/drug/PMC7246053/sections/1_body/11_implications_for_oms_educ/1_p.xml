<p id="p0240">The COVID-19 pandemic has paused almost all our traditional methods of education and training in our profession. This brings us to the question of whether the current training programs will meet the needs of the next generation of oral and maxillofacial surgeons and whether we will be able to relate the new knowledge base to undergraduate and postgraduate OMS education and training. Can we relate a national curriculum to the knowledge base for the board certification and recertification process? This might be the best time to create the national OMS curriculum for undergraduate and graduate training.</p>
