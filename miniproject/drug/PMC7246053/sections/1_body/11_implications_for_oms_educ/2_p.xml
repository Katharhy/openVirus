<p id="p0245">Perhaps some of the most disruptive changes that have resulted from this pandemic have been in the area of resident and student education. Although massive open online courses have been in existence for more than a decade, they have not been used as much nor have they been evaluated for didactic surgical training. Online education and collaborations through data sharing platforms have been an integral part of fields such as engineering and business (eg, Github, Kaggle). These have led to numerous innovations and connected and benefited students across the globe. Equivalent platforms and methods of learning and teaching have been less common in medicine by the sheer nature of how we must practice medicine. However, as we move into an era of cloud-sharing platforms, virtual simulation, augmented reality and intelligence, chatbots, and robotic surgery, it might be feasible to collaborate and share knowledge and interact with others in the field without barriers.

 </xref> National and international online collaborative teaching courses have been having a tremendous effect on our trainees and transforming how they learn. These methods of audio- and video-assisted teaching and learning will need proper evaluation, with milestones for further validation, before incorporating them into the mainstream. Several undergraduate faculty across the United States have developed problem-based learning tools and simulation models for clinical scenarios in oral surgery (eg, objective structured clinical evaluation) to determine the clinical competency of our dental students at all levels. During the next few months as patient care resumes, we might have to rely more frequently on small group clinical teaching sessions (groups of 4 to 5 students) and problem-based learning and simulation-based teaching models, rather than on direct patient care.
