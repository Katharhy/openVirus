It is reported that non-communicable disorders kill 41 million people each year equivalent to 71% of all deaths globally. Hence, there is a shift of concern about healthcare systems from communicable diseases to non-communicable disorders. However, on the other hand, with changing of environment and global setup, increasing population, poverty, malnutrition, unauthorized use of antibiotics or prolonged use of immune suppressant drugs, or increased prevalence of drug resistance microbes, there is emergence of new viral infections or re-emergence of viral diseases, which indicates that the threat of tackling emerging infections also prevails. Emerging infections can be defined as infections that have newly appeared in a population or have existed previously but are rapidly increasing in incidence or a geographic range. Recently an outbreak of corona virus infection has shocked medical fartenity.
