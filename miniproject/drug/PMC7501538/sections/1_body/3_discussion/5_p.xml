<p>Our study included only individuals receiving ART and did not exclude those who had already achieved viral suppression; therefore, a high proportion of our study population already had viral suppression at baseline. We anticipate that including people who are not receiving ART and excluding those who had achieved viral suppression would increase the effect of the interventions on viral suppression. In settings where viral suppression is already high, it is important to reach the final nonâ€“virally suppressed 10% to 15% of patients, who are often the most challenging to engage in HIV care.</p>
