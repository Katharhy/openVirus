<p>At 12 months, viral suppression was significantly higher in the brief intervention group compared with the SOC group; however, the percentage of virally suppressed participants was also higher in the brief intervention group than the SOC group at baseline. After standardizing both baseline levels of viral suppression and dropout rates over time, the brief intervention group still had a significantly higher level of viral suppression compared with the SOC group. This suggests that the brief intervention reduced alcohol use, which in turn improved ART adherence, leading to greater viral suppression compared with SOC.</p>
