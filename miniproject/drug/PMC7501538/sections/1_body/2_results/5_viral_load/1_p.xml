<p>The percentage of participants achieving viral suppression (ie, &lt;20 copies/mL) was similar at 3 and 6 months, but at 12 months, mean (SE) viral suppression was more common in the combined intervention group (83% [3%]) and the brief intervention group (92% [2%]) than in the SOC group (77% [4%]) (
 <xref rid="zoi200622t3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Given that the mean (SE) percentage of virally suppressed participants at baseline was 88.4% (2.6%) in the brief intervention group vs 80.1% (3.3%) in the SOC group, we standardized all arms to the mean baseline level of 84% virally suppressed (

After standardizing covariates, at 12 months the brief intervention group still had the highest mean (SE) percentage of participants with viral suppression (89.2% [3.1%]) followed by the combined intervention group (83.1% [3.1%]) and SOC (78.1% [3.7%]) (
