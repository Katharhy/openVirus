<p>In a private room at the ART clinic, participants completed study visits at enrollment and at 3, 6, and 12 months after enrollment. At the end of each visit, participants were given 100 000 Vietnamese dong (approximately US $4.30) to compensate them for their lost work time; they were also reimbursed for their expenses for travel to and from the study site. Behavioral measures, including ART adherence, were based on self-report. Depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire–9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder–7 scores, respectively, and alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse was defined using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview version 5.0.0. After the questionnaires were completed, interviewers administered the timeline follow-back interview.

 </sup> Participants provided blood samples at every visit except screening for the following tests: CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell count, HIV viral load (HIV-1 RNA test, COBAS AmpliPrep and COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test, Roche Molecular Systems), and hepatitis B surface antigen rapid test (Alere Determine hepatitis B surface antigen reagent). Dried blood spots were collected and shipped to US Drug Testing Laboratories for phosphatidylethanol testing to detect any alcohol use during the 3 weeks before the study visit. Phosphatidylethanol is a direct metabolite of alcohol consumption that serves as a biomarker for alcohol consumption during the preceding 3 weeks.

 </sup> Phosphatidylethanol levels of less than 10 ng/mL have demonstrated a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88.5% with an area under the curve operating characteristic curve of 0.92 for detection of any recent drinking (past 21 days).
