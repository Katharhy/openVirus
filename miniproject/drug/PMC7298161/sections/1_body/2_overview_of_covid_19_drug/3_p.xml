<p id="Par11">With so many clinical trials registered in such a short period of time, we can see that China has responded to the epidemic in a timely manner and hopes to find SARS-CoV-2-specific medicines to end the epidemic as soon as possible. This urgent need propelled Chinaâ€™s drug research ability to its full power, and this motivation involved many academic institutions, hospitals, and companies.

This phenomenon and its impact on our medical system, as well as possible improvement in our medical administration, need thorough review and discussion at an appropriate time in the future.</p>
