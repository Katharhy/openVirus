<p id="Par10">Among those COVID-19 treatment-related clinical trials, a total of 155 registered COVID-19 treatment drug-related interventional studies were obtained from the ChiCTR database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org.cn" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.chictr.org.cn</ext-link>) with ethics committee approval and informed consent signed by 10 March. Statistic information of these registered trials are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The study phase of each trial was extracted, and nearly 25% of these clinical trials were registered as phase 4 studies, which were stated as “postmarketing drugs” or “phase IV clinical trials” by the ChiCTR definition. In phase four studies, many domestically approved Chinese patent drugs and chemical agents are being used to treat COVID-19 patients.
