<p id="Par31">Chinese patent medicine is herbal medicines in traditional Chinese medicine modernized into a ready-to-use form, such as tablets, oral solutions, or dry suspensions. Chinese patent medicine has played very important roles in the domestic battle against COVID-19 in China, and many clinical investigations have started to more precisely evaluate its effects on COVID-19 patient treatment. Chinese patent medicine, as well as many herbal medicines, has been very useful in improving symptoms such as coughing, weakness, and digestive system disorders, as well as alleviating anxiety. Reports announced that up to 90% of COVID-19 patients in China have been given Chinese patent medicine or TCM prescriptions.
