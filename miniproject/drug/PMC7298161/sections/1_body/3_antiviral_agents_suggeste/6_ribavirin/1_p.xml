<p id="Par18">Ribavirin is a purine nucleoside analog with a broad-spectrum antiviral effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. It is used mainly to treat respiratory syncytial virus infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and in combination with interferon for hepatitis C [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Ribavirin was widely used in 2003 to treat SARS-CoV infection, but when used alone, it seemed to have no effect and caused significant hemolysis in many patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. When ribavirin was combined with IFN-β, it had good antiviral activity in in vitro studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Some studies have shown that in patients with severe MERS-CoV infection, ribavirin combined with IFN-α-2a treatment can significantly improve patient 14-day survival [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Preliminary in vitro test results demonstrate that ribavirin can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in a human cell line. In the latest “Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia”, it is recommended to use ribavirin at a dose of 500 mg each time for adults and in combination with interferon or lopinavir/ritonavir, with 2–3 intravenous infusions daily. The course of treatment does not exceed 10 days [
