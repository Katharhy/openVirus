<p id="Par16">Type I interferons, including IFN-α and IFN-β, have broad-spectrum antiviral effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. IFN-α can directly inhibit virus replication or can achieve antiviral effects by activating innate or adaptive immunity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Many studies have proven that IFN-α has an antiviral effect on SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and other experts discovered that IFN-α can prevent MERS-CoV infection and effectively inhibit the virus in the early stages of infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Because it is also a coronavirus and highly homologous to SARS-CoV, IFN-α is recommended for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to the latest new “Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia”, IFN-α at a dose of ~5 million U or equivalent dose each time for adults is added to 2 mL of sterile water, and it is aerosolized and inhaled twice a day [
