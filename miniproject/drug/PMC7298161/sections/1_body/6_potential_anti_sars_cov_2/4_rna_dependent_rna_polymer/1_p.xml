<p id="Par35">As an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2-encoded RdRp plays a key role in the virusâ€™s RNA replication. RdRp inhibitors can be used as broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against RNA viruses. The RdRp protein structure has a large and deep groove structural region as the active center of RNA synthesis. The sequence similarity of the RdRp proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV is as high as 96%, and structural differences exist outside the active center [
