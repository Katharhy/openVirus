 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. At present, the protein structure of the S protein and ACE2 interaction has been solved, providing reliable guidance for vaccine and drug design [

Aiming at the mutual use of the S protein and ACE2 protein necessary for SARS-CoV-2 to enter host cells, multiple domestic research teams have discovered a variety of potential ACE2-binding agents through molecular docking virtual screening methods and artificial intelligence drug screening methods.
