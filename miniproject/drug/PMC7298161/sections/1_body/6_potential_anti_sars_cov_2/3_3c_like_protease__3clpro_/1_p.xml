<p id="Par34">The 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have an amino acid sequence similarity of up to 96%, and the structure of 3CLpro in SARS-CoV-2 has been solved [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. 3CLpro is a key protein of the virus, and the virus needs to use it to replicate RNA. Therefore, finding SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors can provide a more effective way to fight COVID-19.
