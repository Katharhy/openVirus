<p id="Par33">PLpro is a multifunctional protein with protease and phosphatase activity that is involved in viral replication and IFN antagonism [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. PLpro of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have only 83% sequence similarity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. However, the high-level structure of the protein that forms the active site is not altered in the two PLpro proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. There are already domestic teams working to find potential inhibitors of PLpro through virtual screening, which needs to be confirmed by experiments.
