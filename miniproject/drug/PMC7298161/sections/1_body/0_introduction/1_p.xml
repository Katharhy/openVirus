After the alert of this new pathogen, China quickly took measures to completely block off Hubei Province and implemented a quarantine policy nationwide to keep the outbreak under control. This efficient process was also recognized by the international WHO. This highly contagious new coronavirus was initially named 2019-nCoV. On Feb 11, 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses introduced the name “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2) to refer to the virus, and the WHO named the related pneumonia coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19).
