<p id="Par7">ORF1a/b occupy two-thirds of the viral genome, and they encode two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These two polyproteins can be hydrolyzed into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), including papain-like protease (PLpro), 3C-like protease (3CLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, and exonuclease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The enveloped glycoprotein spike (S) forms a layer of glycoproteins protruding from the envelope and is closely related to virus infection of cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. There are multiple sequence segments in the receptor-binding domain of the S protein, which have high homology with SARS-CoV sequences, and some studies have confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 can bind to the ACE2 receptor on the cell surface, similar to SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Two additional transmembrane glycoproteins, envelope (E) and membrane (M), are incorporated into the virion. Nucleoprotein encapsulates the viral (+) RNA genome in the form of a spiral in the envelope to prevent degradation. Accessory proteins do not participate in viral replication, but they interfere with the host innate immune response or have other unknown functions [
