<p id="Par6">The single-stranded RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 is 29891 nucleotides in size. The genes of SARS-CoV-2 from 5′ to 3′ are a 5′ untranslated region, including 5′ leader sequences; and open reading frame (ORF) 1a/b; structural proteins, including the envelope glycoprotein spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N); accessory proteins, such as ORF3, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, and 9b; and a 3′ untranslated region [
