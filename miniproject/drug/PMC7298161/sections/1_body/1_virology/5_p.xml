<p id="Par8">The SARS-CoV-2 possible life cycle begins when the spike glycoprotein on the envelope binds to the ACE2 receptor, and membrane fusion occurs either directly with the host cell membrane or with the endosome membrane. After membrane fusion, the viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm, and the uncoated RNA is translated into two polyproteins. The polyproteins are cleaved by the protease encoded by ORF1a into the 16 nsps, which can form an RNA replicase-transcriptase complex [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This complex drives the production of negative-sense RNA, which is used as a template for the full-length (+) RNA genome. During transcription, subgenomic RNAs are produced by discontinuous transcription and then transcribed into subgenomic (+) mRNA, which is translated into different structural proteins. The newly formed structural protein and viral genomic RNA combine to form a nucleocapsid. The viral particles bud into the ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), and then the primary virion is released from the infected cells [
