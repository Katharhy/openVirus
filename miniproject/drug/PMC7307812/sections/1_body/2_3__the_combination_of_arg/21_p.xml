<p>To simplify the arginine-ascorbate actions in the immune response by the way of dichotomy, arginine is an essential factor for the native immune response via NO production and activation of IFN-α/β (type I) while ascorbate is critical for the efficacy of the adaptive immunity via T cell proliferation and function via IFN-γ (type II); their synergy ensures both decreased viral replication and clearance.</p>
