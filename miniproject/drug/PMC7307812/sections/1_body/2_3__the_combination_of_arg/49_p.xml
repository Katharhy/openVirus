<p>A two-pronged strategy of risk evaluation can be employed based on age and exposure risk: in younger individuals (â‰¤55 years old) a specific panel for genetic risk factors which predispose to fatal CoV infections (rs78142040, rs9605146, rs3848719; NAMPT - 1001G allele, POPDC3, PDE4B, ABCC1, TNFRS11 and DD genotype of ACE) may be more useful, especially in individuals with potential increased exposure to the virus (eg., healthcare professionals). However, in patients most at-risk - elderly and with chronic co-morbidities, evaluation with different testing panels can reasonably assess their risk for severe COVID19, starting with the evaluation of oxidative/peroxisomal status (catalase, malondialdehyde), inflammation - CRP, fibrinogen - and metabolism - bicarbonate, HgbA1c, lipid profile, and immune balance - PGD2 and serum protein electrophoresis - for asymptomatic patients, and adding for symptomatic patients the CD3
