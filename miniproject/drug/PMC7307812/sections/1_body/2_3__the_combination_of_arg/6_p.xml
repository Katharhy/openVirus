<p>NO production from arginine by the inducible NO synthase (iNOS) was shown to be essential for native immune responses in many infections and arginine availability is a critical factor for host resistance to infection (

NO can pass through membranes, unlike complement and antibody, and is especially useful in syncytia, it can act on multiple targets increasing efficacy and preventing developing of resistance, and do not require recognition of infected cell by the immune system, which can be limited by pathogens or tissue-specific differences (
