<p>Arginine also directly stimulates transcription/translation of the iNOS gene leading to 
 <italic>de novo</italic> NOS protein synthesis, and this sheds light on the 'arginine paradox' where intracellular NO production is directly related to the extracellular arginine concentration even though endogenous synthesis of arginine provides approximately half of the arginine needed by cells (

Reciprocally, the pH buffering action of arginine is increasing the cellular uptake of ascorbate by improving the activity of the cellular transporter of ascorbate, SVCT2, which has a pH optimum of 7.5 and is reduced to ~50% when pH is 5.5 (
