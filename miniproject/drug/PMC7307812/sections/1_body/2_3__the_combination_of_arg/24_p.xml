<p>Arginine corrects the pH and its increased extracellular concentration helps cause a shift towards M2, and is the substrate for arginase, which is stimulated by uric acid. Arginases are activated by Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> in a pH-dependent fashion, Arg1/2 have an alkaline optimum activity of 9.0-9.5. NOHA, the arginase inhibitor, can also be oxidized to NO by many heme proteins, including hemoglobin, peroxidase, cytochromes P-450, and catalase, which is inhibited by ascorbate, which is another mechanism by which ascorbate modulates redox and metabolic reactions and NO production (
