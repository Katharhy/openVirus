<p>There is ample data suggesting that the severity of the COVID-19 is less related to the viral replication itself than to the host responses to the infection: delayed IFN production, increased neutrophils and cytokines in the lung creating a pro-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic milieu, combined with lymphopenia, acidosis, coagulation and vascular endothelium modifications and defective tissue repair with fibrosis in the lungs. Most treatments are focused on blocking viral replication, however, in fatal cases irreversible changes and deterioration occur even though viral replication is essentially blocked. Therapeutic interventions which combine agents for pleiotropic actions rather than single agents acting on well-defined pathways are more likely to improve patient outcomes.</p>
