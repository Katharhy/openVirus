<p>Synergistic action of arginine-ascorbate for inhibiting viral replication and achieving viral clearance is shown by the combined effect of IFN-α (induced by NO) and IFN-γ (induced by ascorbate) in inducing the antiviral response via ISGs, which is much enhanced when compared to either one alone (
