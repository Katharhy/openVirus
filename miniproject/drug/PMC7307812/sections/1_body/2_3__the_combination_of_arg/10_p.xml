<p>Ascorbate stimulates the synthesis and actions of antiviral NO indirectly in multiple ways, one via IFN-γ stimulation (

 <xref rid="b135-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>) are heme-containing proteins which require ascorbate or another intracellular reducing agent for their activation. In this context, the observation that three accessory proteins of SARS-CoV2 - orf1ab, ORF3a, ORF10 - bind to heme followed by Fe inactivation and sequestration (
 <xref rid="b37-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) deserve to be further investigated for specific anti-NOS and other IDO activities.
