<p>To get a good perspective on the dose needed of arginine-ascorbate, we note that the daily plasma flux of arginine is about 22-25 g with 5-6 g from diet (
 <xref rid="b153-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>), the majority of arginine is synthesized in the liver and kidney (15-20 g daily) from citrulline in the urea cycle, ~10% is used for creatine synthesis and 1% for NO generation (

Pharmacological doses of up to 30 g/day for 2 weeks administered either intravenously or enteral in multiple clinical studies appear to be well tolerated by healthy individuals and cancer patients without major side effects; significant elevation in IGF1 was the only modified biomarker (
