<p>A very thorough review of arginine use in critical care has analyzed both the mechanistic concern of possible NO-induced vasodilatation, alongside other actions that arginine has in the critically ill patient. This study has importantly discussed the multiple clinical trials and reports of arginine use in septic patients (

During critical illness there is a severe arginine deficit following a 2/3 reduction in arginine synthesis and increased degradation due to a 4-fold increase of arginase activity, so that arginine becomes an essential need for supplementation (

 <sup>+</sup> cells which are also functionally deficient, as they lack the Î¶-chain of its receptor.
