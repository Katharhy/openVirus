<p>Unopposed or excessive viral replication is an important pathogenic mechanism through which the virus overwhelms the natural defenses of the body; besides a weakened immune response associated with chronic pathologies (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, autoimmune and neoplasic), the virus has an advantage in tired or stressed individuals (with high cortisol and lactate/LDH levels) and by repeated exposure which increases the dose of the virus (doctors, nurses, medical personnel). Protective measures are very important for limiting exposure to the pathogen in vulnerable populations and also testing and treating early, as soon as possible after respiratory symptoms.</p>
