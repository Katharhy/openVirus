<p>A comprehensive review of the actions of ascorbate including those on the immune system (
 <xref rid="b131-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>) concludes that enhancement of B- and T-cell differentiation and proliferation is likely due to its effects on gene regulation; an epigenetic effect (DNA demethylation) of ascorbate on the CD8 receptor gene was also inferred in a series of lab experiments which concluded that ascorbate is necessary and sufficient for the CD8a gene transcriptional activation (
