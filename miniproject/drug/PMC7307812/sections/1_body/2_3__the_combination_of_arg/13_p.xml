<p>Arginine is known to improve lymphocyte-based immunity (
 <xref rid="b136-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>). Arginine depletion due to upregulation of Arg1 in myeloid-derived suppressor cells induces T-cell anergy, decreased proliferation of T cells, low expression of CD3 Î¶-chain T-cell receptor, and impairments of production of T cell cytokines and of upregulation of cyclin D3 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk4) (

 <sup>+</sup> and the proliferation of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes (

Arginine is also critical for B-lymphocyte differentiation; in transgenic mice over-expressing arginase in intestinal cells there was an impaired transition of pro- to pre-B cells in the bone marrow with marked decrease in B cell cellularity, serum IgM levels and number and size of Peyer's patches; this was reversed by arginine supplementation (
