<p>In a first step for tissue repair arginine is metabolized to ornithine by arginases (Arg1/2), resulting in both proline (collagen synthesis) and biologically active amines (putresceine, spermidine, spermine) essential for cell repair and proliferation; the balance iNOS/Arg1 determines the pro- or anti-inflammatory environment and intra-cellular use of arginine. Depending on this, macrophages are polarised in M1 (proinflamamtory, cytotoxic, NO) and M2 (anti-inflammatory, proliferative, Arg1), and excessive activity of either can create pathologies; surprisingly the suppression of M2 activity in mice resulted in reduced lung fibrotic lesions in SARS-CoV infection, suggesting the virus produces a shift to M2 activities, despite the high levels of inflammatory cytokines (
