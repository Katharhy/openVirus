<p>In China, the first comprehensive analysis published on the COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="b1-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) included 44,672 cases and 1,023 deaths, with an overall case-fatality rate (CFR) of 2.3%. There were 0 deaths in patients 9 years old or younger, and the CFR increased with advancing age (70-79 years: 8.0%, 80 years and older: 14.8%) and also with comorbid conditions: 5.6% for cancer, 6.0% for hypertension, 7.3% for diabetes, 10.5% for cardiovascular disease; for intensive care patients CFR was 49.0%. Similar data were published by other authors on the China epidemic (
 <xref rid="b2-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="b3-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>); another analysis (
 <xref rid="b4-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) identified 3 biological markers associated with the severity of the infection and progression to ARDS and death: i) neutrophilia; ii) increased lactate dehydrogenase LDH and iii) coagulation dysfunction (D-dimer). There were 2 unexpected findings: i) patients with fever ≥39°C were more likely to develop ARDS but also less likely to die; and ii) administering methylprednisolone to patients with ARDS was associated with lower risk of death.
