<p>Another important aspect is that multiple cellular pathways besides inflammation are simultaneously affected in ARDS, including coagulation, endothelial and epithelial injury pathways (apoptosis) and healing (fibrosis) in lungs. A unique molecular signature of lethal infection with another respiratory virus (PR8, an influenza virus) showed over-activation of pro-inflammatory pathways, NF-ÎºB, IL-6, TNF and neutrophil chemotaxis (
 <xref rid="b22-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), associated decreased activation of genes involved in lung homeostasis and repair. Neutrophils with high pro-inflammatory activity were numerous in lung infiltrates, their own chemokines further promoted neutrophil influx in a positive feedback loop; a dose-dependent survival was seen with partial neutrophil depletion in this type of lethal infection. Comparing viral replication in non-lethal vs. lethal infection they had similar viral replication rates, but the lethal infection had increased viral titers in the lungs, and also increased early pro-inflammatory neutrophil activation, resulting in pathologic neutrophil infiltration and fatal lung damage (

Similar observations increased neutrophil- and neutrophil-attracting chemokines, delay in induction of IFN in airway epitlelial cells resulting in vascular leakage and lung damage were made in SARS and MERS suggesting a common pathogenical mechanism (

Indeed, the significant role of neutrophils in the promotion of ARDS-related alveolal damage was supported by a report in sepsis ARDS patients, where high neutrophil counts in bronchiolar lavage material harvested late in ARDS progression was associated with reduced patient survival (

Hence, it has been proposed that the sulphone dapsone may show efficacy in COVID-19 related ARDS, as the drug is highly and rapidly effective at inhibiting cytokine-mediated neutrophil chemotaxis and respiratory burst in a variety of therapeutic contexts (

 <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> pneumonia suggests it will penetrate the lung tissue sufficiently to attenuate neutrophil activity. The haemotoxicity of the drug can be ameliorated with concomitant cimetidine administration (
