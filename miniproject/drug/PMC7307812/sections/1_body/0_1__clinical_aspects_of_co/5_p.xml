<p>It is safe to say that COVID-19 patients who develop ARDS (with high levels of interleukins, low blood pressure) belong to the hyperinflammatory subphenotype and may benefit from the therapeutic insight associated with this group of patients (higher PEEP, liberal fluid strategy, and simvastatin). In critically-ill COVID-19 patients, increased LDH levels are likely associated with acidosis and if low blood pressure is also present, before vasopressors they are likely to benefit from administration of sodium bicarbonate (increments of 100 ml of 8.4% solution).</p>
