<p>For ARDS, as the most severe form of COVID-19 infection, there is ample data from proteomics showing highly activated pathways of inflammation, increased levels of eosinophil- and neutrophil-derived proteins, epithelial and endothelial injury, matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7), α- and β-hemoglobin, apolipoprotein A1, osteopontin and chemokines (

However, the complexity of living biological systems with redundant pathways and dual-role modulators means that they do not always conform to mechanistic determinism, and this is especially true in patients with chronic diseases or co-morbid conditions, where modifications of physiological pathways translate into unknown but important factors with unexpected consequences. One such example is a clinical trial for sepsis which tested a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) with negative results, but at the same time benefited patients with higher baseline levels of IL-1Ra (
