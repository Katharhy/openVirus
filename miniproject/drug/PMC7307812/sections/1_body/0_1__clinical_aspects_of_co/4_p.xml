<p>Treatment-wise, the same group showed that in the ARDS hyperinflammatory subphenotype better outcomes were obtained with administration of high PEEP, liberal fluid strategy (vs. conservative fluid administration) and simvastatin, while rosuvastatin administration was of no benefit (

The observed difference between statins in ARDS may be explained by their solubility: while simvastatin is lipid-soluble, rosuvastatin is water-soluble, with important consequences on cell membrane interaction.
