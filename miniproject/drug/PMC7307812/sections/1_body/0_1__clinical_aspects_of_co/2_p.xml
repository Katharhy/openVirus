 <xref rid="b9-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) showed that ~1/3 of admitted patients had leucopenia and most of these (80%) had lymphopenia; C-reactive protein (CRP) was often increased and very high CRPs were associated with a less favorable outcome for the patient. Approximately 40% of admitted patients had increased LDH, D-dimer and/or thrombocytopenia, and an LDH value of &gt;400 IU/ml was associated with more severe disease. Troponin was increased in a small number of patients, with unclear significance.
