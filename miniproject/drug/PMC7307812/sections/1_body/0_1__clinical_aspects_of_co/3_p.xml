<p>In the USA, a recent publication showed that a majority (71%) of COVID-19 patients with ARDS and in intensive care, also had hypotension (

 <xref rid="b11-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). There is already an extensive clinical experience with ARDS in the USA, where &gt;180,000 patients annually are admitted with this pathology and ARDS mortality has improved from 40 to 50% 10 years ago to 20-25% in recent clinical trials. A group of USA intensive care specialists led by Dr Calfee has analyzed &gt;30 biomarkers and clinical variables from two large clinical trials on ARDS (

With data from more clinical trials (
 <xref rid="b13-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), two ARDS populations were identified, the hypoinflammatory and hyperinflammatory subphenotypes, with distinctive and opposite characteristics. The former has low levels of IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFr1), lower mortality as well as higher number of ventilator-free days, high bicarbonate and protein C; the latter has high levels of IL-6, IL-8, TNFr1, low levels of bicarbonate and protein C, low number of ventilator-free days and higher mortality.
