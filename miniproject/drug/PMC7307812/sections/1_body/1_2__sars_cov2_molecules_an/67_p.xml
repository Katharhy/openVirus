 <italic>ACE2, RAS and ACE inhibitors</italic>. First genetic markers analyzed as risk factors for ARDS pathogenesis were found in 2002 to be correlated with ACE polymorphism, with the D allele increasing its actions (

The frequency of the DD genotype was significantly increased in the ARDS group, suggesting a role for the renin-angiotensin system in ARDS development. A 2004 study in a small Vietnamese population with SARS found an increase frequency of D allele in patients with hypoxia (n=22) versus no hypoxia (n=22) (

However, a larger study (n=168) evaluated the influence of ACE I/D polymorphism on SARS-CoV infection susceptibility and development of ARDS in a Chinese population and found no association between the frequency of the D allele and presence of infection or severe disease; the only factors associated with requirement of intensive care was age and male sex (
