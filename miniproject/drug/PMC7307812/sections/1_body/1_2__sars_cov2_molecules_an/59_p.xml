 <italic>pH modifies the activity of antiviral medications</italic>. Many proteins undergo conformational changes of their tertiary and quaternary structure induced by ionic changes (Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>, H
 <sup>+</sup>, Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> and Mn
 <sup>+</sup>) and pH modifications. Such modifications are documented for the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV2 during its binding to protease inhibitors at pH 4.0-8.0, and it was shown that they were pH-dependent, with different binding energy (stability of protein complex) and specific bonding type/atom interaction (
