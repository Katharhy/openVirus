<p>Additionally, the infectivity of CoV and other enveloped viruses is known to be impaired by an increase in endosomal pH in a dose-dependent manner; mild bases such as lipophilic amines or amphiphilic drugs with a tertiary amino group can accumulate in acidic organelles via protonation, where they neutralize internal pH, alter the properties of the adjacent membranes and inhibit multiple processes occurring in the respective compartment (
