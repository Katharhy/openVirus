<p>The spike (S) protein of the new virus contains 1,273 amino acids; compared to SARS-CoV it has 27 amino acid substitutions, 8 in the heptad repeat domain, 6 in the RBD, and 4 in the S1 subunit, modifying two peptides which are antigens for SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="b40-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The binding energy between the viral S protein and host ACE2 receptor is higher in the new virus versus SARS-CoV (-50.6 kcal/mol vs. -78.6 kcal/mol) suggesting a more stable bond (
 <xref rid="b41-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>); at the same time the affinity of the S protein of the new virus for the ACE2 receptor is in the 15 nM range, which is about 10-20 times higher than SARS-CoV, an important factor for the differential infectivity (
