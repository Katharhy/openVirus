<p>Oligonucleotide arrays were used to study the ISGs regulated by IFNs; all IFNs induced complement component C1r, IFN-induced nuclear phosphoprotein, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-related protein (VRP or VEGF-C), and phospholipid scramblase, an apoptosis promoter; its levels increased 8-fold by IFN-α, 10-fold by IFN-β, and 3-fold by IFN-γ (
