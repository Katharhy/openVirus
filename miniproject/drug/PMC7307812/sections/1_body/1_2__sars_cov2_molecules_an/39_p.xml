<p>The immune response of CoV patients is imbalanced, with over-stimulation of the monocyte-macrophage line and decreased T cell activation; while early administration of IFN-1 has protective effects, in later stages administration of IFN, with the possible exception of IFN-Î³, is associated with increased neutrophil infiltration in the lungs. This is due to the selective activation of ISGs in macrophages, but not in B or T cells, since signaling in these cells requires the myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), a key molecule used in all TLR signaling pathways of adaptive immunity except for TLR3 which is present in all endosomes (
