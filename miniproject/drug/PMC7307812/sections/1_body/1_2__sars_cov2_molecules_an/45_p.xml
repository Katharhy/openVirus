<p>Both type I and type II IFNs increase expression of the CH25H gene which codes for the enzyme Cholesterol-25-hydroxylase, which converts cholesterol into 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) (
 <xref rid="b50-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), an oxysterol with antiviral effects via alteration of membrane properties, inhibition of sterol biosynthesis and prenylation (priming) of virus and host proteins. However, 25HC production by macrophages also has a central role in regulating the immune system, and at nM concentrations it suppresses the IL-2 mediated proliferation of B cells and inhibits IgA production (
