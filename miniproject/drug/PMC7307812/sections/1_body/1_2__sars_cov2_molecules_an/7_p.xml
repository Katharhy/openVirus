<p>The S protein is a class I viral fusion protein like the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA); SARS-CoV2 also has an S1/S2 cleavage site which is recognizable by furin, a ubiquitous cell protease. When similar modifications (insertion of a polybasic furin cleavage site) occur in the hemagglutinin proteins of avian and human influenza viruses, their virulence is greatly increased (
