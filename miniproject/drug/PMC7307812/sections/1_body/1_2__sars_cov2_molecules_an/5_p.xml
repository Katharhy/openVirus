<p>Importantly, orf8 and orf10 are present in SARS-CoV2 but not in SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="b36-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The orf8 protein from SARS-CoV2 has no known functional domain or motif and is different from the orf8 or orf8b of SARS-CoV, which does not have orf10 at all. However, ORF10 binds to heme and ORF8 to porphyrins (
 <xref rid="b37-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>); heme inactivation increases viral infectivity through inhibition of the host innate antiviral response (
 <xref rid="b38-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) which relies on heme-containing enzymes such as nitric oxide synthase (detailed below); also increases viral permeation of tissues via porphirin binding and tissue destruction (
