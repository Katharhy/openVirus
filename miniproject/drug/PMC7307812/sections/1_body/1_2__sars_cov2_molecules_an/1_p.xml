<p>SARS-CoV2 consists of two types of molecules: RNA and proteins; RNA encodes for 27 viral proteins, of which 16 are non-structural proteins (nsps), and 11 are accessory and structural proteins. There are 4 major structural proteins: nucleocapsid protein (N), spike surface glycoprotein (S), matrix protein (M), and small envelope protein (E). The 
 <italic>N-protein</italic> binds to viral RNA, encloses it in a capsid and assists RNA synthesis and folding during viral replication; it also modifies host responses, cell cycle and gene translation, and after RNA replication it guides the viral membrane proteins for viral assembly. The 
 <italic>S-protein</italic> is essential for attachment and fusion of the virus to host cells (
