<p>Low pH is affecting essential aspects of the native immune response - neutrophil activation, chemotaxis, production of ROS, NO and phagocytosis, apoptosis, cytokine production, activation of transcription factors by binding to DNA, and also decrease of lymphocyte function, lymphokine secretion and activation, while hypoxia is potentiating these actions (
