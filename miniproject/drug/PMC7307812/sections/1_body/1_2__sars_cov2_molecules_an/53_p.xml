<p>Peroxisomal MAVS stimulates ISGs via IRF1 and IRF3 in an IFN-independent manner and does not induce IFN production in macrophages, which is dependent on mitochondrial MAVS. Interestingly, cells lacking either peroxisomal or mitochondrial MAVS had an unusual biphasic behavior, restricting viral replication in the first 24 h, but not at 72 h, and showing that both organelles are necessary for viral clearance (

The functional status of peroxisomes can be correlated both with age and the severity of SARS-Cov2 infection, and is impaired by poor oxidative status, low cellular pH (acidosis) and/or hypoxia which is also seen in patients with chronic pathologies or genetic deficiencies.
