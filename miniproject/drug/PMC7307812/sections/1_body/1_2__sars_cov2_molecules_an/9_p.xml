<p>Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 need S protein priming through cleavage by a host cellular protease (trans-membrane protease serine 2 - TMPRSS2, TMPRSS11a, hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine, trypsin, elastase, cathepsin L) (

 <xref rid="b45-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), and the cell surface from respiratory epithelial cells has abundant TMPRSS2 and trypsin-like protease (

 <xref rid="b44-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), meaning that a cell fusion process used by SARS-CoV involves endosomal membranes and a treatment which blocks only the cell surface proteases or the endosomal protease will not prevent, but only depress viral cell entry; however, a combination of two substances, camostat and EST, a cathespsin inhibitor effectively blocked the viral entry into cells.
