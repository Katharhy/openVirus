<p>More studies are needed to inform decisions on the use of RAS inhibitors in CoV infected patients; we should note that ACE inhibitors increase bradykinin levels, responsible for the associated cough and angio-edema and also a potent vasodepressor (

The risk for bradykinin-mediated adverse reactions was found to be linked to the levels of aminopeptidase P, which catabolizes bradykinin and was significantly lower in hypertensive patients with a history of angio-oedema during ACE inhibitor treatment (
