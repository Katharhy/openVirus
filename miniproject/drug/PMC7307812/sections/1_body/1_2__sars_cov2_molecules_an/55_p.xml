<p>The modifications in the cellular redox state, ionic balance and pH which are simultaneous with the actions of specific molecules in a pathway are not often measured or considered during lab experiments, but in the context of dual or multiple regulators they may have important consequences, one such example being the effect of hemoglobin (Hb) on IFN production (

While exerting a direct inhibitory effect on MDA5 which inhibits IFN production, Hb also modifies a cell redox state, promotes the RIG-I pathway and stimulates IFN production; the increase in ROS by Hb is stimulated only by the microbial and not by the host protease.
