<p>Coronaviruses have the largest known RNA genomes and their RNA is transcribed via open reading frames (ORFs); this peculiarity increasing the efficacy of viral replication and mutagenesis, and making it more difficult to be eliminated by the immune system. The SARS-CoV2 genome has 14 ORFs of different lengths; first ORF has ~10,000 nucleotides (~2/3 of viral RNA) and encodes nsps 1-16, with the structural and accessory proteins being translated from the remainder 1/3 of RNA (
