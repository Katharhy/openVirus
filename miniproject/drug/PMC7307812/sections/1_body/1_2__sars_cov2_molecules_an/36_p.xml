<p>Another intranasal-administered peptide, EK1, which contains the heptad-repeat HR2 from the binding motif of the S protein has inhibited infection by many human coronaviruses (
 <xref rid="b46-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>); its administration in mice reduced lung viral titers by 1,000-fold 2014 (
 <xref rid="b76-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>) and its lipidation, EK1C4, resulted in much greater potency, inhibiting the cell-cell fusion mediated by S protein with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 4.3 nM; its protective effect manifested half an hour after and 6 hours before exposure to coronavirus (
