<p>Molecules involved in virus detection in the cytoplasm of host cells are: the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I), a RNA helicase with the respective cell receptors - RIG-I-like receptors (RLR); and the melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), both of which have the same downstream effector: the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). Besides RIG-1 and MDA5, other cellular viral RNA sensors are known: the protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR), oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), latent endoribonuclease (RnaseL), cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) (
