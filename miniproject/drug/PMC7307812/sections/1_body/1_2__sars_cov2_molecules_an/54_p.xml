 <italic>pH-dependent viral actions</italic>. At the surface of the respiratory epithelium low pH favors viral entry and replication by impairing the actions of the AMPs from the airway surface liquid (ASL), which have pH-sensitive antimicrobial functions, with the pH of ASL being actively regulated by bicarbonate transport (
 <xref rid="b49-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>); another pH-lowering viral activity is the formation of cell syncytiums. Lower intracellular pH favors the activity of the proteases needed for viral replication, decreases the mitochondrial membrane potential and inactivates MAVS, which is essential for IFN and NFÎºB activation and production of antiviral protein switches. In addition, low pH promotes oxidative phosphorylation to anaerobic glycolysis with increased mitochondrial ROS production via related cellular pathways (
