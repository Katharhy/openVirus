<p>The modifications induced by the SARS-Cov infection in host cells were also investigated via a library screen of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting the human kinome (
 <xref rid="b84-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). Besides the expected activation of pro-inflammatory pathways (production of NO and ROS in macrophages, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-17) there was also an increase in the metabolic pathways of complex lipids (inositol phosphate, nicotinate, nicotinamide), intermediates needed in SARS-CoV infection and probably linked to prenylation. The strongest proviral activation was seen in the β2 subunit of the coatomer protein complex (COPB2) followed by inositol hexaphosphate kinase 1 (IHPK1); abelson kinase 1 (ABI1); diacylglycerol kinase epsilon (DGKE); cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulator (CDK5R2); protein kinase C ι (PRKCi). Among antiviral molecules were found the diacylglycerol kinase δ (DGKD), the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR); cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) and most MAPKs with the exception of MAP3K11, which is weakly proviral; ABl1 inhibitors and molecules acting on lipidic and glucidic metabolism are thus important.
