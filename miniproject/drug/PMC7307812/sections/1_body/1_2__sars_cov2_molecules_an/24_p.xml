 <italic>Proposed therapeutic interventions</italic>. The current therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="b18-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) are derived from SARS treatments; the first drugs shown in 2005 to be effective 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> for SARS, both pre- and post-exposure, are chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; since they were extensively studied and shown to exert pleiotropic antiviral actions (

Chloroquine is a weakly basic substance and upon entering cells it is protonated and concentrated in acidic organelles: lysosomes, Golgi vesicles and endosomes; the subsequent increase in endosomal pH interferes with the terminal glycosilation of the ACE2 receptor. Besides inhibiting the S protein-induced viral fusion (
