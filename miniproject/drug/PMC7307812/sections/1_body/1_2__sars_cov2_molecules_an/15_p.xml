<p>After evading or overwhelming this first line of defense and entering host cells, the virus activates the cellular antiviral defenses effectuated by hundreds of proteins (cytokines, chemokines, host restriction factors) which block different steps in the viral replication and are activated by specific cell sensors/receptors. Interferons (IFNs) via IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) initiate innate and adaptive immune responses which alter host cell cycle, translation and apoptosis, virus entry, viral RNA availability, stability and translation, particle and budding (
