<p>Also, an association was found between four SNPs and ARDS patients: rs78142040 of ARSD - an arylsulfatase gene involved in sphingolipid metabolism and associated with 60-day mortality; rs9605146 in XKR3 gene affecting membrane transport and red cells, neuromuscular and central nervous systems, was associated with susceptibility to ARDS; rs3848719 of ZNF335, zinc finger protein regulating lymphoblast proliferation, was associated with increased ARDS severity (APACHE II score); nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) with the -1535T allele associated with decreased susceptibility to ARDS, and the -1001G variant with higher susceptibility to ARDS and mortality in a Caucasian population; other pathways showing differential activation in ARDS patients were T lymphocyte signalling, calcium-induced apoptosis of T lymphocytes, B-cell development, and autoimmune thyroid disease (
