<p>Functionally the S protein has a receptor-binding subunit (S1), an S2 fusion domain (S2), separated by a cleavage site (S1/S2) and another cleavage site (S2â€²) located within S2. The multiple cleavage sites are activated by a wide variety of proteases from the host cell: cathepsins, serine proteases from the trypsin-like transmembrane serine protease family (TTSP), and furin-like proprotein convertases.</p>
