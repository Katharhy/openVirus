<p>However, it is possible that the delayed IFN response followed by neutrophil over-activation is simply due to the lack of activation in the early stage of infection of the peroxisomal MAVS necessary for early IFN production (
 <xref rid="b52-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), and this observation gains more weight as peroxisome function declines significantly in tandem with cellular senescence, advancing age, and age-related co-morbidities (
 <xref rid="b88-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). Peroxisome senescence is associated with dramatic changes in their protein import capabilities, functional integrity, ability to process ROS, regulation of growth and division of other organelles, decreased ability to oxidize fatty acids, accumulation of free fatty acids and diacylglycerol, followed by reorganization of protein kinase C (PKC) signalling (
