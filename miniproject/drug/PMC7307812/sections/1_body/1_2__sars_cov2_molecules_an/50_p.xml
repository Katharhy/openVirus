<p>The data above confirm that in severe CoV infection the host immune system is mounting an imbalanced response to infection which powerfully favors neutrophils/macrophages and inhibits the adaptive cellular response; early events include hindered pDCs activities and over-activation of macrophages with induction of IFN-I expression and autocrine over-stimulation; this may be due to 25-hydroxycholesterol or IDO overactivation, Myd88 inactivation by the virus, hemoglobin degradation and/or simultaneous actions of other viral molecules (EndoU).</p>
