<p>Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), stimulated by IFN-Î³ and inhibited by TLR activation and allergens plays an important role in immune suppression (normally prevents hyper-inflammation and autoimmunity) by inhibiting T cell activation and polyclonal proliferation of T cells, mostly through degradation of tryptophan and kynurenines; its role in SARS-CoV2 infection was not explored but likely is important (
