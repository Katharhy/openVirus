<p>For blocking the ACE2 receptor, three FDA-approved drugs are proposed: TNP, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase, IP6K and Akt pathways, which can also shown to inhibit MERS infection; eptifibatide acetate, an inhibitor of platelet aggregation already tested in septic shock; and the Abelson (Abl) kinase inhibitor GNF5, known to inhibit replication of Dengue virus, which deserves further attention. It was shown that Abl2, but not Abl1 is necessary for replication of SARS/MERS CoV (
 <xref rid="b66-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>) as the virion and endosomal membranes fuse via a cathepsin L-dependent mechanism; the Abl2 kinase inhibitors GNF5/GNF2/imatinib inhibit the fusion of the viral and endosomal membrane, an early stage of viral infection. GNF5/GNF2/imatinib also inhibit the formation of cell syncitia before the hemifusion step, effectively blocking membrane fusion and viral entry (
