<p>During early CoV replication in non-lethal models, pDCs are the major IFN-I producers, and pDCs sense coronaviral RNA via TLR7 within endosomes (

The same author shows that the coronavirus endonuclease (EndoU) from nsp 15 has a key role in preventing early induction of innate responses, by removing the viral dsRNA that would otherwise trigger host cell dsRNA responses, including IFN, PKR and OAS/RNase L, and delaying the viral RNA cytoplasmic sensing mediated by MDA5.
