<p>ACE2 is the main host receptor used by SARS-CoV2, and together with its homologue ACE, also a non-specific protease, modulate the activity of RAS, with ACE2 inactivating angiotensin II (AngII). In animal models, administration of recombinant ACE2 protects mice from lung injury and ACE-deficient mice had much better outcome in acute lung injury (

Also in animal models with acute inflammation it was shown that the renin angiotensin system (RAS) regulates neutrophil influx and pre-treatment of mice with the RAS inhibitor enalapril and losartan decreased lung neutrophil infiltration, concomitant with bradykinin increase and angiotensin II decrease; agonists of bradykinin receptor also inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis induced by IL-8 and pulmonary recruitment of neutrophils (
