<p>SARS blocks antiviral defenses and the IFN production in multiple ways, at multiple sites, many involving RIG-I and MAVS (
 <xref rid="b50-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>): i) after transcription the coronaviral dsRNA is protected from detection by storage in double-membrane vesicles; ii) M protein of SARS virus localizes in membranes associated with the Golgi complex and binds to the host RIG-I, thus impeding activation of MAVS; iii) ORF3b and ORF6 move to the mitochondria and block the interaction between RIG-I and MAVS to block IFN induction; iv) the papain-like protease (PlPro) removes ubiquitin from RIG-I and down-regulates type-I IFN response; v) cytoskeleton perturbations in mitochondria, with modification of the mitochondrial membrane potential and impairment of MAVS activity; vi) blocking IFN-Î² production by de-ubiquitination (DUB) of RIG-1 and other viral sensors and effectors (
