<p>It was shown that an important role in modulating the inflammatory response is played by two proteins containing the Toll or interleukin (IL)-1 receptor (TIR): MyD88 and the TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon (TRIF) (
 <xref rid="b78-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). For controlling inflammation both MyD88 and TRIF proteins are required, since the release of the anti-inflammatory IL10, IL19, endothelial lipase, metalloproteinase inhibitor 1 (Timp1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (Serpin1) is prevented in the absence of either one, resulting in excessive pro-inflammatory modulation.
