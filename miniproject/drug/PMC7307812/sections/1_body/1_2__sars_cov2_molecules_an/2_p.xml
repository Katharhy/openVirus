<p>Sequencing the SARS-CoV2 genome in February 2020 (
 <xref rid="b32-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) showed that phylogenetically it belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, subgenus 
 <italic>Sarbecoviru</italic>s, and has closer genetic similarity to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV. The genome consists of a single, positive-stranded RNA with ~30 k (29,811) nucleotides; from these only 5 nucleotides were found to be different between SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV. Similar sequencing results (&gt;99.9% similarity) were obtained by different teams on different patient samples (

 <xref rid="b34-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>): GenBank sequences MN988668, NC_045512, MN938384.1, MN975262.1, MN985325.1 and MN994468.1.
