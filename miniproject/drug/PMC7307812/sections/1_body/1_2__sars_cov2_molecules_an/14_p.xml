<p>Airway epithelial cells are able to prevent viral infections through multiple mechanisms. The airway surface liquid (ASL) is secreted by the submucosal glands, goblet and club cells and mobilized by cilium cells, and contains the gel-forming mucins MUC5B and MUC5AC, glycosaminoglycan keratin sulfate, and antimicrobial peptides and proteins (AMPs). ASL forms a pericilliary layer with volume, fluidity, pH and microbiome maintained in an optimal range for toxin elimination and the actions of AMPs, and facilitating mobilization of the innate immune response by macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, innate lymphoid cells, and γ/δ T cells. Finally an adaptive, specific immune response is triggered in response to antigens involving T and B lymphocytes, chemokines, cytokines and antigen-neutralizing IgAs (
