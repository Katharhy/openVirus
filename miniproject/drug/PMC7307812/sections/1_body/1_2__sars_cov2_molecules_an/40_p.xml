<p>In animal models of lethal COV infection, the immunopathological events are mostly IFN-I-dependent and independent of viral replication; IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR) receptor ablation or neutrophil depletion avoided lethal infection but did not affect the viral load. TNF inhibition improved lymphopenia, which is not unexpected since IFN-I sensitizes T cells to apoptosis.</p>
