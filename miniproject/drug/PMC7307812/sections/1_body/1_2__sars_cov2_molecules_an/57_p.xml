<p>The pH-dependent fusion of various viruses endocytosed into host cells by non-coated vesicles (caveolas) or in association with clathrin is well-documented (
 <xref rid="b96-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>); additionally CoV and influenza viruses can fuse with host cell membranes via anchoring cell receptors and internalization in the lipid bi-layer, a process blocked by constituent hydrolaze CH25H, methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin, a cholesterol-sequestering drug, simvastatin and possibly other lipophilic statins.
