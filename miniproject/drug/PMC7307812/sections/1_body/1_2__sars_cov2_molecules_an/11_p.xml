<p>The S protein of both coronaviruses has another peculiarity: its dependency on Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> (
 <xref rid="b47-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Significant cell membrane ordering prior to membrane fusion is needed, and it requires the presence of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> ions because of the negatively charged residues in the fusion platform. Consequently the entry of SARS-CoV2 is highly dependent on the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration in its cell environment, and calcium chelators inhibit viral fusion and cell entry. Thus it was observed that SARS-CoV entry is blocked by 
 <italic>amiodarone</italic>, which blocks calcium channels in the endosome and lysosome (
