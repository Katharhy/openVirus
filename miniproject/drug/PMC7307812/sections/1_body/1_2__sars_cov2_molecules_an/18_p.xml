<p>Following activation, IFN-α/β-type I IFNs are produced in and activate most cells, while type III IFN (IFN-λ) mostly mucosal cells; they activate very similar IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). IFN signaling occurs very fast since it does not require new protein synthesis; all IFNs use the Janus kinase (JAK) - signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. pDCs produce most of the IFN-α during an infection; IFN-γ bridges the innate and adaptive immune responses, helps regulate immune function, and is mostly secreted by activated T cells and natural killer (NK) cells (
