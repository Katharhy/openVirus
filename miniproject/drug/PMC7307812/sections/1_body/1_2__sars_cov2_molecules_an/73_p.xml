<p>Translating data from animal models to clinical practice shows sometimes important differences, and we have contradicting results in clinical trials involving RAS and ARDS. A South Korean study with 182 patients (
 <xref rid="b115-ijmm-46-02-0489" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>) showed that mechanically ventilated patients on RAS inhibitors had better survival rates at 30 days than patients not receiving them; however at 90 days there was no significant difference in mortality between the 2 groups, and patients on RAS inhibitor required longer ICU stay and mechanical ventilation.
