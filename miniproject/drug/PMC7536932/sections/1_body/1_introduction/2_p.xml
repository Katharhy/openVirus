It has been used as a treatment in previous coronavirus diseases during the epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)

Its proven safety, affordability and global availability make it an attractive candidate for repurposing as a treatment for COVID‐19. Given the expected massive global impact of COVID‐19, particularly in low‐to‐middle income countries, it is important not only to develop therapies that treat the virus successfully, but also to ensure that these therapies are readily implementable at all levels of development and economy.
