<p>In a randomised trial in patients with influenza A receiving oseltamivir, 5 days' adjunctive AZM 500 mg daily was associated with more rapid reductions in plasma concentrations of IL‐6, IL‐8, IL‐17, CXCL9, soluble tissue necrosis factor (TNF) and C‐reactive protein (CRP).

 </xref> However, this was an open‐label study, with a small sample size (n = 50), and the effect was small, with no significant changes in viral clearance or time to symptom resolution. In a second, larger, open‐label, randomised controlled trial 2 days of clarithromycin 500 mg and naproxen 200 mg twice daily reduced 30 day mortality, high dependency unit admission and hospital stay in 217 elderly patients with H2N2 influenza.

 </xref> The effect size was marked, although the study is limited by lack of blinding and by the likelihood that much of the effect might be attributable to the antibacterial properties of clarithromycin, as bacterial pneumonias are responsible for a high proportion of influenza deaths, particularly in the elderly.
