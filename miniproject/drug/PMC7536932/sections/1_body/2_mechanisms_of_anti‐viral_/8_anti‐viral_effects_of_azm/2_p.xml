 </xref> These viruses are endemic respiratory and gastrointestinal viruses and the 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genus includes the pandemic viruses MERS‐CoV, SARS‐CoV and SARS‐CoV‐2. AZM was used in a third of patients treated for MERS‐CoV, although without a clinical evidence base.

 </xref> A retrospective cohort analysis of 349 patients across 14 sites in Saudi Arabia found no significant reduction in 90‐day mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.84 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47‐1.51) or improvement in MERS‐CoV RNA clearance (hazard ratio HR 0.88 [0.47‐1.64] with macrolide use).
