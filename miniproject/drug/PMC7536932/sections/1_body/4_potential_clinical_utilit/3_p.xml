<p>The importance of controlling this inflammation is demonstrated by the recent positive findings of the RECOVERY trial showing a significant mortality benefit with dexamethasone in patients with severe COVID‐19 disease and respiratory failure.

 </xref> Interestingly, there was no benefit in those randomised at earlier disease stages, consistent with a lower degree of inflammation in these individuals, and suggesting other anti‐inflammatory approaches with fewer side effects might be valuable. The lag between symptom onset and severe disease provides a therapeutic window in which AZM anti‐inflammatory properties may reduce severe pulmonary inflammation, benefiting from the propensity of macrolides to accumulate in phagocytes,
