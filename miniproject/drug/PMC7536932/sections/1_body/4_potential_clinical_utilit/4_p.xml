<p>It is understandable therefore, that more than 80 clinical trials have been designed to test AZM efficacy in COVID‐19 (Table 
 <xref rid="rmv2163-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). These differ significantly from each other according to dosing regime, duration of therapy, whether being used in combination with hydroxychloroquine and, critically, according to the population being studied. Those recruiting in primary care will tend to study the anti‐viral effects in early disease, whilst those recruiting in secondary care will be studying more the anti‐inflammatory effects important in late disease. The first trial to publish results compared standard care with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 400 mg twice daily or with HQC 400 mg twice daily and AZM 500 mg once daily for 7 days in hospitalised patients with a median duration of symptoms of 7 days prior to randomisation.

 </xref> There was no reduction in symptoms or requirement for ventilation with either HCQ plus AZM compared with HCQ alone (odds ratio 0.82; 95% confidence interval 0.47‐1.43), but data from other populations, disease stages and without HCQ are urgently needed. If studies show clinical efficacy it will be essential to determine which populations benefit and what criteria to use as clinical indications for therapy. There is also a need for further human in vivo mechanistic studies to determine which of the manifold potential mechanisms are dominant in patients with disease.
