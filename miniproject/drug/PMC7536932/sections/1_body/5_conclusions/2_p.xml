<p>As a therapeutic class, macrolides, and in particular AZM, with its long therapeutic half‐life, good safety profile and very strong evidence base in bacterial diseases are fascinating molecules. Macrolides undoubtedly have broad‐spectrum anti‐viral properties in vitro. AZM consistently emerges as a candidate molecule in anti‐viral drug screens against respiratory viruses, and there are tantalising hints of clinical efficacy in clinical studies to date. The additional anti‐inflammatory properties displayed by some macrolides, including AZM, may well prove to be clinically important in reducing immunopathology in some viral diseases, not least against the pandemic 
 <italic>Betacoronaviruses</italic> in which activation of an over‐exuberant inflammatory cascade seems to be critical to mortality. However there is currently insufficient evidence to justify their use clinically, but rather, a clear mandate to perform well‐designed and conducted randomised trials in patients with chronic airways disorders and those with pandemic respiratory viruses including influenza A, SARS‐CoV‐2 and in future pandemics of novel coronaviruses which increasingly appear to be an inevitable prospect.
