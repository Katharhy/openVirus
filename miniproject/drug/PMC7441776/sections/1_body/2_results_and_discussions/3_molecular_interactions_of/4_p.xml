<p>Simeprevir is observed to show three hydrophobic interactions with Pro168, two with Leu50 and one with each of the Thr190 and Ala191. Ergotamine exhibits one pi–alkyl and one pi–pi T-shaped hydrophobic interaction with Met165 and His41, respectively. Among all the protein–drug complexes, Bromocriptine demonstrates the most noncovalent interactions with the main protease. It shows two hydrophobic interactions with His41, two with Leu27, three with Met165 and one with each of the Met49, Cys145 and Gln189 residues. Tadalafil exhibits hydrophobic interactions with both catalytic residues. Both Ergotamine and Tadalafil show one pi–sulfur interaction with Met165 and Met49 residues, respectively.</p>
