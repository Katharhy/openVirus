 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>, supporting information). Among them, most of the interactions with the active site residues are categorized as hydrophobic (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Both Simeprevir and Ergotamine form a hydrogen bond with at least one of the catalytic residues.
