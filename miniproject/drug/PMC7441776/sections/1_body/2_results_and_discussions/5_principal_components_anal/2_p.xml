<p>PCA is applied to observe the structural properties and energy profiles of apo–Mpro and the selected four drug–Mpro complexes. A single PCA model consisting of five training sets (Mpro and four drug–Mpro complexes) was constructed for analysis. The first two PCs explained 91.74% of the total variance, where PC1 contributed 75.07% and PC2 contributed 16.67% of the variance. It is observed from the scores plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(a)</xref>) that the apo–Mpro (violet) and Simeprevir–Mpro complex (cyan) overlap with each other, thus, indicating similarity in energy and structural profile. Moreover, Ergotamine–Mpro (green) and Tadalafil–Mpro (orange–red) shifted slightly toward the right in the PC1 direction and resided very close to apo–Mpro and Simeprevir–Mpro complex. Thus, by forming a complex with Ergotamine and Tadalafil, Mpro showed a similar structural profile compared to Mpro alone. However, the Bromocriptine–Mpro complex (blue) shifted significantly toward the positive direction of PC1. This indicates greater dissimilarity of Bromocriptine–Mpro with apo–Mpro and other complexes. The loading plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(b)</xref>) revealed that the variables are separated in the PC1 direction, which explains different cluster formation in the PC1 direction. Therefore, it is evident from the PCA scoring plot that Simeprevir has the best binding stability with Mpro, while Ergotamine and Tadalafil also demonstrate almost similar behavior in MD simulation.
