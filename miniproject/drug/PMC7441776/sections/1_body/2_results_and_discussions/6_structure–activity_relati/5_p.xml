<p>The ability of the MLR model to accurately anticipate the binding energy of the validated drugs is evaluated by the root-mean-square-relative percent-error (RMS%RE). The result obtained from MLR is 82% accurate while comparing to the binding energy. Yet, findings from this analysis can help researchers predict the drug performances against the main protease considering the binding energy, chemical behavior and pharmacological efficacy of upcoming drug candidates.</p>
