<p>SAR has been used for decades by researchers as a cheaper way to develop relationships between physiochemical properties of chemicals and their bioactivities (Santos-Filho et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Verma et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). It is a widely used tool in bioinformatics, drug discovery for clinical research, pharmaceutical industry, petrochemical and agrochemical sectors for modeling and predictive pattern analysis (Alam &amp; Khan,

 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). For further analysis, MLR has been employed. For instance, TPSA (Å
 <sup>2</sup>), molecular weight, XLogP3, H-bond donor count, H-bond acceptor count of the drugs are the most significant variables on QSAR contributors to the MLR model (
