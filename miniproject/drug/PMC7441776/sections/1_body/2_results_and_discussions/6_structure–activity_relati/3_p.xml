 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figure 7</xref>). For example, drugs (D2, D3 and D5) containing indole ring, amide group and alcohol group are clustered together on the fourth quadrant of the score plot. On the other hand, drugs (D23, D7, D16, D13, D22 and D24) with diazole ring attached to the benzene ring are clustered on the second and third quadrants.
