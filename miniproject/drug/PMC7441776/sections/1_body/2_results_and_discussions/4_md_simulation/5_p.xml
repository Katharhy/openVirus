<p>Since intermolecular hydrogen bonds between protein–drug complexes have a significant contribution to the conformational stability of the complex, the total number of hydrogen bonds is calculated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(e)</xref>). The average number of hydrogen bonds observed in apo–Mpro is 510.2 ± 11.80. The Bromocriptine–Mpro complex has the most hydrogen bonds over the 100 ns simulation time (
