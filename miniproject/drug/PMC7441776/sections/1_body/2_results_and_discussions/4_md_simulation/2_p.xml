<p>MD simulation for all complexes of the main protease (6LU7) with the top four selected drugs and apo–form is performed for 100 ns. RMSD of alpha carbon atoms, RMSF of all amino acid residues, solvent accessible surface area, radius of gyration and the number of hydrogen bonds of all the drug–protein complexes and apo–Mpro are investigated.</p>
