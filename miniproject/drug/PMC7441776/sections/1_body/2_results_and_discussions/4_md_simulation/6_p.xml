<p>Binding free energy calculations for each complex were conducted by employing the MM/PBSA method. The Simeprevir–Mpro shows the highest average binding free energy of −77.44 ± 2.43 kcal/mol. All our selected drug–Mpro complexes demonstrate better binding free energy than the Remdesivir–Mpro complex (

The binding free energy of Ergotamine–Mpro, Bromocriptine–Mpro, Tadalafil–Mpro and Lopinavir–Mpro complexes remained negative most of the time, which also indicates good binding (
