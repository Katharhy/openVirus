<p>The RMSD of Simeprevir–Mpro and Ergotamine–Mpro are stabilized after 20 ns of simulation, with an average value of 1.81 ± 0.30 Å and 1.90 ± 0.32 Å, respectively (
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4a</xref> reveals that Bromocriptine–Mpro follows a similar trend in MD trajectory like apo–Mpro. Tadalafil–Mpro complex shows fluctuation until 30 ns, while it reaches a peak of 3.01 Å at 26.8 ns. It exhibits structural stability after 30 ns of MD simulation. These drug–Mpro complexes exhibit better stability in the RMSD trajectory than the control drugs. Unstable nature is observed for the RMSD of Remdesivir–Mpro after 70 ns of MD simulation, while the Lopinavir–Mpro complex followed the similar trend like the Bromocriptine–Mpro complex. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4b</xref> displays root-mean-square fluctuation as a function of the residue number of the apo–Mpro and drug–Mpro complexes. This is explored to understand how the binding of drug molecules changes the behavior of the amino acid residues of the protein. A low RMSF is observed for the apo–Mpro which suggests low flexibility of protein even without a ligand. It also shows flexibility at Ser46 to Asn53, Tyr154, Val303, Thr304, Phe305 and Gln306. The residues Arg188 to Asp197 show high flexibility in Tadalafil–Mpro complex. RMSF of Simeprevir–Mpro, Ergotamine–Mpro, Bromocriptine–Mpro, Remdesivir–Mpro and Lopinavir–Mpro complexes are almost similar in most areas.
