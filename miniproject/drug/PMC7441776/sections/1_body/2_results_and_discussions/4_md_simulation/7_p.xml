<p>The snapshots of Mpro–drug complexes are visualized at different time intervals to explore the drugs pose during MD simulation. All our selected drugs stayed at the binding pocket of the protein over the phase of 100 ns MD simulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref>). Additionally, all drugs interact with at least one of the catalytic residues during most of the time of MD simulation (Table S4, supporting information).
