<p>The radius of gyration (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>g</sub>) is the root mean square distance of various atoms of a protein from the axis of rotation, and it illustrates structural compactness. A greater change in 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>g</sub> value may occur due to the folding or conformational changes of protein structure, while a lower degree of fluctuation over the simulation period indicates rigidity and higher compactness of a structure. According to the observed 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>g</sub> value, the apo–Mpro and Simeprevir–Mpro complex showed almost similar structural compactness over the phase of the 100 ns simulation. The apo–Mpro complex experienced a fluctuation in 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>g</sub> value during 80–90 ns. Ergotamine showed structural compactness all over the simulation time with an average of 22.32 ± 0.11 Å. Bromocriptine–Mpro followed a similar trend like the Remdesivir–Mpro complex after 45 ns. A loose packing is observed for Tadalafil–Mpro during 60 ns to 90 ns. Except for this time frame, Tadalafil–Mpro and Lopinavir–Mpro followed a similar trend in MD trajectory. Based on the overall 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>g</sub>, the average values are 22.35 ± 0.14 Å, 22.39 ± 0.14 Å, 22.20 ± 0.13 Å, 22.57 ± 0.24 Å, 22.22 ± 0.12 Å and 22.42 ± 0.11 Å for apo–Mpro, Simeprevir–Mpro, Bromocriptine–Mpro, Tadalafil–Mpro, Remdesivir–Mpro and Lopinavir–Mpro complexes, respectively. To anticipate the solvent accessibility of all complexes, the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) of apo–Mpro and complexes are calculated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(c)</xref>). Binding of a drug to the protein may impact its structural properties, thus, SASA may also change. A higher SASA value suggests the expansion of protein structure. A low fluctuation of SASA value is expected during the simulation. All the examined complexes exhibit a similar trend until 40 ns of MD trajectory. Simeprevir–Mpro and Ergotamine–Mpro showed lower SASA value than the control drug–Mpro complexes. The overall average SASA value suggests Lopinavir could induce protein expansion, and thus, increase the solvent accessible surface of the protein (
