<p>The structure of 1615 FDA approved drugs is considered for virtual screening using Autodock Vina. Considering −5.1 kcal/mol as a cutoff value, the binding affinities of the drugs are distributed between −5.1 to −6.0, −6.1 to −7.0, −7.1 to −8.0, −8.1 to −9.0 and −9.1 to −10.4 kcal/mol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). Most drugs are found to have binding affinities between −6.1 to −7.0 kcal/mol. The top 31 candidates are selected for further analysis according to their binding affinities. The binding affinity of two already reported drugs Remdesivir and Lopinavir were observed −7.5 and −7.4 kcal/mol, respectively. After optimizing by PM6 level of theory, the selected drugs are screened again in AutoDock Vina. GOLD suit was also employed to understand the binding fitness using the CHEMPLP fitness score. Here, a higher fitness score suggests better docking interaction between protein and ligand. Along with 5 previously suggested FDA approved drugs (Contini,
