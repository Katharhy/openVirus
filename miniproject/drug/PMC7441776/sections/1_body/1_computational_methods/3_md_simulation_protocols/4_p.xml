 <sub>SA</sub> correspond to polar and nonpolar solvation energyies, respectively. 
 <italic>TΔS</italic> is the entropic contribution. Due to the high computational time, the entropy contribution was not considered. The final 50 ns data of MD simulation was used for binding free energy calculations.
