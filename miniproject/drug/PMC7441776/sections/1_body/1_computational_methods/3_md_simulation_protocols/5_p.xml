<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to identify similarities and dissimilarities among the collected energy profiles of MD trajectory data (Martens &amp; Naes, 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). The important components of a PCA model are highlighted in the following equation: 
 <italic>X = T
  <sub>k</sub>P
  <sub>k</sub>
  <sup>T</sup> + E
 </italic>, where the 
 <italic>X</italic> matrix expresses a product of two new matrices, i.e. 
 <italic>T
  <sub>k</sub>
 </italic>, 
 <italic>P
  <sub>k</sub>
 </italic>, 
 <italic>T
  <sub>k</sub>
 </italic> is the matrix of scores that shows how samples relate to each other, 
 <italic>P
  <sub>k</sub>
 </italic> is the matrix of loadings, which carries information about how the variables relate to each other, 
 <italic>k</italic> represents the number of factors involved in the model and 
 <italic>E</italic> is the matrix of residuals.
