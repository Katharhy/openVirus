<p>The MD simulations for the main protease were conducted (6LU7) in apo-form (protein without ligand) and in holo-form (protein–drug complex) to assess any probable conformational changes to and interactions with their structures over the 100 nanoseconds (ns). AMBER14 force field (Dickson et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) was used on YASARA Dynamics (Krieger et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) for the simulation. Water molecules were added and the system was neutralized by the addition of NaCl salt of 0.9% concentration at a temperature of 310 K (Krieger et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The particle-mesh Ewald method was used for calculating long-range electrostatic interactions. A periodic boundary condition was utilized to carry out the simulation. In all cases, the cell size was larger than the protein by 20 Å. The temperature of the simulation was controlled by the Berendsen thermostat. The initial energy minimization process of each simulation was performed by the simulated annealing method, using the steepest gradient approach (5000 cycles). Normal simulation speed (1.25 fs time step) was maintained during all the simulations (Krieger &amp; Vriend, 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). A snapshot was saved in every 100 ps during simulations. After completion of 100 ns MD simulation for all systems, the results were analyzed in YASARA. During the analysis of the simulations, time, energy, bond distances, bond angles, dihedral angles, solvent–accessible surface area (SASA), molecular surface area (MolSA), coulombic and Van der Waals interactions, root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) and root mean square deviation (RMSD) values for backbone, alpha carbon and heavy atoms were recorded. For more accuracy, the 100 ns MD simulation was conducted twice for every complex and the average result was used for analysis.
