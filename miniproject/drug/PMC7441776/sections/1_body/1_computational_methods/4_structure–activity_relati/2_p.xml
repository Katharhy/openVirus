<p>Structure–activity relationship (SAR) is a method for establishing computational or mathematical models that aim to detect a statistically significant correlation between structure and function employing chemometric technique (Verma et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). 31 initially selected drugs are explored in this study. Topological polar surface area (TPSA, Å
 <sup>2</sup>), molecular weight (MW, gmol
 <sup>−1</sup>), XLogP3-AA, hydrogen bond donor (HBD), hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA), number of the rotatable bonds (ROTB), number of H, C, O, Cl, F atoms, single bonds (SB) count, number of double bonds (DB) and number of benzene rings of the drug candidates were studied as variables. Along with calculated binding energies, these variables were applied to correlate with the SAR by multiple linear regression (MLR) (Fakayode et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Mark &amp; Workman, 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). MLR was carried out with XLSTAT (Adinsoft,
