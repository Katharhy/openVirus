<p>Inside the host cell, coronavirus genomes are translated into two groups of proteins; structural proteins, such as Spike (S), Envelope (E), Matrix (M) and Nucleocapsid (N) and nonstructural proteins, such as 3C-Like Protease (3CL-PRO, nsp5), RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp, nsp12) (Elfiky, 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Coronavirus genome replication and transcription takes place at cytoplasmic membranes and involves a coordinated process of both continuous and discontinuous RNA synthesis that is mediated by the viral replicate (Sola et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in cutting down polyproteins into functional pieces (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Shaghaghi, 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Thus, the main protease plays a vital role in viral replication. The main protease (also known as 3C-like protease) can be an attractive drug target to inhibit coronavirus. Inhibiting the activity of the main protease could block the replication of the virus inside infected cells.
