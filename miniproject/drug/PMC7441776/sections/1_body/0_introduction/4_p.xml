<p>The crystallized structure of the main protease (Mpro) or Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL-Pro) of SARS-CoV-2 was identified and repositioned at the RCSB Protein Data bank (PDB) (Jin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The crystallized structure (PDB ID: 6LU7) contains two chains, A and B, which form a homodimer. Chain A was used for macromolecule preparation. The protein chain is composed of 306 residues. His41 and Cys145 form an uncharged catalytic dyad (Paasche et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The active site of the protease is activated by a protonation reaction in the catalytic site (Paasche et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Inhibiting the activity of the catalytic dyad will ultimately help to inhibit the activity of the main protease.
