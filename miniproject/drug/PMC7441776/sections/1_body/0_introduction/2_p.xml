<p>A novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 spreading an infectious pneumonia-like disease (Huang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) named the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as SARS-CoV-2 (Gorbalenya et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on 11 February 2020. On the basis of ‘alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction’, on 11 March 2020, the Director-General of WHO characterized the COVID-19 situation as a pandemic (Bedford et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). To date, the total numbers of reported cases have reached over 5 million and the number of death is more than 300 thousand (Worldometer, 
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Earlier, epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in Guangdong, China in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 have shown a high fatality rate (Hilgenfeld &amp; Peiris, 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Ton et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 was found to be an enveloped positive-sense, single- strained RNA virus belonging to the genus betacoronavirus (Beta-CoV) (Chan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Lu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to (with 88% identity) two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL- CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, Eastern China, but are more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%) (Lu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). CoVs have the largest known RNA virus genomes, ranging from 27 to 34 kb (Sexton et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
