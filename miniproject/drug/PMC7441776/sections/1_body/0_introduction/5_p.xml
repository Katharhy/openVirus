<p>Currently, no effective drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 are available. Drug repurposing, a strategy to identify new uses of approved drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost for identifying effective drugs against COVID-19 (Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). We have selected 1615 FDA approved drugs from the ZINC database (Irwin &amp; Shoichet, 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). The focus of this study is to identify the binding affinities and molecular interactions of these drugs against the main protease using computational and statistical tools. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD), principal components analysis (PCA) and quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSAR) were executed to evaluate the performance of the drugs.
