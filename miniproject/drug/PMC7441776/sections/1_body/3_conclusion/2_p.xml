<p>In this study, several computational and statistical tools such as molecular docking, MD simulation, SAR and PCA are used to detect the best existing drugs against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Among the 1615 studied drugs, Simeprevir, Ergotamine, Bromocriptine and Tadalafil are found to have the highest binding affinity. As these drugs are already certified for human use, they do not require long-term clinical trials. These drugs show a significant number of noncovalent interactions including hydrogen bond, hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic interaction with the binding site residues of Mpro. All the selected drugs interact either with both (His41 and Cys145) or at least one of the catalytic residues. Furthermore, MD simulations exhibit that Simeprevir, Ergotamine and Bromocriptine drugs with Mpro protein preserve the structural stability over the simulation period. Additionally, the MM/PBSA free energy profiles of these drugs suggest strong binding with the receptor. SAR pattern recognition reveals that drugs containing an indole ring, amide group and alcohol group are clustered together in the fourth quadrant and drugs containing an azole ring attached to benzene ring are assembled together in the second and third quadrant of the scoring plot. The predicted binding affinity values from MLR shows 82% accuracy compared to values obtained from molecular docking. It can be concluded that the selected drugs are promising and can be used to design effective drugs against the SARS-CoV-2.</p>
