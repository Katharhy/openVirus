<p id="Par25">The SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequence was retrieved from NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) under Accession # NC_045512.2. In addition, a total of 94 whole-genome viral sequences belonging only to class Nidovirales, order Coronaviradae, family Coronavirinae, and three genera (Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus) were downloaded from the GenBank database for sequence similarity comparison with our experimental sequence of SARS-CoV-2. The sequences were submitted to MEGA v7 in FASTA format, aligned using CLUSTALW alignment tool and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) tree was constructed against all viral genome sequences for tracing the evolutionary record with SARS-CoV-2 using a bootstrap value of 1000.</p>
