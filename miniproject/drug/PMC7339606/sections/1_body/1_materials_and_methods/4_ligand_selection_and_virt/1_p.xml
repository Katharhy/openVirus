<p id="Par28">For docking, the following ten antiviral drugs were screened: Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Penciclovir, Nitazoxanide, Nafamostat, Chloroquine, Galidesivir, Favipiravir, and Interferon. Docking was performed using molecular operating environment (MOE) software. Based on the phylogenetic similarity of the RdRp proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the catalytic domain was selected for inhibitor docking of inhibitors against the SARS-CoV-2 RdRP. Antiviral drugs were docked against the following catalytic sites: GLY616, TRP617, ASP618, TYR619, LEU758, SER759, ASP760, ASP761, ALA762, LYS798, TYS799, TRP800, GLU811, PHE812, CIS813, and SER814. The best antiviral drug was selected with distinct S-score, root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), and energy binding score for the catalytic domain of RdRp SARS-CoV-2. The pre-eminent ligand was screened against the PubChem database for detection of drug-like compounds, and the Pfizer rule was applied to evaluate drug-like properties. Different parameters for drug evaluation were considered, such as: molecular weight (MW) &lt; 500, LogP &lt; 5, H-bond doner(s) &lt; 10, and H-bonding accepter(s) &lt; 5. Finally, compounds fulfilling the above-mentioned requirements were used for molecular docking into a new database.</p>
