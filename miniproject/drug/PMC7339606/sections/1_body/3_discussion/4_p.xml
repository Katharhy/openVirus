<p id="Par40">Our study indicates that the novel predicted drug-like compounds CID123624208 and CID11687749 have a strong affinity with the residues of the RdRp catalytic domain (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Strong S-score, binding energy, and RMSD values suggest that these compounds could be used as potential inhibitors against the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2. Numerous other viral inhibitors have also been reported which are in clinical trials including Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir Galidesivir etc., for which we have already tested with virtual screening [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. However, some of them are stated in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> with their S-score and RMSD values. Thus, in summary, Galidesivir and the two drugs-like compounds CID123624208 and CID11687749 screened in the present study could more likely have potential as therapeutic drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2.
