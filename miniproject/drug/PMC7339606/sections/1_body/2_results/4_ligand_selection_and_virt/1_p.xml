<p id="Par35">All the selected ligands from a previous literature survey were docked with the RdRp protein of SARS-CoV-2. The docking score, RMSD, and binding energy of ligands with receptor RdRp are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The results demonstrated that all the ligands exhibit interaction with the pocket of RdRp, while, Remdesivir has the highest S-score and lowest binding energy with the active pocket of RdRp of SARS-CoV-2. However, in virtual screening, Remdesivir and Sofosbuvir do not provided us with novel compounds against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Therefore, we have selected Galidesivir with S-score (− 12.5338) and binding energy (− 13.922) that provided us with some novel compounds in virtual screening (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Compounds with &gt; 95% structural similarity to Galidesivir were selected for ligand-based virtual screening from the PubChem database. A total of 1061 compounds were retrieved and Pfizer’s rule of five was applied to all the compounds, out of which 677 were aligned after minimizing energy in a new database for docking with the protein of interest RdRp.
