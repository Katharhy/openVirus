<p id="Par34">The SARS-CoV-2 RdRp protein sequence was queried using pBLAST and 94 validated sequences were downloaded from the NCBI database for evaluating its phylogenetic relationship with other viral RdRp proteins. An MLE tree constructed for all validated proteins revealed that most of the proteins shared close association with each other. Overall, the RdRp protein tree was divided into three clades: I, II, and III. Most of the viral RdRps in clade I belong to beta-CoV; the same is true for clades II and III with most accessions belonging to beta-CoV, while a few remain unclassified and require more research for proper designation. Accession QHR63299.1 was also unclassified but shows close association with other SARS RdRp relatives (Fig.Â
