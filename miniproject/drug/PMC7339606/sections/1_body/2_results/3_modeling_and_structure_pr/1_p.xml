<p id="Par33">Results of comparison of amino acid residues demonstrated that the RdRps of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are mostly conserved. Overall, divergence was observed in only 23 out of 932 AA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). According to our results, 2.46% divergence was observed, thus we selected the SARS-CoV RdRp (6NUR) protein structure as a reference template for the purpose of homology modeling. The protein sequence of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (YP_009725307.1) was retrieved from NCBI and submitted to a protein databank for PSI-BLAST (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.rcsb.org/</ext-link>), which depicts 96% similarity with the 6NUR protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Using the 6NUR protein structure as a template, 100 models were generated with MODELLER and the SARS-CoV 3D structure was selected with a DOPE score of -108,832.65625 and GA score 1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). RAMPAGE Ramachandran plots indicate that most of the amino acids are within favorable regions (875 AA), making up 94.1% of the expected residues. There was no need for refinement analysis, as the Ramachandran plot shows 94.1% in most favored regions. Moreover, outlier AA represented on the plot shows the desired AA which are to be targeted by our ligand reside in favored regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).
