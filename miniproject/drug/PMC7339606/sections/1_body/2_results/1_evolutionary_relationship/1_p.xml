<p id="Par31">A phylogenetic tree infers relative evolutionary distance with respect to other species. Tracing evolutionary history among all possible viral relatives using a genome sequence of interest can elucidate the adaptive behavior of species. In this study, we identified interspecies divergence among all the 94 validated viral genomic sequences belonging to the family Coronavirinae retrieved from the NCBI database. Most of the species clustered together, reflecting prior taxonomic identification, with a few exceptions. Overall, the phylogenetic tree was divided into three different clades (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The accessions, origin and taxonomic classification of all sequences are given in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. Most of the accessions in clade I belong to the Betacoronaviruses, indicating they all are closely related to each other, while only one and two accessions belong to alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV, respectively, thereby representing some distance with respect to the Betacoronavirus members. Clade II also included most of the beta-CoV members, with only two viral species clustered in a separate clade belong to alpha-CoV. Most importantly, clade III—which included the experimental SARS-CoV-2 isolate originating from the Wuhan seafood market—was found in close relation with all the other isolates of SARS-CoV-2 reported from Hong Kong and the USA (MN975262.1, MN997409.1, MN994467.1, MN988713.1; Fig.
