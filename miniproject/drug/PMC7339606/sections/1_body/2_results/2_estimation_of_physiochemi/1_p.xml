<p id="Par32">The feasibility of protein structure depends upon three-dimensional conformation based on amino acid sequence. Protein sequences were assembled based on their physicochemical properties. ProtParam (ExPASy) results for physicochemical properties revealed that the RdRp polypeptide contains 932 AA with a molecular weight of 106,660.24 Da, GRAVY score of − 0.224, an instability index of 28.32, and is capable of making hydrogen bonds, categorizing it as a stable protein (Table
