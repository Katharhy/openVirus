On January 30th, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). By April 10th, 2020, the current pandemic caused by the 2019-nCoV has reached nearly all the world’s countries and has consisted of more than 1.5 million confirmed cases with more than 92,000 deaths [

Both these strains evolved from a common Betacoronavirus ancestor; however, it is believed that SARS-CoV-2 first infected humans from a bat host during interspecies viral transmission. In support, it has been reported in China and other countries that bats are the primary reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 [

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses reported to cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). SARS-CoV-2 is one of the seven coronaviruses known to cause infection in
