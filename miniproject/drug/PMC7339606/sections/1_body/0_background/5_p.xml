<p id="Par24">Soon after the COVID-19 outbreak, China initiated several in vitro studies and clinical trials to discover effective antiviral drugs. Favipiravir is the first antiviral drug that has been approved by National Medical Products Administration of China to use against SARS-CoV-2 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The core objective of the current study was to evaluate the potential of Galidesivir, similar to structurally similar antiviral compounds, to inhibit the viral replication protein RdRp. An evolutionary-based study was performed to understand the relationships of SARS-CoV-2 genome with other SARS isolates. Homology modeling for predicting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp structure was performed with a reference template of SARS-CoV RdRp. Among the eight antiviral agents examined (Ribavirin, penciclovir, nitazoxanide, nafamostat, chloroquine, Galidesivir, favipiravir, and interferon), the best suited inhibitors were screened through in silico analysis that can further be used for preclinical trials to halt viral replication after prior testing. Our results are promising and may be considered for both in vitro and in vivo clinical trials for inhibition of COVID-19.
