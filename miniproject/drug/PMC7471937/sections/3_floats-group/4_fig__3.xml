  <p>ANOVA results for testing the statistical significance of the fractal analysis results. (a) MANOVA 95% confidence interval (error) plot for the fractal dimensions obtained with the shape*spike interaction of the nCoV particles and the corresponding MANOVA table shown on right. (b) ANOVA box plot of the 
   <italic>D</italic> values for three groups of nCoV. The red line indicates the median, the blue box extends between the first and third quartiles, and the black dashed lines (whiskers) extend between the minimum and maximum values excluding outliers (red points). (c) ANOVA box and error plots for testing the statistical significance between the means of the CoV and nCoV particles for rounded, slightly oval and elongated shapes.. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
