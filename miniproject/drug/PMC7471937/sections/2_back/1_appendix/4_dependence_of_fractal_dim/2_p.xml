<p id="d1e1758">We examined the dependence of fractal dimension on threshold obtained for both the data sets using an automated version 
 <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> of the Kapur’s algorithm 
 <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> for image segmentation. The threshold values lie in the range 0.3–0.65. The dependence of fractal dimension on threshold is again not significantly influenced by a small change in ROI of the images analyzed (
 <xref rid="figA.3" ref-type="fig">Fig. A.3</xref> (d)), in agreement with the findings of a previous study using the automated procedure of selecting the threshold for image segmentation
