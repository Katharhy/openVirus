 <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Determination and interpretation of fractal dimension associated with the complexity of viral surface could provide information on nature of contact causing the infection, and provide clues in developing new vaccines or at least antiviral strategies that are seemingly unknown for nCoV. Hence, from a utilitarian angle with the emergence of the pandemic, we made a first attempt to study the complex geometry associated with the surface roughness based on the systematic analysis of the electron microscope images of nCoV.
