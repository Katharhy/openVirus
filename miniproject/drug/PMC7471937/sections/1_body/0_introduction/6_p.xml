<p id="d1e396">Viruses have a variety of shapes and structures. They are classified into four groups based on shape: filamentous, isometric (or icosahedral), enveloped, and head and tail. A complete virus particle (virion) consists of a nucleic acid (RNA or DNA) surrounded by a coating, referred to as an envelope. The shape of a viral coat has implications on how a virus infects a host. The protein distribution on the envelope provides clues for drugs
