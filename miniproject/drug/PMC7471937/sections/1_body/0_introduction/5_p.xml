<p id="d1e377">After this outbreak, there have been several studies on nonlinear epidemiological models of COVID-19 spreading based on analysis of epidemiological data in mainland China and other countries

 <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Optimal control theory-based epidemic model (Susceptible, Quarantined, Exposed, Infected, Asymptomatic, and Recovered individuals, SQEIAR) 
 <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> is proposed for eradication of infection by following quarantine and treatment policies in China and Spain for different types of disease (COVID-19, Ebola, and Influenza). However, little is known about the roughness structure of the virus surface including its shape, structure, protein distribution, and nature of contact causing infection. Here, we claim to investigate these properties as they provide clues to understanding how virus enters human cells, providing ways to design drugs or vaccines to combat the virus
