<p id="d1e1328">Topological entropy was measured from the images of varying size and then they were compared with the 
 <italic>D</italic> values obtained. Entropy shows an increasing trend with fractal dimension for the nCoV particles of different type by shape (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), in agreement with theory. It is worth mentioning that the bias in 
 <italic>D</italic> could produce results similar to those shown in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> for different virus shapes. We investigated the influence of small change in ROI of the images analyzed on the 
 <italic>D</italic> values obtained and on the results shown in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> (see 
 <xref rid="figA.2" ref-type="fig">Fig. A.2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="figA.3" ref-type="fig">Fig. A.3</xref>, Appendix). On comparing the changed results with the original ones, we hardly found any noticeable influence (
 <xref rid="figA.3" ref-type="fig">Fig. A.3</xref>(a–c), Appendix). We also found from the MANOVA analysis that small changes in ROI produce fractal analysis results that are not significantly different from the original results (
 <xref rid="figA.2" ref-type="fig">Fig. A.2</xref>, Appendix). However, the effect of the use of different techniques for taking the images on the measured 
 <italic>D</italic> values cannot be excluded, so care must be taken when interpreting the 
 <italic>D</italic> values and their relations to entropy for different virus shapes.
