<p id="d1e1303">Here we discuss the implications of the ANOVA test results presented in the last section. Morphological diversity of nCoV particles is not statistically significant (
 <italic>D</italic> falling in a narrow overlapping range within error limits, 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>(a)), in accordance with ANOVA test results (#2, Section 
 <xref rid="sec3.1" ref-type="sec">3.1</xref>). These observations strongly suggest the 
 <italic>D</italic> value as one of the intrinsic properties of virion, although its measurement could be influenced by factors such as the methods used, finiteness in data, etc., to be discussed later. The slightly oval and elongated shapes of both the virus types (nCoV and CoV) could statistically be resolved (#3). The classification seems more complex with the shape*spike interaction than without interaction of the features (#4).
