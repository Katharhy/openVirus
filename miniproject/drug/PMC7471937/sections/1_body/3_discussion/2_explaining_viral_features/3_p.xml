<p id="d1e1282">It is worth mentioning that in few cases the quality of fit is relatively poor in an intermediate scale (see 4th column, 
 <xref rid="fig2a" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> as an example). This could be attributed to several factors such as experimental/measurement noise resulting from the use of different electron microscopy techniques, and the extracellular background (part of the region of interest, ROI, of the image outside the viral surface border), implying the 
 <italic>D</italic> values in this range are likely overestimated. It was found that a small change in ROI of the image outside the viral surface slightly improves the quality of fit, but their overall effect is not statistically significant, at least true for the images we analyzed (see 
 <xref rid="figA.1" ref-type="fig">Figs. A.1</xref>–
 <xref rid="figA.2" ref-type="fig">A.2</xref>, Appendix). The effect of the use of different techniques on 
 <italic>D</italic> estimation cannot be excluded, with a caution in interpretation, however.
