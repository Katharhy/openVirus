<p id="d1e1374">Fractal analysis of binary images depends on the threshold values used for image segmentation. The 
 <italic>D</italic> estimates used for discrimination of tissue structures at the multiscale level were found to be independent of the threshold selected 
 <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Our threshold values, obtained with an automated version of the Kapur’s algorithm 
 <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> for image segmentation, lie in the range 0.3–0.65 for the 
 <italic>D</italic> estimates obtained. We expect their influence, at least with the current technique, on fractal scaling is minimal 
 <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In addition, we investigated the dependence of the 
 <italic>D</italic> values on threshold for small changes in ROI of the images. We found their dependency is again not influenced significantly with small changes in ROI (see 
 <xref rid="figA.3" ref-type="fig">Fig. A.3</xref>(d), Appendix), in agreement with the findings of an earlier study on the automatic selection of threshold for image segmentation
