 <italic>D</italic> values obtained with the nCoV data analyses are in the range 1.34–1.85, differing from the Euclidean dimension of 2.0, suggesting a considerable degree of surface complexity. This complexity can be interpreted in terms of the nature of surface contact/binding/infected-site between the viral and host cells, and thus in terms of the patterns of surface interactions 
 <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. A rough (smooth) site may indicate a potentially stronger (weaker) interaction between protein and the binding molecule 
 <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The borders of binary images show irregularity in the image shape; the 
 <italic>D</italic> values suggest how their complex shapes deviate from classic geometric figures.
