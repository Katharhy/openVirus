<p id="d1e1427"> CoV exhibits spectral properties almost similar to those of nCoV, with a few exceptions mentioned as follows. The former (3rd rows, 
 <xref rid="fig2a" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="fig2b" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, 
 <xref rid="fig2c" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>) shows a relatively faster spectral decay at low wavelengths than the latter (3rd row, 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). A spectral decay of opposite nature is observed between them at high wavelengths, however. Because scaling analyses generally look for linearity in high-frequency spectral decay in log–log domain, we are hardly interested in the nature of low-frequency spectra. For the spike-less virions, the transition between the two regimes is not clear, however. Their low-wavelength spectral decay is relatively faster than others, suggesting the significance of the spike-distribution on the observed spectral decay. Overall analyses suggest that a power-law self-similar scaling over few orders of magnitude is clearly missing, with an apparent scaling at low wavelengths over a maximum of one order of magnitude corresponding to the linearity in log–log domain.
