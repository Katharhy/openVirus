<p id="d1e1478"> In any case, the spectra presented here are still useful, which enable the calculation of upper and lower bounds on wavelength. The lower bound on wavelength is related to resolution of the instrument (pixel size) and the upper bound to the ROI of the image analyzedÂ 
 <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The spectra shown here can also be extrapolated to learn about a surface beyond the limits of the measurement technique.
