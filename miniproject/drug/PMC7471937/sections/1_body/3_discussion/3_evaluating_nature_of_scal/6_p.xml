<p id="d1e1488">The spectral scaling suggests that the viral surface roughness features are prevalent over a limited small-scale (short-wavelength) range. Surface properties such as the contact area thus increasingly depend on the accuracy of these short-wavelength measurements/information. So care must be taken when measuring and analyzing the spectra at a wider scale range.</p>
