<p id="d1e1500">The limitation of this study is that our data are limited and consequently subtleties like the exact nature of spike distribution could not be resolved. Another source of error could be the use of technique, such as the binary box-counting method for determining 
 <italic>D</italic>, where the intensity information is lost and all the viral features are not contrasted from the background pixels. Also, image segmentation may cause some loss of information for estimating the 
 <italic>D</italic> valuesÂ 
 <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The advantage here is the use of automated entropy-based thresholding for image segmentation thereby avoiding/having minimal influence of threshold on the 
 <italic>D</italic> values. In any case, attending all these aspects, including the ways to standardize the images to avoid any bias of the results, as already presented, is beyond the scope of this short communication, but is the scope of future studies with the availability of a larger dataset to tightly constrain our current findings. By then the results can be considered as first order, but still useful for better understanding of nCoV in the framework of basic virology and clinical practice. Finally, the scope of this study can be extended to investigate some important dynamic features of nCoV, such as (i) changes in envelope-shape at different stages of infection where structural changes are expected to occur, and (ii) virion size that depends on the interactions between all its components. It is possible with the availability of high-quality data from both the low angle X-ray and light scattering experiments.
