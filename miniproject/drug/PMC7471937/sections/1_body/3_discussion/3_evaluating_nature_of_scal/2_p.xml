<p id="d1e1411">The radial spectra are analyzed to describe the complexity of texture at different scales that contain information of fine (small scale) and coarse (large scale) structures as well as the morphology of the virions. We qualitatively analyzed them to evaluate the nature of scaling. For nCoV, a cross-over at

A linear spectral decay at low wavelengths is observed over less than an order of wavelength with a slow decay, although it is difficult to visualize them from the figures shown (3rd row,
