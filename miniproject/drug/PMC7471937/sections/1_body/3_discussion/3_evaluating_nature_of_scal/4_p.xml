<p id="d1e1446">Images taken with different electron microscopy techniques are characterized by different bandwidth limits, lateral resolution limits, and maximum analysis size, which may subsequently bias the results. Thus, the spectra defined over the whole frequency range cannot be reliably measured. The resulting low-frequency noise may explain why the linear trend in the observed spectra is distorted in the intermediate to large wavelength range (3rd rows, 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>–
 <xref rid="fig2a" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Thus, the spectra in this range may not represent true morphological variations of the virions. There are ways one can standardize them to avoid the resulting bias 
 <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The first one, mostly experiment-based, involves combining results from various techniques and multiple measurements of the images per technique. The other one (numerical-based) involves analysis of the synthetic spectra for the computer-generated surfaces created under the assumptions of the random process model of surface roughness 
 <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The influence of noise on the measured power spectral density (PSD) can be tested by adding white noise into the synthetic viral surface characterized by a well-defined PSD. The fact that white noise gives constant power spectrum can be used to detect it 
 <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Comparison of the synthetic with the measured spectra enables us to calculate the upper limits on wavelength that can reliably be measured.
