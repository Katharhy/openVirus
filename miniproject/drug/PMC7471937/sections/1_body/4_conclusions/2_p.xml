<p id="d1e1520">We assessed the complexity of surface roughness of nCoV particles. ANOVA results show that the nCoV particles of different shapes (rounded, slightly oval, and elongated) could not be statistically resolved with their 
 <italic>D</italic> values falling on a narrow overlapping range. The latter two groups (slightly oval and elongated) of nCoV could, however, be distinguished from the earlier counterpart (CoV). The interaction of shape and spike distribution plays a major role for the classification to be statistically significant. Topological entropy describing the randomness of information in the images correlates with the 
 <italic>D</italic> values. The effect of the use of different techniques for taking the images on the 
 <italic>D</italic> estimation cannot be excluded, so care is required to accurately interpret the results for different virus shapes. Our data support apparent scaling (weakly self-affine) of viral surface roughness over a narrow band, with a maximum of one order of wavelength. Studies of this type have important implications on structure of virion, a key element in developing drugs, and on nature of contact causing infection with the organ. Detailed investigations of a large dataset at different scales, however, are essential to further constrain the nature of scaling, as a scope of future study. By then our results are treated as first order, providing clues to fight against COVID-19 with a hope for new vaccine.
