<p id="d1e431">The RGB color images are converted to gray-scale images to be segmented (binarized) by thresholding, allowing most of the detailed features of the virions to be preserved. The entropy-based thresholding algorithm of KapurÂ 
 <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> obtains the optimal threshold values by maximizing the sum of entropies for object (gray-scale value higher than threshold, set as white) and background (gray-scale value lower than threshold, set as black) of the image. Finally a binary image, created by assigning each pixel to 1 or 0 in reference to the label of pixels, is subjected to fractal analyses.
