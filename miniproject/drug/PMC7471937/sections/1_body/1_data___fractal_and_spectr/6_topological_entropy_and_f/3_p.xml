 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig2a" ref-type="fig">2</xref> show examples of data analysis applied to the representative images of nCoV and CoV, respectively. The nCoV shown here has four virions (marked as 1â€“4) of different shape and size visually. The CoV has twelve virions classified according to the envelope shape (rounded, slightly oval, and elongated) and nature of spike distributions (evenly distributed, clustered at opposite ends, clustered at one end, and depletion of spikes). All the nCoV particles analyzed here are characterized by spiked envelopes. As presented in the following section, we systematically compared the shapes of the nCoV images with those of the CoV images of 
 <xref rid="fig2a" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> to find in which category of those mentioned in 
 <xref rid="fig2a" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> all the nCoV images analyzed are framed and then compared them with that category. Once all the nCoV images are classified into the 12 categories of CoV presented in 
 <xref rid="fig2a" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, the results are compared from a media analysis, ANOVA for their statistical significance. The 1st row of plots shows the 2-D gray-scale binary images obtained after pre-processing the original color images. The 2nd and 3rd rows show the fractal and spectral analyses results, respectively.
