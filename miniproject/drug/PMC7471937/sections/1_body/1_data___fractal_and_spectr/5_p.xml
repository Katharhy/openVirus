<p id="d1e510">Next, we calculated radial spectra of the thresholded images. Here the power spectrum is averaged over all possible directions. It provides a convenient means of representing the information of 2-D spectra in 1-D. The spectra present a multi-scale characteristic of the images, with the frequency as a proxy for scale variable. Finally, we computed the entropy of the images to characterize the texture and studied their relation with fractal dimensions obtained.</p>
