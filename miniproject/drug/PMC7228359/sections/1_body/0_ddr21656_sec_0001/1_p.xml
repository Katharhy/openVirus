<p>At the time of writing this commentary (February 2020), the death toll from the COVID‐19 epidemic caused by coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2, which emerged in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China (World Health Organization, 2019), has surpassed the combined death toll of the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic of 2002–2003 and the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic of 2013 combined (Mahase, 2020). This epidemic seems to be spreading at an exponential rate, with a doubling period of 1.8 days, and there are fears that it might progress to pandemic scales (Cheng &amp; Shan, 
 <xref rid="ddr21656-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Yet, no SARS‐CoV‐2 therapeutics are presently available, albeit some treatment options which await validation have been published, including several broad spectrum antivirals such as favipiravir and remdesivir (Beigel et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21656-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>, Li &amp; De Clercq, 
 <xref rid="ddr21656-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), the anti‐malaria drug chloroquine (Gao, Tian, &amp; Yang, 
 <xref rid="ddr21656-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), and a traditional Chinese herbal formula (Luo et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21656-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). The ultimate solution is, obviously, developing a SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine (Patel et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21656-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Zhang &amp; Liu, 
 <xref rid="ddr21656-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). However, vaccines for the SARS‐CoV developed since its outbreak 18 years ago have not materialized to an approved product. This topic has been reviewed in detail (de Wit, van Doremalen, Falzarano, &amp; Munster, 
 <xref rid="ddr21656-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) and is beyond the scope of this brief commentary. In addition, there have been concerns about vaccine‐mediated enhancement of disease, for example, due to pulmonary immunopathology upon challenge with SARS‐CoV (Tseng et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21656-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Moreover, even once a vaccine is approved for human use, high virus mutation rates mean that new vaccines may need to be developed for each outbreak, similarly to the situation with new annual influenza vaccines (Belongia et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21656-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Below, I describe an alternative option which, if proven to be effective, would allow a rapid application in the clinic.
