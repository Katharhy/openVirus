<p>A recent hypothesis suggested that angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) inhibitors might be beneficial for patients infected by COVID‐19 who experience pneumonia (Sun, Yang, Sun, &amp; Su, 
 <xref rid="ddr21656-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). This article, however, is only available in Chinese with an English abstract that does not describe its logic besides the notion that the renin–angiotensin system is dysregulated by SARS‐CoV‐2. A similar suggestion proposing the treatment of COVID‐19 patients with AT1R blockers was put forward in a “rapid online response” posted online by the

 <xref rid="ddr21656-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). These tentative suggestions were based on the observation that SARS‐CoV‐2 uses angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor binding domain for its spike protein (Lu et al.,

 <xref rid="ddr21656-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), similarly to the coronavirus strain implicated in the 2002–2003 SARS epidemic (Dimitrov,

 <xref rid="ddr21656-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Moreover, the receptor binding domains of these two coronaviruses share 72% amino acid sequence identity, and molecular simulation has indicated similar ternary structures (Chen, Guo, Pan, &amp; Zhao, 
 <xref rid="ddr21656-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). However, SARS‐CoV‐2 includes a distinct loop with flexible glycyl residues replacing rigid prolyl residues in SARS‐CoV, and molecular modeling indicated that the receptor binding domain of SARS‐CoV‐2 has higher affinity for ACE2 compared with SARS‐CoV (Chen et al.,
