<p id="p0030">Is there a causal link between pandemics and methodological developments in epidemiology? This article explores whether pandemics of the past have been accompanied by major advances in epidemiologic research methods. Pandemics are particular because they threaten the established order, they challenge our way of life and of exerting power, and they appear as a failure of human societies against nature. They create a sense of urgency to find solutions to problems that older methods failed to handle properly. Thus, it is reasonable to wonder whether they also represent watersheds, discrete moments in the refinement and improvement of the methods used in a discipline which, etymologically, is the science of epidemics.</p>
