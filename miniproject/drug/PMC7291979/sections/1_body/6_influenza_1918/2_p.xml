<p id="p0060">Until 1918, public health was overseen by health officers and civil servants. In April 1918, Wade Hampton Frost was still working for the U.S. Public Health Service when Surgeon General Rupert Blue made him responsible for his Influenza Task Force. Frost conducted a massive epidemiological house-to-house survey in 18 U.S. communities and established the prevalence of infection in the population in the fall of 1918. Contemporaneously, the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health (SHPH) admitted its first students on October 1, 1918. William Henry Welch, who founded the SHPH, approached Frost in the summer of 1919 and made him Chair of the newly formed epidemiology department in September 1919. This was the first such department ever. Frost later became the first “Professor of epidemiology” in the United States. I am not aware of documents establishing the connection between the pandemic and the academization of epidemiology, and, as an epidemiologist, Frost is primarily remembered for his work on tuberculosis, and not for his work on influenza. Nonetheless, both Welch and Frost had been actively involved in the response to the 1918 flu and for the years 1919–1920 all of Wade Hampton Frost's publications [

Thus, with hindsight, we can appreciate that the 1918 pandemic may have spurred the emergence of an academic parallel to the public service dedicated to public health and epidemiology. The later development of an epidemiologic corpus of methods and concepts mostly came from these schools of public health and academic epidemiology [
