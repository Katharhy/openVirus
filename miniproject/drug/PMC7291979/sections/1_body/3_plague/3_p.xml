<p id="p0045">When John Graunt analyzed this continuous series, week after week, for several decades of mortality data, he saw, as expected, that plague deaths waved across time, but he also discovered a phenomenon never reported before: deaths from some causes other than the plague occurred with great constancy [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For instance, the number of deaths from “Consumption and Cough,” that is, mostly tuberculosis, that would occur any year in London could be predicted from the number of deaths observed during the previous year: about 2000. Graunt discovered that occurrence of events in populations is predictable and potentially comparable and can therefore be a source of scientific knowledge. The properties of events in populations could not even have been suspected before the 17th century because there were no data to observe them. A comparative health science had remained elusive because the life course of individuals, the only observation available to physicians, is unpredictable and incomparable. Thus, the surveillance system built up to restrain the disruptive consequences of the plague, the catastrophic pandemic of the time, appears to have provided the foundation to the most decisive methodological advance in the history of social and human sciences: the discovery of population thinking.
