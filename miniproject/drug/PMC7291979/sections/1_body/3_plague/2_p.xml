<p id="p0040">Recurrent plague outbreaks between the 14th and the 17th centuries disrupted urban life and unsettled civic powers. In London, the pandemics of plague progressively led to the systematic collection of death counts [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Quantitative plague reports were introduced in 1518 and expanded to other individual causes of death in 1554 and 1555. Serious episodes of plague in 1592 and 1625 were associated with the first broadside Bills and the regular, weekly handbills with parish-by-parish counts of plague deaths. At some points, these Bills of Mortality allowed for, as shown in
