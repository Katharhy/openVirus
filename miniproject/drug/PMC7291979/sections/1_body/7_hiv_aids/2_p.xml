<p id="p0065">The HIV pandemic unsettled epidemiology at first because epidemiologists had become used in the 20th century to studying chronic diseases and were taken by surprise by this resurgence of infectious scourges. Since World War II, the epidemiologic corpus of study designs had been substantially refined but the tools to study causes of disease were restricted to fixed exposures and outcomes well defined in time (e.g., to tobacco and lung cancer) [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The epidemiologic usage of the causal concepts of confounding, interaction, and mediation was still in their infancy [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. When the first cases of Kaposi's sarcoma were reported in 1981, epidemiologists focused on noninfectious exposures such as recreational drugs, which fitted the tobacco-lung cancer model [

 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The viral nature of the disease was established by virologists in laboratories [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A major question from then on was the assessment of the efficacy of HIV/AIDS time-varying treatments. Contemporaneously, a fresh approach to causality, now known as the potential outcome framework and the corresponding causal models, was occurring, inspired by work in the analysis of randomized controlled trials [

 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>]. The first application of these developments in epidemiology was unrelated to the HIV/AIDS epidemic [
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. They looked appropriate to handle the “healthy worker effect,” an up-to-then intractable methodological issue in occupational epidemiology: when studying the effect of an occupational exposure on a disabling illness, sick workers, who terminate employment early, are at an increased risk of death although no further exposed, resulting in a biased assessment of the association among the healthier workers remaining in the study. These causal models might have remained of limited usage in epidemiology for some time if it had not been shown that they were also appropriate for estimating the effect of time-varying treatment on the time to clinical AIDS among HIV-infected subjects: the fact that sicker patients were more likely to both be treated and die, an issue referred to as treatment by indication, generated selection and confounding issues analogous to those of the healthy worker effect [
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The watershed happened with James Robins's application of “causal models” to “the Analysis of Randomized and Nonrandomized AIDS Treatment Trials Using A New Approach to Causal Inference in Longitudinal Studies” [
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These methods are now used routinely in health and social science research, including epidemiology, and are textbook matter [
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thus, the deadly HIV/AIDS pandemic appears to have accelerated the integration of a new conceptual framework that resulted in the refinement of causality-related concepts in epidemiology and more generally in human and social sciences.
