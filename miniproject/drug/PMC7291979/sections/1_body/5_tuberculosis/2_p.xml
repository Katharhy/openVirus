<p id="p0055">Tuberculosis has affected human populations probably since the Neolithic, as the 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> is thought to have adapted to humans from domesticated cattle in dwellings shared promiscuously by humans and animals [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In 1900, many in public health believed that susceptibility to tuberculosis was hereditary. Persons with tuberculosis in 1900 affluent Western societies did not die consumed by their disease anymore as had been the case until the first half of the 19th century. They could have offspring. Eugenicists feared that, at some point, every human being would become susceptible to tuberculosis, leading to the extinction of the human species. The perception of tuberculosis then was analogous to a pandemic. Of all diseases, it had become the main killer. However, no methods existed to study whether persons with tuberculosis had a survival advantage: the latency between infection and diagnosis was long, and the cross-sectional surveys that had been used in the 19th century, by John Snow, for example, were biased because they comprised only selected survivors. Precisely for this reason, the German physician, Wilhelm Weinberg, invented a new design, referred to today as a cohort study, never used as neatly and at this scale before. Using population registries of Stuttgart, in Germany, he followed up 25,786 children from birth to the age of 20 years, comparing those from families in which a parent had died from tuberculosis with children from families in which the parent had not died from tuberculosis [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Children from tuberculous parents lived shorter lives. Tuberculosis conferred no selection advantage and did not threaten the human species with extinction. Weinberg's report is equivalent to a textbook of epidemiology, which described in detail the new design and analytic methods of his study. His review of hundreds of thousands of records, individual follow-up of dozens of children, and complex computations without a calculator was a huge endeavor unlikely to have been deemed worthwhile if it were not for the hope of an enormously important outcome. Comparative cohort studies will turn out to be a key determinant for the achievements of the subsequent chronic disease epidemiologic research.
