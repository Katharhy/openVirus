<p id="p0050">Before the 19th century, cholera had been endemic in certain parts of Asia but remained localized until faster means of transportation and routes made it feasible for sick travelers to survive the trip from, say Bombay, India, to Marseille, France, or from Rotterdam, Netherlands, to New York or Cartagena, Colombia. Since then, cholera spread in waves or pandemics. The second pandemic (1826–1837) reached Europe, North Africa, and North America. The third (1841–59) also reached Central and South America. These pandemics were scary. During the 1831–1832 pandemic, the case fatality ratio in Vienna, Austria, was 49.02% of 4,360 cases [

Susceptibility was an individual trait, and there was no way of proving it existed. However, John Snow believed there was some kind of still unobserved living thing that could multiply in the water supply and that caused the cholera syndrome when ingested from water or food or from sleeping in infected linen. He conducted a well-known survey—different from his investigation of the outbreak related to the water pump in Broad Street—that allowed him to compare Londoners residing in the same parishes, equally exposed to stench and air pollution, but drinking water of different degrees of cleanliness. Leaden pipe belonging to private companies conveyed water from sections of the Thames, one contaminated and one not, to tanks and then from these tanks to pumps situated in the individual houses ([

Thus, the pandemics of cholera, the greatest pandemic of the 19th century, stimulated the first use at a population scale of a comparative study design to explore a causal association. Group comparison has become the other defining trait of epidemiology besides population thinking.
