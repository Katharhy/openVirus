<p id="p0080">In favor of the causal link is the difficulty of finding counterexamples of minor epidemics that led to methodological breakthroughs of the same magnitude as those described previously for pandemics. In the 18th century, the Royal Society innovated in designing a comparative study of the mortality associated with natural smallpox infection and that provoked by variolation [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It involved a subtle analysis of the bills of mortality and an intercontinental physician survey. Natural smallpox was ten times more lethal than variolation, a finding leading to a wave of smallpox inoculation, at least in the United Kingdom. In his 1747 nonrandomized trial on board, a naval warship doctor James Lind allegedly compared 6 treatments, a single one of which (citrus fruits) was effective in curing scurvy [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. But these 18th century methodological breakthroughs were minor compared with the discovery of population thinking which gave birth to all population-based sciences we know today, such as demography, statistics, sociology, evolutionary genetics, and so on. In the 19th century, the researches of Pierre-Charles-Alexandre Louis [
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and Ignaz Semmelweis [
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] were innovative in their own ways, but their long-term methodological legacy is not comparable to that of Snow. In the 20th century, the refinement of the case-control study design was induced by etiologic research on cancer [
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and cardiovascular diseases [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which were on the rise and progressively replacing acute infectious diseases and tuberculosis as public health priorities. The epidemic of pellagra also led to methodologically innovative work by Joseph Goldberger [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. But none of this work rivals the contribution of Wilhelm Weinberg [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], which opened the way to the study of chronic disorders, including the elucidation of the health effects of smoking [
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], by rigorously establishing the methodological basis of cohort studies and survival analysis. Finally, no disease or epidemic has shaken the conceptual foundations of causal inference in epidemiology as much as the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
