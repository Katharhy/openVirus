<p id="p0090">However, my argument would be weakened if one could argue that the link with pandemics is not specific and that innovative methods and concepts in epidemiology have followed other types of happenings. My thesis could also be disproved by COVID-19, if the pandemic does not shatter an important dimension of epidemiologic methods. I would speculate that its consequences will be comparable to those of the 1918 influenza. We have now schools of public health all over the world, and academic epidemiology is thriving. Still, population thinking remains esoteric outside of academia and public health. This may be changing. Never in the past have we collectively considered what an epidemic curve is, what herd immunity is, and how we can act together to affect the progression of the epidemic. Similarly, Covid-19 may have accelerated the understanding that health inequities can be better studied and corrected at a population rather than at an individual level. Population thinking may become mainstream and, if it does, this will have huge consequences on the society we will build when the ordeal is over.</p>
