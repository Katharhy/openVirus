<p>The four CRF01_AE genomes from Cameroon were identified among a larger set of 
 <italic>N</italic> = 13 genomes that were previously classified as CRF01_AE based on sequencing of smaller subgenomic regions. However, the detection of recombination in the majority of these strains (
 <italic>N</italic> = 9) highlights the limitations of subgenomic sequences for classifying strains. Surprisingly, three recombinant genomes were identified among these that were classified as CRF02_AG or CRF27_cpx (
 <xref rid="tb1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This finding is likely explained by similarities in the regions found in both CRF01_AE and CRF01_AG, as well as the presence of CRF01_AE in the complex recombinant pattern of CRF27_cpx.

 </sup> These unexpected classifications confirm that full-length sequences provide the most accurate classification. Furthermore, the identification of mostly recombinant genomes in this dataset indicates that reliance upon subgenomic sequences alone can lead to underestimation of the amount of HIV recombination in a population. This is especially relevant for estimating the true prevalence of CRF01_AE, which could be skewed by subgenomic sequences from unrecognized recombinant genomes. Although CRF01_AE is rare in the Congo Basin, it is likely that its prevalence is actually much lower than has been estimated due to subgenomic sequence limitations. Interestingly, CRF01_AE has recently been found at dramatically higher rates in Kenya in 2008 and 2015 (14%–25%),

 </sup> although with subgenomic sequence classifications. Whether these strains represent a resurgence of CRF01_AE or a CRF01_AE-containing recombinant in East Africa remains to be seen.
