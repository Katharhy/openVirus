<p>We anticipate that further sampling and sequencing of global CRF01_AE strains will provide additional resolution for the molecular and geographical epidemiology presented herein. To accommodate these future updates, the interactive CRF01_AE Next Strain phylogenetic tree, map, and timeline provide an ongoing resource for tracking this HIV clade. As more strains are sequenced, they can easily be merged with the CRF01_AE Next Strain dataset to enable comprehensive monitoring of this clade in real time.</p>
