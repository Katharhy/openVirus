<p>The four African CRF01_AE genomes presented in this study provide further resolution for the epidemiology of the CRF01_AE clade and provide a new genetic link between the African and Asian CRF01_AE clades of the HIV-1 pandemic. First, phylogenetic analysis with the new Cameroonian CRF01_AE strains confirmed the African origin of CRF01_AE.

 </sup> Likewise, molecular dating with these strains was consistent with previous estimates of emergence of CRF01_AE in Africa in the early 1970s and in Asia in the early 1980s (Refs.

 </sup>). CRF01_AE appears to have originated in CAR where it spread to Cameroon and other countries in central Africa, although limited sampling from African countries prevents further resolution of the spread of CRF01_AE in the region. After ∼10 years of localized transmission in central Africa, CRF01_AE spread to Thailand and onward to other Asian countries (
