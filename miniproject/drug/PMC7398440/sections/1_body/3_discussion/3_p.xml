<p>The phylodynamic reconstruction with a skyride tree prior and the addition of more African sequences led to a more refined demographic reconstruction of this HIV-1 clade. The reconstruction suggests a small decrease in the effective population size in the early 1980s with another dip in the mid 1990s. The first followed the transmission from Africa to Asia and may relate to this migration event, while the second dip in the effective population size may very well be due to behavioral changes in Thailand at the outbreak of the epidemic in that country.
