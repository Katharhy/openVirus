<p>In contrast, HIV isolates collected from Thailand in the 1990s were dominated by subtype E envelope sequences.

 </sup> Once this “subtype” was officially recognized as CRF01_AE in the late 1990s, many molecular epidemiological surveys confirmed that CRF01_AE has continued to predominate the epidemics in Southeast Asia over the past three decades (reaching up to almost 82% among HIV-1 infections in the region).

 </sup> The spread of CRF01_AE has been tracked from Thailand to Vietnam, China, and ultimately a global dissemination.
