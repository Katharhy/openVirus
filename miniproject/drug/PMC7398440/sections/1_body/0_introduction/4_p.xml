<p>To address this gap, near-complete genome sequences were generated from 
 <italic>N</italic> = 13 specimens collected in Cameroon and DRC carrying HIV strains identified as CRF01_AE by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and subgenomic Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis with references from CAR and Asia indicates that four new Cameroonian CRF01_AE strains sequenced herein provide a new molecular link between the two previously well-characterized major clades.
