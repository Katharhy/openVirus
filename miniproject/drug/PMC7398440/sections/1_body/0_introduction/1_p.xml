 </sup> The genome structure of this virus appeared to be a mosaic strain containing a mixture of subtype A and portions of sequences that did not cluster with other known subtypes of HIV-1 at the time. The non-A regions (portions of 
 <italic>vif</italic>, 
 <italic>vpr</italic>, 
 <italic>env</italic>, 
 <italic>nef</italic>, and 3′ long terminal repeat) were classified as subtype E, although a complete subtype E genome has not been identified to date. The earliest isolates of CRF01_AE were collected in 1990 in the Central African Republic (CAR).

 </sup> Molecular characterization of the envelope region from strains circulating in Africa in the 1990s indicated that genotype E accounted for 31% of 29 randomly selected samples collected in CAR,
