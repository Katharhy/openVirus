<p>Both subgenomic sequences and complete genomes have been used to estimate when CRF01_AE first emerged in Africa and became a key Asian strain. Bayesian analysis with subgenomic sequences estimated the origins of CRF01_AE in Central Africa to the 1960s by several models.

 </sup> More recently, analyses with four complete genome sequences have estimated that CRF01_AE first emerged in CAR in the 1970s and was introduced in Asia in the early 1980s (Ref.

 </sup>). The evolutionary path of CRF01_AE between CAR and Asia has not been well characterized due to the limited number of only four CRF01_AE complete genome sequences ever produced from Africa, which could be a reflection of its low prevalence.
