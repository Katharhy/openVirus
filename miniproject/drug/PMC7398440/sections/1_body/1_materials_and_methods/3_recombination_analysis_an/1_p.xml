<p>Recombination structures of all thirteen genomes were determined by five different detection methods: (i) REGA subtyping tool v3.0 (Ref.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
 </sup>); (ii) jumping profile Hidden Markov Model (jpHMM)-HIV
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
 </sup>; (iii) Simplot v3.5.1 (Ref.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
 </sup>) under the Kimura 2-parameter model and a sliding window of 200 nucleotides increased by increments of 20 nucleotides; (iv) nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) to search for the most similar sequences; and (v) through phylogenetic reconstruction against a comprehensive dataset of 500 HIV-1 whole-genome sequences
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
 </sup> or through. The whole-genome phylogenetic reconstruction was performed in Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood (RAxML)
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
 </sup> incorporating the best-fitting model of nucleotide substitution as determined in important quartets (IQ)-Tree
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
 </sup> and 1,000 bootstrap replicates
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
 </sup> that were used to infer transfer support for branches in the phylogeny.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
 </sup> The final genome classification was defined based on the results of all five methods.
