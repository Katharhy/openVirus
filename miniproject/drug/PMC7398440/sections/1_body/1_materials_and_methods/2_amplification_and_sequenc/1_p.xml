<p>All near full-length nucleotide sequences of HIV-1 (HXB2: 94-9720) were amplified and sequenced from plasma viral RNA by a metagenomic sequencing with spiked primer enrichment (MSSPE) NGS approach.

 </sup> Briefly, nucleic acid was extracted from plasma according to the manufacturers' instructions using (i) the EZ1 Advanced XL system and EZ1 Virus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for NGS or (ii) the RNA extraction protocol on an m2000sp system (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL) for Sanger sequencing. For NGS, random hexamer (RH) primers (Life Technologies) were spiked with HIV-specific primers.

 </sup> These primers were designed from 3,571 reference genomes, which cover genotypes M, N, O, and P of HIV-1 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). A total of 798 primers of 13 nucleotides (464 forward and 334 reverse) were ordered and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (IDT, Coralville, IA). The HIV RNA extract was mixed with spiked primer (4 μM) plus RH (0.4 μM) in a 10:1 ratio and heated to 65°C for 5 min. The reverse transcription master mix (10 mL SuperScript III buffer, 5 mL dNTP of 12.5 mM, 2.5 mL DTT of 0.1 M, and 1 mL SuperScript III enzyme) was added to each sample and incubated at 25°C for 5 min, followed by 42°C for 30 min and 94°C for 2 min. Generated complementary DNA went through metagenomic library preparation using Illumina Nextera XT protocol to be analyzed on a HiSeq instrument (Illumina). Genome consensus sequences were generated using CLC Bio and Sanger sequences covering gaps were merged into the consensus using Sequencher v5.4.1 (Genecodes) as previously described.
