<p>Demographic history of the CRF01_AE epidemic was examined under a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach as implemented in BEAST v.1.8.4 (Ref.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>
 </sup>). First, a phylogenetic tree of the CRF01_AE whole-genome sequences (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) was aligned with 371 whole-genome CRF01_AE reference sequences from LANL in MAFFT v7.0 (Ref.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
 </sup>). The subsequent alignment was used to construct an ML tree topology in RAxML v8.0 under the GTR+G+I model of nucleotide substitution and 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The resulting phylogeny was manually inspected in FigTree
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
 </sup> and highly monophyletic clades—defined as containing three or more sequences from the same country and with good branch support (&gt;0.95)—were pruned with the ape package in R
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>
 </sup> to only one sequence, preferably keeping the oldest isolate in the clade. The pruned phylogeny (
 <italic>N</italic> = 179) was tested for good clock-like signal in Tempest v1.5.1 using the sampling dates and root-to-tip divergence.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>
 </sup> An additional 61 sequences were removed as outliers resulting in a final R
 <sup>2</sup> of 0.903 and a slope rate of ∼3.22 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> mutations per site per year, and with an 
 <italic>x</italic>-intercept around 1969.7 (
