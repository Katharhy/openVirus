<p>This dataset was submitted to a Bayesian analysis incorporating the best-fitted nucleotide substitution model (GTR +4Γ+I+F) as determined in IQ-Tree

 </sup> and various coalescent tree priors (e.g., skyride, skygrid, and skyline, constant and exponential growth). Bayes factor comparison between various coalescent tree priors consistently favored the use of the skyride coalescent tree prior.

 </sup> The molecular clock was calibrated using the sampling dates of the sequences under a uniform-distributed prior for the evolutionary rate according to previous simulations. After 5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> steps, convergence was checked using Tracer v1.6 discarding the first 50% of values for burn-in.

 </sup> Following the discarding of the burn-in, the remaining posterior parameters and trees were used to reconstruct the demographic growth of the global HIV-1 CRF01_AE linage through time.
