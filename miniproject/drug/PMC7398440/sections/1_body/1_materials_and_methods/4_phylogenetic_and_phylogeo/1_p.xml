<p>Isolates identified as CRF01_AE in this study were analyzed against all whole-genome CRF01_AE sequences in the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) HIV-1 sequence database (
 <italic>n</italic> = 382; accessed October 2018). First, we re-subtyped these reference sequences with REGA v3.0 (Ref.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
 </sup>) and jpHMM
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
 </sup> to insure the correct subtype assignment. Sequences presenting classification discrepancies from the Genbank information were excluded from the dataset (
 <italic>n</italic> = 11).
