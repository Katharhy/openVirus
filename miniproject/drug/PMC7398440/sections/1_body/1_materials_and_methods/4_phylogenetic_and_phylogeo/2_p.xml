<p>The final dataset was submitted to a Nextstrain build.

 </sup> Nextstrain consists of a suite of tools that take raw sequences (in fasta format) and associated metadata (e.g., time, country, publications, authors, and/or journals) as input. In short, Nextstrain performs a sequence alignment of the input data in multiple sequence alignment based on Fast Fourier transform (MAFFT),

  <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
 </sup> which in turn is used to infer a maximum likelihood. For the purpose of this study, the maximum likelihood (ML) tree topology was inferred in RAxML using the general time-reversible (GTR)+G+I model of nucleotide substitution.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
 </sup> The resulting tree topology is then transformed into a dated phylogeny where the branches correspond to units of real calendar time using a least squared dating approach.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
 </sup> In turn, the dated phylogeny is used to perform ancestral state reconstruction to infer the probable location of internal nodes in the phylogeny using a marginal likelihood approach. Finally, the time-scaled tree and the spatial reconstruction are then visualized together in a web browser with auspice.
