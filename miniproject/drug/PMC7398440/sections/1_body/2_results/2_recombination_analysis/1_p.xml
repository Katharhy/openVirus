<p>Genome-wide recombination analyses of whole-genome sequences were performed to determine the viral subtype and to detect evidence of intersubtype recombination. Despite minor differences, all five methods we employed to characterize the genome profiles of the whole-genome sequences broadly led to similar results (
 <xref rid="tb1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Based on consensus agreement between the five different methods, we identified four CRF01_AE isolates (U7957, U8216, 234-40, and 1002-28) and six unique recombinant forms (260-27, A1188, A1549, CG-0422-02V, CG-0427a-02V, and CG-0070-01) that included portions of genomic regions assigned to CRF01_AE (
