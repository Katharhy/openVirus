<p>After almost 10 years of localized transmissions, the first divergence from the African strains was estimated to have occurred in the early 1980s (1980â€“1981) by the introduction of the virus in Thailand. It seems that only one or a few strains were imported from Africa and reached Asia. Thai sequences were found to be dispersed throughout the tree, structuring the basal positions to several clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). This pattern suggests that this lineage is likely to be the ancestor of all CRF01_AE strains in Asia (

Thai sequences fall within the base of four major Chinese clusters and point to independent introductions of this strain into China. The Chinese epidemic was also seeded by strains from Vietnam in the mid-1990s (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). In addition, Chinese sequences were also found dispersed throughout the tree lying next to Thai sequences indicating extensive interaction between the two epidemics. The evolutionary history of the CRF01_AE strains as they exited Africa and were introduced to Asia, Europe, and the Americas is illustrated in an interactive phylogenetic tree, map, and timeline at
