<p>Only CRF01_AE sequences were submitted to further phylogenetic analysis. The four CRF01_AE strains isolated in this study were aligned to 371 CRF01_AE sequences from LANL, after a filtering step to achieve a more equitable temporal and geographic distribution as implemented in Nextstrain (final alignment; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 358). Our phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of near full-length CRF01_AE sequences in Nextstrain indicates that HIV-1 CRF01_AE arose in Africa in the early 1970s (1968–1970) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs. 2</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>). As expected, our isolates grouped at the base of the tree with four other samples from Central Africa (three from the CAR and one from Cameroon) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). This pattern suggests that Cameroon has a secondary role in the African CRF01_AE epidemic and was seeded by Central African viruses around 1974 (1973–1975). The grouping of the four sequences in the base of the tree suggests that the current epidemic in Africa was directly derived from the primary CRF01_AE strains. The estimated evolutionary rate for this dataset was 1.5 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> nucleotide substitutions/site/year.
