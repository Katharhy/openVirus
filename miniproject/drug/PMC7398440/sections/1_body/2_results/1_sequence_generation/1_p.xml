<p>A set of 
 <italic>N</italic> = 13 specimens with subgenomic sequences classified as CRF01 was identified from previous viral diversity studies conducted in Cameroon and DRC for complete genome sequencing. A range of 4.11–5.32 log copies/ml HIV RNA was detected among samples with previous viral load results available (
 <italic>N</italic> = 7). NGS of all 13 samples using the MSSPE method yielded complete or near-complete genomes of at least 8,800 nucleotides in length. Full coverage was achieved for 
 <italic>N</italic> = 8 samples and &gt;90% coverage for 
 <italic>N</italic> = 5 (A1549, 1002-28, 234-40, A1152, and A1188), which were filled in further by Sanger sequencing. Average read depths for each genome ranged from 14 to 18,899 × and the number of reads mapping to the consensus ranged from 1,060 to 1,744,672.
