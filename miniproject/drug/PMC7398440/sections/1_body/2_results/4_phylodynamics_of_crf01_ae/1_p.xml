<p>We further investigated the past population dynamics of CRF01_AE using 179 sequences under a Bayesian skyride model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Consistent with the ML results, we estimated the time of the most recent common ancestor of CRF01_AE to be around 1971 (95% highest posterior density (HPD): 1970â€“1973) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). The estimate of the effective number of HIV-1 infections through time shows an exponential increase in the viral population between 1971 and 1980, period in which the virus was still circulating in Africa (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). The introduction of CRF01_AE in Asian countries is followed by a short decrease in the CRF01_AE population probably due to the unsustained number of dead-end infections (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs. 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>). After 1985, the number of new CRF01_AE infections exponentially increases, reaching a plateau after the 2000s. More recently, we observed a decrease in these estimates; however, the 95% Bayesian confidence interval prevents us to confirming this hypothesis.
