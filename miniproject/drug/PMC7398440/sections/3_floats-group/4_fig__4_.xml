 <caption>
  <p>Nextstrain geographical view of CRF01_AE temporal dynamics. The geographical locations of isolates at each snapshot in time on the Bayesian skygrid are depicted with links between related strains indicated by a line. Lines between countries represent putative HIV transitions between regions and circle diameters are proportional to the square root of the number of branches that maintain the same location state at each time-point. Estimates of past population dynamics for CRF01_AE are plotted on the maps from 
   <bold>A</bold> to 
   <bold>F</bold>.
