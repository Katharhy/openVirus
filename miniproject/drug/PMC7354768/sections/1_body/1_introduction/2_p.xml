<p id="par0015">PubMed literature search (November 2019) using the terms ethics (or ethical), pregnancy and infections yielded 658 references. 144 of these were primarily concerned with ethics, including 105 articles on HIV/AIDS and 9 on the Zika outbreak. The sparse academic output leaves a number of areas inadequately explored. To date, there are no publications on the ethical concerns of Sars-Covid-2 pandemic as applicable to pregnancy.</p>
