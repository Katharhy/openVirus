<p id="par0130">It is often the case that fetal welfare transcends self-benefit as a basis of maternal choice, but neither is a fail-proof determinant of compliance with prevailing orthodoxy. Failure to seek medical care can result in detriment to the patient, her baby or dependents. Health services and society may come to shoulder some of the ensuing burden. The unique interdependency poses questions about whether pregnant women have, or should be seen to have, moral (or legal) obligations to the unborn child. There are also questions about the derivation and extent of any obligations and their enforceability [

 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The questions raised here are linked to the status conferred on the unborn child, the pregnant woman and on ‘being pregnant’. This status varies in different societies and over time. Pregnant women often receive support or unique entitlements that facilitate their access to health care. Whether health care structure reflects societal values and how these structures ought to interface with individual choices are matters for debate, but understanding these points clarifies the framework in which healthcare professionals’ practice. Infections may be regarded as a matter for collective responsibility and endeavour or be consigned to individual resourcefulness or motivation. Whether societal interest is rooted in compassion, concern for the inescapable monetary or human cost, or in third party interest can have a strong influence. The approach adopted by different societies or healthcare systems will inevitably vary, but there will remain an inescapable need for collaboration in the face of outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics.
