<p id="par0120">The effect of infections ranges from asymptomatic to severe or life threatening. The severity of fetal and maternal affection may not correlate. The fetus may remain unharmed - provided maternal survival - even where maternal infection is life-threatening e.g. swine flu in late gestation. Other infections can be more detrimental to the fetus e.g. rubella and CMV. Vertical transmission to the fetus can occur during pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium. This provides different drivers for action and raises the prospect of interventions, including caesarean section, aimed selectively towards fetal or maternal benefit. Tension can arise as treatments will have different implications for both parties. The effect of infection can also differ depending on gestational age. The risk of miscarriages or teratogenicity are relevant to early pregnancy. At later gestation, serious risks include preterm rupture of membrane, preterm labour and intrauterine fetal death. Some infections e.g. rubella and toxoplasmosis are linked to substantial lifelong impact.</p>
