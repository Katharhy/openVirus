<p id="par0050">Whilst effective against certain infections e.g. measles, tuberculosis and poliomyelitis, vaccines are not available against others e.g. malaria, or group B Streptococcus. Some vaccines are used for at-risk individuals e.g. hepatitis B, others are recommended for the entire population. High uptake of population-oriented vaccines creates ‘herd’ immunity, which requires 90–95 % uptake for high, and 80–85 % uptake for moderate contagion disease. Herd immunity benefits the small percentage who may have a contraindication to vaccination or those who have not otherwise been vaccinated. Overall, contraindications to any specific vaccine are rare, and lack of uptake is more likely to stem from passivity or deliberate choice. This creates inequity in the burden of risk and benefit. Minimizing own burden or risk in situations of high herd immunity becomes a tempting but, arguably, a self-centred choice. This can also create a dilemma for health care personnel when providing advice and brings into focus the tension between the desire to enable the exercise of individual choice and maintaining near universal uptake. Measures advocated to maximise uptake vary by the extent they employed persuasion, inducements or enforcement. Recently, the question of compulsory vaccination has come to the fore in relation to measles (in response to outbreaks) and influenza (vaccination of health care workers) [

Relevant here is that population vaccination campaigns are typically designed to deliver high-volume at low cost, with little information exchange between the parties at the clinical interface. The practical questions aside, there are challenging issues concerning social and individual responsibility. The emphasis on vaccination and prevention can influence the perception of those seen to have contributed to their illness.
