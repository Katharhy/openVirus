<p id="par0175">This article highlights questions of the moral responsibilities of the pregnant woman, the legitimate limits of her autonomous choice and whether society has a right or duty to interfere in the name of welfare or public good in contentious issues that are relevant to prevention, diagnosis and management of infections in pregnancy. The impact of infections varies, and the severity of maternal affection may be at variance with the effect on the baby. The risk of transmission adds an important dimension. The unique status of pregnancy and societal interest in the welfare of the mother and baby may provide an impetus for intervention in the name of welfare. But this may conflict with maternal autonomy. Societal factors and interests can pose a challenge to health care professionals seeking to exercise their duty to the individual patient under their care. There is a risk that judgements be influenced by perceptions of maternal moral responsibility or by the various competing interests.</p>
