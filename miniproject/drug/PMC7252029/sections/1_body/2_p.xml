<p id="para0003">A full-bodied worldwide research effort is currently underway to repurpose existing drugs and develop new therapies able to halt progressive disease that leads to respiratory failure and death. Here, we explore how we can apply our extensive knowledge of immune modulation that has been gained from the cellular therapy field to overcome the therapeutic challenges of treating COVID-19. Biological therapies to dampen hyperimmune host responses could potentially be implemented along with supportive care (supplementary oxygen and mechanical ventilatory support when indicated) or in combination with other pharmacotherapies such as antimalarials, antivirals, anti-COVID-19 antibody infusions (convalescent serum), anticoagulation and immunization.</p>
