In a cohort of patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19 who were treated with compassionate-use remdesivir, clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53 patients (68%). Due to study limitations such as cohort size and single arm design, efficacy will require ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled trials
