<p id="para0024">Targeting inflammatory cytokine signaling via Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) inhibition to treat CRS is being reported 
 <xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Baricitinib, fedratinib and ruxolitinib are potent and selective JAK inhibitors approved for indications such as rheumatoid arthritis and myelofibrosis. All three are powerful anti-inflammatories that, as JAK-STAT signaling inhibitors, are likely to be effective against the consequences of the elevated levels of cytokines (including interferon-Î³) typically observed in people with COVID-19
