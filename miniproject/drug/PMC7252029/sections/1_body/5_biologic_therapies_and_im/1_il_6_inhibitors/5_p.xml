<p id="para0017">The rapid clinical stabilization frequently seen after systemic tocilizumab administration to CRS patients strongly implicates a cytokine array, including IL-8, IL-20, IL-21, IL-22 and dominated by IL-6, in the pathophysiology of the syndrome 
 <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The median time from the onset of CRS to the first dose of tocilizumab has been reported to be 4 days (range, 0–18 days) 
 <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Temperature often normalizes within a few hours after tocilizumab administration, whereas the other components of CRS take longer to resolve. In previous CAR-T clinical trials, patients were considered responders if CRS resolved within 14 days of the first dose of tocilizumab, if not more than 2 doses of tocilizumab were needed, and if no drugs other than tocilizumab and corticosteroids were used for treatment. Approximately 70% of patients achieve a response under this definition 
 <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Tocilizumab has a half-life 11–14 days; therefore, if given early, it could dampen hyperimmune responses thought to be related to clinical decline in COVID-19 patients who progress to respiratory failure.
