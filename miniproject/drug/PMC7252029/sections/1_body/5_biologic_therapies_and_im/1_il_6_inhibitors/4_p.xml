<p id="para0016">In a study of 40 hospitalized symptomatic COVID-19 patients, the median IL-6 was reported 27.1 pg/mL (range 0–430 pg/mL). The risk of respiratory failure for patients with IL-6 levels of ≥80 pg/ml was 92% and thus 22 times higher compared with patients with lower IL-6 levels. After reaching an IL-6 value of 80 pg/mL, the median time to mechanical ventilation was 1.5 days (range 0–4 days)
