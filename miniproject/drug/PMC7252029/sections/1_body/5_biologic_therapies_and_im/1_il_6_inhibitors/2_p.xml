<p id="para0014">IL-6 is a pleotropic cytokine with both anti- and pro-inflammatory effects. It is mainly produced by T cells and macrophages upon a tissue injury but also from skeletal muscle, smooth muscle in blood vessels, adipocytes and, notably, by lung epithelial cells 
 <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. It could be hypothesized that myalgias, microthrombi formation and higher complications in obese patients could be associated to IL-6 effects. Moreover, IL-6 crosses the bloodâ€“brain barrier and triggers the increase of body temperature through the release of prostaglandin E
 <sub>2</sub> (PGE2).
