<p id="para0029">During the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in China, several clinical studies were open and are still ongoing, with one already published: a single-center open-label pilot investigation from the YouAn Hospital in Beijing administered BM-derived MSCs to seven patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with differing degrees of severity including one patient with critically severe disease requiring ICU care

 <sup>6</sup> cells/kg body weight in 100 mL of saline at various times after initial symptomatic presentation. The seven patients were categorized as critically severe (n = 1), severe (n = 4) and common type (n = 2). Three additional patients classified as severe received placebo for comparison. Patients were followed for 14 days after MSC or placebo administration and a range of safety and efficacy endpoints were assessed. No infusion toxicities or severe attributable adverse events were observed and patients, including the one categorized as critically severe, apparently demonstrated clinical improvements within 2 to 4 days after MSC administration However, although detailed clinical information as well as information on levels of circulating inflammatory mediators and of inflammatory cell populations were presented, there is a lack of corresponding information for the other six patients or for the three placebo patients. As such, more information regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria, timing of MSC administration relative to disease onset, comorbidities, the clinical course of each patient and a comprehensive evaluation of inflammatory mediators for both treated and placebo patients are required to better determine the potential efficacy of MSC and their mechanisms of action in this setting
