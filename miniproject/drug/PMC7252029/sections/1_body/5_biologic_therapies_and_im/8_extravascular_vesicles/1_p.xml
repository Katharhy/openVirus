<p id="para0033">Extravascular vesicles (EVs) are a heterogeneous group of cell-derived membranous structures, including exosomes and microvesicles, which are involved in intercellular communication, thus important for multiple physiological and pathological processes 
 <xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The broad and increasing interest in EVs has opened the opportunity to use exosomes and microvesicles both as biomarkers to follow the progression of various pathological states, as well as potential therapeutic modalities. In particular, MSC-derived EVs have been shown in a range of preclinical studies, including those of acute lung injury, to be as effective as the parent cells themselves 
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. However, there are several issues including but not limited to source, isolation and purification approaches, manufacturing consistency and potency that are in evolution and yet no clinical investigations in patients with ARDS 
 <xref rid="bib0041" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. As such, it is likely premature to consider use of EVs for COVID-19 respiratory disease.
