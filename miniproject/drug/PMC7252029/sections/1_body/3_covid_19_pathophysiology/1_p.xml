<p id="para0004">SARS-CoV2 is a betacoronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV. Both viruses use the angiotensin-converting enzymeâ€“related carboxypeptidase (ACE2) receptor to gain entry to cells. This receptor is widely expressed in cardiopulmonary tissues and also in some hematopoietic cells, including monocytes and macrophages 
 <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Direct diffuse alveolar damage due to viral targeting of the human respiratory tract epithelium via ACE2 receptors may lead to a hyperimmune response in the host, which can result in the development of acute respiratory failure and ultimately, in some cases, death. Decade-long structural studies on SARS-CoV postulate that viral receptor recognition is one of the most important determinants of its cross-species and human-to-human transmissions, strongly suggesting that SARS-CoV2 uses ACE2 as its receptor

This virus-induced exaggerated host immune response is a previously described phenomenon thought to be responsible for the high fatality rate observed in healthy young adults during the 1918 influenza pandemic and also described with SARS and MERS infections
