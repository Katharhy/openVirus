<p id="Par17">RNA of coronavirus is polycistronic containing approximately seven genes: 5′ region mainly contains large replicase gene for replication and transcription process, and the 3′ region contains nonessential accessory proteins expressed from sub-genomic mRNAs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. The large replicase gene at 5′ end encodes replication–transcription complexes (RTCs) amongst CoVs which comprise of two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b. Translation of these ORFs results in two very large polyproteins, polyprotein 1a (PP1A) and polyprotein 1ab (PP1AB), further leading to formation of nonstructural proteins by co- and post-translational modifications by various proteinases. ORF1b encodes enzymes which are needed in RNA replication and its transcription. All CoVs contain specific genes in ORF1 downstream regions that encode proteins for viral replication, nucleocapsid, and spike formation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. CoVs contain double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) which are attached with RTCs; these DMVs are derived from network of modified ER membranes, also referred to as convoluted membranes (CMs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. The replication of CoVs is inhibited by addition of drugs in the early-secretory phase or by addition of RNAi [
