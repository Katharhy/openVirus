<p id="Par14">The CoVs are ~ 65–125 nm in diameter, containing single-stranded RNA ranging from 26 to 32 kbs in length as nucleic material, being enveloped in lipid bilayer derived from the host cell membrane. The structural together with few nonstructural proteins (nsps) are coded within the 3′ end of the viral genome, whereas the 5′ two-thirds of the genome codes for nsps that are important in viral replication, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) [
