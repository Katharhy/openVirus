<p id="Par19">Attachment and entry of CoVs into host cells is mediated by “S” protein on outer surface of CoVs. S protein has two domains: S1 and S2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. Within S1 domain, receptor-binding domain (RBD), located at the C-terminus in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, mediates binding to the associated host cell receptor, while the S2 domain brings about the merger between viral and host cell membranes through endosomal pathway, leading to the entry of the viral genome into the cytoplasm of host cell. The virus may infect multiple hosts as the receptor-binding domain (RBD) is loosely attached to it [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. CoVs mostly identify carbohydrates or amino peptidases as a key receptor for entry to human cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. The mechanism of entry of CoV in host cell is governed by cellular proteases including human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), cathepsins, and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) which cleave spike protein and start further infiltration [
