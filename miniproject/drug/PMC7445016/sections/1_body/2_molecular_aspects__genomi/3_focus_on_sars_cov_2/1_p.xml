<p id="Par18">Genome of this lethal virus has been isolated; a total of 120 whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 could be downloaded from the GISAID database as depicted in Fig.

Sequences that likely had spurious mutations resulting from sequencing errors were indicated in the comment field of the GISAID data. Its genome is a +ssRNA virus having 29,903 bp length with 3′ poly A tail and 5′ cap. GenBank: MN908947.3; Locus MN908947 (

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/QHI42199.1" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/QHI42199.1</ext-link>). The genome of the SARS-CoV-2 reportedly is over 80% identical to the previous SARS-like bat CoV, and according to the evolutionary tree, SARS-CoV-2 lies close to SARS-CoV. The 
 <italic>ORF1AB</italic> is the largest gene in SARS-CoV-2 which encodes the PP1AB protein and 15 nsps. The 
 <italic>ORF1A</italic> gene encodes for PP1A protein which also contains 10 nsps. Further, the PP1A and PP1AB encoded by the ORF1a/b give rise to viral proteases, papain-like protease (PLpro), and 3C cleavage-like protease (3CLpro/Mpro), for creating non-structural proteins (RdRp, helicases) [

Recent studies have indicated notable variations in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 such as the absence of 8a protein and fluctuation in the number of amino acids in 8b and 3c protein in SARS-CoV-2 [
