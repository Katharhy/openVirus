<p id="Par2">Coronaviruses (CoVs) are spherical RNA viruses, deriving name from Latin word “corona” or crown as they appear like a royal crown under the electron microscope due to characteristic spike projections on their spherical surface. CoVs belong to family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> within order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic>, which further has two subfamilies: 
 <italic>Orthocoronavirinae</italic> and 
 <italic>Torovirinae</italic>. Subfamily 
 <italic>Orthocoronavirinae</italic> encompasses four genera: 
 <italic>alpha coronavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>beta coronavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>gamma coronavirus</italic>, and 
 <italic>delta coronavirus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Beta coronaviruses are a subgroup of the coronavirus family, large enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses able to infect a wide variety of mammals and avian species, causing mainly respiratory or enteric diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Discovered long back in 1960s, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were known to cause common cold in humans. To date, seven beta coronaviruses are known to cause human disease—the prevalent strains, HCoV 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43, typically cause mild infections of the upper respiratory tract in humans [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, scenario has altered in the past two decades with CoVs becoming a major public health concern as three strains, SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], MERS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2, are associated with serious respiratory diseases and have led to severe zoonotic outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The SARS-CoV pandemic initiated in Guangdong Province, China, in 2002. The infected patients exhibited pneumonia symptoms with a diffused alveolar injury which lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); the disease quickly spread worldwide causing serious illnesses and nearly 800 deaths in 2002–2003 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. MERS-CoV epidemic took place in 2012 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In both cases, the infected patients manifested severe acute pneumonia, but while SARS-CoV infected mainly the lower respiratory tract, MERS-CoV caused more pronounced gastrointestinal symptoms, often associated with kidney failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported a total number of 2519 MERS-CoV cases with 866 associated deaths from 2012 to 31 January 2020 [
