<p id="Par3">Currently, the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 alternatively termed 2019 nCoV, has caused panic with WHO declaring it as a global health emergency on 30 January 2020 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It was initially identified in the city of Wuhan, China, in December 2019; patients presented with severe viral pneumonia and respiratory illness. The number of cases has been mounting since then to whopping figure of around six and half million globally [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been named COVID-19, a highly transmittable and pathogenic respiratory infection, which has become a public health emergency of international concern as no clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine is available—though few broad spectrum antiviral drugs and drug combinations in clinical trials have resulted in clinical recovery [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy has recently been shown to be well tolerated, and severe COVID-19 cases could potentially improve the clinical outcomes by neutralizing viremia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Transmission is via respiratory droplets or aerosols on exposure to coughing, sneezing, and close contact with an infected person [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Social distancing, face masks, and frequent hand sanitization are recommended preventive measures. Personal protective gear as recommended is to be used by healthcare workers for their safety. Containing the outbreak before it can spread is the best way to prevent pandemics. Border closures, screening at airports, and checkpoints—classical measures implemented in pandemics—can reduce spread of the virus but will not be a fool-proof strategy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Millions of people travel every day from one country to another; a disease originating in one country can rapidly spread to other countries regardless of distances between them. This is particularly visible in the rapid spread of COVID-19, which affected almost every country in the world within 3 months of the first reported case. Information technology is playing its own role with numerous apps coming up, purportedly helping cope with awareness, management, and controlling spread of this disease—like “Aarogya setu App” in India.
