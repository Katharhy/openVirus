<p id="Par8">Metagenomics analysis of phylogenetic relationships between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, bat SARS r-CoVs, and Bat CoV revealed that SARS-CoV-2 genome (~ 29.9 kb) shares 79.5% sequence identity with SARS-CoV. Again, close phylogenetic relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and a bat CoV, 96% identical at whole genome level, points to bat origin of SARS-CoV-2 and bats as probable “key reservoirs” [

However, intermediate source of origin and transfer to humans is not known; further studies are needed to determine whether the virus was transmitted to humans by an intermediate host. Nevertheless, rapid human-to-human transfer has been widely confirmed, already reported from more than 100 countries in the world [
