<p id="Par7">Studies have shown that bats harbour CoVs that are ancestral to SARS-CoV which have been circulating in bats for a long time before genetically changing and jumping to humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. 
 <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> bats were found to have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies suggesting bats as a source of viral replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Further, studies have revealed that palm civets and raccoon dogs, of Chinese local food markets, harbour SARS-related CoVs (SARSr-CoVs) suggesting that they could be key reservoir of infection and may be secondary hosts. This detection of SARSr-CoVs in bats and small animals in retail markets may indicate an interspecies transmission from bats to small animals and finally to humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In 2001, samples from the healthy persons of Hong Kong on molecular assessment showed 2.5% frequency rate of antibodies against SARS-CoV, indicating that SARS-CoV might have been circulating in humans before causing the outbreak in 2003 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. MERS-CoV reportedly has camels as a zoonotic source or primary host [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In a recent study, MERS-CoV was also detected in 
 <italic>Pipistrellus</italic> and 
 <italic>Perimyotisbats</italic>, favouring bats as key host and transmitting medium of this virus [
