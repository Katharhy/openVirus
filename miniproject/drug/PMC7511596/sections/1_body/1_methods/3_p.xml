<p>In this review, an eligible case was defined as a subject who was determined to have acquired HCV through sexual contact with an identifiable molecular subtype. Abstracts of all search results were first screened, followed by selection of studies containing eligible cases. Bibliographic reference lists of the included studies were then examined for expanding the coverage of relevant literature. For samples suspected of duplicated recruitment in multiple studies, the study with a larger number of eligible cases was retained. Characteristics of each included study were first described, including the following variables: study design, location of the study conducted, study period, source of data, study population, genomic region for sequencing, number of HCV‐viraemic and eligible samples, with HIV prevalence among the latter. The genetic profile in each study was then collated with sorting by country and city, followed by tabulation of the regional genotype distribution of HCV. Crude prevalence of each HCV genotype in the region was hence computed by summation of that in respective studies. Phylogenetic analysis performed within each included study, if available, was evaluated for the identification of shared HCV transmission network with PWID, the latter referring to those whose mode of HCV acquisition was determined by clinician/researcher to be drug injection. The presence of both cross‐border and intercity spread of HCV in the Asia‐Pacific region was also examined.</p>
