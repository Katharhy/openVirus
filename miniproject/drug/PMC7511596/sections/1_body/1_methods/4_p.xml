<p>Following the systematic search, a further search on articles summarizing the prevalence of HCV genotypes in the general population and PWID in the Asia‐Pacific region was carried out. Search terms comprised “hepatitis C”, “genotype distribution”, “global”, with and without “PWID”, and their synonyms. One large‐scale study each for the general population and PWID with the most updated estimates and covering the investigated locations for sexual HCV transmission were selected. The HCV genotype distribution of these two populations in the respective countries/cities was then extracted for comparison with our main results as regards sexually transmitted HCV in the Asia‐Pacific region.</p>
