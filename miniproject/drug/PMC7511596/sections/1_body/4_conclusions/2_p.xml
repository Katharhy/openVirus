<p>In the Asia‐Pacific region, the genotype distribution of sexually acquired HCV is scattered across cities and countries. Currently, shared transmission network between MSM and PWID was noted only in Australia and New Zealand, while overlapping risk elicited from a small number of subjects existed in other parts of the region. Nevertheless, these networks were more likely to have been formed by drug‐injecting MSM instead of heterosexual PWID. Molecular evidence was minimal to reveal any cross‐border and intercity transmission network, and that the occurrence of regional outbreaks could not be demonstrated. The scarcity of molecular epidemiological information has hindered the progress with conducting comprehensive assessment in the Asia‐Pacific region, where seroprevalence of HCV among HIV‐positive MSM was relatively high.</p>
