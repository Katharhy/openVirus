<p>There are several limitations in this study. First, only published data from nine territories in the Asia‐Pacific region could be reviewed which might undermine the generalizability of the synthesized results. The limited number of HCV samples in each territory, that might be disproportionate to the true nationwide or city‐wide population prevalence, could lead to skewed results on the overall genotype distribution, which should be interpreted with caution. Second, the differentiation of transmission patterns between MSM versus non‐MSM and by HIV status was technically difficult. Since the baseline characteristics corresponding to each genotyped sequence were not specifically profiled in every study, the epidemiologic patterns could only be jointly evaluated. The same situation also applied to the differentiation between MSM‐PWID and conventionally defined PWID, which might also make the interpretation on overlapping risks difficult. Third, the incompleteness of sequence data and the unavailability of the accession numbers of the sexually acquired HCV sequences in most studies did not allow us to validate the clustering results. The differences in the genomic region used for sequencing in multiple studies had further restricted our evaluation and interpretation on the phylogenies and their implications.</p>
