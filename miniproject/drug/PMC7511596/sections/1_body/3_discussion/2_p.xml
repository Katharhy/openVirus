<p>This is the first review that has synthesized the current molecular epidemiology of sexually acquired HCV infection in the Asia‐Pacific region. To date, more information has come to light and confirmed the role of sexual contact as one of the major transmission routes of HCV, as well as the existence of transmission networks formed among HIV‐positive MSM [

 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>]. As revealed from the clustering patterns, local HCV networks seeded by single and multiple sources were both observed and differed by locations. A unique dominant subtype circulating among MSM existed in Hong Kong (subtype 3a) [

 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>]. Probably due to founder effect, the founding MSM in these places might have isolated from the large infected population and established a new gene pool, echoing the HCV‐4d outbreaks among MSM in Europe [

 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>], where genotype 1 was predominant [
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>]. Elsewhere in the Asia‐Pacific, the genotypes harboured among those who acquired HCV through sexual contacts appeared to be a replicated subset of that circulating in the general population.
