<p>In a European study, a rapid upsurge of HCV incidence among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)‐positive men who have sex with men (MSM) was observed, from 0.09 per 100 person‐years in 1990 to 2.34 per 100 person‐years in 2007 [

HIV‐associated immunodeficiency increases the susceptibility of the host to HCV entry and contributes to the subsequent failure of virus clearance [
