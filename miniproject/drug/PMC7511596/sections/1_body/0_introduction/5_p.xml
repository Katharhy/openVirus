<p>To date, seven genotypes, 67 confirmed and 20 provisionally assigned subtypes of HCV have been identified globally [
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>]. The continued discovery of different yet closely related variants over a short period and in diverse locations provided evidence to the phenomenon of fast‐paced virus evolution [
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>]. The molecular epidemiological pattern, coupled with the overlapping modes of virus transmission, suggested that the control of HCV transmission has continued to be a global challenge [
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>]. In the Asia‐Pacific region, information on the genetic characteristics of sexually acquired HCV is notably lacking as compared to its Western counterparts [
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>]. Moreover, the situation of overlapping risk and extent of HCV transmission network is yet to be systematically evaluated in this region. Against these backgrounds, this review was conducted for enhancing the understanding of molecular epidemiology of sexually acquired HCV infection in the Asia‐Pacific region to inform effective public health responses towards the elimination of the virus.
