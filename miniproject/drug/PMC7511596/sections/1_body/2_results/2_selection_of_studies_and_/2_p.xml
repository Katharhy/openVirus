<p>Overall, 275 original articles examining the molecular epidemiology of sexually acquired HCV in the Asia‐Pacific region were identified, 33 full‐text of which were reviewed. Detail of the search results is shown in the flowchart (Figure 
 <xref rid="jia225618-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In total, 13 articles published from 2010 to 2019 were included, comprising 12 cross‐sectional studies and one cohort study [

The studies, all of which recruiting participants in the period of 1994 to 2016, originated from nine countries/cities, namely Australia, New Zealand, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Pakistan and Taiwan. Of 3211 HCV‐viraemic subjects in these 13 studies, 549 samples came from individuals who acquired HCV through sexual contact (including 18 through injection drug use in the presence of male‐to‐male sex), with detectable subtype identified. Of these subjects, at least 75.8% were HIV‐positive (Table
