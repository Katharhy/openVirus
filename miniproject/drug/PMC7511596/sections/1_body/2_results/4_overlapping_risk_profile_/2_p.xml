In these studies, the pattern of association between reported sexual risk and injection behaviours with HCV transmission differed among the places. Overlapping risk profile was shown in four out of nine countries/cities, whereas shared transmission networks between the two risk groups were phylogenetically confirmed only in the Australian‚ÄêNew Zealand [
