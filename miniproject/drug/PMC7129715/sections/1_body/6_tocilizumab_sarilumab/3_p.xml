<p id="p0040">The acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by coronavirus infection is associated with the over-exuberant release of cytokines (a ‘cytokine storm’). In SARS and MERS patients, peak viral load precedes maximum IL-6 release and subsequent radiographically severe pneumonia [

Sarilumab an inhibitor of soluble and membrane IL-6Rα receptors may reduce the severity of the pulmonary complications of COVID-19, including respiratory failure, but there is no evidence that it has anti-viral potential.
