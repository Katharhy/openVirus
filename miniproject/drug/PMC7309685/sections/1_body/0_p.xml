<p id="Par2">In 1998, the historian of science and medicine J. Andrew Mendelsohn posed a deceptively simple question. “Where,” he asked, “did the modern, ecological understanding of epidemic disease come from?” Helpfully, Mendelsohn provided an answer. Arguing that it was difficult to see how “the fledgling ideas and methods of upstart population ecology, or the premises of parasitology could have conquered bacteriology,” he suggested these perspectives were 
 <italic>already present</italic> in medical microbiology at its inception but re-emerged more strongly in the interwar and post-war period, often from within the very institutions most closely associated with germ theory and the reductionist pursuit of vaccines and chemotherapeutic drugs (Mendelsohn 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>, pp. 303–304). In particular, Mendelsohn chided the Australian immunologist and Nobel Prize winner Frank Macfarlane Burnet for having “left out half the story” when in 1940 he had claimed in 
 <italic>Biological Aspects of Infectious Disease</italic> that the new “ecological point of view” had been due to the ascendance of other scientists over “bacteriologists who had been trained as medical men” (Burnet 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1940</xref>, pp. 2–3).
