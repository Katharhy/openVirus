<p id="Par16">Our study also provides much needed historical context for current policy debates around “emerging infectious diseases”. This concept is closely associated with a 1992 report by the Institute of Medicine and the molecular biologist Joshua Lederberg. A former student of Dubos, Lederberg drew on ecological insights associated with Dubos’s and Burnet’s writings in proposing his own view of a natural history of disease (see Méthot and Fantini 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2014</xref>). However, while Dubos’ and Burnet’s ideas exerted a huge influence over Lederberg and other medical researchers who came of age in the 1950s and 1960s, we do not know precisely how these ideas found their way into epidemiology and public health teaching. Nor can we say precisely what became of these ideas in the 1970s and 1980s—periods marked by the Legionnaires’ Disease and swine flu outbreaks, and the advent of HIV/AIDs—much less why the EID concept took precisely the form it did in the early 1990s (but see Weir and Mykhalovskiy 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2010</xref>). To answer this question, and provide a more comprehensive understanding of why it is that modern practices of disease control and preventive medicine are crafted in the way they are, more work needs to be done to fill in developments in the period from 1970 to 1990.
