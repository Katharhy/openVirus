<p id="Par6">In the summer of 2016 we invited a diverse group of scholars to re-interrogate Mendelsohn’s question at a workshop at Queen Mary, University London.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> Most of us were historians of science, medicine and technology, but with a view to opening up interdisciplinary perspectives the group also included anthropologists, biologists, and epidemiologists specializing in emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). As the latter reminded us, in recent years a succession of epidemics of SARS, Ebola, and Zika, has driven home the importance of ecological perspectives in pandemic planning. Yet, while it is now widely recognised that the disturbance of natural habitats can result in zoonotic pathogens being dislodged from their ecological niches and infecting human populations, we still lack a comprehensive account of when and how disease ecology entered the medical mainstream. If anything, the need for such an account has become even more urgent following the emergence in December 2019 of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the pandemic of COVID-19 that followed. Although at time of writing the source of SARS-CoV-2 has not been established, the fact that it shares 96% of its genes with a coronavirus previously isolated from wild bats, and that the earliest human cases occurred in or a near a wild animal market in Wuhan, in central China, points strongly to the pandemic’s zoonotic origins and that the world should be prepared for further pandemics triggered by “spillover” events. As three of the leading experts on zoonoses and pandemics put it in a paper in the 
 <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic>, “We have created a global, human-dominated ecosystem that serves as a playground for the emergence and host-switching of animal viruses” (Morens et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2020</xref>, p. 1293). Back in 2007, in the aftermath of the SARS epidemic, a research team from the University of Hong Kong warned the scientific community that “the presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic animal in Southern China, is a time bomb” (Cheng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2007</xref>, p. 683). Sadly, that call was not taken sufficiently seriously. We can only hope that the present pandemic of COVID-19 has finally put to rest Macfarlane Burnet’s and David O. White’s complacent and dangerous assumption that “the most likely forecast about the future of infectious disease is that it will be very dull” (Burnet and White 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1972</xref>, p. 263).
