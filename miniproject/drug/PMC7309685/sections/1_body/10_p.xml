<p id="Par13">These ecological perspectives had particular appeal to microbiologists working in tropical or settler environments—hence Burnet’s “ecological point of view”—but for many years lacked a unifying term. Instead they found expression in the language of “host–parasite interactions,” “equilibrium states”, “immune balance”, “latent infections” and changes in virulence and pathogenicity. To complicate the picture, throughout the period when these ideas were making inroads into microbiology, the laboratory continued to be the place where scientific breakthroughs and the reputations of medical researchers were made. It was the era of “microbe hunting” and the search for specific chemotherapeutic agents—one in which medical scientists cultivated an image as slayers of germs and held out the promise that medicine would triumph over the microbes of infectious disease and bring an eventual end to epidemics. Yet as Christoph Gradmann argues, this approach entailed a rather static view of microbes, or one in which evolution of resistance to antibiotics occurred over long Darwinian time periods, although by the 1960s ecological perspectives were also making inroads into infection medicine as hospitals became “hothouses” for drug-resistant microbes (Gradmann
