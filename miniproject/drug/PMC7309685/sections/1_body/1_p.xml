 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2019</xref>)—an outbreak that according to Mendelsohn had posed “complex” new challenges for public health—Mendelsohn’s answer struck many as persuasive at the time, but in the two decades since it has become clear that his answer was incomplete. In his pioneering essay on the “natural histories of disease,” the historian of medicine Warwick Anderson offered a partial riposte to Mendelsohn by showing how Burnet’s ideas had been fashioned by his interactions with animal ecologists in the 1920s and 1930s, and the disease challenges that confronted microbiologists working in colonial and postcolonial settler societies (

Nevertheless, it remains to be explained how scientists came to postulate an “evolutionary time scale” and to develop “integrative models” in place of a more static view of the relation between environment, health, and disease, to use Anderson’s words (
