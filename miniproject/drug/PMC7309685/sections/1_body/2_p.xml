 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>). Furthermore, local scientific traditions and research styles differ from one context to another, but scholarship on the history of disease ecology has mostly concentrated on dominion science and especially on American, Australian, and British contexts, even though similar concepts flourished elsewhere, for instance in Russia, as the study by Susan Jones and Anna Amramina in this collection demonstrates (Jones and Amramina

Last but not least, in writing the first draft of the natural history of disease, prominent scientists like Macfarlane Burnet and Joshua Lederberg have selectively identified prestigious forerunners of their ecological ideas and suggested key influences on their work, while leaving out other potentially important sources and antecedents (Anderson
