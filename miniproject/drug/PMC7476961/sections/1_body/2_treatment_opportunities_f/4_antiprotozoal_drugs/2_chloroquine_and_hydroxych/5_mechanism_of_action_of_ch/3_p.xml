<p id="p0170">Chloroquine indirectly interferes with the interaction between the SARS-CoV-1 spike proteins and ACE-2 receptors. Interactions between the glycosylated form of ACE-2 receptor and SARS-CoV-1 S protein is necessary for the viral entry into the cell. Chloroquine impairs the Golgi mediated 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminal glycosylation of ACE-2, which results in decreased affinity to SARS-CoV-1 S proteins. Hence weak interaction ensues, and the viral entry is prevented
