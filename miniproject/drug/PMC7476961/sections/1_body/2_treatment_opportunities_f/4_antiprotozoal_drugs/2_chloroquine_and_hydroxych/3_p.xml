Firstly, the presence of an extra hydroxyl group makes it more hydrophilic and hence faster clearance lessening the risk of retinal toxicity than chloroquine. Secondly, hydroxychloroquine is a safer option than chloroquine with respect to therapeutic window and safety margins. Thirdly, owing to its proven immunomodulatory properties, hydroxychloroquine can act as an ideal treatment intervention in severely ill cases where cytokine storm is a significant issue to deal with COVID-19
