<p id="p0105">Remdesivir, a prodrug of adenosine analog GS-441524 (
 <xref rid="f0090" ref-type="fig">Fig. 18</xref> )
 <bold>,</bold> is an investigational antiviral molecule that was developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of the Ebola virus 
 <xref rid="b0425" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>. Remdesivir is in the frontline in ongoing clinical trials for COVID-19. Remdesivir is a direct-acting antiviral drug, which stops replication of SARS-CoV-2 in host-cells 
 <xref rid="b0430" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>. Remdesivir was also found to exhibit antiviral activity against other flavo viruses like Marburg virus, Pneumo viruses like respiratory syncytial virus, and paramyxoviruses like mumps, measles, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus 
 <xref rid="b0435" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>. A recent study reported prophylactic as well as the therapeutic potential of remdesivir in the rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV infection 
 <xref rid="b0440" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>. Remdesivir potently inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in human airway epithelial cell cultures with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.069 and 0.074 µM, respectively 
 <xref rid="b0445" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>. In addition, it was also effective against zoonotic coronaviruses 
 <xref rid="b0445" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0450" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>. Recently, remdesivir was shown to exhibit potent activity against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Remdesivir was effective in blocking the viral infection in Vero E6 cells infected with nCoV-2019BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.77 µM) 
 <xref rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Remdesivir was also shown to afford clinical benefits in rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 
 <xref rid="b0455" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>. The preliminary results of a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effectiveness of intravenous remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 was recently published. The study findings revealed that remdesivir was superior to placebo in reducing the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with COVID-19 with a median recovery time of 11 days as compared to 15 days for the placebo-treated group 
 <xref rid="b0460" ref-type="bibr">[92]</xref>. Recently, Gilead Sciences announced that a 5-day treatment course of remdesivir was associated with significantly greater clinical improvement in hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19 when compared with standard care in a Phase-3 clinical study, further demonstrating the importance of remdesivir in the battle against COVID-19 
 <xref rid="b0465" ref-type="bibr">[93]</xref>. The adverse effects that have been reported due to remdesivir administration include hypersensitivity- infusion-related and anaphylaxis and elevation in liver transaminases 
 <xref rid="b0470" ref-type="bibr">[94]</xref>. In the USA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted remdesivir an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the management of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19.
