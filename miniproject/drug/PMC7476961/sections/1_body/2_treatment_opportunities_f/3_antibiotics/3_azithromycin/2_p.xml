<p id="p0140">Azithromycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is used for the management of several bacterial infections (
 <xref rid="f0100" ref-type="fig">Fig. 20</xref> ). A recently conducted clinical trial highlighted the importance of azithromycin for the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
 <xref rid="b0585" ref-type="bibr">[117]</xref>. A total of 36 patients were enrolled for the study, out of which 20 patients received chloroquine, and 16 patients served as control. Among the chloroquine treated patients, six patients received azithromycin as a precautionary measure against bacterial superinfection. At the end of day 6, 100% of the patients treated with chloroquine and azithromycin were cured off the virus while only 57.1% of the patients were cured who received chloroquine alone (negative PCR results). These outcomes should be further dwelled on to consider azithromycin as viable adjuvant therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fascinatingly, azithromycin has been reported to be active against other RNA viruses like Ebola and Zika virus
