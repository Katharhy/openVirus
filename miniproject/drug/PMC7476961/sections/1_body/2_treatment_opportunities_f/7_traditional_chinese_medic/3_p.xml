<p id="p0205">Ni et al. reported the treatment of 3 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan with Shuanghuanglian oral liquid (SHL). SHL is a patented TCM that is used for the treatment of cough, cold, and fever. The symptoms of all three patients improved after the consumption of SHL, and the patients finally recovered without any side effects
