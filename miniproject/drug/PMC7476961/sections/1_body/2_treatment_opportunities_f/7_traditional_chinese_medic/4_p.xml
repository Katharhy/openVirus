<p id="p0210">Chen et al. identified five natural compounds- baicalin, hesperetin, scutellarin, nicotianamine, and glycyrrhizin that could potently bind to ACE-2 by molecular docking studies 
 <xref rid="b0790" ref-type="bibr">[158]</xref>. Incidentally, glycyrrhizin (
 <xref rid="f0115" ref-type="fig">Fig. 23</xref> ), a triterpene saponin found in liqourice roots, has been previously reported to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV 
 <xref rid="b0795" ref-type="bibr">[159]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0800" ref-type="bibr">[160]</xref>. A derivative of glycyrrhizin with 2-acetamido-Î²-d-glucopyranosyl amine into the glycoside chain showed 10-fold increased activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> against SARS-CoV. An amine derivative of glycyrrhizin and the conjugates of glycyrrhizin with two amino acid residues and a free 30-COOH function showed 70-fold increased activity against SARS-CoV. However, these modifications also increased cytotoxicity 
 <xref rid="b0805" ref-type="bibr">[161]</xref>. Since the safety and toxicity profiles of glycyrrhizin are well established, further studies are needed to establish the efficacy of glycyrrhizin against SARS-CoV-2.
