 <xref rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Scientists from Research Center for Asian Infectious Diseases of the Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, have disclosed that nafamostat prevents the entry of novel SARS-CoV-2 by potently binding to the transmembrane protease TMPRSS2. Nafamostat was able to achieve the fusion inhibition at less than one-tenth of the concentration required by camostat 
 <xref rid="b0710" ref-type="bibr">[142]</xref>. Nafamostat can also be repurposed for therapeutic utility against COVID-19.
