<p id="p0090">Dai et al. reported the synthesis and evaluation of two peptidomimetic aldehydes targeting the M
 <sup>pro</sup> of SARS-CoV-2 
 <xref rid="b0375" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. The two peptidomimetic aldehydes 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold> potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.053 µM and 0.040 µM, respectively (
 <xref rid="f0075" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15</xref> ). The crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with both the inhibitors were resolved and were found to bind with the substrate-binding site of the protein and showed vital interactions with the active site residues. Compounds 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold> were also shown to possess potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.42 and 0.33 µM, respectively. Furthermore, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies were conducted to substantiate these compounds as promising candidates for COVID-19. Both the compounds exhibited good pharmacokinetic properties, and compound 
 <bold>5</bold> exhibited low toxicity 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>.
