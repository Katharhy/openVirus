<p id="p0095">Fintelman-Rodrigues and co-workers shed light on the promising potential of atazanavir and atazanavir/ritonavir combination for the treatment of COVID-19 
 <xref rid="b0380" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. Through a combination of molecular docking and molecular dynamics, atazanavir was shown to bind to the active site of SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup>. It was also shown to inhibit the enzyme through zymographic studies. Atazanavir and atazanavir/ritonavir combination were evaluated for their inhibitory potential against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells and human epithelial pulmonary cell lines (A549). The solo treatment, as well as the combination treatments, was found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in both the cell lines potently. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of atazanavir and atazanavir/ritonavir combination against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells and A549 cells are shown in 
 <xref rid="f0080" ref-type="fig">Fig. 16</xref> . Furthermore, atazanavir and atazanavir/ritonavir also prevented pro-inflammatory cytokine production in monocytes infected with SARS-CoV-2, as confirmed by the low levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6).
