<p id="p0070">Cathepsins are cysteine proteases that play a crucial role in protein catabolism in the endosomes and lysosomes. The ubiquitously expressed cathepsin L plays a fundamental part in the entry of the SARS-CoV into the host cells 
 <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Once the virus enters the endosomes after binding onto the ACE-2 receptor, the spike proteins of SARS-CoV are activated by the pH-dependent cathepsin L, which results in the fusion of virus and endosomal membranes releasing the genetic material of virus into the cytoplasm 
 <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. SID 26681509, Z-Phe-Tyr(
 <italic>t</italic>-Bu)-diazomethylketone, and E-64-d are some of the well-known cathepsin L inhibitors (

 <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. It was also shown to inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses 
 <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Ou et al. demonstrated that cathepsin L is specifically required for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirus into 293/hACE2 cells. Broad-spectrum cathepsin inhibitor, E-64-d, reduced the SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirus entry by 92.5% and cathepsin L inhibitor, SID 26681509, reduced the entry by about 76% while cathepsin B inhibitor, (CA-074), had no significant effect on the virus entry 
 <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Taken together, the priming of spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on cathepsin L in the endosomes, making it an attractive therapeutic target for further exploration.
