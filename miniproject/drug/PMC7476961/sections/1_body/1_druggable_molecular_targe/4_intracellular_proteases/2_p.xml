<p id="p0065">After the virus enters into the host cells, some of the critical processes regarding endosomal proliferation and assembly of viral proteins require the processing of these proteins through intracellular proteases. These processes are essential for the proliferation of the virus. Disruption of these process through target protease inhibitors breaks the cyclic of virus proliferation and have been suggested as the antiviral drug targets.</p>
