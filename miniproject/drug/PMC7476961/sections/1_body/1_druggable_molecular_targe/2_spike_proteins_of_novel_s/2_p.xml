<p id="p0030">The entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends upon the binding of its spike protein to the cell surface receptor. The spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are 1273 amino acids long and structurally consists of two domains- the 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminal S1 domain for binding to the cellular receptor and C-terminal S2 domain for fusion with the cell membrane 
 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The S1 subunit (aa 14-685) encompasses an 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminal domain (aa 14-305) and a receptor-binding domain (RBD) (aa 319-541) 
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The RBD consists of core and external sub-domains responsible for forming trimer particle and for interaction with the receptor, respectively 
 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The S2 sub-domain encompasses Heptad repeat 1 (HR1), Heptad repeat 2 (HR2), Fusion peptide (FP), and transmembrane domain. After binding of the S1 domain of spike protein to the host receptor, conformational changes take place in the S2 domain. The heptad repeat domains, HR1 and HR2, interact with themselves to form a six-helix bundle fusion core bringing about the close association of cellular and viral membranes for fusion 
 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Xia et al. designed novel peptides based on the HR1 and HR2 domains as fusion inhibitors 
 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> similar to the approach that was undertaken against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The two peptides designed were designated as 2019-nCoV-HR1P and 2019-nCoV-HR2P. 2019-nCoV-HR2P was shown to potently inhibit fusion in 2019-nCoV spike mediated cell-cell fusion assay with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) value of 0.18 µM. EK1, reported previously as a pan CoV fusion inhibitor targeting the HR1 domain 
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, also showed potent fusion inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.19 µM). Furthermore, 2019-nCoV-HR2P and EK1 were also found to effectively inhibit 2019-nCoV pseudovirus infection in 293 T cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.98 µM and 2.38 µM, respectively (
