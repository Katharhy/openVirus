<p id="p0035">Following the initial findings, Xia et al. and others designed a series of derivatives based on EK-1 
 <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. EK-1 was covalently linked with cholesterol (designated as EK1C) and palmitic (designated as EK1P) at their C-terminus end with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Both the peptides exhibited potent fusion inhibition in SARS-CoV-2 mediated cell-cell fusion (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 48.1 and 69.2 nM for EK1C and EK1P, respectively). Based on the inhibitory potential of EK1C, further derivatives were designed with glycine / serine-based linkers (GSG) and PEG-based spacers. The peptides were designated as EK1C1-EK1C7 (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). The presence of the linker/spacer and length of the spacer influenced the activity, especially increased the activity of these lipopeptides. The most potent lipopeptide, EK1C4, contained the optimal five residues linker/spacer GSGSG-PGE4. EK1C4 also exhibited potent activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection and live SARS-CoV-2 infection 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 15.8 nM and 36.5 nM, respectively. Furthermore, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies were conducted to evaluate the prophylactic and post-infection potential of EK1C4 on the HCoV-OC43 infection mouse model. The studies revealed that EK1C4 was effective prophylactically up to 12 h before challenging with the infection at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg intranasally, suggesting good stability and half-life of the peptide. EK1C4 also afforded protection to mice when administered at 0.5 h post-infection 
 <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Considering these results together, EK1C4 has all the potential to be a drug candidate for treating COVID-19.
