<p id="p0225">The long-term goals for management of COVID-19 should be directed against the development of novel inhibitors aimed at any of the druggable targets discussed in this review. The starting point of such a journey would be to modify the agents that have been shown to be promising against other coronaviruses like SARS-CoV, as demonstrated by Xia et al. and Zhang et al. in their respective studies 
 <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0340" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be an attractive target for the discovery and development of novel drug candidates because of its importance in virus replication and the fact that its active site is highly conserved among coronaviruses. Peptidomimetics targeting the entry of the virus and small peptide molecules targeting M
 <sup>pro</sup> have shown the potential to combat SARS-CoV-2. However, questions regarding their stability inside the body, selectivity against the target protease, and their delivery to the target site should be addressed. Structures and functions of RdRp have been extensively investigated for RNA viruses. Considerable efforts have also been made, and several lead compounds have been identified targeting specific RdRp functions through extensive structure-activity-relationship studies. A few of them have been advanced to the clinical use and are clinical evaluation. Current repertoire of lead RdRp inhibitors offer unparalleled starting point for optimization of their efficacy against SARS CoV-2. The inhibitors of RdRp may have low propensity to development of resistance, due to requirement of high fidelity for CoV RdRp functions.
