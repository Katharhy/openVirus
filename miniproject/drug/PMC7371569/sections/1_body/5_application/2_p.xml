<p>Data have been used in the preparation of weekly situation reports for submission to the Regional Critical Care Medicines Acute Surge Workstream for onward reporting. The situation reports include red, amber or green (RAG) ratings according to the number of stock days of both individual product lines and the therapeutic group as a whole, currently and for a projected surge. For the example shown in 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>, green indicates that there is adequate stock within the therapeutic group to fully meet the needs of critical care for more than 14 days, even though individual product lines within the group may be amber (7â€“14 stock days) or red (less than 7 stock days).
