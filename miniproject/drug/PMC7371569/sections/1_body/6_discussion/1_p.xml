<p>COVID-19 is an emerging pandemic and widespread and unprecedented efforts to optimise patient care are ongoing and are being delivered at pace. The process developed to estimate critical care drug requirements represents a robust and agile starting point in the journey to inform regional procurement planning and preparedness in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that this is a new virus, the existing evidence base to inform and predict critical care drug requirements is limited. Other than the unpublished tool developed in response to the H1N1 swine influenza pandemic in 2009, updated for COVID-19 (Borthwick, Barton and Graham-Clarke, 2020), the authors are not aware of any other published tools to estimate critical care drug requirements to inform procurement planning and preparedness in a pandemic. The process developed will evolve and be refined based on real-world data as they become available. Measures are currently being introduced to gather further real-world data. The current model assumptions were formulated to reflect the initial surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in NI. However the evolving course of the pandemic will be monitored and the assumptions can be adapted, as necessary, to reflect changing requirements.</p>
