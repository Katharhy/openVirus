Understanding immune evasion strategies of SARS-CoV2 and the resulting delayed but massive immune response and ARDS should no doubt result in the identification of disease biomarkers that predict outcomes as well as phenotype and disease stage specific treatments that will likely include both antiviral and immune modulating agents. However, it is unlikely that the above mentioned biomarkers can be used to guide treatments as the development of treatments needs to be massively accelerated to reduce the mortality rate associated with COVD-19. Another important strategy is closer co-operation between the medical, veterinary, and animal health disciplines.
