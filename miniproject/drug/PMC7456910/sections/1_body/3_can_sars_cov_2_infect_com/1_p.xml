<p>There has been a great deal of interest in the press about companion and zoo animals serving as reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2. It has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can infect cats but not dogs (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Cats may be infected with SARS CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and spread it to other cats, but according to researchers in China, dogs are not susceptible to the infection. The team at Harbin Veterinary Research Institute in China has proposed that chickens, pigs, and ducks are not likely to catch the virus. However, since COVID-19 is an emerging and rapidly evolving pandemic with the potential to use animals as reservoir hosts. There are quite a few recent reports

 </xref> about SARS-CoV-2 infections in mink and ferrets and linked cases of COVID-19 in humans at Dutch fur farms (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). This remind us of previous outbreaks of avian influenza virus H9N2 infections in farmed mink (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Beyond mink and ferrets, we simply do not know much more at this stage. However, transmission from humans to dogs, domestic cats, tigers, and lions has indeed occurred. Furthermore, pigs, cats, ferrets (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), and primates have been identified as good candidates for susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). It is important to point out that SARS-CoV-2 is not originally a human virus. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to Î²-coronavirus family and the sequencing studies carried out so far suggest that the virus in humans is identical to the horseshoe bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural, and reservoir host (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The SARS-CoV-2 genome is closest to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses from horseshoe bats, and its receptor-binding domain is closest to that of pangolin coronaviruses (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). However, it has been proposed that the recent outbreak of COVID-19, did not come directly from pangolins (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Recent studies also suggested that 
 <italic>Bovidae</italic> and 
 <italic>Cricetidae</italic> should be included in the screening of intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 and could be unexplored reservoir hosts (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The current gaps in knowledge highlight the need for field studies in the same geographical regions where the SARS-CoV-2 emerged, to look for intermediate hosts and to establish if there are any animal species that we have missed.
