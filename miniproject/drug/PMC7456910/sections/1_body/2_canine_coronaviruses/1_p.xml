<p>It is important to note that canine respiratory coronaviruses are not the same as the SARS CoV-2 responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic in the human population. Dogs have had to co-evolve with their own respiratory and enteric coronaviruses. The Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses is the group responsible for developing the classification of viruses and taxon nomenclature of the family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>. This group has recently assessed the placement of the human pathogen, tentatively named 2019-nCoV, within the Coronaviridae, providing an updated classification of the phylogeny and taxonomy of coronaviruses (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) is a coronavirus of dogs, which is widespread in North America, Japan, and across Europe (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). CRCoV was detected in dogs more than 14 years ago (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). It has been associated with respiratory disease, particularly in kennel dog populations (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The virus is highly pathogenic, causing severe lesions (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). It is genetically and antigenically distinct from enteric canine coronaviruses (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), a finding which has stimulated further epidemiological research, serological surveys, and the development of new diagnostic tests. It is not clear, at this stage, if prior human exposure to CRCoV can afford any protection against later exposure to SARS CoV-2. Further research studies are required to determine if humans that co-exist with canine companions that have previously been exposed to CRCoV might develop a stronger immunity to SARS CoV-2 to those who have not had this exposure. This is purely speculative and requires further exploration.
