<p>Coronaviruses are a diverse group of viral pathogens. Although some of them are potentially dangerous zoonotic pathogens, many are not pathogenic. These viruses possess rapidly evolving genomes and are finding new hosts (

We have been completely unprepared for these epidemics. One of these was the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. We were totally unprepared for the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, there were scientific papers published more than 10 years ago that predicted the emergence of such an airborne coronavirus. Nevertheless, we ignored the classic literature and we did this at our peril. A review article published in 2007, 13 years before the current COVID-19 crisis predicted this pandemic (

Instead, they had great insight and predicted that the coronavirus would, 1 day, pose a global threat. They wrote: “The presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is a time bomb.”
