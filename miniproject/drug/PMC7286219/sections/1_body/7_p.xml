Four SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been approved for phase I or II clinical trial in China at the end of April of 2020. Several biotechnology companies have announced the development of mRNA vaccines against this mated coronavirus. In early January 2020, Stermirna Therapeutics, cooperating with Shanghai East Hospital of Tongji University, proclaimed that no more than 40 days will be needed to produce vaccine samples based on the new generation of mRNA technology and some preliminary procedures. The samples would be sent for tests and be brought to clinics as soon as possible (Xinhua net

On February 14, Zhuhai Lifanda Biotechnology announced that an antibody against antigen encoded by mRNA was detected in mouse serum at day 12 after the mice had been immunized. Data on rhesus macaques immunized with mRNA vaccine candidates would be obtained soon. The mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 would go into clinical testing within 2–3 months. A GMP factory would be put into use in April, 2020 (cnBeta
