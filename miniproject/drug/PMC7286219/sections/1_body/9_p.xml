<p id="Par10">During the development of SARS-CoV and MRES-CoV vaccines, some groups found that enhanced lung inflammation following homologous challenge in mice and nonhuman primates was mediated by S specific IgG (Liu

 <italic> et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>). ADE modulates the immune response and can elicit sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm, one or all of which have been documented in severe cases and deaths. ADE also requires prior exposure to similar antigenic epitopes. Currently, immunologists are worrying that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines based on S protein maybe induce ADE, which will blur the adaptation in the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, in a recent paper, Qin
 <italic> et al</italic>. reported inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was safe in nonhuman primate and has not induced ADE in macaques (Gao
 <italic> et al</italic>.
