<p id="Par11">As a novel vaccine platform, mRNA vaccine technology is not mature to be used in immune prophylaxis and therapy. It still needs improvement and has uncertainty in the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine development. The mechanisms of immunity induction of mRNA vaccine 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> are under elucidation. Published results showed mRNA vaccines stimulated potent immune response, but in human, the immune response is not strong enough with low dose of antibodies (Pardi
 <italic> et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2018b</xref>). The delivery tool and administration route determine the dimension of immune response by mRNA vaccine (Pardi
