<p id="Par9">Like other coranaviruses, S protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays an essential role in binding to receptors on the host cell to initiate an infection and determines host tropism. It is also the major target of neutralizing antibodies and it may be the main antigen of development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines by most related groups. According to the public information, S protein or receptor binding domain (RBD) sites are main antigens edcoded by SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates. However, due to the limited information and patent protection on the adaptation of antigens of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in development, the antigen information of most SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates are unclear. The expected immune response, such as antibody or T cell mediated immune response, stimulated by these SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in development are not clear either. Thus accordingly, the protection against SARS-CoV-2 can not to be predicted.</p>
