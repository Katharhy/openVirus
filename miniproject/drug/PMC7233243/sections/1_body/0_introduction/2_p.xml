<p id="p0010">Viruses, the most abundant organisms on our planet, affect all living beings, including animals, plants, parasites, fungi and bacteria. Their subtle ability to develop strategies to evade the host immune system, along with the high mutation and replication rates, has made viruses plague terrestrial ecosystems since their appearance. Indeed, virus-borne infectious diseases tend to spread abruptly over wide geographical areas, leading to outbreaks that can dramatically affect health, national economies, and the overall well-being of societies.

 </xref> In the past few decades, pharmaceutical and biotechnological advance has succeeded in developing new therapeutics for the management of different viral diseases: for example, anti-retroviral therapy against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or the pan-genotypic direct-acting antiviral drugs used for hepatitis C (HCV) management. Nevertheless, the majority of current therapies are unable to accomplish virus eradication or sustained virological response, therefore the battle against viral pathogens still represents a primary focus of medical research. In addition, the constant onset of new viral pathogens, generally correlated with massive outbreaks, imperils researchers to determine the pathogenic mechanisms of the new viruses, with the ultimate goal to provide new therapeutic approaches in the antiviral field.
