<p id="p0030">G-quadruplexes (G4s) have been identified in viruses belonging to almost all groups of the Baltimore classification. Indeed, in the past few years, research on the biological role of G4s in virology has boomed, providing strong evidence of the relationship between G4s and the regulation of key viral steps. A recent comprehensive bioinformatics analysis traced putative G4-forming sequences (PQSs) in all human viruses, showing that their distribution is statistically relevant, making them a distinctive feature of the different virus families. In addition, such PQSs are highly conserved, despite the high recombination rates that characterize viruses, suggesting a crucial role for G4s in viral evolution and replication, and corroborating their targeting as a valid pharmacological approach for antiviral therapy.
