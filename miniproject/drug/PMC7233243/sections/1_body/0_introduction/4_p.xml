<p id="p0020">In order to replicate, viruses induce the host cell to synthesize all the essential components necessary to form new virus particles. As a consequence, new virions are assembled in the cell and egress from it to infect other cells, completing their replicative life cycle (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). Some viruses do not always actively replicate while within the host but remain dormant in defined cell types by integrating their genome into the host DNA, or through formation of circular viral genome molecules (episomes). This process is termed viral latency: through it the virus can evade the host immune system, usually establishing a lifelong infection.
