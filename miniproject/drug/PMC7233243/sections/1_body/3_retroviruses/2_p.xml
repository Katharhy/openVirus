<p id="p0180">Retroviruses are the most ancient discovered viruses: they are able to infect almost all vertebrates worldwide, causing severe diseases, such as immunodeficiencies, neurological disorders, and cancer. Retroviruses are classified into two subfamilies: 
 <italic>Orthoretrovirinae</italic>, including alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-, epsilon-retroviruses and lentiviruses; 
 <italic>Spumavirinae</italic>, represented by the genus spumavirus. They possess two copies of (+)-ssRNA genome, formed by four coding genes, 
 <italic>gag</italic>, 
 <italic>pro</italic>, 
 <italic>pol</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic>, several genes encoding for accessory proteins and two flanking repeat segments followed by untranslated regions. The 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene encodes for the reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme, the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase that allows synthesis of viral DNA from the genomic RNA. The newly formed dsDNA, which presents two identical long terminal repeats (LTRs) at both ends, once integrated into the host's chromosomal DNA forms the provirus. The provirus is transcribed and translated to form new virions, or it may remain dormant, i.e., latent: in both cases, it can be no longer eliminated from the host. The LTR located at the 5â€²-end represents the control center for viral gene expression. It is organized in three sections, U3, R, and U5. The U3 region includes binding sites for transcription factors and acts as the unique promoter for retroviral transcription.
