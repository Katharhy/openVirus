<p id="p0185">Interestingly, highly conserved PQSs have been found in the majority of retrovirus subfamilies, mainly located in the LTRs. Biophysics assays have demonstrated the actual ability of these sequences to fold into G4s, which were strongly stabilized by G4 ligands, such as BRACO-19 and a core-extended NDI, supporting the possibility of targeting the LTR G4s as innovative antiretroviral therapy.
