<p id="p0225">Further investigation on G4s in the HIV-1 integrated genome have identified three PQSs in the 
 <italic>nef</italic> gene. This encodes for the viral accessory protein Nef, a factor involved in the maintenance of a persistent HIV infection 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. The 
 <italic>nef</italic> gene is located at the 3′-end of the viral genome, with its coding region that partially overlaps with the 3′-LTR. The observed PQSs were highly conserved and able to fold into two-tetrads G4s. Nef G4s were stabilized 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> by different G4 ligands, such as TMPyP4, BRACO-19 and PIPER. Interestingly, employment of TMPyP4 in the TZM-bl reporter cell line, which supports Nef-dependent HIV-1 replication, resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of viral infectivity.

 </xref> Altogether, these data support the possibility of exploiting viral G4s as novel anti-HIV-1 targets, possibly in both the lytic and latent infection.
