<p id="p0210">The HIV-1 genome, as mentioned above, consists in two copies of positive, single-stranded RNA that, once synthesized, dimerize in order to be encapsulated into the new virion: this step is critical for viral recombination (

 </xref> Both RNA regions are associated with dimerization and primer-strand transfer during reverse transcription, events that promote recombination. Collected data infer that the G4s in this region might be involved in the regulation of the aforementioned processes, making RNA G4s fundamental for the virus.
