<p id="p0215">At the 5â€²-UTR, specifically in the U3 segment, a highly G-rich sequence, overlapping with three Sp1 binding sites, has been found to fold into multiple G4s. These structures provide a contact point for dimerization between the two RNA strands, contributing to viral recombination.
 <xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>65</sup>
 </xref> In detail, three G4s have been identified, U3-II, U3-III and U3-IV, which showed remarkable stability and were well recognized by the G4 ligand BRACO-19, which was able to stall RT progression 
 <italic>in vitro,</italic> therefore impairing viral DNA synthesis and thus viral production.

 </xref> The nucleocapsid protein (NCp7), a viral protein that assists RT by unwinding HIV-1 RNA genome secondary structures in order to promote polymerase progression, could counteract such mechanism. NCp7 is known to preferentially bind single-stranded nucleic acids compared to duplex states, and works as a chaperone, as it promotes folding of nucleic acids in their most thermodynamically stable conformations.
 <xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>67</sup>
 </xref> It was recently demonstrated that NCp7 contributes to RT processivity by recognition and subsequent unfolding of HIV-1 RNA G4s.
 <xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>68</sup>
 </xref> NCp7 has also been reported to interact 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> with a G4 sequence located in the HIV-1 central DNA flap overlapping positive-strand, which forms a tetramolecular G4.
 <xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>69</sup>
 </xref> The G4s in this region might be involved in the protection of the pre-integrated genome from nuclease degradation. However, the biological outcome of the G4-NCp7 interaction still needs to be elucidated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>.
