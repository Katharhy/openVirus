<p id="p0230">Indeed, one of the most appealing and interesting aspects about G4s in HIV-1 is their possible involvement in the regulation of viral latency. The virus establishes a state of latent infection in T cells: at this stage, it is not susceptible to antiretroviral drugs. The molecular mechanisms underlying this process are complex and not completely understood; nonetheless some forms of latency entail transcriptional interference, thus the 5â€²-LTR and its G4s might be involved.

 </xref> G4 stabilizing agents have been tested in cells infected with latent HIV-1, where they showed strong antiviral activity, effectively linking G4s to HIV-1 latency. BRACO-19 in latently infected cells reduced viral titer to undetectable levels, an effect that was still observed after long-term treatment. TMPyP4 administration also blocked viral replication in two lymphocyte T cell lines with established HIV-1 latency. The antiviral activity was found to be coupled with higher apoptosis/death rates, with respect to untreated cells and the effect was enhanced upon association with DNA damage repair inhibitors.
