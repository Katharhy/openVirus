<p id="p0220">Regarding the provirus, the LTR U3 promoter sequence is highly enriched in guanines, especially at the Sp1 and NF-κB binding sites.

 </xref> In this region, three overlapping G4 structures can form: LTR-II and LTR-III that are constitutively formed, and LTR-IV, the folding of which is induced by proteins or ligands binding.
 <xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>71</sup>
 </xref> LTR-III and LTR-IV structures, which have been characterized through NMR spectroscopy, showed very peculiar features. LTR-III G4 folds into a hybrid, three-layered quadruplex, with a conserved duplex stem-loop in the central loop.
 <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>72</sup>
 </xref> LTR-IV G4 has a parallel topology with a bulged G-tract at its 3′-end.
 <xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>73</sup>
 </xref> Such distinctive structures could be exploited to design specific ligands able to selectively target HIV-1 LTR G4s, overcoming the low selectivity that characterizes currently available G4 ligands. The two LTR G4s are mutually exclusive and induce opposite effects on the LTR promoter activity. LTR-III G4 stabilization inhibits viral transcription,

 </xref> while LTR-IV G4 hampers this activity.
 <xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>73</sup>
 </xref> The folding/unfolding of this region is controlled by at least two cellular proteins: nucleolin, which greatly stabilizes the LTR G4s, with a consequent overall silencing effect,
 <xref rid="bb0375" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>74</sup>
 </xref> and the human ribonucleoprotein A2B1, which in turn unwinds the G4s to promote transcription.
 <xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>75</sup>
 </xref> These data infer that the fine balance between G4s might be one of the regulatory mechanisms in the regulation of HIV-1 promoter activity. Moreover, it has been very recently shown that the LTR transcription machinery also involves another alternative structure, the i-motif,
 <xref rid="bb0385" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>76</sup>
 </xref> which can form in the provirus negative strand, further supporting the regulatory role of non-canonical nucleic acids structures in virus biology.

 </xref> Several G4 ligands have been tested to assess the effect on HIV-1 G4s on the viral promoter and promising stabilizing activity was observed, leading to an overall antiviral effect. BRACO-19 significantly stabilized the naturally occurring G4s, LTR-II and LTR-III, and induced folding of LTR-IV. Upon treatment with increasing compound concentrations, LTR promoter activity was reduced by almost 70% when compared to the untreated condition: a mutated non-G4 sequence used as control showed no variation in promoter response and thus confirmed the effect to be G4-related.
 <xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>71</sup>
 </xref> BRACO-19 was then tested in various cell lines, using different HIV-1 strains. It exerted promising G4-mediated antiviral activity, in the micromolar range. Considering that the G4 ligand also stabilizes HIV-1 RNA G4s, the antiviral effect could be ascribed to a dual mechanism of action, both at the pre- and the post-integration level.

 </xref> The development of a new series of core-extended NDI derivatives has significantly improved the anti-HIV-1 activity of the G4 ligands. In fact, these molecules, characterized by exceptional solubility properties, displayed outstanding 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> stabilizing activity on HIV-1 LTR G4s, with preference for the viral over the human telomeric G4s, used as a cellular reference. Most importantly, the series exhibited strong antiviral activity in the low nanomolar range (IC
 <sub>50</sub>  &lt; 25 nM). Time-related antiviral assays combined with reporter assays, have confirmed the G4-mediated mechanism of action.
