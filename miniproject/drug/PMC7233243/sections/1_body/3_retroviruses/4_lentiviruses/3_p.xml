<p id="p0195">Analysis of PQSs in these viruses has mainly focused on the promoter region, the 5′-LTR, revealing that almost all members of the family share the possibility to fold into G4s. The most intriguing result was the abundance of PQSs in relation to species: all lentiviruses affecting primates showed PQSs in their 5′-LTR. A lower percentage was observed in the bovine lentiviruses, while none, or very low, in the phylogenetically more distant species. These data suggest that the G4 structures are beneficial to the overall virus biology and have consequently been selected for throughout evolution. Furthermore, a strong correlation between G4s and the binding site for the transcription factors Sp1 and NF-κB was observed in almost all primate lentiviruses, corroborating the key role played by G4s in the regulation of viral transcription.
