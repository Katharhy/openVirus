<p id="p0130">RNA viruses constitute the major part of the global virome, occupying four out of seven of Baltimore's classes. They display the highest mutation rates, which often generate multiple complex mixtures of related virus variants, feature responsible for their adaptability to environment selection. The high number of mutations is generated by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that lacks proofreading activity.
