<p id="p0140">The 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family comprises a large number of (+)-ssRNA viruses, the genomes of which serve also as mRNA for viral protein translation. More specifically, the whole genome is translated into a unique polyprotein, which subsequently undergoes different cleavages by means of viral and host proteases, to finally provide three structural proteins, namely the pre-membrane/membrane (prM/M), the capsid (C) and the envelope (E) proteins, and seven non-structural (NS) proteins. At both ends of the viral genome, there are two untranslated regions (UTR) of different length, which are essential for viral replication and immune modulation and whose activity is strongly related to the secondary structures adopted, mainly stem-loops.

 </xref> Flavivirus infections represent a serious global threat because of the continuous outbreaks reported worldwide. Pathogenic flaviviruses are mainly transmitted by mosquitoes or ticks and subsequent infections can lead to the onset of severe neurological and non-neurological diseases. The family comprises over 100 virus species, including emerging and re-emerging arboviruses of global significance, such as Japanese encephalitis (JEV), West Nile (WNV), Zika (ZIKV), dengue (DENV), yellow fever (YFV), and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) virus, and also the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which belongs to the 
 <italic>Hepacivirus</italic> genus. Albeit commercially available vaccines for some of these viruses have been developed, nowadays no effective specific treatments exist, besides the recent one established against HCV. Considering the global threat of flaviviral pandemics, specific treatments are craved for.
