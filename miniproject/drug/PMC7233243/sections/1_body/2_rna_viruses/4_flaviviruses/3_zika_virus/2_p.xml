<p id="p0145">ZIKV is transmitted to humans by mosquito bites: in adults, it usually causes mild to no symptoms, while it might be devastating if contracted during pregnancy, as it is related to microcephaly in the unborn child. Several G4 forming sequences have been discovered in the positive strand of the ZIKV genome, while the negative one is devoid of PQSs. Seven of the identified sequences were found to be surprisingly conserved within more than 50 analyzed flavivirus genomes. Given the great viral genome variability, this observation suggests a significant involvement of these PQS in the regulation of the life cycle of these viruses. An additional G4 in the unique 3â€²-UTR region is present in ZIKV: this region is pivotal to viral replication of the negative-sense strand, therefore it could be a target to impair viral progression.
