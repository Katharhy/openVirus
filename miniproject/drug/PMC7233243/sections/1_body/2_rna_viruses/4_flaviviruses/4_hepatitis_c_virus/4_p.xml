<p id="p0160">HCV was also used as the reference RNA virus to develop a fluorescence light-up probe, a thioflavine T derivative (ThT-NE), for the direct visualization of the native HCV RNA genome in living cells. ThT-NE showed remarkable specificity for HCV RNA G4s with respect to other G4s in different cell models, probably because during infections viral G4s outnumber cellular G4s in order to maximize viral replication. Moreover, the HCV replication machinery promotes formation of vesicle-like viral replication complexes that contain most of the newly synthesized viral RNA, generating a localized G4 enrichment that improves ThT-NE recognition.
