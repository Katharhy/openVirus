<p id="p0150">HCV affects more than 70 million people worldwide. It can cause both acute and chronic hepatitis, possibly leading to cirrhosis, liver failure and cancer. Indeed, HCV is responsible for 25% of liver cancers. The HCV genome, in common with that of all flaviviruses, is organized into a long open reading frame, which produces a unique polyprotein that is processed by proteases to form 10 structural and non-structural proteins. Notwithstanding the numerous virus variants emerging constantly in patients, the core protein is the least variable and therefore it represents an attractive antiviral target.
