<p id="p0170">The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified after a massive outbreak in 2003, which led to the death of almost 10% of the affected people. The virus is one of the most pathogenic viruses in humans and it is highly contagious. Furthermore, no effective drugs are available against it. SARS-CoV belongs to the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family and has a (+)-ssRNA genome of 29.7 kb in length, encoding for 13 viral genes. The nonstructural protein 3, also known as SARS unique domain (SUD), plays a crucial role in viral replication and transcription. It was demonstrated to preferentially bind G4-forming oligonucleotides that form in the 3′-UTR of mRNAs coding for host-cell proteins implicated in the regulation of several processes, such as apoptosis and signal transduction. For this reason, the SUD/G4 interaction has been speculated to be involved in the modulation of genome replication and host cell response to viral infection.
