<p id="p0165">Filoviruses comprises five genera of viruses, including deadly pathogens such as Ebola (EBOV) and Marburg (MARV) viruses, which cause fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and primates, with no cure available thus far. These viruses are characterized by filamentous virions with a ~ 19 kb-long (−)ssRNA, which includes seven genes. Filoviruses RNA replication consists in the generation of a (+)ssRNA intermediate, namely the anti-genome, which acts as template for the synthesis of new genomes. Studies on the presence of G4s in filovirus genomes has revealed a highly conserved G-rich sequence in the EBOV L gene, which encodes for the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and modulates viral replication and transcription. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> analysis has demonstrated that this sequence folds into a dynamic parallel G4, stabilized by treatment with the TMPyP4 ligand. Interestingly, this compound was able to reduce L gene transcription and to impair replication of the EBOV mini-genome, a cell-based method involving firefly luciferase as reporter protein.
