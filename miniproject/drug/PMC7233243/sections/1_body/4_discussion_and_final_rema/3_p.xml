<p id="p0240">Taking into account that both hosts and viruses have genomic sequences able to organize into G4s, one of the most demanding tasks in the design of antiviral G4 ligands is to accomplish selectivity toward viral versus cellular G4s. As a matter of fact, one of the major limitations in the development of these compounds is in respect to the common chemical features that characterize the currently employed G4 ligands: the large flat aromatic core that stacks on the G quartet, increasing discrimination among different G4s; high-molecular weights and positive-charged side chains, which guarantee loops and grooves interaction to the detriment of cellular uptake.
