<p id="p0245">In order to achieve selectivity, deep knowledge about the structural characteristics of each identified G4 is necessary. In fact, loop and groove regions are distinctive marks of the G4 structure and are amenable to selective recognition. Structural data on cellular G4/G4 ligand complexes has demonstrated the involvement of the grooves in the stabilization of such interactions, contributing to formation of a compact arrangement that would likely efficiently impair the transcription machinery.

 </xref> It is therefore possible to speculate that enhanced selectivity could be mediated by interaction with loop/groove moieties. To this end, NMR and crystallographic determinations of viral G4s and their complexes with ligands are necessary, in order to allow ad hoc design of new antiviral molecules. To date, only two viral G4 structures have been solved through NMR spectroscopy: the HIV-1 LTR-III
