<p id="p0250">Notwithstanding their poor selectivity, most of the G4 ligands tested in viruses have demonstrated promising antiviral activity and, in the majority of cases, the activity was shown to be G4-dependent. One possible explanation for this outcome is the amount of viral G4s, which, during infection, largely exceeds that of cellular G4s, especially during replication, as reported for HSV-1.

 </xref> Considering that generally G4s are located in regulatory regions crucial for viral life cycle progression, a combination of abundance of viral G4s and impairment of key viral functions might explain the observed antiviral effect. Exploring the effective folding of G4s during different steps could help not only help understand the role of G4s in different viruses, but it would heighten the possibility of targeting them in the most useful and effective way. Ultimately, extending this kind of investigation to other viruses would likely lead to a more rapid and successful application of G4 ligands in antiviral research.
