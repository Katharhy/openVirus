<p id="p0255">However, it must be realized that each virus has complex and unique characteristics, therefore investigation of the effective target and mechanism of action of compounds at the molecular level may not be straightforward. The case of the EBV virus is a clear example of this entangled picture: PDS impairs EBNA1 synthesis, while PhenDC3 exerts the exact opposite effect.
