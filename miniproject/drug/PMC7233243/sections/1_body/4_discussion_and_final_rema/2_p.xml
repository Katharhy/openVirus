<p id="p0235">The involvement of G4s in the regulation of cellular processes, such as transcription, replication, translation and telomere maintenance, has been widely accepted by the scientific community. The development of specific G4 ligands with promising anticancer effects has encouraged identification of new ways to harness G4 modulation in other human diseases, including viral infections. Altogether, the data collected in the past few years on G4s in viruses, their interaction with specific ligands and the consequent effect on the modulation of the viral machinery validate the possibility of developing G4-based antiviral drugs. The first aspect to acknowledge is that all the characterized viral G4s are located in highly-conserved genomic regions. In virology, base-conservation analysis is a critical issue, since viruses are characterized by high mutation rates.

 </xref> The limited availability of deposited sequences for many viruses, especially the emerging ones, limits a comprehensive conservation analysis; however, data accumulated so far clearly show that PQSs are conserved elements within viruses, thus representing efficient targets in antiviral research.
