<p id="p0265">In conclusion, all the data reported so far on G4s in viruses clearly show that G4 structures are pivotal elements in the regulation of the virus life cycle, both at the lytic and latent levels. G4 ligands can be envisaged as efficient and promising antiviral agents; therefore research on the discovery of new G4-ligand small molecules should be encouraged. The availability of selective molecules will also help to clarify and further understand the role of G4s in the viral life cycle and ultimately in viral pathogenesis.</p>
