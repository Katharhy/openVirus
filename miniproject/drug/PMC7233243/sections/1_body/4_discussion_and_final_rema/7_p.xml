<p id="p0260">Finally, one of the most exciting applications of G4 ligands in antiviral therapy is the possibility to fight viruses that undergo latency. Current available therapies cannot eradicate the latent virus from its host, and consequently infective agents such as HIV and HHVs still cause non-eradicable diseases. In this scenario, a G4-mediated pharmacological approach would affect both the replicating and the latent virus, possibly leading to virus eradication. To this end, the virus-induced manipulation of host chromatin needs to be considered. Recently, several studies reported virus-host chromatin interactions and chromatin machinery modulation by viral proteins.
