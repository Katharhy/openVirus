<p id="p0115">HPVs include more than 100 characterized viruses, which infect and replicate within epithelial structures, inducing specific hyperplastic lesions. Among them, those defined as “high-risk” HPVs can efficiently induce malignant transformation of infected cells, leading to the onset of cervical, anogenital, and several oropharyngeal cancers. Notably, high-risk HPVs infections cause almost 99% of cervical cancers and approximately 5% of all cancers worldwide.

 </xref> Currently, despite the availability of anti-HPV vaccines, access to effective treatments is limited in many parts of the world; furthermore, no specific anti-HPV drugs are available. G4 forming sequences have been found in 8 out of the 120 identified HPV types, all belonging to the “high risk” HPV subgroup.

 </xref> Nevertheless, the majority of the identified sequences are characterized by high polymorphism,

 </xref> Such dynamism makes HPV G4s difficult to study and, above all, to target; therefore, further in-depth studies will be necessary to disclose the involvement of HPV G4s in the viral life cycle.
