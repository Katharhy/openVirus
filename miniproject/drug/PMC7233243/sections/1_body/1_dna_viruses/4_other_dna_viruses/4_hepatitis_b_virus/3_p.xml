<p id="p0125">Very recently, a G4-forming sequence was identified as a genotype-specific regulator of HBV replication, located in the preS2/S promoter of HBV genotype B. The sequence was shown to fold into an intramolecular hybrid G4 structure, the stabilization of which surprisingly led to enhanced transcription of the preS2/S gene promoter, with consequent production of the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). The positive modulatory effect was demonstrated through the employment of the G4 ligands BRACO-19 and PDS, revealing a yet unknown role for DNA secondary structures in the viral context.
