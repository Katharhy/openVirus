<p id="p0120">HBV is a hepatotropic virus, characterized by a partially double-stranded, circular DNA genome, which replicates through an RNA intermediate, synthesized by a reverse transcriptase. Persistent HBV infections are related to serious liver damage, eventually leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The pronounced genetic variability associated with HBV determines the existence of 10 genotypes (Aâ€“J) which differ in terms of transmissibility, virus loads, response to antiviral therapy, and ability to cause liver disease. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide are chronically infected with HBV, and despite the availability of a prophylactic vaccine and antiviral drugs that keep HBV levels under control, full eradication is not yet achievable. Treatments are urgently needed, as almost 1 million deaths per year are estimated to be caused by HBV-related cancers and associated diseases.
