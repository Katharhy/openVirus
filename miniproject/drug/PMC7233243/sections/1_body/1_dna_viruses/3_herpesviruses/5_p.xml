<p id="p0055">Genome-wide bioinformatics analysis has revealed remarkable PQS density in all HHV species, mostly in genome regulatory and repeated regions, which are crucial to sustain the episomal form. The enrichment, distribution and conservation rate of these sequences strongly corroborate G4s as functional elements in the regulation of the viral life cycle.

 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In addition, a recent study demonstrated an interesting correlation between G4 sequence composition in HHVs and their hosts, suggesting a possible long-term virus-host co-evolution process.
