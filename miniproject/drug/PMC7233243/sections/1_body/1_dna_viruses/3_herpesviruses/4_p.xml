<p id="p0050">Pharmacological research in the antiherpetic field has been quite successful, since to date, several efficient drugs are available on the market. One of the most efficient antiviral agents is acyclovir, along with its derivatives. These compounds are classified as nucleosides analogues: they block viral replication by being incorporated into the nascent viral DNA. They have been widely employed for the treatment of alpha-HHVs and are still considered the first line drugs of choice in the management of these viruses. However, the excessive use of anti-HHVs agents over large periods, especially in immunocompromised patients, has led to the onset of resistant viral strains. Moreover, considering that HHVs undergo latency, and that, to date, there is no way to eradicate the virus from the host cells, the development of new compounds with innovative targets and mechanisms of action is urgently needed.
