<p id="p0100">KSHV is the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma and other lymphoproliferative disorders, such as primary effusion lymphoma and a plasmablastic form of multicentric Castleman's disease. It mostly concerns AIDS patients, as KSHV seroprevalence is directly proportional to HIV seropositivity rates. At the moment, there are no treatments for the lytic or latent infections.

 </xref> The KSHV genome is arranged in a ~ 140 kb long central region, encoding viral genes, flanked by repeated regions (terminal repeats, or TRs), which harbor the viral episome unique origin of replication. TRs are highly enriched in G/C bases and have been demonstrated to form stable G4s, located both in the forward and reverse strands, and involved in the regulation of episomal replication. Stabilization of viral G4s by means of different G4 ligands, PhenDC3 and TMPyP4, stalled the replication fork at the TR level, with consequent replicative stress and inhibition of KSHV DNA replication, which resulted in the dramatic reduction (60%) of viral episome copy numbers.

 </xref> In addition, the KSHV latency associated nuclear antigen 1 (LANA1) protein, which is the master regulatory protein of KSHV latency, forms G4 structures in its own mRNA, analogous to EBNA1. G4 stabilization induced by TMPyP4 treatment downregulated LANA1 translation, with consequent reduction of protein expression in KSHV infected cells, suggesting that LANA1 mRNA G4s are involved in the regulation of the translation machinery. Interestingly, reduced translation has been found to be strictly related to reduction of antigen presentation, one of the main mechanisms adopted by LANA1 to promote immune evasion.
