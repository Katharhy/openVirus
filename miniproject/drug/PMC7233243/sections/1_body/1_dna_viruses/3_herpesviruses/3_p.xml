<p id="p0045">HHVs differ significantly in terms of DNA base composition and sequence arrangement; nonetheless, they share many biological properties, including the ability to sustain, after a primary infection, a latent state through maintenance of their genome in the infected organism as an extrachromosomal nuclear episome.

 </xref> During their life cycle, HHVs trigger an intricate chain of events to achieve replication, which involves both cellular and viral structures. Briefly, after attachment to the host's cell surface, the virus penetrates into the cell cytoplasm and migrates to the nucleus, where it releases the viral genome. Here, different complex steps lead to the synthesis of concatemer copies of viral DNA, which, along with the newly translated viral proteins, are assembled into new virions and finally released.
