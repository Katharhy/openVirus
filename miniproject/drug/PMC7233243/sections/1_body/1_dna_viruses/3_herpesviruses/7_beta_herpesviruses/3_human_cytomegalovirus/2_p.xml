<p id="p0075">The human CMV is estimated to affect more than 80% of the worldwide population. It has the largest dsDNA genome among HHVs (~ 235 kb), which was found to include a remarkably high number of PQS, distributed among the promoters of immediate-early, early and late genes. The majority of the sequences have been demonstrated to actually fold into G4 structures, and to be stabilized after treatment with two different porphyrin-based G4 ligands, TMPyP4 and NMM. Interestingly, in a luciferase reporter system that included different PQSs in viral promoters, NMM was shown to suppress the expression of several mRNAs and to reduce both intracellular and extracellular viral DNA levels.

 </xref> Recently, the anti-CMV activity of a polymerase inhibitor CX-5461, a known G4 ligand currently in phase I clinical trial, was also demonstrated. Interestingly, the compound induced a 2.0 log reduction in viral titer, together with a significant decrease in the amount of viral DNA and pUL44, the viral processivity factor: these data indicate that the effect of CX-5461 is exerted at the viral DNA replication stage of the viral life cycle. Considering that the compound is known to induce a DNA damage response (DDR), its antiviral activity may be related to a double G4-related mechanism of action, involving both the viral targets and the activation of cellular stress response pathways.
