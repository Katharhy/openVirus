<p id="p0080">HHV-6 consists of two related viruses known as HHV-6A and 6B, which infect almost 100% of the human population and cause the febrile illness roseola infantum, also called the sixth childhood eruptive disease. The HHV-6 genome is characterized by the presence of variable-length telomere-like repeat regions at its termini, which can integrate by homologous recombination into the human chromosome at the telomeres; however, the mechanisms regulating this process remain poorly understood. Considering that telomeres are commonly known to fold into G4s, involvement of these non-canonical arrangements in the regulation of HHV-6 chromosomal integration is plausible. Indeed, treatment of HHV-6 infected telomerase-expressing cells with the G4 ligand BRACO-19 resulted in a significant reduction in chromosomal integration, likely due to the prevention of telomere end elongation.
