<p id="p0060">The subfamily of alpha-HHVs includes HSV type 1 and 2, and VZV: these are characterized by the establishment of a persistent infection in sensory neuronal cells. Most of the studies conducted on the role of G4s in HHVs regulation focused on the HSV-1 virus, as its genome is characterized by 68% GC content, with multiple and highly stable G4-forming sequences.

 </xref> HSV-1 G4s formation has been monitored in infected cells through a G4-specific antibody at different time points post-infection. G4s were found to form in a virus cycle-dependent fashion. During viral replication, viral G4s fold massively in the cell nucleus and localize in different compartments according to the viral genome movements in the cell during the viral cycle.
