  <p>Cartoon representation of a simplified virus life cycle. The virus attaches to the host cell through surface receptors or proteins (step 1) and enters the cell, according to different mechanisms (step 2). After penetration, the viral genome is uncoated (step 3) and released into the cytoplasm. At this stage, the DNA or RNA genome nature defines the location and the strategy adopted for genome replication (step 4): the majority of DNA viruses replicate in the cell nucleus. Most RNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells. For retroviruses, retrotranscription occurs in the cytoplasm, while integration takes place in the cell nucleus. After viral mRNA synthesis, viral proteins are expressed in the cytoplasm (steps 5–6). The newly synthesized viral elements (genomes and proteins) are assembled into new virions (step 7) and released outside the cell (step 8).</p>
