  <p>Cartoon representation of the HIV-1 life cycle. The virus attaches to the host cell through surface receptors (step 1) to enter the cell (step 2). After penetration, the viral genome is uncoated (step 3) and released into the cytoplasm. At this stage, the viral RNA is retro-transcribed into a double-stranded intermediate (step 4) which enters the nucleus, where it can be integrated into the host genome (step 5). After transcription (step 6), mRNA acts as template for the synthesis of new viral genome copies and for the expression of viral proteins in the cytoplasm (steps 6). The newly synthesized viral elements (genomes and proteins) are assembled into new virions (step 7) and released outside the cell (step 8).</p>
