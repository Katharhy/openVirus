Comprehensive bioinformatics analyses have traced putative G4-forming sequences in the genome of almost all human viruses, showing that their distribution is statistically significant and their presence highly conserved. Since the genomes of viruses are remarkably variable, high conservation rates strongly suggest a crucial role of G4s in the viral replication cycle and evolution, emphasizing the possibility of targeting viral G4s as a new pharmacological approach in antiviral therapy. Recent studies have demonstrated the formation and function of G4s in pathogens responsible for serious diseases, such as HIV-1, Hepatitis B and C, Ebola viruses, to cite a few. In this chapter, we present the state of the art on the structural and functional characterization of viral G4s in RNA viruses, DNA viruses and retroviruses.

Nevertheless, the majority of current therapies are unable to accomplish virus eradication or sustained virological response, therefore the battle against viral pathogens still represents a primary focus of medical research.

Upon treatment with increasing compound concentrations, LTR promoter activity was reduced by almost 70% when compared to the untreated condition: a mutated non-G4 sequence used as control showed no variation in promoter response and thus confirmed the effect to be G4-related.<xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr"><sup>71</sup></xref> BRACO-19 was then tested in various cell lines, using different HIV-1 strains. It exerted promising G4-mediated antiviral activity, in the micromolar range. Considering that the G4 ligand also stabilizes HIV-1 RNA G4s, the antiviral effect could be ascribed to a dual mechanism of action, both at the pre- and the post-integration level.<xref rid="bb0335" ref-type="bibr"><sup>66</sup></xref> The development of a new series of core-extended NDI derivatives has significantly improved the anti-HIV-1 activity of the G4 ligands. In fact, these molecules, characterized by exceptional solubility properties, displayed outstanding <italic>in vitro</italic> stabilizing activity on HIV-1 LTR G4s, with preference for the viral over the human telomeric G4s, used as a cellular reference. Most importantly, the series exhibited strong antiviral activity in the low nanomolar range (IC<sub>50</sub>
&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;25&#x000a0;nM). Time-related antiviral assays combined with reporter assays, have confirmed the G4-mediated mechanism of action.<xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr"><sup>78</sup></xref>
</p><p id="p0225">Further investigation on G4s in the HIV-1 integrated genome have identified three PQSs in the <italic>nef</italic> gene. This encodes for the viral accessory protein Nef, a factor involved in the maintenance of a persistent HIV infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. The <italic>nef</italic> gene is located at the 3&#x02032;-end of the viral genome, with its coding region that partially overlaps with the 3&#x02032;-LTR. The observed PQSs were highly conserved and able to fold into two-tetrads G4s. Nef G4s were stabilized <italic>in vitro</italic> by different G4 ligands, such as TMPyP4, BRACO-19 and PIPER. Interestingly, employment of TMPyP4 in the TZM-bl reporter cell line, which supports Nef-dependent HIV-1 replication, resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of viral infectivity.<xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr"><sup>79</sup></xref> Altogether, these data support the possibility of exploiting viral G4s as novel anti-HIV-1 targets, possibly in both the lytic and latent infection.</p><p id="p0230">Indeed, one of the most appealing and interesting aspects about G4s in HIV-1 is their possible involvement in the regulation of viral latency. The virus establishes a state of latent infection in T cells: at this stage, it is not susceptible to antiretroviral drugs. The molecular mechanisms underlying this process are complex and not completely understood; nonetheless some forms of latency entail transcriptional interference, thus the 5&#x02032;-LTR and its G4s might be involved.<xref rid="bb0405" ref-type="bibr"><sup>80</sup></xref> G4 stabilizing agents have been tested in cells infected with latent HIV-1, where they showed strong antiviral activity, effectively linking G4s to HIV-1 latency. BRACO-19 in latently infected cells reduced viral titer to undetectable levels, an effect that was still observed after long-term treatment. TMPyP4 administration also blocked viral replication in two lymphocyte T cell lines with established HIV-1 latency. The antiviral activity was found to be coupled with higher apoptosis/death rates, with respect to untreated cells and the effect was enhanced upon association with DNA damage repair inhibitors.<xref rid="bb9091" ref-type="bibr"><sup>81</sup></xref>
</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s0120"><label>5</label><title>Discussion and final remarks</title><p id="p0235">The involvement of G4s in the regulation of cellular processes, such as transcription, replication, translation and telomere maintenance, has been widely accepted by the scientific community. The development of specific G4 ligands with promising anticancer effects has encouraged identification of new ways to harness G4 modulation in other human diseases, including viral infections. Altogether, the data collected in the past few years on G4s in viruses, their interaction with specific ligands and the consequent effect on the modulation of the viral machinery validate the possibility of developing G4-based antiviral drugs. The first aspect to acknowledge is that all the characterized viral G4s are located in highly-conserved genomic regions. In virology, base-conservation analysis is a critical issue, since viruses are characterized by high mutation rates.<xref rid="bb0410" ref-type="bibr"><sup>82</sup></xref> The limited availability of deposited sequences for many viruses, especially the emerging ones, limits a comprehensive conservation analysis; however, data accumulated so far clearly show that PQSs are conserved elements within viruses, thus representing efficient targets in antiviral research.</p><p id="p0240">Taking into account that both hosts and viruses have genomic sequences able to organize into G4s, one of the most demanding tasks in the design of antiviral G4 ligands is to accomplish selectivity toward viral versus cellular G4s. As a matter of fact, one of the major limitations in the development of these compounds is in respect to the common chemical features that characterize the currently employed G4 ligands: the large flat aromatic core that stacks on the G quartet, increasing discrimination among different G4s; high-molecular weights and positive-charged side chains, which guarantee loops and grooves interaction to the detriment of cellular uptake.<xref rid="bb0415" ref-type="bibr"><sup>83</sup></xref> Indeed, low selectivity and poor drug-like properties are major factors in the lack of progression of current G4 ligands beyond phase II clinical trials.</p><p id="p0245">In order to achieve selectivity, deep knowledge about the structural characteristics of each identified G4 is necessary. In fact, loop and groove regions are distinctive marks of the G4 structure and are amenable to selective recognition. Structural data on cellular G4/G4 ligand complexes has demonstrated the involvement of the grooves in the stabilization of such interactions, contributing to formation of a compact arrangement that would likely efficiently impair the transcription machinery.<xref rid="bb9089" ref-type="bibr"><sup>84</sup></xref> It is therefore possible to speculate that enhanced selectivity could be mediated by interaction with loop/groove moieties. To this end, NMR and crystallographic determinations of viral G4s and their complexes with ligands are necessary, in order to allow ad hoc design of new antiviral molecules. To date, only two viral G4 structures have been solved through NMR spectroscopy: the HIV-1 LTR-III<xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr"><sup>72</sup></xref> and LTR-IV<xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr"><sup>73</sup></xref> G4s. Molecular docking analysis, coupled to cleavage experiments, has enabled the identification of groove interactions between LTR-III G4 and the NDI-Cu-DETA derivative, a highly selective G4-cleaving agent.<xref rid="bb9090" ref-type="bibr"><sup>85</sup></xref> Structure resolution is thus a valid approach for the development of specific compounds.</p><p id="p0250">Notwithstanding their poor selectivity, most of the G4 ligands tested in viruses have demonstrated promising antiviral activity and, in the majority of cases, the activity was shown to be G4-dependent. One possible explanation for this outcome is the amount of viral G4s, which, during infection, largely exceeds that of cellular G4s, especially during replication, as reported for HSV-1.<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Considering that generally G4s are located in regulatory regions crucial for viral life cycle progression, a combination of abundance of viral G4s and impairment of key viral functions might explain the observed antiviral effect. Exploring the effective folding of G4s during different steps could help not only help understand the role of G4s in different viruses, but it would heighten the possibility of targeting them in the most useful and effective way. Ultimately, extending this kind of investigation to other viruses would likely lead to a more rapid and successful application of G4 ligands in antiviral research.</p><p id="p0255">However, it must be realized that each virus has complex and unique characteristics, therefore investigation of the effective target and mechanism of action of compounds at the molecular level may not be straightforward. The case of the EBV virus is a clear example of this entangled picture: PDS impairs EBNA1 synthesis, while PhenDC3 exerts the exact opposite effect.<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Probably, the overall outcome could be ascribed to multiple G4-mediated mechanisms.</p><p id="p0260">Finally, one of the most exciting applications of G4 ligands in antiviral therapy is the possibility to fight viruses that undergo latency. Current available therapies cannot eradicate the latent virus from its host, and consequently infective agents such as HIV and HHVs still cause non-eradicable diseases. In this scenario, a G4-mediated pharmacological approach would affect both the replicating and the latent virus, possibly leading to virus eradication. To this end, the virus-induced manipulation of host chromatin needs to be considered. Recently, several studies reported virus-host chromatin interactions and chromatin machinery modulation by viral proteins.<xref rid="bb0425" ref-type="bibr"><sup>86</sup></xref> Epigenetic modifications of viral chromatin and viral transcriptome might be crucial in conveying the virus toward either lytic or latent infection.<xref rid="bb0430" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>, <xref rid="bb0435" ref-type="bibr">88</xref> Since G4 formation has been directly linked to the suppressive role of heterochromatin and it seems to occur only in highly transcribed nucleosome-depleted chromatin regions,<xref rid="bb0440" ref-type="bibr"><sup>89</sup></xref> it would be fascinating to understand how viral G4s affect and could be affected by such a complex mechanism.</p><p id="p0265">In conclusion, all the data reported so far on G4s in viruses clearly show that G4 structures are pivotal elements in the regulation of the virus life cycle, both at the lytic and latent levels. G4 ligands can be envisaged as efficient and promising antiviral agents; therefore research on the discovery of new G4-ligand small molecules should be encouraged. The availability of selective molecules will also help to clarify and further understand the role of G4s in the viral life cycle and ultimately in viral pathogenesis.</p><p id="p0270">G4-mediated antiviral drugs could represent a striking turning point in the management of viral infectious diseases, especially in people who cannot access immunization, such as immunocompromised and elderly people. Finally, the G4-mediated antiviral effects observed in latent systems may lead to cutting-edge therapeutic approaches in the treatment of human deadly malignancies, such as AIDS, herpes- and HPV-related cancers.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bb0010"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Krupovic</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Dolja</surname><given-names>V.V.</given-names></name><name><surname>Koonin</surname><given-names>E.V.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Origin of Viruses: Primordial Replicators Recruiting Capsids from Hosts</article-title><source>Nat.
