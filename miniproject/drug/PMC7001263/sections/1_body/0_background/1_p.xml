<p id="Par14">Tanzania has reported a steady fall in the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the general population, from 7% in 2004 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] to 5.0% in 2017 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The prevalence of hepatitis B and C viruses in the general and some sub-populations like health care workers, pregnant women and children have also been reported to decline [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These decline have been attributed to several preventive measures such as increasing awareness; screening blood donors; free condom distribution; prevention of mother to child transmission; expanded access to antiretroviral therapy; voluntary male circumcision; setting up HIV care and treatment clinic and methadone clinics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is unclear whether these preventive measures have had an effect on people who inject drugs (PWID) [
