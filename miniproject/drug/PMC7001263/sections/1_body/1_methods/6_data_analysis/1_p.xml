<p id="Par22">Data were entered in excel software and analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. Categorical variables were summarized as proportions while continuous variables were summarized as median with inter-quartile range. The seroprevalence of HIV, HCV, and HBsAg among PWID was expressed in percentages and comparisons between the groups were done using Chi-Square. Low income was defined as earning less or equal to 45 US dollars per month. Binary simple logistic regression was first performed, followed by a multivariable logistic regression model to determine factors independently associated with HIV, HBV or HCV infection. All variables with 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;â€‰0.2 in simple binary regression were included in the multivariable model. Associations in the multivariable logistic model were presented as adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Interactions between independent variables were examined, and the Wald test was used to test the associations of the variables and interactions. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to examine the overall fitness of the model. The level of significance was specified at 0.05.
