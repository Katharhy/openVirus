<p id="Par33">Our study may have several limitations. We acknowledge that reliance on self-reported information and dependency on the willingness of PWID to participate may have introduced selection and information biases and clustering of events and failure to recall. Reporting error may have occurred for some measures such as the frequency of injection and condom since this was based on participants’ ability to recall events in the last 6 months. HBV vaccination status was not evaluated and therefore the risk of acquiring HBV infection cannot be determined. Finally, the snowball sampling approach employed in this study may have resulted in a biased sample that cannot be corrected by weighting schemes, limiting inferences of our findings.</p>
