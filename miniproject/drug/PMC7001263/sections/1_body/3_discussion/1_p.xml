<p id="Par28">Our study shows that over two-thirds of PWID in this study had serologic evidence of infection with at least one virus, while 22.4% having dual or triple multiple infections. About one-third of the participants were HIV positive, half had evidence of HCV infection and 8% HBV infection. These findings are higher in comparison with latest systematic review of studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, showing estimates of 21.8% for HCV, 18.3% for HIV and 3.7% for HBV [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,
