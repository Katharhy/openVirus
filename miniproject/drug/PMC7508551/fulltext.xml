As per expert opinion, rapidly mutating viruses, emergence and re-emergence of epidemics with increasing frequencies, climate-sensitive vector-borne diseases are likely to be increasing over the years and the trends will continue and intensify. Susceptible disease hosts, anthropogenic activities and environmental changes contribute and trigger the &#x02018;adaptive evolution&#x02019; of infectious agents to thrive and spread into different ecological niches and to adapt to new hosts. The overarching objective of this paper is to provide insight into the human actions which should be strictly regulated to help to sustain life on earth. To identify and categorize the triggering factors that contribute to disease ecology, especially repeated emergence of disease pandemics, a theory building approach, &#x02018;Total Interpretive Structural Modeling&#x02019; (TISM) was used; also the tool, &#x02018;Impact Matrix Cross-Reference Multiplication Applied to a Classification&#x02019; analysis (MICMAC) was applied to rank the risk factors based on their impacts on other factors and on the interdependence among them. This mathematical modeling tool clearly explains the strength, position and interconnectedness of each anthropogenic factor that contributes to the evolution of pathogens and to the frequent emergence of pandemics which needs to be addressed with immediate priority. As we are least prepared for another pandemic outbreak, significant policy attention must be focused on the causative factors to limit emerging outbreaks like COVID 19 in the future.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p>Fig.&#x000a0;1.

Looking at the pandemic outbreaks of the last few decades, it is evident that approximately 75% of emerging diseases including the major pandemics like, HIV, Ebola virus, Zika, avian &#x00026; swine influenza, SARS-CoV, MERS and the COVID-19 were all zoonotic in origin [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>].

Pathogens have evolved from closely related species, for example, in the case of HIV (Chimpanzees to Humans) or by species which are distant from humans in genetic homology, but having close contact as part of animal farming or exposure in the wild, have resulted in transmission of disease causing pathogens from wild animals to humans.</p><p id="p0080">Bats were the vectors of the Nipah virus to human and, SARS was transmitted to humans from bats and civet cats [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

These mutations include mutations in the viral genome which helps it to overcome the host&#x02019;s immune surveillance and other host resistant factors which interfere with their replication inside the host cell. The adaptive mutations also strengthen host-specific receptor structure modifications to ease cellular entry to new host species. Viral genetic recombination or re-assortment is another factor contributing to virulence.

The Lyme disease is caused by a spirochete in the genus &#x02018;Borrelia&#x02019; which, shuttles between an arthropod vector, usually a tick, and a mammalian, usually deer or avian populations. In the last century, deforestation as part of industrialization followed by reforestation resulted in fluctuations in deer populations due to reduction in predator species and hunting.

checking for transitivity:</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="p0315">This process allows checking for transitivity that has been caused because of inference, between some of the pairs that are a part of the reachability matrix initially created. A transitivity check must be done before arriving at the FRM to find the significant relationships, among factors which were not directly represented in the IRM. The transitivity check was performed on all entries with &#x02018;0&#x02019; in the IRM. 1&#x02217; or 1&#x02217;&#x02217; signifies the presence of transitivity, and the lack of it means that the original value of &#x02018;0&#x02019; can be retained. 1&#x02217; implies first level transitivity wherein if P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;Q and Q&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;R then P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;R. 1&#x02217;&#x02217; implies second level transitivity wherein if P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;Q, Q&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;R, and R&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;S, then P<private-char name="E00C" description="bond, double bond"><glyph-data id="pc-E00C" format="PBM" resolution="300" x-size="12" y-size="9">

<bold>Partition of the factors from FRM into different levels</bold>: In this step, the FRM was partitioned into three sets. The first set, called the reachability set, was comprised of the row elements of the final reachability matrix. The second set, called the antecedent set, was comprised of the column elements of the final reachability matrix. The third set is called the intersection set, and it was comprised of common elements of the previous two sets. In Iteration-1, the intersection elements were &#x02018;one&#x02019; and indicate reachability set. These factors were removed from the set and designated as level-1 factors. The process was repeated until the partitioned reachability matrices were obtained at various levels.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0035"><label>6.</label><p id="p0325">
<bold>Interaction matrix derived from direct and transitive links:</bold> From the expert opinion, the significant transitive links were drawn, which are highly influential relationship links among the transitive links of the FRM. The interaction matrix was developed by using the direct links as well as the transitive links that were significant.

<bold>Creating the digraph and the TISM model:</bold> At the final level, an entity known as the digraph, an acronym for directed graph, was created. The contents of the FRM as well as the level partitions were used for this purpose. After the digraph was developed, the direct and the significant transitive links were used to derive useful conclusions. The factors at the top of the model were called the first level factors. Subsequently, going down the digraph, the numeric value of each level increases in ascending order, one at a time. Then, using results from the interpretative matrix and the digraph, the TISM model was developed. The TISM model representing the direct and significant transitive relationships of the causative factors which were found to be influential in the disease ecology of emerging infectious diseases contains eight levels. The level eight is the base level, if any changes happened in the level-VIII factors (F4) may reflect in all other factors. The level-VII factors can influence all other factors except level-VIII factors. Likewise the factor&#x02019;s impact is on upward direction; i.e., the factors in the bottom levels determines the performance of those factors in the top levels</p></list-item></list>

The Di-graph was prepared based on the interaction matrix included in <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;4</xref>.</p><p id="p0345">The Di-graph represented eight levels of interdependence, starting with increasing human populations (F4) on the bottom level (level VIII) of the pyramid representing the root cause of all other factors studied by the authors of this paper, that trigger changes listed in the topmost level (level 1) of the pyramid, the host susceptibility to emerging pandemics (F13).</p><p id="p0350">The interpretive interaction matrix of the causative factors found to be influential in the repeated emergence of pandemics is presented in <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;5</xref>.</p><p id="p0355">To summarize, exponential growth of the human population&#x02019; (F4) plays key roles in the transformation of local epidemics in to pandemics, depending upon the disease-causing agent&#x02019;s virulence and host susceptibility. The human population increase is leading to climate changes, globalization (F10) and civil unrest (F11) as the pressures on resources limit their supply, therefore, global markets for labor and products, along with technological advancements have dramatically increased human migration, globally. The human population explosion also triggered socio-economic and political struggles and civil conflicts, due to increasing poverty caused by worsening inequities, risks to health as well as increased food and safe water insecurities in many countries.</p><p id="p0360">From time immemorial, population growth has served as an impetus for exploration and colonization, exploitation of geological and ecological resources as well as human resources has that often has led to or was based upon civil unrest, war, famine, infectious disease outbreaks among the natives, that, in-part triggered, caused mass migration. Trade, foreign investment, and migration tend to rise with increased human capital. Many dimensions are interconnected with and migration (F9) and encourage wildlife trade (F3) in global markets. These dynamics help to enable a pathogen to be spread globally in a short time.</p><p id="p0365">Human migration either due to civil unrest or as part of globalization, lead to human habitation in na&#x000ef;ve environments (F6), either for habitation or for industrialization and urbanization; which gradually destroy the regional ecological balance by overexploitation of nature through anthropogenic activities like, deforestation, intense agriculture, mining, industrialization, air, water and soil pollution, urbanization and rapidly increasing carbon foot prints (F5).</p><p id="p0370">Changes in food consumption patterns (F14), &#x02018;bush meat&#x02019; consumption and wildlife trade and exposure of farm animals and humans to wild animals increase human-animal interactions and increase the likelihood of pandemics (F13), and often result in the emergence or re-emergence of independently re-assorted zoonotic (F1) pathogens after repeated infections in different hosts or co-infections of similar microbial strains in the same host.</p><p id="p0375">Industrial or factory farming of livestock and their monoculture effects (F7), with little genetic diversity, increase the probability that new pathogens or new strains of previously encountered pathogens may be strengthened by new capacities derived while in wild species hosts.</p><p id="p0380">Loss of bio-diversity is a trigger to virulent pathogen emergence when natural reservoir hosts face threats to their existence and adaptation in multiple hosts and related mutations of significant survival value. Large scale habitat destruction and changes in land utilization patterns, pollution and poaching, result in habitat losses, decreases in species diversity and number, shifts in reservoir hosts of pathogens, species extinction, that may converge to result in severe ecological destruction, ecosystem de-stabilization and climate changes (F2). The climate changes and ecosystem imbalances combined with intensive agriculture frequently results in increases in antibiotic resistant strains in farm animals and in humans. The interspecies adaptability of infectious agents and adaptive mutations of the microbial genome to gain multi-species adaptability and immune surveillance inside the host may trigger the pathogen to achieve pandemic potential (F12).</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><label>4.2</label><title>Impact Matrix Cross-Reference Multiplication Applied to a classification (MICMAC)</title><sec id="sec4.2.1"><label>4.2.1</label><title>Analysis</title><p id="p0385">The MICMAC analysis involves classifying the relevant causative factors into four different zones, namely: driving factors, autonomous factors, dependent factors and linkage factors [<xref rid="bib136" ref-type="bibr">[136]</xref>, <xref rid="bib137" ref-type="bibr">[137]</xref>, <xref rid="bib138" ref-type="bibr">[138]</xref>, <xref rid="bib139" ref-type="bibr">[139]</xref>, <xref rid="bib140" ref-type="bibr">[140]</xref>, <xref rid="bib141" ref-type="bibr">[141]</xref>]<bold>.</bold>The factors for this article were classified as:<list list-type="simple" id="olist0020"><list-item id="o0045"><label>1.</label><p id="p0390">

The TISM approach was used to list the factors influencing the emergence of infectious diseases and to identify the links among them. Factors were ranked according to their order of importance and a hierarchy was established using the MICMAC analysis. The results revealed that changes in any individual factor in the study could directly or indirectly help to cause repeated epidemics. Expanding human populations, globalization, and civil unrest were the top factors. Also, human habitation of naive environments and interconnectedness and human migration were found to be driving or key factors according to this model. These factors were independently and interdependently found to impose a strong impact on the increased frequency of emergence of epidemics.</p><p id="p0435">Anthropogenic factors leading to ecosystem destabilization and climate changes were found to be the primary driving causes that lead to the emergence of infectious diseases as the result of pathogen mutation and zoonoses. Host susceptibility, is at the peak of the pyramid because that parameter depended on all other factors including changes in environment, socio-behavioral changes and food consumption habits.</p><p id="p0440">The findings provide a guide to policy-makers to identify the impacts of cumulated anthropogenic interference that are resulting in global pandemics.

Although, the epidemic characteristics of pandemic outbreaks have been studied extensively, coupled with million-dollar research and development to control each epidemic as and when it emerged, our societies were not prepared for the global shutdown when COVID-19 lashed the world. This reminded us of the magnitude of the devastating effects of anthropogenic activities.</p><p id="p0460">The extensive destruction of natural habitats for urbanization and modern agriculture have led to biodiversity losses and to extensive species extinction due to habitat loss and destabilized ecosystems. Pollution and carbon footprints coupled with climate changes contributed to global changes in temperatures and emergence of vector-borne diseases. The illegal trade of wildlife and bush meat consumption habits of humans, and extensive industrial farming of livestock fed with antibiotics accelerated the rapid mutations in infectious agents.</p><p id="p0465">The &#x02018;adaptive selection&#x02019; of this genetic changes contributed to the evolution and emergence of pandemic pathogens with high mutation rates, like the Corona-family viruses. The selective mutations may help them to emerge and re-emerge repeatedly in various geographical locations, by passing through multiple host species, adapting to wide ecological niches, and carefully escaping the host&#x02019;s immune system&#x02019;s surveillance as was documented in the genome mutations of SARS-CoV-2.</p><p id="p0470">Human life on earth might have to confront the worst disease syndrome that we can imagine due to the expected ecological backlashes created by nature destruction activities of humans.

Since, environmental regulations are difficult to implement, surveillance systems with real time tracking, warning and response systems with strict law enforcements are very important to prevent, predict and contain outbreaks with immediate effect.</p><p id="p0480">Emergence of a novel pathogen with epidemic potential is like a volcano eruption bringing out all incubating inner fires at once. By learning from previous pandemics, and their much-discussed causative factors, we should look deeply into the &#x02018;inner fires we have created on mother Earth&#x02019;, which has led to the emergence of pandemic diseases. The concept of &#x02018;planetary health&#x02019; has emerged instead of human health, as the repeated lashes of pandemics like COVID-19 challenge us to come out of our attitude of supremacy over other species, and become increasingly be motivated to respect, care for and protect nature and other fellow creatures for the short and long-term future so, generations after generations will also have sustainable futures on this planet!</p></sec><sec id="sec9"><title>CRediT authorship contribution statement</title><p id="p0490">
