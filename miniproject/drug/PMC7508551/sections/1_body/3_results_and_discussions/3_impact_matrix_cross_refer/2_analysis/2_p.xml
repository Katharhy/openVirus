 <list list-type="simple" id="olist0020">
  <list-item id="o0045">
   <label>1.</label>
   <p id="p0390">
    <italic>Autonomous factors (Zone-I):</italic> Factors that have weak dependence power and weak driving power are known as autonomous factors. In this study, there was no autonomous factor.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="o0050">
   <label>2.</label>
   <p id="p0395">
    <italic>Dependent factors (Zone-II):</italic> Factors that have higher dependence on other factors but lesser driving power are known as dependent factors. In this study factor 2 (destabilization of ecosystems &amp; climate change), factor 7 (industrial farming of livestock &amp; monoculture effect), factor 8 (Emergence of Antibiotic resistance in livestock), factor 1 (emergence of zoonotic diseases), factor 12 (pathogen evolution and pandemic potential) and factor 13 (host susceptibility to pandemics) were found to be dependent factors. These factors are influenced when there are changes in other factors.

  <list-item id="o0055">
   <label>3.</label>
   <p id="p0400">
    <italic>Linkage factors (Zone-III):</italic> Factors that have a strong dependence power and strong driving power are known as linkage factors. They establish the connections between the dependent and the driving factors. In this study factor 3 (illegal wildlife trade), factor 5 (urbanization &amp; carbon footprint) and factor 14 (human food consumption habits) were found to be the linkage factors.

  <list-item id="o0060">
   <label>4.</label>
   <p id="p0405">
    <italic>Driving or Independent factors (Zone-IV):</italic> Factors that have a strong driving power, but weak dependence power are driving factors or independent factors. In this study factor 4 (expanding human population), factor 10 (globalization), factor 11 (civil unrests), factor 6 (human habitation to naive environments) and factor 9 (interconnectedness &amp; human migration) were found to be the driving or key factors.
