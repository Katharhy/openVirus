<p id="p0380">Loss of bio-diversity is a trigger to virulent pathogen emergence when natural reservoir hosts face threats to their existence and adaptation in multiple hosts and related mutations of significant survival value. Large scale habitat destruction and changes in land utilization patterns, pollution and poaching, result in habitat losses, decreases in species diversity and number, shifts in reservoir hosts of pathogens, species extinction, that may converge to result in severe ecological destruction, ecosystem de-stabilization and climate changes (F2). The climate changes and ecosystem imbalances combined with intensive agriculture frequently results in increases in antibiotic resistant strains in farm animals and in humans. The interspecies adaptability of infectious agents and adaptive mutations of the microbial genome to gain multi-species adaptability and immune surveillance inside the host may trigger the pathogen to achieve pandemic potential (F12).</p>
