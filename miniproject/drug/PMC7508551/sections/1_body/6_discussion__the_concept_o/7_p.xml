By learning from previous pandemics, and their much-discussed causative factors, we should look deeply into the ‘inner fires we have created on mother Earth’, which has led to the emergence of pandemic diseases. The concept of ‘planetary health’ has emerged instead of human health, as the repeated lashes of pandemics like COVID-19 challenge us to come out of our attitude of supremacy over other species, and become increasingly be motivated to respect, care for and protect nature and other fellow creatures for the short and long-term future so, generations after generations will also have sustainable futures on this planet!</p>
