<p id="p0465">The ‘adaptive selection’ of this genetic changes contributed to the evolution and emergence of pandemic pathogens with high mutation rates, like the Corona-family viruses. The selective mutations may help them to emerge and re-emerge repeatedly in various geographical locations, by passing through multiple host species, adapting to wide ecological niches, and carefully escaping the host’s immune system’s surveillance as was documented in the genome mutations of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
