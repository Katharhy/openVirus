<p id="p0280">To identify and categorize the triggering factors that contribute to disease ecology, especially repeated emergence of disease pandemics, a theory building approach,“Total Interpretive Structural Modeling,” (TISM) was used to obtain insights into the interrelationships among factors that trigger frequencies of emerging infectious diseases and their increased spreading from epidemics to pandemics. Many researchers have used TISM to analyze inter-relationships in manufacturing and service industries [

The tool, ‘Impact Matrix Cross-Reference Multiplication Applied to a Classification’ analysis (MICMAC) was applied to rank the risk factors based on their impacts on other factors and on the interdependence among them. This mathematical modeling tool clearly explains the strength, position and interconnectedness of each anthropogenic factor that contributes to the evolution of pathogens and to the frequent emergence of pandemics which needs to be addressed with immediate priority.
