<p id="p0260">Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) [
 <xref rid="bib117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>] is a theory building approach used to analyze the interrelationship among the factors in complex situations. ISM is a structural model which indicates how these factors are linked in a hierarchical manner. The overall structure of the factor’s relationships are captured in a graphical model. Any theory building approach should address the basic questions of what, why when and how [
 <xref rid="bib118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. The ISM approach answers to the what, why and when questions, but it is lacking of ‘how’ these relationships are happened. ISM is developed further by Sushil [
 <xref rid="bib119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>] as Total Interpretive Structural Modeling (TISM). The TISM answers the question ‘how’. TISM approach articulates the interrelationship between factors and detailed interpretation among the factors are captured. The ‘what’ question has been answered by the identification of the causative factors that were found to be influential in the disease ecology of repeatedly emerging infectious diseases through literature sources, ‘how’ and ‘why’ question has been answered by the capturing the interrelationships among factors and hierarchal structure of factors using TISM approach.
