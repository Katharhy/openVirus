 <xref rid="bib121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>], have used TISM to explore the relationships between various factors that have a significant influence on the loyalty of customers in the area of cloud computing. Likewise, Shibin et al. [
 <xref rid="bib122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>], have explored the use of the TISM technique so as to study factors that both facilitate and hinder the occurrence of flexible green supply chain management. Likewise, Balaji and Arshinder [
 <xref rid="bib123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>] have attempted to understand the factors responsible for wastage of food, in the context of the Indian food chain of perishable nature. The TISM technique helps the researchers to create a network of relationships between various factors, something that subsequently allows them to understand the inherent structural nature of the model. Sehgal et al. [
 <xref rid="bib124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>], also have used TISM to model the most critical factors responsible for the success of virtual network operators in the mobile platform, in the context of the telecommunication market in India.
