<p id="p0430">The authors identified fourteen risk factors that influence pandemic re-emergence through literature review and based upon data from expertâ€™s opinions. The TISM approach was used to list the factors influencing the emergence of infectious diseases and to identify the links among them. Factors were ranked according to their order of importance and a hierarchy was established using the MICMAC analysis. The results revealed that changes in any individual factor in the study could directly or indirectly help to cause repeated epidemics. Expanding human populations, globalization, and civil unrest were the top factors. Also, human habitation of naive environments and interconnectedness and human migration were found to be driving or key factors according to this model. These factors were independently and interdependently found to impose a strong impact on the increased frequency of emergence of epidemics.</p>
