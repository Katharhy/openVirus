<p id="p0105">Host defence patterns are as important as the mutation and evolution of the pathogen in emergence of virulent strains. The immune-competency of the host is an important factor of infections [
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. More research should be done to understand the species barrier, such that, pathogens are harmless to their natural hosts, while they can cause serious damage to other species [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Several factors influence the host’s susceptibility to an epidemic. For example, chemotherapy for cancer, age, underlying diseases, obesity related diseases, malnutrition and chronic infections are important factors that influence viral impacts. Host’s defences may be reduced by immune-suppression due to diseases like HIV/AIDS or ‘iatrogenic’ or medicine induced immune-mediated diseases and transplantation and is well documented with COVID 19 [
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Lack of proper vaccinations and cross-immune protection (For example, yellow fever and dengue fever; smallpox and monkeypox etc exhibits cross protection) can also contribute to increased susceptibility of a host to a newly emerging pathogen [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The cross-immunity among the different strains of an infectious agent or among different pathogens can reduce the replication of a pathogen inside a host, emergence and spread of novel viruses.
