For example, in the USA and Europe, the changes in distribution patterns observed in vector-borne diseases, such as tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), malaria and Lyme disease or Lyme borreliosis (LB) was associated with human impacts on the landscape that triggered tick populations to multiply significantly by increasing both their habitat and wildlife hosts, which led to the emergence of LB in USA and Europe, with high transmission rates [
