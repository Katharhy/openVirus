<p id="p0155">Human population explosion and globalization have increased inter-connectivity and migration, opening global markets for wildlife trade, which enhances the spread of zoonotic pathogens globally. Increasing human populations are causing increased strains on the resources, increasing civil unrest, and war &amp; famine, all of which contribute to political and ecological migration of people. These migrants, who often live-in high-density slums or inhabited forest lands increase the probability of humanâ€“animal contact and accelerate global spread of zoonotic diseases. As human population density increases, greater crowding and contact rates occur with increase in contaminated air and water that catalyzes spreading of infectious diseases [

These pressures also have impacts on the ecosystem services due to changes in land-use patterns, deforestation, increased fossil carbon footprints of urbanization, that result in ecosystem destabilization and to climate changes that accelerate the evolution and spreading of pathogens and their vectors [
