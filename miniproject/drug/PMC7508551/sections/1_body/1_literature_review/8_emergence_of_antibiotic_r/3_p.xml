<p id="p0145">Since 1940, 40% of emerging infectious diseases identified in Asia documented the emergence of a new pattern of antimicrobial resistance [

According to the WHO, excessive use of antibiotic drugs in human and animals result in a post-antibiotic era where pathogens of treatable diseases come back as more virulent. In addition to the overuse of antibiotic drugs, growing human population and climate changes contribute to antibiotic resistance [

 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].The routine prophylactic use of antibiotics in crowded, unhealthy, conditions may decrease animal infections, but at the same time the microbial diversity within the livestock may be reduced and antibiotic resistant superbugs will be selected. For example, Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) transmission from pigs to humans and Swine-associated MRSA can cause an invasive disease in human patients [
