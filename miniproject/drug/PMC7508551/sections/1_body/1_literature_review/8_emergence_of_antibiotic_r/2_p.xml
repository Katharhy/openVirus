<p id="p0140">The use of antibiotics is a significant concern in contemporary livestock production. Antibiotic usage in livestock is very common because they protect the animals from diseases and death due to infections. Repeated use of antibiotics causes elimination of a number of resident strains from the hostâ€™s gut, leading to the gradual emergence of antibiotic resistant pathogen strains. Natural host microbial communities and their diversities are important as they have a protective effect, as it suppresses the growth of resistant pathogenic microbial strains.</p>
