<p id="p0190">Losses of islands, wet-lands, plains and natural forests due to human habitation, are having strong impacts on ecosystems. These changes displace resident species by limiting their habitats and food sources, which encourage the introduced species to out-compete native organisms and to gradually displace them. When the human populations expand into previously uninhabited na√Øve terrains, they come in contact with wild animals which carry organisms naturally, and can cause diseases in man. For example, Lassa fever, an acute viral disease found endemic in West African countries of Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Liberia, and Guinea, was transmitted to humans because people destroyed the forest and converted the land to intensive agricultural production [
