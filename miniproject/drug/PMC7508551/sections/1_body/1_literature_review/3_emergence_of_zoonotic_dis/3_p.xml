<p id="p0075">The pathways of zoonoses have not yet been analyzed comprehensively and quantitatively. The increasing imbalance created in the human-animal-ecosystem interface, increases the potential risks of zoonoses. Wild-life hunting &amp; trading, interactions between wild and domestic animals and wildlife species adapted to human-modified environments [

 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], migration of infected wild birds, transportation of infected domestic or farmed animals, and loss of biodiversity, have contributed to the ‘spill over’ and spread of zoonotic diseases and persistence of respective pathogens. Pathogens have evolved from closely related species, for example, in the case of HIV (Chimpanzees to Humans) or by species which are distant from humans in genetic homology, but having close contact as part of animal farming or exposure in the wild, have resulted in transmission of disease causing pathogens from wild animals to humans.
