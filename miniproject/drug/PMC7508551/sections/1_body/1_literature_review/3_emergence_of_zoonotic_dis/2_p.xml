<p id="p0070">A zoonosis is any disease or infection, microbial or viral, that is naturally transmissible from vertebrate animals to humans; thus, in nature, animals maintain zoonotic infections. Looking at the pandemic outbreaks of the last few decades, it is evident that approximately 75% of emerging diseases including the major pandemics like, HIV, Ebola virus, Zika, avian &amp; swine influenza, SARS-CoV, MERS and the COVID-19 were all zoonotic in origin [
