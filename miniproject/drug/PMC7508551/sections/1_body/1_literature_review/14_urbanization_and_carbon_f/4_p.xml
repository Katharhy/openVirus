<p id="p0220">Urbanization followed by commercialization and industrialization increases the usage of fossil fuels. Although urban areas cover only 0.4–0.9% of the global land surfaces, they contribute 70% of carbon emission causing increases in the earth’s atmospheric temperatures, that are resulting in dramatic climate changes in increased frequencies and severities of catastrophic weather events, flooding, water shortages and disturbed ecosystems. In addition to urbanization, globalization, human habitation to naïve environments, deforestation, habitat losses, pollution and the resulting destruction of nature and consequent imbalances, all contribute to increased carbon footprint impacts that are causing climate changes and global warming.</p>
