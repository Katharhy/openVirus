<p id="p0225">Global warming causes changes in the epidemiology of infectious diseases by influencing three factors. Changes in behavior and susceptibility of the human host population, changes, in the abundance and distribution patterns of vector populations, and the genomic changes of causative infectious agents. Changes, in the climate may cause crop failures and famines that result in malnutrition and reduced host resistance to infections. Compounding this, higher temperatures may shorten the extrinsic incubation periods of pathogens like dengue and yellow fever viruses leading to more rapid epidemic/pandemic spread. All these contribute or trigger human migration to better places of suitable climatic conditions [
