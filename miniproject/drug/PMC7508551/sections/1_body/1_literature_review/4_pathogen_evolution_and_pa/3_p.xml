<p id="p0090">Rapid mutations are an important adaptation for pathogens as it results in their evolution and spreading among the same types of hosts and jumping to other host species. The absence of proof reading capacity of viral RNA replicases can generate swarms of genetic variants of progeny viruses which undergo selection pressures for fitness to bypass the host’s immune system [

These mutations include mutations in the viral genome which helps it to overcome the host’s immune surveillance and other host resistant factors which interfere with their replication inside the host cell. The adaptive mutations also strengthen host-specific receptor structure modifications to ease cellular entry to new host species. Viral genetic recombination or re-assortment is another factor contributing to virulence. The co-infection of closely related viral species in the same host cell can also have a role in the emergence of new viruses by re-assortment [
