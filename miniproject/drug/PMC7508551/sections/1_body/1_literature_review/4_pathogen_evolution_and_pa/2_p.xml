<p id="p0085">Diverse factors are responsible for the evolution of a pathogen into an infectious agent which can adapt in multiple hosts and ecological niches, thereby, making it more virulent to humans (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). The ‘evolvability’ of a virus, is contributed by the mutation rates of its genome which help the virus to create anti-immunity in the host. It helps the virus to jump from one host to another and also supports or increases its replication rate inside the host and virulence [
