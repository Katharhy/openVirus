<p id="p0095">Environmental factors like changes in climate and habitat can trigger changes in reservoir host populations or intermediate insect vectors, which can contribute to evolution of the pathogen and result in disease emergence, such as in the case of Lyme borreliosis (LB) which, spread as a consequence of reforestation, habitat loss and climate change. The Lyme disease is caused by a spirochete in the genus ‘Borrelia’ which, shuttles between an arthropod vector, usually a tick, and a mammalian, usually deer or avian populations. In the last century, deforestation as part of industrialization followed by reforestation resulted in fluctuations in deer populations due to reduction in predator species and hunting. This changes in the ‘pathogen’s host populations’ triggered the emergence and re-emergence of Lyme disease [
