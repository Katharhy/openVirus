<p id="p0135">Unsustainable use of resources, water and air pollution caused by the waste products and methane gas production, biocide and fertilizer manufacture and use for feed production, etc, make industrial farming a potential triggering factor to global environmental degradation. Deforestation for planting monocultures for feeding livestock results in habitat losses and reduced species diversity and greater susceptibility to plant and/or animal disease epidemics or pandemics [

Transforming a species diverse tropical rain forest into a monoculture of coconut palms or soybeans or sugarcane, makes the monoculture vulnerable to new strains or types of pathogens, reduce species diversity and gradually ecological instability may happen.
