<p id="p0130">Reduction of genetic diversity among livestock, mixed species cultures (like pig farm, cattle farm and poultry together), loss of traditional breeds, and antibiotic resistance, influence the genetic evolution and cause the emergence of zoonotic pathogens easier. When livestock are exposed to wild species which are natural reservoirs of several pathogens, if ‘spill over’ happens from a wild species to a suitable host with high densities and very little genetic variability, the pathogen may flourish in the new host [

For example, the 1998–1999 Nipah virus outbreaks in Malaysia, once the virus crossed from wild fruit bats to high-density domestic swine farms with very small genetic diversity, an explosive outbreak of the Nipah virus resulted in widespread exposure of humans [
