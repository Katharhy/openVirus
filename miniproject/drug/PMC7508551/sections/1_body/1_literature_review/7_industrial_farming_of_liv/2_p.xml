<p id="p0125">Escalating global demands on the production of high-protein/high-energy animal feed resulted in intensified animal production. Commercial large-scale, industrial farming operations for production of dairy products, meat and other animal products are increasing risks of zoonotic disease transmission. Such monocultures often have negative impacts on animals that are grown or raised in suboptimal conditions without properly addressing the inherent issues of waste management and animal welfare [

Whereas in the wild, due to broader genetic diversity, this infectious agent is less likely to spread as rapidly, often ends in limited number of hosts; this leads to lower potential for it to cause a pandemic [
