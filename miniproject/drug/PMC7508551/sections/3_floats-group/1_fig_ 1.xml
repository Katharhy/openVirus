  <p>Several factors contribute to the adaptive evolution of infectious agents to spread into different ecological niches, adapt to new hosts, escape from host defense mechanisms and spread globally. They are broadly categorized in three major factors; host factors, microbial factors and environmental factors (
   <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Rapid genetic mutation is an adaptation for pathogen evolution and emergence. Viral genetic recombination or re-assortment is another factor contributing their degree of virulence. The co-infection by closely related viral species in the same host cell can have a role in the emergence of new virus strains by re-assortment. Environmental factors like changes in climate, habitat etc along with host factors can also trigger changes in reservoir host populations or intermediate vectors which can contribute to pathogen evolution and emergence of epidemics or pandemics.
