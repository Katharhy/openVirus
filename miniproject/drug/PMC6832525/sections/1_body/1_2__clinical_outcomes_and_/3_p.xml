<p>The host immune response is a believed to contribute to the severity of the “toxic phase”, but approaches targeting the host’s immune response in severe YFV disease are lacking. When patients present with severe symptoms, the therapeutic window of IFNs and other immune modulators may have already passed [

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot1-viruses-11-00960">Section 3.1</xref>) have not been evaluated but represent promising avenues for further investigation. In summary, many potential candidates for treatment of YFV-induced symptoms have been identified, although none are currently licensed. The toxicity and efficacy of promising anti-YFV therapeutics should be further investigated in animal studies and clinical trials.
