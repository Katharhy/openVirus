<p>More recently, as NGS technology has advanced, hand-held nanopore sequencing devices (MinION, Oxford Nanopore) have been deployed to monitor viral outbreaks, including the West African 2013-16 EBOV outbreak [

 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In combination with the ION Torrent and Illumina platforms, MinION sequencing was utilized to provide insights into the molecular epidemiology of the 2016â€“2017 YFV outbreak in Brazil, generating data spatially correlating infections of humans with infection of non-human primates [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These data indicate that vector-mediated transmission in the Brazilian outbreak was dominated by continued primate-to-human transmission rather than a human-to-human transfer often observed in explosive African outbreaks. While future outbreaks are inevitable, rapid identification of YFV as the causative agent and subsequent real-time tracking of epidemics can be facilitated by recent advances in NGS technologies and phylogenetics [
 <xref rid="B231-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">231</xref>], enhancing effective outbreak management, including coordinating vaccination programs and vector eradication campaigns. Additionally, in future outbreaks, viral sampling could be coupled with serological markers of infection (anti-YFV antibodies) and patient DNA bio-banking to enable stratification of host-genetic correlates of YFV infection outcomes, and correlation with host single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). It is likely that host genetics underlie the range of clinical symptoms observed in YFV infection, which include subclinical, symptomatic, severe and fatal outcomes. However, significant challenges to wide-spread implementation of the strategies outlined above should not be underestimated. High costs associated with NGS, coupled with underdeveloped infrastructure in the majority of YFV-endemic countries remain logistical obstacles to overcome.
