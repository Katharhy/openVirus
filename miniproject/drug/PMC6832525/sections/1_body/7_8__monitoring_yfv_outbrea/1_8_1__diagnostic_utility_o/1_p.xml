<p>The use of NGS technologies allows recovery of complete viral genomic sequences directly from infected patientsâ€™ material, and these metagenomic approaches have revolutionized infectious disease outbreak diagnostics and surveillance in recent years [
 <xref rid="B225-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>]. In Africa and South America, YFV co-circulates with multiple endemic VHFs which can emerge in humans sporadically, complicating initial diagnosis. These include Ebola viruses (EBOV), Marburg virus (MARV), Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), Junin virus (JUNV) and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHFV). The diagnostic capacity of NGS to discriminate between hemorrhagic fever viruses from diverse families and orders, including the
