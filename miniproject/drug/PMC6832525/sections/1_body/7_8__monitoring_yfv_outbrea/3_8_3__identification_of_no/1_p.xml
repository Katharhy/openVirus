<p>YFV represents a zoonotic pathogen: while many zoonotic viruses cause severe pathology in humans, tolerance and absence of disease is often observed in reservoir species [
 <xref rid="B235-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">235</xref>]. After long periods of absence, sporadic and often explosive YFV outbreaks occur in endemic regions, initiated by vector-mediated spillover from jungle primates when environmental conditions are favorable. This pattern of emergence poses the question of whether, in addition to described host- and vector-species, other as yet unidentified animal or arthropod species can act as reservoirs for YFV. Vertical transmission of YFV between mosquitos has been reported [
 <xref rid="B236-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">236</xref>,
 <xref rid="B237-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">237</xref>]. While transmission rates are low (~1%), this capacity could maintain YFV reservoirs during dry periods which are not favorable for transmission [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It has been suggested that primate density is often not sufficient to maintain stable sylvatic transmission, and YFV reservoirs in non-primate species could maintain inter-epidemic YFV [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Indeed, serum neutralizing antibodies for YFV were detected in ten forest mammal species from French Guiana, including members of the divergent orders Rodentia and Carnivora, the superorder Xenarthra, as well as multiple primate species [
 <xref rid="B143-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. Thus, the breadth of YFV species-specificity remains to be determined. To further investigate this, extensive sampling and NGS screening of jungle species in YFV endemic regions could be undertaken, potentially identifying novel animal reservoirs which silently maintain YFV transmission between intermittent outbreaks. In summary, future YFV outbreaks can be rapidly identified and epidemics monitored at high resolution using NGS to inform containment strategies. This technology also lends itself to tracking intra-host evolution and the identification of novel animal reservoirs.
