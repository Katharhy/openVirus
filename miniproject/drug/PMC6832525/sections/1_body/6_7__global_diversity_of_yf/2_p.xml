<p>While clinical YFV isolates can be readily propagated in tissue culture, the majority of studies utilize the YFV-17D vaccine strain which has atypical properties [
 <xref rid="B78-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], or its wild-type progenitor, the Asibi strain, representing only a small fraction of the global YFV diversity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00960-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). Consequently, the phenotypic correlates of YFV global sequence diversity are incompletely defined and future studies should address this discrepancy: it is currently unknown whether infection with isolates from different YFV lineages contributes to differential pathogenicity or mortality rates in humans. However, in spite of these deep-divergences apparent in the YFV phylogeny, the 17D vaccine provides robust protection against strains from all known YFV lineages.
