<p>Out of the three domains of the YFV E protein, DIII is suspected to mediate interaction with cellular receptors during infection [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. While flavivirus entry into target cells is incompletely defined, many host molecules have been implicated in the process. These include CD209 and the mannose receptor for DENV entry [
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 6 (GRK6) for WNV entry [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The related GRK2 was reported to both promote YFV entry and enhance viral RNA synthesis, properties which were conserved across key members of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, including DENV and HCV [
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The transmembrane immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM) and TAM (Tyro3, Axl and Mer) families of phosphatidylserine receptors have been shown to mediate DENV infection, with TIM-1 and TIM-4 also enhancing infection rates for WNV and YFV-17D to differing degrees, while herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection rates were unaffected [
 <xref rid="B67-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Therefore, these cellular factors represent general enhancers of flavivirus infection. Additionally, candidates implicated in YFV host-cell attachment include heparin sulfate, a member of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) family, which also facilitates attachment for the related flaviviruses DENV [
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) [
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], as well as unrelated viruses, including HSV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="B71-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Indeed, the antiviral effect of PI-88, a heparin sulfate mimetic, was demonstrated against DENV and neurotropic flaviviruses [
 <xref rid="B72-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Despite reports of multiple factors which are potentially involved in YFV entry, it is still unknown whether a ubiquitous cellular receptor is responsible for facilitating flavivirus infection of permissive cells [
 <xref rid="B73-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Similarly to DENV, YFV is able to infect a range of cell-types from diverse host species, indicating either binding to a ubiquitous cell-surface receptor, or the ability to engage multiple distinct receptors [
 <xref rid="B74-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. RNAi screening has revealed many potential host factors influencing WNV or DENV infection of human or drosophila cell-lines [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Analogous to mammalian CD209, an 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> C-type lectin, mosGCTL-7, has been described as an entry factor for JEV [
 <xref rid="B76-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Previous studies already identified mosGCTL-1 and mosPTP-1 as cascade receptors facilitating flaviviral entry in mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="B77-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Thus, distinct flaviviruses may use conserved entry factor(s) for entry into permissive cells in mosquito vector species.
