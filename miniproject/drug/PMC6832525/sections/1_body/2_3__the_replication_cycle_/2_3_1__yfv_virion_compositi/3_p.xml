<p>To date, only the structure of the immature YFV particle has been resolved, with the architecture of mature virions containing a processed (pr)M protein still outstanding [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. By facilitating virus entry into target cells and determining the global structure of the virion, the YFV E is essential for infection. Thus, it represents an ideal target for an intervention at an early state of infection, e.g., using a structure-based drug design or E-targeted monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Antiviral mAbs represent viable therapeutic options, including palivizumab (marketed as Synagis), which is licensed for use against RSV in humans [
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], and a number of anti-HIV mAbs in clinical trials [

 <xref rid="B62-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In most cases, therapeutic mAbs interfere with virus entry via targeting the envelope glycoprotein(s), thus preventing further dissemination. However, currently, while mAb based therapies have proven effective, they are also expensive, which limits their widespread application in the resource constrained settings where YFV epidemics often occur.
