<p>The potent anti-E monoclonal antibody 5A identified in [
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] was able to neutralize divergent YFV strains (YFV-17D and Angola lineage) [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The mAb 5A recognizes a conserved region within DII, which is accessible in both the pre- and post-fusion states of the virus. It is suggested that mAb 5A interferes at three stages during YFV infection: (A) by inhibition of virus attachment due to modifying the spatial distance between the E protein and host receptors; (B) by entering early endosomes and inhibiting the “dimer-to-trimer transition” of the E protein by blocking membrane fusion and therefore, blocking the release of nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm and; (C) by binding the E protein trimers in their post-fusion state [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Structural and functional studies have suggested conformational change from a dimeric to a trimeric state, which is induced by acidification of endosomes (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00960-f002">Figure 2</xref>B) and leads to a release of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm via E protein-mediated fusion of virus and endosomal membranes [

 <xref rid="B58-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In the post-fusion state, the fusion peptide is located at the apex of the trimer (see
