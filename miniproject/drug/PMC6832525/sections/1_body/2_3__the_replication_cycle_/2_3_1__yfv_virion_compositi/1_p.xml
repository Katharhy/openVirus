<p>The YFV virion is spherical in shape, with a 40–60 nm diameter [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The virion is composed of host-hijacked lipid membranes associated with three virally encoded structural proteins. These include the highly basic core protein (C) which binds and encapsidates the YFV RNA genome [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and two envelope glycoproteins: prM/M (membrane) and E (envelope). The transmembrane domains of prM and E act as membrane anchors and also represent ER retention signals [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The E protein of YFV represents a class II fusion protein, which possesses structural homology with the ectodomains of the envelope proteins from divergent arboviruses (related flaviviruses and unrelated alphaviruses), despite no obvious amino acid conservation [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The E protein facilitates YFV entry into permissive cells, mediating the interaction between the virus and cell surface receptors, and also elicits host neutralizing antibody responses. YFV E consists of three domains: DI, DII and DIII (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00960-f002">Figure 2</xref>A, upper panel). In the pre-fusion state, the E protein forms dimeric structures. DII contains a highly conserved 16 amino acid fusion peptide motif (DRGWGNGCGLFGKGSI) (

 <xref rid="B50-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and can be found in a parallel orientation to the virion’s lipid envelope in the pre-fusion state (See 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00960-f002">Figure 2</xref>A, lower panel). DIII harbors epitopes essential for neutralization of YFV [

 <xref rid="B52-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, antibody repertoire cloning from YFV patients also identified key neutralizing epitope residues in domains I (residue 71) and II (residues 153-5), which likely combine to form a conformational epitope [
