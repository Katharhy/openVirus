<p>After entry and uncoating, viral RNA is transported to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and translated as a single polyprotein precursor. Host factors RPLP1 and RPLP2, phosphoproteins that bind to ribosomes, are essential for efficient ribosomal translation of the YFV polyprotein and have panflaviviral activity [
 <xref rid="B82-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. The YFV polyprotein is post-translationally modified by cellular glycosyltransferases, and the liberation of ten mature viral proteins is mediated by both host and viral proteases [
 <xref rid="B83-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,
 <xref rid="B84-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. The processed polyprotein produces three structural proteins which comprise the virion (see above) and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [
 <xref rid="B85-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] which are involved in viral RNA replication on ER membranes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00960-f003">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00960">Table S1</xref>). After translation of the genome, a domain of the RdRp NS5 binds to a promotor sequence on the stem-loop A (SLA) at 5’ end of 5’ untranslated region (UTR) to promote the synthesis of uncapped negative-sense RNA, which is produced at low levels from the positive-sense RNA template [

 <xref rid="B87-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Flavivirus positive-stranded RNA genomes are similar to vertebrate mRNAs, although they differ in critical aspects: they possess a methylated type 1 cap structure at the 5′-terminus (me
 <sup>7</sup>-GpppA-me
 <sup>2</sup>) and lack a polyadenylation signal at the 3′-terminus. The type 1 cap is synthesized by virally encoded proteins: an NS3-encoded RNA triphosphatase [
 <xref rid="B88-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] and the two NS5-encoded enzymes: methyltransferase [
 <xref rid="B89-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>,
 <xref rid="B90-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] and guanylyltransferase [
 <xref rid="B91-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. NS3 and NS5 possess additional functions and constitute the core of the flaviviral RNA replication complex [
 <xref rid="B85-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] which occurs on ER membranes [
 <xref rid="B92-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Indeed, DENV NS3 and NS5 were identified on the virus-induced membrane vesicles of the ER, which are open to the cytoplasm [
 <xref rid="B93-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. A serine protease encoded at the N-terminus of NS3 is involved in cleavage of multiple NS protein junctions [
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] and requires the NS2B cofactor for its activity [
 <xref rid="B95-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. NS3 also possesses a C-terminally encoded NTPase/RNA helicase to remove viral RNA secondary structures and double-strand RNA (dsRNA) intermediates, generated by NS5 during virus replication [
 <xref rid="B96-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. The flavivirus NS5 protein encodes the viral RdRp, synthesizing negative-stranded RNA, which forms a double-stranded complex with the genomic template [
 <xref rid="B97-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Experiments with DENV demonstrated that the phosphorylation of NS5 controls the interaction with NS3 [
 <xref rid="B98-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Furthermore, mutation of the phosphorylation site on YFV NS5 (S56) disrupted the capping process via inhibition of the methyltransferase activity and inhibited viral replication [
 <xref rid="B99-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. NS1, NS2A, NS4A and NS4B represent hydrophobic membrane proteins which modify the structure of the ER, creating a scaffold that anchors the replicase complex during virus assembly, although their precise functions remain unclear [
