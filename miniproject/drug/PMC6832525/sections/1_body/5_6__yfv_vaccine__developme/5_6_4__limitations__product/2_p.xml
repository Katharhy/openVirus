<p>Despite the protective nature of the YFV-17D vaccine against potentially fatal hemorrhagic fever, there are certain contraindications, including children aged less than 9 months or 6 months during an epidemic, pregnant women, lactating women, people with severe immunodeficiency due to symptomatic HIV or the presence of thymus disorder, and hypersensitivity to chicken eggs [

 <xref rid="B187-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. In addition, there are common side effects of the vaccine, ranging from muscle aches, chills, flu-like symptoms, joint pain, mild fever, mild rash, muscle weakness and swelling at the injection site. Using transcriptomic and metabolic profiling of 17D-204 vaccinees, it has recently been demonstrated that symptomatic outcomes to vaccination were associated with baseline endoplasmic reticulum stress and reduced tricarboxcylic acid cycle activity, initiating downstream proinflammatory responses [

 <xref rid="B194-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>]. In severe cases, memory loss, problems with breathing, behavioral changes, seizures, viscerotropic disease, encephalitis and death can occur. In addition, the vaccine is known to interact with about 42 drugs, but overall, the risk of developing adverse effects from vaccination is low. The causes of serious adverse events to vaccination were previously unknown. However, recent studies implicated abnormal immune responses and identified patient-specific polymorphisms in immune-associated gene loci, including
