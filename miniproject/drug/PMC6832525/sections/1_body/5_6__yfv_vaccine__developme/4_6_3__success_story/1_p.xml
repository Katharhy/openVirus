<p>The 17D vaccine has been in use for over 75 years. Over 600 million doses have been administered to date, although rare cases of serious adverse reactions are described [
 <xref rid="B162-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. Remarkably, very few cases of vaccine failure have been documented due to its near-global sero-conversion rate in human vaccinees and induction of persistent immunity [
 <xref rid="B174-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. Due to its success, the YF vector backbone is currently being trialed as an antigen delivery platform for other experimental vaccines including HIV-1, Lassa fever, malaria and DENV [

However, when Angola was hit by urban outbreak which spread to neighboring countries, including in the Democratic Republic of the Congoâ€™s capital Kinshasa, the epidemic created an urgent need for more than 28 million doses of the YFV vaccine, exhausting the existing global vaccine supply [

 <xref rid="B185-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>]. In order to maximize the impact of limited vaccine supplies in a context of depleted global stockpiles, fractional doses of YFV vaccine were administered. Because promising data were available on the immunogenicity of fractional dosing, 10 million individuals were immunized with 2 million doses of 17DD [
