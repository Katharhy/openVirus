<p>In summary, in addition to vaccination, vector control is imperative: one should also consider therapeutic options and not just rely on prophylactic vaccines. Fractional dosing for other strains needs to be validated for future outbreaks, and there is a need to manage the potential risk of YFV introduction to Asia. In the coming decade, vaccine manufacturers are expected to meet the global demand of 1.38 billion doses needed to eliminate the risk of YF epidemics [

Hence, novel manufacturing techniques to produce large quantities of yellow fever vaccine at short notice are required which also eliminate the chicken embryo proteins that lead to allergic reactions. The mechanism by which YFV-17D mediates protection against the virus is not well defined. This is due, in part, to the limited animal models available to evaluate vaccine-induced immune responses [
