<p>YFV is the prototypic flavivirusâ€”a zoonotic pathogen which is responsible for continuing outbreaks of VHF in tropical regions. Recent epidemics in Angola and Brazil serve to underline that the threat from this re-emerging pathogen remains high despite the long-standing availability of a protective vaccine. Scaling back of vector control programs, low vaccine coverage and limitations on vaccine production impedes effective management of outbreaks. Furthermore, rapid global warming, coupled with increasing urbanization and globalization, is expanding permissive mosquito ranges and increasing the potential for future outbreaks. Therefore, intensification of basic YFV research is imperative to expand current knowledge of the complex viral life cycle and stimulate the development of novel anti-YFV therapeutics targeted at both the virus and the host. Additionally, disentangling immune correlates of YFV-induced pathogenesis versus protection, addressing bottlenecks associated with vaccine production, real-time surveillance of outbreaks and genetic modification of vector species to reduce YFV permissiveness can all contribute to future efforts aimed at reducing mortality rates associated with YFV epidemics.</p>
