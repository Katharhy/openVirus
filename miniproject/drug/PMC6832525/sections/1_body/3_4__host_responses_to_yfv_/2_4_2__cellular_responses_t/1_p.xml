<p>Dendritic cells (DCs) are essential antigen-presenting cells, recognizing pathogens by toll-like receptors (TLRs) to trigger maturation and the induction of adaptive immunity and immunological memory. The activation of DCs by YFV-17D through TLR 2, 7, 8 and 9 was shown to induce a broad range of innate and adaptive responses [
 <xref rid="B116-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) rapidly secrete large amounts of type I-IFNs to modulate effector molecules and cell populations of the innate and adaptive immune system. YFV also was shown to induce the production of IFN-γ and type III-IFNs from pDCs via interaction with TLR7 or cell contact, and immature virions were more efficient at stimulating pDCs than mature virions [

YFV NS5 interacts with STAT2 when STAT1 is phosphorylated during type I IFN signaling: the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM23 polyubiquinates NS5, mediating STAT2 binding and subsequent inhibition of IFN signaling [

Human and rhesus macaque monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDC) and macrophages (MDM) were also shown to be susceptible to infection with YFV wild-type Asibi and 17D vaccine strains, with differences in cytokine responses to infection observed between strains. Additionally, only MoDCs infected with YFV-17D could initiate IFN-γ and IL-2 expression in CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, confirming differential patterns of immune induction between attenuated and wild-type YFV [

 <xref rid="B120-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. NK cells were shown to be the highest producers of IFN-γ, which protects against viscerotropic disease in YFV-17D infection but not for wild-type virus, indicating that YFV vaccine attenuation results in increased sensitivity to IFN-γ [
 <xref rid="B121-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Replication of YFV-17D in NK cells was enhanced by STAT1 knockout, although NK cells do not appear to be a major reservoir for YFV replication [
 <xref rid="B122-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. After YFV-17D vaccination, NK expression of TLR3, TLR9 and CD69 increases, concomitant with increased circulating IFN-γ [
 <xref rid="B123-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>] and 17D-YFV infection stimulated vigorous early NK cell responses in vivo primed by type I and III IFNs [
