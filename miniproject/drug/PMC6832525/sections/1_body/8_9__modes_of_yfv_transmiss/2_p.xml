<p>Urban YFV outbreaks are associated with 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> transmission, although the Asian tiger mosquito, 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, is also competent for YFV transmission [
 <xref rid="B238-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">238</xref>]. Both species are invasive, are able to breed in water containers and have drought-resistant eggs. Indeed, the geographical distribution of these important vector species continues to increase, fueled by human population growth, globalization, increasing urbanization and ongoing climate change [
 <xref rid="B239-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">239</xref>], expanding the risk of human exposure to YFV infection. The expansion of the 2016â€“2017 outbreak in Brazil to an area not previously considered endemic for YFV serves to underline this point [

 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, during YFV outbreaks, while isolated cases can be imported from endemic to non-endemic regions [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], continued host-to-host transmission of YFV observed in outbreaks is only possible in geographic regions where competent vector species reside: the disease is not contagious in their absence. This facet of the viral life cycle has been exploited in the past to control and even eradicate YFV from specific regions. While YFV has never been controlled in Africa, vector control programs coupled with the absence of a sylvatic cycle enabled its complete eradication from Europe and North America, where devastating outbreaks were previously common [

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> by the 1960s [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], although this vector species has re-populated the continent due to the cessation of such programs and remains endemic in 13 countries [
 <xref rid="B240-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">240</xref>]. In addition, vector resistance to traditional insecticides has been detected in the major invasive 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> vectors and is becoming an increasing problem [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,

 <xref rid="B242-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>]. Thus, in combination with traditional chemical spraying of vector breeding sites and vaccination campaigns targeted to at-risk people in endemic regions, innovative new strategies for vector control are required to help to manage and reduce the likelihood of future arbovirus outbreaks, including YFV [
