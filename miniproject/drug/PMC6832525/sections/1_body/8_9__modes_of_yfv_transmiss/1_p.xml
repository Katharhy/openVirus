<p>YFV is transmitted by mosquito vectors between primate hosts and transmission to humans in three distinct cycles is possible. 1. The sylvatic or jungle cycle—where epizootic transmission between rainforest primates by jungle-resident mosquito species occurs, with sporadic spillover to forestry workers. This is mediated by multiple 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species in Africa and 
 <italic>Haemogogus</italic> and 
 <italic>Sabethes</italic> species in South America; 2. The intermediate or savannah cycle—occurs in isolated rural communities on the rainforest periphery where infected mosquito species feed simultaneously on both primate and human hosts. In Africa, 
 <italic>Aedes africanus</italic> preferentially feeds on primates while 
 <italic>Aedes simpsonii</italic> feeds indiscriminately on nonhuman primates and humans; 3. The urban cycle—where invasive domesticated mosquitoes (
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>) facilitate YFV transmission from human-to-human in areas of high human and vector population density [
