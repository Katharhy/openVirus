<p>Mosquito population suppression strategies which harness the power of genetic modification include the 
 <underline>r</underline>elease of 
 <underline>i</underline>nsects carrying a 
 <underline>d</underline>ominant 
 <underline>l</underline>ethal gene (RIDL). In trials performed on the Cayman Islands, engineered male 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> RIDL mosquitos (strain OX513A) carrying a dominant lethal transgene were released, resulting in the suppression of wild mosquito numbers [

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> from two test-release sites in China, combining population suppression and population replacement strategies [
 <xref rid="B245-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">245</xref>]. Male mosquitoes artificially infected with Wolbachia 
 <italic>w</italic>Pip strains were unable to produce viable offspring after mating with non-
 <italic>w</italic>Pip infected females, and 
 <italic>w</italic>Pip infected mosquitos of both sexes were less susceptible to infection with the pathogenic flaviviruses DENV and ZIKV [
 <xref rid="B246-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">246</xref>]. Pupal irradiation boosted viable mosquito numbers for use in the trial ten-fold compared to previous conventional manual inspection techniques, and this combined approach was able to substantially reduce both wild mosquito numbers and biting rates at test-sites [

 <xref rid="B246-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">246</xref>]. While the current limitations of approaches outlined above include associated costs, relatively small trial sizes and isolated trial sites, these exiting results pave the way for analogous trials with 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in YFV endemic regions.
