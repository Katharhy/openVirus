<p>YFV continues to pose a very real threat to public health, which has been starkly illustrated by recent outbreaks in Angola in 2015–2016 [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Brazil in 2016–2017 [

 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and associated imports into non-endemic regions [

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This is compounded by a limited vaccine production, which can easily be overwhelmed by a large YFV outbreak, and the collapse of vector control programs [

 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], coupled with large populations of unvaccinated individuals in endemic regions and a lack of effective antivirals for treatment of infected patients [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Indeed, despite long-standing knowledge of YFVs genomic architecture, favorable growth kinetics in tissue culture and the availability of reverse genetic systems [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,

 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], YFV remains a neglected tropical disease attracting relatively little research attention [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This is, in part, due to vaccine availability, which has led to research complacency [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and recent commentaries have highlighted the need for intensification of YFV research, as many facets of the virus life cycle remain poorly defined [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These include determination of vertebrate and arthropod host-ranges, identification of co-opted host factors which are essential for YFV propagation in humans and insects, and identification of genetic markers and associated mechanisms underlying differential pathogenesis and observed clinical outcomes in infected humans.
