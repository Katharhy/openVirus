  <p>YFV genomic and amino acid diversity. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Phylogenetic analysis of YFV genomes. The presented tree was generated using PhyML [
   <xref rid="B220-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">220</xref>] from full-length ORF sequences. Nucleotide sequence alignment (10239 nucleotides) was generated in MEGA7 [
   <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and adjusted manually to ensure maintenance of the polyprotein ORF. Collapsed clades in the YFV phylogeny contain closely related isolates from the 2016–2017 Brazilian outbreak (
   <italic>n</italic> = 52, green triangle), the 2015–2016 Angolan outbreak (
   <italic>n</italic> = 16, red triangle) and 17D vaccine strains (
   <italic>n</italic> = 46, blue triangle). The green filled circles in SAL I (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3) represent YFV sequences isolated from non-human primates during the 2016–2017 Brazilian epidemic, which co-cluster with previously sampled non-outbreak sequences and are antecedent to the main outbreak grouping (green triangle). The statistical robustness of YFV lineages were calculated using the bootstrap approach in MEGA7 [
   <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and values assigned to the branches are percentages derived from 500 replications. Branch lengths are proportional to the scale bar (units: substitutions per site). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Conservation and variability in YFV genomes. Amino acid and underlying nucleotide similarity plots for globally sampled YFV genomes are presented. For the purpose of positional referencing, a cartoon of the YFV reference strain polyprotein is provided directly above, with coordinates of polyprotein cleavage sites for the liberation of mature proteins highlighted. The triangles positioned below indicate the position of the NS3-encoded RNA helicase. Degrees of amino acid or underlying nucleotide or similarity at individual sites/residues in global alignments were calculated in CLC Genomics Workbench (Qiagen Aarhaus) and relative similarities are color-coded according to the scale bars positioned to the right. The associated pie charts indicate the proportion of conserved or variable sites in each dataset. The numbers inset indicate the actual numbers of variable and conserved amino acids or nucleotides in the alignment. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Conservation and variability in the YFV RNA helicase. Amino acid conservation and variability estimated in (
   <bold>B</bold>) were mapped onto the YFV NS3 RNA helicase structure. Relative conservation of amino acids on the helicase structure are color-coded according to the scale bar positioned below. Completely conserved residues are colored black while variable residues highlighted dark green through to orange. The YFV helicase structure presented was described in [
   <xref rid="B221-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">221</xref>] (PDB ID: 1YKS; 440 amino acids) and the conservation and variability were visualized on the structure using UCSF Chimera [
   <xref rid="B222-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>].
