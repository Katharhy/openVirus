  <p>Schematic representation of the YFV genome and encoded polyprotein. The genome of YFV is a single-stranded positive-stranded RNA of approximately 11kb encoding a single ORF containing three structural proteins (C, prM, and E) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). The genome has methylated type 1 cap at the 5′ end and is not polyadenylated. Secondary structures (stem-loop A and B; SLA/SLB) in the 5′ and 3′ UTR are required for translation and RNA synthesis. The polyprotein is post-translationally modified by viral and host proteases into 10 mature proteins which are incorporated into the ER membrane.</p>
