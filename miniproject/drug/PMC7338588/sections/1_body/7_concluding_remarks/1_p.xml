<p>The current global COVID-19 pandemic is a major challenge for all involved in studies of the role of human genetics in the face of a novel infectious disease. Sequencing children and young or middle-aged individuals with severe COVID-19, who are otherwise healthy, will identify rare, deleterious mutations that lead to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe clinical outcome. This will offer unique insights on the disease pathogenesis
