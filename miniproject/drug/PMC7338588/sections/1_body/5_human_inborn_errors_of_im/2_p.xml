<p>It has been proposed that deficient type I IFN production may undermine the innate immune response during early SARS-CoV infection, resulting in a more severe disease course (

 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>) and

 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>). Together, these data highlight the importance of an intact type I IFN pathway in the innate response to SARS-CoV, and it can be reasoned that any genetic mutations that impair this response may somehow predispose to COVID-19 disease progression. Consequently, it is worth considering that clinical outcome may be influenced by mutations of the PRRs and immune signaling pathways involved in recognition of SARS-CoV-2, including RIG-I, MDA5, and TLR3 and downstream IRF3 and IRF7, as well as molecules involved in effector function of type I and III IFN, such as IFNAR1/2 or the janus kinase (JAK) - signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathways.
