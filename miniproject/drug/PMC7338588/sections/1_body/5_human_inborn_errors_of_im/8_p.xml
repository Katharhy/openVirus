<p>Genetic studies have identified polymorphisms in the 
 <italic>IL28B</italic> gene which have been linked to hepatitis C virus (HCV) clearance (
 <xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>). The product of this gene is type III IFN (IFN-λ). Given that genetic variants in IFN-λ appear to play an important role in the natural course of disease and severity during infection with HCV, it will be interesting to investigate if polymorphisms in the 
 <italic>IL28B</italic> gene could also predispose to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Perhaps the most compelling reason to believe that genetic differences may account for the vast diversity in COVID-19 symptoms is a recent preprint study by British researchers who, using a mobile symptom tracker, recorded data from over 2.7 million app users. Analysis of same sex adult twins (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2,000
 <sup>+</sup>) showed that genetic factors accounted for 50% of the difference in COVID-19 symptoms (
 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>). Although the results from the latter studies will need to be verified, these data highlight how genetic differences may explain the great variability in SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome.
