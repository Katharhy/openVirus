<p>As we start to gain further insight into the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and appreciate the major role played by inflammation and immunopathology, this raises the question as to whether there might be an increased risk of developing severe disease in certain individuals, and whether genes predisposing to those conditions should be investigated in a genetic approach. Such genes include 
 <italic>NLRP1, NLRP3, CASP1, MEFV</italic>, and many others, which all encode proteins involved in inflammasome activation (
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>). Focus should also be on known genetic causes of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), including defects in the genes 
 <italic>PRF1, UNC13D, STX11, STXBP2, LYST, RAB27A</italic> (
 <xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>) either in the well-recognized homozygous forms, or possibly in heterozygous forms that may still predispose to HLH in the presence of a trigger, such as SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B165" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>). However, the precise pathogenesis of macrophage activation syndrome and Kawasaki-like disease/PIMS in COVID-19 is not fully understood and may involve autoinflammation, autoimmunity, and/or immunopathology induced directly by the virus or as a secondary result of crossreactivity.
