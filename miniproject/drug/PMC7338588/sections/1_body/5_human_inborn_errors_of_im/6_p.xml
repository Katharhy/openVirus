<p>Based on insight into immunopathogenesis and pathology during COVID-19, potential susceptibility genes may be involved in mechanisms of immune dysregulation, auto-inflammation or autoimmunity, thus involving the gain-of-function or loss of inhibition of various genes and pathways in cytokine and TLR signaling cascades, especially those affecting IL-1 and IL-6 synthesis and production (

 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Likewise, genetic variants in endothelial cell biology and regulation may be anticipated to aggravate coagulopathy and thrombotic events. Specific evidence on such associations remains to be reported but should be part of searches in large unbiased whole exome sequencing approaches, such as the worldwide consortium (
