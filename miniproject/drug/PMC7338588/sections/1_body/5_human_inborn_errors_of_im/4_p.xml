<p>Within adaptive immunity, the impact of PIDs associated with antibody deficiencies and combined immunodeficiencies on SARS-CoV-2 outcomes are not fully clarified. However, some important information may be retrieved from a description of severe lung pathology and COVID-19 disease course in patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) compared to patients with pure agammaglobulinemia (
 <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>). Although the results were based on few patients, it was noted that patients with agammaglobulinemia experienced relatively mild disease. However, patients with similarly low immunoglobulin levels but immune dysregulation as part of CVID experienced more severe disease, suggesting a role of immune dysregulation and abnormal B immune cell phenotype and potentially excessive IL-6 production in COVID-19 pathogenesis, although T cell deficiency may also be involved (

Such data may facilitate understanding of what constitutes an inadequate immune response toward SARS-CoV-2 and from this knowledge determine the molecular and cellular correlates of protective immune responses and immunity in COVID-19.
