<p>At the other end of the disease spectrum, there is the possibility that some individuals may avoid infection due to protective tissue types or gene mutations. The most prominent example to mention is the potential protective role of ACE2 defects, rendering cells restistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection, in analogy to protection from HIV infection by Delta32 
 <italic>CCR5</italic> homozygosity (
 <xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>). Given the important role of host ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we might speculate that 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> genetic polymorphisms may be present in certain individuals, which could be exploited by SARS-CoV-2 and lead to severe clinical disease. Equally, 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> polymorphisms may even offer some level of resistance. Indeed, one study has identified multiple rare genetic variants in 
 <italic>ACE2</italic>, which are predicted to modify virus-host interaction and alter susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>). Another study has also reported rare, genetic variants in 
 <italic>TMPRSS2</italic> as possible disease modulators of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italy (
 <xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>). Although these findings necessitate functional validation, it gives weight to the hypothesis that rare, genetic mutations may explain COVID-19 disease severity.
