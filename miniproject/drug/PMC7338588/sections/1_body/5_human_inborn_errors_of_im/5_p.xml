<p>As to the role of T cells in protection from severe COVID-19, it would be expected that T cell lymphopenia from any source might represent an increased risk of severe viral infection. However, not much evidence suggests that patients with primary T cell defects nor HIV infection are at a significantly elevated risk. When large cohort studies of SARS-infected and MERS-CoV-infected patients from previous epidemics were reviewed, HIV infection was not identified as an independent risk factor for infection by these coronaviruses (
