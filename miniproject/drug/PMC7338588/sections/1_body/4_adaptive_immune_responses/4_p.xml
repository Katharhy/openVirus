<p>The possibility of re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 is a key area of investigation. Individuals who recovered from SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection displayed high tires of antibodies which waned after 2â€“3 years (

 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>). However, a small study of only three SARS-recovered individuals identified SARS-specific memory T cells 11 years after infection (

Finally, the efficacy and longevity of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is highly dependent upon the rate by which the virus alters its composition, i.e., the mutation rate. So far, studies suggest a relatively low virus mutation rate with mutations randomly spread throughout the viral genome, suggesting absence of positive selection toward increased virulence (
