<p>The cell-mediated immune response plays a critical role in antiviral immunity, and developing early and robust CD8
 <sup>+</sup> and in particular, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses correlates well with positive outcomes during SARS-CoV infection (
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>). Clinical investigations of severe COVID-19 patients consistently report neutrophilia and lymphopenia, with significantly depressed CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell counts and decreased IFN-γ expression, as well as reduced numbers of regulatory and memory T cells (

 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>). In addition, increased levels of plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-a) are observed in severe COVID-19 patients, indicative of a cytokine storm and subsequent ARDS development (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). In support of these data, a study of 522 hospitalized COVID-19 patients reported a negative correlation between T cell numbers and serum IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α levels (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>). Furthermore, COVID-19 patients displayed increased expression of the T cell exhaustion markers, programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and Tim-3, compared to healthy controls, suggesting that T cell survival and activation may play a role in protecting the host from severe SARS-CoV-2 development (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>). Studies investigating T cell phenotypes in asymptomatic or convalescent COVID-19 patients have been more limited. However, a recent study (
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>) identified circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in ~70% and 100% of recovered COVID-19 patients, respectively. Importantly, this study reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in healthy donors recruited in 2015–2018 (
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>). These data suggest that there is a cross-reactive coronavirus T cell memory response, but whether such pre-existing immunity influences clinical outcomes remains to be determined.
