<p>A considerable number of studies have demonstrated that infection with SARS-CoV-2 initiates an antibody response. On average, seroconversion is observed between 10 and 14 days post infection, a timeline similar to that observed for the previous SARS-CoV epidemic (

 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>). Serological investigations of 262 hospitalized COVID-19 patients across the Chongqing region, China, reported simultaneous or sequential seroconversion (IgM and IgG) against recombinant antigens containing the nucleoprotein and a peptide from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (

A number of studies have also reported earlier or increased antibody titers in critical vs. non-critical COVID-19 patients, possibly reflecting more severe and invasive infection and thus making it difficult to determine the specific nature of the association (
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>) whereas others report no correlation between disease severity and serum antibody levels (
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>). Such discrepancies between findings may be explained not only by the relatively small number of individuals investigated per study, but also due to the fact that different assays are used in the different studies, likely causing significant sensitivity and specificity challenges (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>). Importantly, however, SARS-CoV-2 isolated from critically ill patients can be neutralized by sera from several patients, a finding that gives weight to the rapid development of therapeutic neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) as a potential means to control the current pandemic (
