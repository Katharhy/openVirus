<p>Cytotoxic T cells are important for clearing respiratory viruses and providing long-term protection; however, the magnitude of this response must be well-controlled to prevent pathological consequences (

 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>). Histological examination of a patient who died from severe SARS-CoV-2 infection identified that whilst the overall peripheral CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell counts were significantly reduced, alveolar CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells harbored high concentrations of cytotoxic granules, which may have contributed to severe tissue injury (

 <sup>+</sup> T cell response is known to be important in SARS-CoV infection, and mild cases of COVID-19 have increased clonal expansion of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, compared to severe cases (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>). The pathological features of COVID-19 resemble those of SARS and MERS, both of which are thought to be largely caused by immune dysregulation rather than direct pathology induced by high viral load (

 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>), with a similar picture emerging for SARS-CoV-2.
