<p>In late December 2019, several cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were reported across several provinces in China, and by March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current outbreak a global pandemic (

This virus spreads by human-to-human transmission and early observational data has suggested a reproductive number of 2.2 days. Together with a mean incubation time of 5.2 days, SARS-CoV-2 has the ability to spread widely among humans (

Whilst the majority of deaths have been of elderly individuals or patients with underlying health conditions, a small number of young and healthy people have also succumbed to fulminant infection. In these rare cases, host genetics may provide some explanation for failure to control SARS-CoV-2 infection.
