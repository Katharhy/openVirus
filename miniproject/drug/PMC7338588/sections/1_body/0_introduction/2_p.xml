<p>Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) are a group of genetically determined diseases predisposing individuals to severe infection, immune dysregulation, autoimmunity and malignancy (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). There is increasing evidence that the extreme variability in the clinical outcome of infections can often be influenced by the germ line genetics of the human host (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Such monogenic inborn errors of immunity predispose to a narrow or broad range of viral infections (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Examples include herpes simplex virus encephalitis and defects in the TLR3 pathway and RNA metabolism (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), varicella-zoster virus and defective innate RNA POL III signaling (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), severe influenza and defects in IRF7 (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), IRF9 (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), TLR3 (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), GATA2 (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), and RIG-I (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), rhinovirus infection and MDA5 (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), papillomaviruses and mutations in EVER1/2 (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), EBV lymphoproliferation and malignancy in the case of defects in SH2D1A (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), CD27, CD70 (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), XIAP (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), ITK (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and MAGT1 (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), fatal CMV infection in NOS2 deficiency (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), and finally disseminated infection with measles vaccine strain virus in IFNAR and STAT2 deficiency (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In this review, we aim to discuss the most recent findings in terms of the innate and adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and draw on knowledge from the previous SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks where relevant. This knowledge should enable us to speculate and to suggest essential antiviral pathways that may be defective in individuals at increased risk of severe COVID-19 and thus suggest genetic etiologies which may predispose otherwise healthy individuals without comorbidities to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.
