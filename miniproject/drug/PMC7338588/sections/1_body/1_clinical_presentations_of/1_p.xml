<p>The severity of COVID-19 is extremely variable, with some individuals reporting almost no symptoms, whereas others become critically ill requiring intensive care and respiratory ventilation (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The frequency of asymptomatic infections is yet to be determined and the differentiation between those and pre-symptomatic cases should be considered (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In the largest case report of 44,672 confirmed cases of COVID-19 described by the Chinese CDC, an overall case fatality rate (CFR) of 2.3% was calculated (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). However, the mortality rates vary widely between different ages. No deaths were reported in children &lt;9 years old, but the CFR increases to 14.8% in the 80+ age group. In critical cases requiring ventilator support in the ICU, a CFR of 49–61% was reported (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Whilst severe disease outcomes have been reported in otherwise healthy individuals of any age, several risk factors are recognized that lead to a more critical disease course; these include old age, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and cerebrovascular disease (
