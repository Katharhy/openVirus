<p>COVID-19 initially presents with non-specific signs and symptoms of upper airway viral infection characterized by fever, fatigue, cough, and dyspnoea, as well as anorexia, myalgia, and productive sputum, which can develop to pneumonia (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Intriguingly, patients are increasingly reporting anosmia and dysgeusia, the loss of smell and taste, reflecting some neurological effect of SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), which has subsequently been confirmed by several reports of central and peripheral nervous system manifestations, with meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome presenting as components of severe COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). In this context, respiratory failure has been hypothesized to be partly neurogenic in origin and possibly resulting from viral invasion of cranial nerve I into brainstem respiratory centers (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are commonly described (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In the most critical cases, widespread lung inflammation can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which often necessitates mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to prevent total respiratory failure (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated an extensive tendency for coagulopathy, thrombosis, micro-thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation during severe COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) which is reflected in elevated fibrin and D-dimer levels during disease (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Furthermore, a significant fraction of deceased ICU patients have pulmonary thrombosis or deep vein thrombosis as revealed by autopsy results (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).
