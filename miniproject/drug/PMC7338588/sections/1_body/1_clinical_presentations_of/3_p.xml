<p>Several clinical and immunological studies have suggested that excessive inflammation and a cytokine storm play a key role in the immunopathology, responsible for much of the lung damage, morbidity and mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 in ICUs (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). This concept opens up the possibility that medical treatments that dampen immune activation may represent an important strategy in treating this disease and decreasing the high mortality (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), a rare disease entity causing systemic inflammation, fever, and vasculitis with a risk of developing aneurisms. This inflammatory condition associated with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) (
