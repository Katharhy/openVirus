 <sup>−/−</sup> mice with SARS-CoV causes increased viral replication, enhanced pathology in the lungs, and increased morbidity (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>–
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). The most severe phenotypes and mortality are generally seen in mice lacking the downstream adaptors TRIF and MyD88 (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). Interestingly, following SARS-CoV infection of 
 <italic>Trif</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice, the aberrant proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses were similar to those seen in human patients with poor disease outcome during SARS-CoV infection (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>) or MERS-CoV infection (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). This may suggest that the initial impaired control of viral replication could lead to exaggerated immune responses and enhanced immunopathology later during infection. However, MyD88 and IRAK4 seem to be largely redundant in antiviral immunity in humans, since previous studies have failed to report increased susceptibility to severe viral infection in patients deficient in these molecules (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). This underlines the value of studying the spectrum of infections in patients with well-defined immunodeficiencies 
 <italic>in natura</italic>, revealing important lessons on protective immunity in humans (

 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>).
