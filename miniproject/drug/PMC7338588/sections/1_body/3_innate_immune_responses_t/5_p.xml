<p>Investigations into the role of lung inflammation during respiratory infection identified a potential role for excessive inflammasome activation. Mice in which the inflammasome pathway had been deleted by CASP1/11 knock-out displayed less mortality upon influenza infection compared to wild-type mice (

Given that neutrophilia is a paraclinical indication of COVID-19 disease severity, we might predict that inhibiting this response may improve outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection. These studies are supported by other data demonstrating that the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation by the SARS-CoV viral proteins, E, ORF-8b and viroporin 3a (
