<p>IFNs are the most prominent antiviral effectors of the innate immune system, and SARS-CoV infection is highly susceptible to this potent antiviral substance, as shown by the efficient inhibition of viral replication upon administration of exogenous IFN both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>–
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>). However, only very limited amounts of IFNs are actually produced during SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>), and the response seems to be delayed relative to the production of proinflammatory cytokines (
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>). However, it is worth noting that these anti-viral responses are most likely cell-type specific. A recent study demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 also induces significantly less alveolar cell IFN and ISG expression compared to influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>). In support of these data, a comparative study reported more efficient viral replication and a reduced type I IFN response in SARS-CoV-2 infection of 
 <italic>ex-vivo</italic> human lung cultures compared to SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>). To achieve this very low IFN production, the coronaviruses are known to employ numerous strategies to counteract the innate immune signaling pathways of the host, which have been reviewed elsewhere (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>–
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>). However, the exact mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 appears to more efficiently prevent IFN production, and if this is partly responsible for increased pathogenicity in the current outbreak, remains elusive. Collectively, future identification of the molecules and signaling pathways targeted by SARS-CoV-2 will provide essential information on key antiviral modalities, which may also be those defective in patients with genetic predisposition to severe disseminated COVID-19.
