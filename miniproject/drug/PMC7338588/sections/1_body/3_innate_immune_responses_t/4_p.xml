<p>Coronaviruses are, in addition to being recognition by TLRs, also recognized by RLRs. The RLRs are cytosolic RNA sensors, where RIG-I recognizes short dsRNA with 5' triphosphate, and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) recognizes long dsRNA. MDA5 is clearly protective in mice infected with the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (

This is, however, not due to the virus failing to be recognized by the receptors, but rather because SARS-CoV, as well as other coronaviruses, employs several strategies to avoid recognition and immune activation. For example, deletion of the SARS-CoV nsp16 gene, an enzyme which catalyzes ribose 2'-O-methylation to generate caps on the coronavirus RNA (

 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). However, in the absence of MDA5 or Interferon Induced Protein With Tetratricopeptide Repeats 1 (IFIT1), the SARS-CoV nsp16 deletion mutant reached similar levels of viral replication and virulence as wild type SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>), indicating that MDA5 recognizes partly uncapped SARS-CoV RNA. The recognition of SARS-CoV by RIG-I has not yet been described, probably due to the fact that RIG-I has a preference for short dsRNA and also because the initial steps of capping impairs RIG-I recognition by removing the 5'triphosphate (
