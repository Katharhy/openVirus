<p>The innate immune response is the first line of defense against a wide range of pathogens, particularly viruses. Importantly, viral infection induces type I interferons (IFN) (IFNα/β) and type III IFNs (IFN-λ), which activate hundreds of antiviral proteins as well as mediate priming the adaptive immune response (

Coronaviruses, and their nucleic acid genome and replication intermediates in particular, are recognized primarily by two groups of pattern recognition receptors, namely the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs). These receptors recognize several viral components, which induce downstream signaling and result in production of antiviral type I and III IFNs as well as proinflammatory cytokines through activation of the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor (IRF)3, IRF7 and nuclear factor(NF)-κB (
