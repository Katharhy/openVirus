<p>The TLRs which have so far been implicated in the response to SARS-CoV, are TLR3, -4 and -7 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). TLR3 recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and the coronavirus-derived ligand is likely a double-stranded replication intermediate. The ligand for TLR4 remains obscure, as TLR4 usually recognizes lipopolysaccharide from gram negative bacteria. Finally, special GU-rich sequences in the SARS-CoV genome activate TLR7 (
