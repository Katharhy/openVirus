<p>Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded viruses that contain the largest genome amongst RNA viruses (27â€“32 kb) (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genera, based on its phylogenetic relationship with other 
 <italic>Betacoronaviruses</italic>, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Whilst SARS-CoV-2 shares 79% nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV, Zhou et al. reported the SARS-CoV-2 sequence to be 96.2% identical to the sequence of the horseshoe bat coronavirus, RaTG13, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 originates from this bat species (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). An intermediate animal host between horseshoe bats and humans, as well as the transmission route, has yet to be identified in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). However, the most prevalent hypothesis is that the virus acquired one or several mutations allowing it to cross species barriers and infect human cells some time in autumn 2019, a few months before the beginning of the current pandemic (
