<p>Like other coronaviruses, the major structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include the envelope (E), membrane (M) and spike (S) proteins (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). In the earlier SARS-CoV epidemic, the S protein was shown to facilitate cellular entry by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor present on target cells (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). In addition, the cellular serine protease transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPSS2) is needed for priming of the S protein and subsequent fusion of SARS-CoV with the host cell membrane (

 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of ACE2 enhances disease severity in mice upon SARS-CoV infection, indicating the importance of this receptor in facilitating viral entry (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). Several studies have shown that the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 also uses ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for cell entry, and that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is able to bind to ACE2 with 10- to 20-fold higher affinity than the SARS-CoV S protein (

 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). Furthermore, ACE2 is highly expressed by type II alveolar epithelial cells (

 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>) which correlates with the pulmonary symptoms of COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). However, ACE2 is also highly expressed by intestinal, heart, kidney and bladder cells (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). This pattern of cellular ACE2 expression may explain some of the non-respiratory symptoms and complications that SARS-CoV-2 patients exhibit, such as diarrhea, kidney failure and cardiac injury (
