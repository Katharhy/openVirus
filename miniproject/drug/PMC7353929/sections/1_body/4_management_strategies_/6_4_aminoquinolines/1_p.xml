<p>Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been demonstrated to inhibit CoV-2 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Hydroxychloroquine acts by increasing the pH of endosomes and lysosomes which make the epithelial cell resistant to viral replication. It reduces the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes, therefore cytokine storm. It interferes with glycosylation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and reduces the binding efficiency between ACE2 on the host cells and the spike protein on the surface of the coronavirus. As per Chinese experience, the use of chloroquine has been associated with decreased duration of symptoms and reduced progression of the disease.[
