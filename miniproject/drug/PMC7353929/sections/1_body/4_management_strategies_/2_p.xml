<p>So far, the most effective strategy against this virus is containment measures. The importance of adequate respiratory droplet precautions, hand hygiene, and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces can never be overemphasized. Half-hearted travel restrictions, unmonitored containment, and meager screening at entry points seem to be counterproductive. Quarantine, social isolation, and lockdown have been tried successfully by China and some other countries, but unless we develop a concrete therapeutic strategy, we are going to see recurrent emergence of the illness in areas cleared of illness in large proportions.</p>
