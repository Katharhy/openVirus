<p>Reports have suggested that around 80% of CoV-2 illness manifest mild, 15% moderate, and 5% severe symptoms requiring intensive care unit care. There is a group of patients who do not manifest symptoms and are thereby asymptomatic carriers. These make the case count much higher and case fatality rate lower. Clinical manifestations comprise fever, cough, and fatigue. Dyspnea is reported in patients who develop lower respiratory tract involvement. Hemoptysis has also been reported.[
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are uncommon.[
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Computed tomography reveals ground-glass haziness or patchy areas of consolidation or crazy-paving pattern with or without subpleural predominance.[
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Unilateral and bilateral lung involvement has been noted. However, cavitation, tree in bud, and pleural effusion are less likely in COVID. Postpneumonia fibrosis has also been documented, and it is unclear about the prognosis of this fibrosis.[
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Laboratory abnormalities include lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated C-reactive protein and serum ferritin levels. Derangement of liver function tests, renal function tests, and raised d-dimer has also been reported. A throat swab for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for novel-CoV-2019 is diagnostic for the virus. The strategies for testing of suspects have been evolving with current recommendations to test symptomatic people who have a history of travel outside the country, symptomatic contacts of confirmed COVID cases, symptomatic health-care workers, and patients admitted with acute severe respiratory illness. In addition, asymptomatic individuals or health-care workers who have had direct contact with a positive case without adequate personal protective equipment need to be tested.[
