<p>COVID-19 has emerged as a global health problem of a large magnitude. Containment measures at population level are currently suggested as the best strategy to curtail the epidemic spurt of disease. As of today, no effective vaccine or a drug is available. However, a variety of evidence-based prevention and treatment modalities are expected to come out in the near future.

The global leaderships should join hands in devising effective management policies to combat this disease.</p>
