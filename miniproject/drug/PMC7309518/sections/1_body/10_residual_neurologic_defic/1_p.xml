<p>No neurologic data are yet available about the discharged patients who survived the catastrophic effects of the virus. We know that several people have permanently lost smell and taste, which is a form of disability affecting quality of life, depriving tasting pleasures, and the ability to detect danger signals, like smelling gas or fire. Many discharged patients require assistance because of muscle weakness and gait unsteadiness, which is arguably multifactorial; some patients may have had critical illness neuropathy and deconditioning with significant muscle atrophy worsened by comorbidities; others may have neurotoxicity or myocytotoxicity from antiviral therapies, like first described with antiretrovirals or chloroquine

 </sup>; still others may have the residual effects from an unrecognized primary myopathy, neuropathy, or myelopathy due to postviral autoimmunity. A study exploring the patients' current causes of residual muscle weakness and sensory deficits is urgently needed using EMG, muscle or nerve biopsies, autoantibody screening, and CSF or imaging studies to determine immediate or long-term recovery prospects, identify potential reversibility, and accelerate return to normalcy.
