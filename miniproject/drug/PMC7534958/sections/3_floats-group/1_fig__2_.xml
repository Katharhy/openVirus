  <title>severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication cycle and potential targets for drug repurposing. (1) Virus infection initiates with the binding of virus S proteins to the ACE2 cellular receptors. After attachment, the virus may enter the cell through two distinct mechanisms: early and late pathways. (2) In the early pathway the genomic ssRNA (gRNA) is liberated into the cytoplasm after the fusion between viral and cell cytoplasmic membranes, an event triggered by membrane proteases (e. g., TMPRSS2). (3) The gRNA is immediately translated into two polyproteins that undergo proteolytic cleavage giving rise to all nonstructural proteins (Nsps). (4) The Nsps form the replication-transcription complexes (RTCs) where the gRNA (blue ribbon) is replicated and the subgenomic RNAs (red ribbon) are transcribed. (5) The subgenomic RNAs are translated into viral structural and accessory proteins in the cytosol. (6) Upon translation, E, M and S structural proteins are inserted into ER and follow the secretory pathway to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). (7) Meanwhile, a copy of the gRNA binds to N proteins in the cytoplasm forming the nucleocapsid, which is transported to the ERGIC. (8) Virion assembly in the ERGIC. (9) The new virion travels through the cytoplasm inside a vesicle and leaves the cell by exocytosis. (10) Alternatively, in the late pathway, the virus can undergo endocytosis to initiate the infection. (11) The virion membrane merges with the endosome membrane after S protein proteolysis by endosomal proteases (e. g., cathepsin L), allowing the gRNA to be released into the cytoplasm. From this point on, the cycle follows the same pathway described in 3-9 steps. The red arrows indicate the general replication pathway and the blue arrows indicate the gRNA movement through the cycle. Some viral and host proteins have been explored as potential targets for drug repurposing. Some of these drug candidates are shown with their site of action indicated in the cycle.
