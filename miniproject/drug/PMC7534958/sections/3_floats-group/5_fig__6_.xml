  <title>3D structure of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (PDB 7BV2, 2.5 Å, RdRp, Nsp12) bound to triphosphate form of remdesivir (RTP) and cofactors Nsp7 (pink) and Nsp8 (purple). (A) Ribbon representation coloured by Nsp12 subdomains: β-hairpin (cyan), NiRAN (yellow), interface (orange), finger (blue), palm (red) and thumb (light green). (B) Binding pose of RTP. The sidechain of all residues (gray) within 5 Å of distance and the RTP molecule (pink) are represented as sticks. Magnesium ions (pink) are represented as space filling spheres.
