<p>A patent can be defined as a government license that confers the owner the exclusivity over a new invention or medication. With the patent, the inventor is able to exclude others from making and selling the invention for a determined period of time. When it comes to medication, the market exclusivity granted by the patent generates enormous economic profit for the patent holder, once the company will have the monopoly over the product for around 20 years. Once the patent term finishes, generic companies can start producing and selling the drug, increasing the market competition over the product. A strategy adopted by some companies is to maximise the term of patent of successful products, extending market exclusivity, for instance, increasing economic rewards with the invention. In order to extend patent terms, the companies can apply for new formulations, new routes of administration, new uses of the drug among other strategies.

As a consequence, the expected profit associated with repurposing can be severely affected.
