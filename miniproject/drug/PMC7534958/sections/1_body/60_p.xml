<p>Zhou et al. developed a network-based approach to identify potential repurposable drugs based on the interactions between their human targets and coronavirus-associated proteins.

 </xref> The premise is that protein targets that are associated with viral infections are part of a subnetwork of the human protein-protein interaction network. The targets of a repurposable drug should be in or close in proximity to this subnetwork. The authors identified many potential targets, such as Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1), Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), and also biological pathways that could be explored, such as NF-kappa B signaling.

An interesting finding was that the selected molecules and targets have reported links to viral infection and some have been used for treatment of Coronavirus-related disease, such as emodin (44) in SARS-CoV, and mercaptopurine (42) and toremifene (40) in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

 </xref> In addition to identifying repurposable drugs, possible synergistic combinations between them were also suggested by the network, such as sirolimus (41) and dactinomycin (45), and mercaptopurine (42) and melatonin (46).
