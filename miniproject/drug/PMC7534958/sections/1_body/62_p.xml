<p>Experimental target validation (e.g., by genetic and proteomic approaches), cellular 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, are pivotal for the discovery of molecular pathways involved in pathogenesis, supporting the discovery of new drugs.

 </xref> SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes less than 30 proteins that can be explored for generating new avenues for further research. Heterologous viral protein expression could be used in a myriad of structural and functional target-based biochemical studies.

 </xref> These assays do not need to be performed in biosafety level 3 laboratory, democratising the early research on searching for a new drug candidate for COVID-19 treatment.

 </xref> Genome-wide expression studies, nucleotide sequences, protein structures and associated sequences are available online providing a foundation for preclinical drug discovery and development research against SARS-CoV-2 (Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/sars-cov-2-seqs/). It is good to point out that many drugs show 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> effect (e.g., target and/or cellular assays) that may not last 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, in animal models, including humans. An ideal animal model of COVID-19 should reflect the clinical signs, viral replication and pathology reported in humans.

 <italic>In vivo</italic> animal infection experiments with SARS-CoV-2 require infrastructure of a biosafety level 3 laboratory, restricting scientific research to well-equipped research groups. Animal models are indispensable, because they could identify toxic hits or molecules that could enhance COVID-19 pathogenicity. 
 <xref rid="t2" ref-type="table">Table II</xref> lists some compounds that have the potential to be clinically tested and that will be discussed in more details below in this topic.
