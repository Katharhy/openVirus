 <italic>In conclusion</italic> - SARS-CoV-2 infection is a life-threatening disease with such a high transmission rate that can surpass even the most well-structured health systems in developed high-income countries. While vaccines are the ideal solution for preventing the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19 their development cycle have intrinsic challenges and safety checking steps that require several months or years to complete their development. A similar situation is found for developing new drugs for COVID-19 (as with any other disease), because of the long process involving discovery, validation and safety evaluation of new chemical entities for use in human health. In this scenario, repositioning drugs already in clinical use for treatment of COVID-19 is an important shortcut, as we have discussed.
