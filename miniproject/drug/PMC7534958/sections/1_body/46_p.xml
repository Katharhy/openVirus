<p>In the absence of exogenous or membrane-bound proteases (e g. TMPRSS2) to promote SARS-CoVs infection on cells’ surface, the virus can also be internalised via endocytosis, also known as “late pathway”.

 </xref> This process comprises several factors that operate in a sequential and partially overlapping fashion.

 </xref> Endocytosis initiates with the recruitment of endocytic coat proteins (e. g., clathrins) from the cytosol to gather on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Then, protein-coated pits bud into vesicles originated from plasma membranes and fuse with each other or with pre-existing early endosomes.

 </xref> Gradually, early endosomes mature to late endosomes which have an acid environment (approx. pH 5.5), activating endosomal cathepsin L cysteine proteases (family: C1, clan: CA).

 </xref> These enzymes are responsible for triggering the fusion activity of S protein and subsequent insertion of viral SARS-CoV gRNA into the cytosol, especially in cells with lower expression of TMPRSS2.

 </xref> Some key elements of endocytosis have been explored as potential targets for anti-SARS-CoV drugs, such as agents that increase endosomal pH (avoiding cathepsin L activation) [e.g., chloroquine (20) and hydroxychloroquine (26)] and cathepsin L inhibitors [e.g., teicoplanin (27), a glycopeptide antibiotic].
