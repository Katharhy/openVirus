 <italic>Virus targets</italic> - During SARS-CoV-2 gRNA translation, two proteases, namely M
 <sup>pro</sup> and PL
 <sup>pro</sup>, act in concert to cleave and release from pp1a/pp1ab the 16 Nsps that compose the RTC.

 </xref> Therefore, these proteases are essential for virus replication and represent useful targets for therapeutic intervention. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> and PL
 <sup>pro</sup> had their 3D structures published - PDB 6LU7, 2.16 Å and PDB 6W9C, 2.70 Å, respectively - which make them particularly useful for computational structure-based drug design methods.
