<p>In order to become fusion-competent, SAR-CoVs S proteins must be cleaved by host proteases. In SARS-CoV-2, this process appears to be mediated primarily by TMPRSS2 in the plasma membrane.

 </xref> TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease, serine 2) is a transmembrane protein (predicted to have 492 aa) from the serine protease class (family: S1 clan: PA).

 </xref> TMPRSS2 has a major role in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and replication, and thus represents an interesting therapeutic target since its inhibitors could potentially block virus infection in its initial stages.
