 </xref> The authors explored two strategies, consisting of disrupting the S protein: ACE2 complex and preventing its formation by docking on the isolated proteins. From this analysis, four compounds [pemirolast (30), nitrofurantoin (31), isoniazid pyruvate (32) and eriodictyol (33)] displayed potential to disrupt the S protein: ACE2 interaction, and three natural compounds [cepharanthine (34), ergoloid (35) and hypericin (36)] showed potential to block host recognition.
