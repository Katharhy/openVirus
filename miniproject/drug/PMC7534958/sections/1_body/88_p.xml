 <italic>Off-patent drugs</italic> - Fortunately, a number of drugs that have been tested as possible agents in the COVID-19 treatment are off-patent, meaning that generic drug companies already manufacture and commercialise the medicine, making it easier for drug repurposing.

 </xref> The off-patent drugs that have been tested in COVID-19 clinical trials include CQ (20), HCQ (26), Ritonavir (2) and Lopinavir (1).

 </xref> A recent research article published by Hill and collaborators estimated the minimum cost of production associated with these drugs, showing that all the treatments under evaluation in current clinical trials are cheap to manufacture. However, list prices can be over 100 times higher than the costs to produce the drug.

 </xref> If any of those drugs become approved for the treatment of COVID-19, its demand will increase dramatically. Therefore, it is important to consider the challenges associated with scaling up the production to meet the demand. For instance, there are few regulatory approved production facilities, and drug manufacturers rely on low-cost suppliers of raw materials in India and China, which might be scarce during a pandemic. Consequently, it would be difficult to ensure short term global availability of the treatment, since the production depends on different countries.

 </xref> Those conclusions are very helpful in showing the importance of optimising the way of manufacturing the candidate drugs presented above. For this reason, recent and optimised synthetic pathways found in patents and articles for some Ritonavir (2) and Lopinavir (1) are discussed below, as CQ (20) and HCQ (26) have now been abandoned. Finally, we will briefly discuss the ease of manufacturing in large scale each of the drugs we had the synthesis reviewed here.
