 <italic>SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of infection</italic> - At present, the mechanisms that underlie SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been directly described. Nonetheless, they seem to be similar to those proposed for other coronaviruses.

 </xref> In one proposal, virus infection starts with the binding of its S proteins to host receptor ACE2, a membrane protein largely expressed in the lung and small intestine cells (

 </xref> After attachment, S protein is cleaved by host proteases initiating the fusion of virus and cell membranes that culminates in viral gRNA release into the cytoplasm. This event is proposed to occur through two distinct ways: via plasma membrane (early pathway) or via endosomes (late pathway). In the early pathway, S protein is cleaved by host plasma membrane proteases (e. g., TMPRSS2) while in the late pathway by endosomal proteases (e. g., cathepsin L). The route taken by the virus to enter the cell appears to be dependent on the availability of these proteases.
