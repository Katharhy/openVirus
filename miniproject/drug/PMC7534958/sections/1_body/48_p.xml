 <italic>Other targets</italic> - Apart from SARS-CoVs infection, some relevant molecular targets of other viral diseases and host metabolism have also been investigated in COVID-19 drug discovery, such as viral neuraminidases and the DPP4 cell receptor. Neuraminidases (NA) or sialidases, are glycoside hydrolases (family: GH34) largely found attached to the envelope of influenza viruses.

 </xref> They catalyse the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds between sialic acid and adjacent sugar residues (EC 3.2.1.18) in glycoproteins, glycolipids and oligosaccharides.

 </xref> NA is mainly responsible for cleaving sialic acid acids from cell receptors and on carbohydrate side chains of nascent virion, facilitating its release from infected cells.

 </xref> Its critical role in virus infection and proliferation has been exploited by NA inhibitors [e.g., oseltamivir (28)] which are administered in clinics to combat influenza infections. Apparently, this therapeutic strategy was employed at the beginning of COVID-19 outbreak during the peak of influenza season in China when the etiologic agent of this disease was yet unknown. So far, there is no evidence that NA inhibitors may have a role in COVID-19 management.
