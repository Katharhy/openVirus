 <italic>Clinical studies</italic> - Over 1452 clinical trials have been unveiled, until the publication of this manuscript, focusing on COVID-19 treatment interventions (Available from: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID-19). With a growing number of patients suffering from acute severe respiratory symptoms and hospital capacities reaching its limit, therapeutic options are urgently essential to avoid human mass deaths. Drug repurposing approaches of approved (with safe and effectiveness proven) and unapproved molecules, that were promising in pre-clinical and early stages of clinical studies of SARS and MERS, are in vogue. With this premise, World Health Organization (WHO) organised a simplified dynamic platform comparing the effectiveness of treatment strategies around the globe. This clinical trial design, called SOLIDARITY, can shrink by 80% the time of clinical studies, compared with the “gold standard” double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. This strategy could overcome the uncertainty of multiple small trials that do not produce a solid base necessary to establish the relative success of arising probable treatments. On the other hand, this shorter time required reflects the compassionate characteristic of the studies, that cannot rule out placebo effects and patient severe adverse effects, including death.

 </xref> Currently, WHO is focusing on four most promising therapies: remdesivir (8); CQ (20) or HCQ (26); ritonavir (2)/lopinavir (1); ritonavir (2) /lopinavir (1) plus interferon-beta, an immune response modulator.
