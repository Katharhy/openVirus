 <italic>Host cell targets</italic> - A key step in SARS-CoVs infection is the attachment of S protein to host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a membrane-bound carboxypeptidase (family: M2, clan: MA).

 </xref> Its role as a functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in host cells makes this protein a potential drug target to treat COVID-19. There are several therapeutic strategies targeting ACE2 which include: vaccines based on S protein, exogenous administration of a soluble form of ACE2, and administration of small molecules [e.g., arbidol (19), an anti-influenza drug] or antibodies (e.g., STI-1499, an anti-spike antibody) to block the interaction of ACE2 with S protein.
