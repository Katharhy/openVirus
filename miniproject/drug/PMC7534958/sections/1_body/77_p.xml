<p>Currently, there is a lot of research around the world examining drugs that can be used for the treatment of COVID-19. Unfortunately, until this moment no therapeutic options are promptly effectively available. Most of the studies have a small number of patients with variable dose and/or duration, fact that hinders a comparison. To successfully undertake the COVID-19 pandemic with new medicines, synchronised clinical trials with randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled are still needed. Infection prevention by social distancing and supportive medical care, are the only strategies to deal with this disease until this moment.</p>
