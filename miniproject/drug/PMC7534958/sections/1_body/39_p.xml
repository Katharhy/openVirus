<p>Spike protein (S) is a viral type I transmembrane glycoprotein (~180-200 kDa) responsible for CoVs interaction and invasion of host cells.

 </xref> This protein is synthesised as a monomer and suffers post-translational modifications in the ER before becoming a trimeric glycosylated protein.

 </xref> The former protrudes from the surface of the virus particle creating a crown-like halo and contains two functional subunits: S1 (bulbous shape), which binds to cellular receptors (e.g., ACE2), and S2 (stalk shape) that promotes the fusion between cell and virus membranes.

 </xref> In turn, S1 subunit has two domains: a N-terminal and a C-terminal domain. The latter serves as a RBD for SARS-CoVs being responsible for ACE2 recognition and binding.

 </xref> Apart from S1 and S2, SARS-CoV-2 S protein also has a ganglioside-binding subdomain at the tip of N-terminal domain, which may allow this protein to interact with gangliosides on cellsâ€™ surface. In theory, this domain could facilitate virus attachment to the cell and facilitate the contact with ACE2, being a potential site for drug interference.
