 </xref> Ritonavir (2) is a potent CYP3A inhibitor therefore inhibiting the metabolism of lopinavir (1), increasing its plasma levels. Both are reported as peptidomimetic molecules that inhibit HIV-1 protease activity in a competitive manner.

 </xref> This combination may be useful against SARS-CoV-2 virus by acting on its main protease, an enzyme essential in processing polyproteins translated from viral RNA.
