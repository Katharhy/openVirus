<p>In the following topic, we will review SARS-CoV-2 structure and mechanism of infection in order to discuss molecular targets from the virus or its human host that are being considered for drug repurposing and perhaps future development of new drugs. Ongoing drug repurposing efforts will be described in more details later in this article, along with some clinical trials that have been carried out so far for COVID-19 treatment. Finally, as treatment availability is of utmost importance when dealing with a pandemic, we bring a discussion on patent protection and ease of large-scale production of some of the drugs that are more advanced in clinical studies.</p>
