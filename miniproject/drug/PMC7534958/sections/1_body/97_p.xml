<p>Data are accumulating about the molecular pathology of COVID-19 as well as structural information on the viral and host proteins involved in the infection mechanism. This knowledge is essential for allowing researchers to have new insights on approved or investigational drugs that can be repurposed to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. As reviewed here, over 10 targets distributed amongst distinct steps of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle or host cell mediators are currently being investigated. Here, we highlighted several up-to-date examples of potential repurposable drug candidates proposed from either computational approaches or experimental trials (or their combination) at different levels of validation and stages of development. Noteworthy, AI methods hold a great promise in finding occult links between drugs, human and viral targets to find novel bioactivities and even combinations of drugs.</p>
