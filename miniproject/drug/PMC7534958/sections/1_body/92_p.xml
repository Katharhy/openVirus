 </xref> (1) has 4 chiral centres, and the synthetic strategies reported by Abbott are similar, involving the synthesis of a key intermediate amino alcohol unit, that is then connected to the appropriated side chains. Some drawbacks that can be pointed out in the synthesis include the use of 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) as a condensing agent and the weak base 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, both expensive reagents, making the synthesis not suitable from the viewpoint of cost and industrial application. In addition, one of the methods described by Abbott includes the synthesis of an acid chloride as an intermediate, which is very unstable, and it can be easily decomposed by humidity, making the synthesis not suitable for industrial production.
