<p>CoVs E proteins are small integral membrane polypeptides (76 - 109 aa) encoded by subgenomic RNAs. In SARS-CoV, they are found in virions, but also in large amounts in the ERGIC where they participate in virus budding and trafficking. Their structures are divided into three main domains: N-terminal, transmembrane (TMD) and C-terminal domain. TMD is able to form pentameric α-helical bundles creating ion conductive pores in membranes.

 </xref> The ion channel (IC) activity of E protein has been proposed to alter ion homeostasis, as well induce inflammatory response, which may lead to pulmonary damage.
