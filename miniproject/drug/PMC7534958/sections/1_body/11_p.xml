 </xref> In this case, first there is an accumulation of macrophages in alveoli, followed by release of cytokines and accumulation of fluids. Neutrophils can also be recruited by the immune system leading to the destruction of type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells causing a collapse of the alveoli function and consequently the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In the severe condition, with an increase of the inflammation, the protein rich fluid from lungs enter in the bloodstream causing the systemic inflammatory syndrome (SIRS).
