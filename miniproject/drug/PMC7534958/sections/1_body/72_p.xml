 </xref> Based on results for a very limited number of patients (100), it was concluded that CQ (20) presented apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia. Borba et al. performed a double-blind, randomised clinical trial designed to assess the safety of CQ (20) in two dosages: 600 mg twice daily for 10 days with an initial dose of 450 mg twice daily on the first day, decreasing to once daily for four more days.

 </xref> The study suggests that the higher dosage should not be recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential side effects. It is important to note that both doses studied were above the Brazilian recommended dose.
