<p>Cytokines are short-lived small size proteins (15-20 kDa) that exert an important role in autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine signaling controlling the development and function of several immune and nonimmune cells.

 </xref> One example is Interleukin (IL)-6 family which includes several cytokines, such as IL-6, that use the common signaling receptor subunit glycoprotein 130 kDa (gp130). IL-6 signaling requires the binding of IL-6 to IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) which consists of a soluble IL-6 binding domain (CD126) and membrane-bound gp130. IL-6 acts as the main inducer of fever, inflammation and of hepatic acute phase proteins. Therefore, IL-6/IL-6R antagonists have a therapeutic effect in inflammatory diseases.
