 </xref> These studies emphasize how important computational methods are in modern drug discovery to analyse the huge amount of biomedical data available. 
 <xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table I</xref> summarises a selection of studies that suggested potential drugs for repurposing. Below we will describe the main computational methods and results. Smith and Smith performed a large virtual high-throughput screening to identify drugs, natural products and metabolites that could disrupt the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S protein and human ACE2 receptor. The authors used a supercomputer called SUMMIT to conduct the simulations, which included structural modeling of the S protein:ACE2 complex, generation of an ensemble of conformations for the complex and molecular docking.

 </xref> The ensemble generation was a crucial step in this work, allowing the authors to explore different conformations of the complex and identify drugs that could interact with binding sites not easily identified in static conformations.
