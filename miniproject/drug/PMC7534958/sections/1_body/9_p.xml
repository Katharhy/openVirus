<p>By genomic sequencing analysis of other coronavirus strains and SARS-CoV-2, Andersen and collaborators demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 has mutations resulting in six different amino acids at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that appears to be optimised for binding to the human receptor ACE2.

 </xref> They also showed that the gene encoding the Spike protein has an insertion of 12 nucleotides giving it a polybasic (furin) cleavage site at the S1-S2. In this way, the high-affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the human ACE2 is a consequence of natural selection on a human or human-like ACE2. They suggest some possibilities to explain that: emergence in an animal host before zoonotic transfer; natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer; or natural selection during the passage.

 </xref> They showed 3 important variations in the composition of amino acids that allowed them to classify into different groups. Group A has two subclusters that are distinguished by the synonymous mutation T29095C. While B is derived from A by two mutations T8782C and C28144T, type C differs from its parent type B by mutation of G26144T. The A and C types are found more often outside East Asia, in Europeans and Americans. While the B type is the most common type in East Asia.
