<p id="par0035">COVID-19 has placed an unparalleled burden on the health systems and economies of all affected countries, with a projected serious impact on African countries that are already saddled with weak health care provision and economic systems. Apart from the immediate economic losses, there are considerable costs associated with the containment of the pandemic, from laboratory testing to personal protective equipment, treatment and personnel costs. Mass testing is being advocated, and this requires molecular techniques, the current gold standard for COVID-19 detection, as recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) (

However, these polymerase chain reaction-based tests do not provide information on the origin of an infection, possible mutations in the virus or transmission links in clusters of infection. Monitoring the evolution of the virus and transmission networks is essential for containment strategies, and this requires obtaining genomic data by sequencing viral isolates from infected persons. The use of high-throughput next-generation sequencing tools can provide additional data to refine strategies to fight against COVID-19. Examination of the nucleic acid sequences of a virus enables detailed understanding of its genetic content, evolution and diversity both within and between local communities. The information obtained from sequencing is also essential in the design of effective vaccines, drugs, efficacy monitoring and transmission studies. As the virus continues to evolve in African populations, African countries and the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ACDC) must facilitate investment in costly laboratory technologies that will ensure that the strains of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Africa are included in the design of new interventions.
