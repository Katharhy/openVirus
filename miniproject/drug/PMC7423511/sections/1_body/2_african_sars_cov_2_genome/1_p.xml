<p id="par0040">While SARS-CoV-2 sequence data are an integral part of the information used for making decisions on other continents (
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2020</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>), Africa has yet to integrate this information into our decision making for managing COVID-19 outbreaks within the continent. This is primarily due to limited skillsets and infrastructural deficiencies (
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Devex, 2020</xref>). To the present, only 900 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from 14 African countries have been uploaded out of a total of 62,267 whole-genome sequences in GISAID (
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">GISAID, 2020</xref>), an online database for the rapid sharing of viral genomes and clinical and epidemiological data. Africa has recorded approximately 642,387 cases and close to 10,789 deaths from COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2020a</xref>). On a global scale, this significantly outweighs the available African SARS-CoV-2 genomes, putting the continent at disadvantage in global genetic epidemiology studies of SARS-CoV-2 and in consideration for the design of vaccines that could provide broad potency against all virus strains circulating in the continent. The above narrative could be different if each country appreciated the need for genetic data and deliberately empowered at least one molecular laboratory involved in COVID-19 detection and diagnostics with sequencing technologies. The transition to sequencing viral genomes could adopt cost-effective, easily deployable and portable sequencing platforms with less restricted access to reagents and readily available protocol-sharing global networks.
