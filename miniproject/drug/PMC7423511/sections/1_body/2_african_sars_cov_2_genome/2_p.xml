<p id="par0045">During an epidemic or a pandemic, most countries close their land borders and airspace to restrict movement and curb the spread of the infection. If viral sequencing platforms are not available in a country, it must rely on shipping samples to laboratories elsewhere to generate sequences. Doing so allows real-time contributions to global sequencing challenging and unrealistic. Therefore, while ACDC aims for a coordinated, centralised approach to high-throughput next-generation sequencing using platforms such as the Next-seq and Hi-Seq, the generation of moderate-quality data using Miseq, capillary electrophoresis and Nanopore technology should be prioritised. This model has been tested in the United Kingdom with reported success (
