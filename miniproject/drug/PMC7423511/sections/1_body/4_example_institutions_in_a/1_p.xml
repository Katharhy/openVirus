<p id="par0055">Despite the challenges within the continent, there are a small number of medical research centres or institutions in Africa that are changing the narrative. These have been largely funded by external donors, including the NIH, World Bank, Wellcome Trust and the African Academy of Science. Taking West Africa as an example, the following institutions have established genomics platforms with evidence of data generation in publications or deposition in open access repositories: The Medical Research Council Unit, The Gambia at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (MRCG-LSHTM); West African Centre for Cell Biology and Infectious Disease Pathogens (WACCBIP), University of Ghana; Institute Pasteur Dakar, Senegal; Malaria Research and Training Center (MRTC), Mali; The African Center of Excellence in Genomics of Infectious Pathogens (ACEGIP), Nigeria. In Central Africa, genomics centres are almost entirely absent, with the exception of Institut National de Recherche Biom√®dicale DRC. Eastern and Southern Sub-Saharan Africa have many more institutions, including a large number of public, private and commercial platforms in South Africa. These institutions, supported by funders, are investing significantly in infrastructural and human capacity development. They provide platforms for teaching and research and are building momentum for advanced molecular bioscience research in West and Central Africa.</p>
