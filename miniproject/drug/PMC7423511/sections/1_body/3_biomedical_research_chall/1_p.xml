<p id="par0050">A lack of concerted financial commitment, skilled personnel and advanced infrastructure are top amongst the many hurdles facing biomedical science research in Africa (
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Omoleke et al., 2018</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Gilbert et al., 2020</xref>). Unlike in the global North, African capacities are heterogeneous, with wide differences between most sub-Saharan African countries and South Africa, for example. Moreover, research activities are little coordinated across borders, disallowing meaningful continental approaches. This is largely driven by lack of political will and buy-in by various African governments, which continue to consider investments in advanced scientific technologies as low priority despite the large burden of infectious diseases. The cost of acquiring and maintaining new technologies such as Next Generation sequencing platforms remain relatively high and outweighs other interventions. For instance, sequencing the genome of a virus or other pathogen can cost tens to several hundreds of dollars, depending on the sequencing platform used, the number of samples available and the depth of data required (
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Weymann et al., 2017</xref>). At the moment, direct budgeting and investment by African governments in medical research remains minimal, despite the pledge signed by all countries in the African Union to commit 2% GDP to investment in research, under the auspices of the ACDC designated body for coordinating disease control across the continent. Beyond data-generating platforms, there is also an acute shortage of expertise in genetic and genomic data analysis and interpretation for translation into public health interventions. This lack of trained human capacity has resulted in heavy reliance on research collaborators and donor funding from the global North for limited quality and few valid data outputs. Hence, the benefit of using genetic epidemiology data in real-time to inform policy is currently largely unrealistic.
