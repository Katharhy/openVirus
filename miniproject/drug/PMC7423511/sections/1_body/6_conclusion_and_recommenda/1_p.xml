<p id="par0070">Despite the efforts of ACDC to promote centralised genomic hubs, a situational analysis of continental needs and priority areas in epidemic preparedness and genomic intelligence is necessary. The current state of institutions, infrastructure and human resources for data generation, management and analysis needs urgent attention. To respond to epidemics such as COVID-19, genomic data generation for real-time decision making could be enhanced by the adoption and decentralised application of small, portable and easily operated experimental tools such as the Oxford Nanopore technology-MinION sequencer, Illumina MiniSeq or the BGI-DNBSeq across all countries. These easily deployable, user-friendly field-based technologies were instrumental in the sequencing of the Ebola virus (EBOV) during the last outbreak in West and Central Africa (
