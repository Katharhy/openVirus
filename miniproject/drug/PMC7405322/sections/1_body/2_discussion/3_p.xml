 </xref> In this case, the question raised is whether lack of BCG vaccination increased susceptibility to severe pulmonary TB, COVID‐19, and possibly other viral coinfection. The protective effects of BCG vaccination against severity and poor outcome in COVID‐19 infection is currently a subject of clinical trials.
