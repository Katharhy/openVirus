<p>Currently, it would be very difficult to predict whether PTB in children confers additional risk of developing severe COVID‐19. This case illustrates that children with confirmed PTB may have persistent or worsening symptoms due to other viral infections, including COVID‐19 infection, and may present with new pneumonia and exacerbation of TB‐associated nodal airway obstruction. However, the rapid improvement is reassuring. The child experienced short‐term deterioration of his airway obstruction due to COVID‐19, which subsequently rapidly improved. Oral prednisone at 2 mg/kg for TB airway obstruction was continued for 1 month even after recovery from COVID‐19.</p>
