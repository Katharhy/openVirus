<p>This case highlights the difficulty that diagnosis and management of COVID‐19 presents to clinicians in resource‐constrained countries with high TB and HIV burden. This child, known with PTB, presented with clinical symptoms that could have been presumed to be related due to either TB or COVID‐19. Routine management of children with significant airway obstruction is also compromised due to the risk bronchoscopy may hold. The nonspecific clinical and radiological findings of COVID‐19 in children complicate recognition. Computed tomography (CT) findings are thought to be more specific,

In patients with complicated PTB, with extensive parenchymal involvement, it would be impossible to differentiate from COVID‐19, based on symptoms and chest radiograph findings alone. Bronchoscopy has been used to confirm and determine the severity of tuberculous airway obstruction in children, guiding the decision either to treat medically with antituberculous drugs and oral prednisone or intervene surgically.

 </xref> As bronchoscopy is a very high‐risk aerosol‐generating medical procedure, in TB endemic areas, this has to be performed with strict indications and with full personal protective equipment (PPE).

 </xref> The indications for bronchoscopy in pediatric TB may need to be revised as full PPE, although optimal, is not always available in a resource‐constrained world and may be limited to only N95 masks.
