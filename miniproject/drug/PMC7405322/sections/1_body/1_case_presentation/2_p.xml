<p>A 2‐year 5‐month‐old human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)‐negative boy presented to his local hospital with fever, coughing, worsening respiratory distress, and loss of appetite 1 month after being diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) with a positive GeneXpert MTB/RIF, Rifampicin sensitive, on gastric aspirate. The chest radiograph at diagnosis demonstrated subcarinal lymph nodes and mild narrowing of the left main bronchus. He was started on a 4‐drug, weight‐appropriate, TB regimen at diagnosis. He did not receive prednisone at the time as the airway obstruction was deemed not to be clinically significant. There was no close contact with an adult TB source case at the time of the original or the current diagnosis. The mother was screened but was negative. He had no travel history, and at the time of presentation, we were not aware of contact with a confirmed COVID‐19 case. He did not receive the Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin (BCG) vaccine at birth due to local shortage at the time.</p>
