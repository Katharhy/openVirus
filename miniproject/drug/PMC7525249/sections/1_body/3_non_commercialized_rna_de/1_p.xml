<p id="p0025">Many institutes are keen to adopt isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology for the point-of-care testing of SARS-CoV-2, avoiding the need for a highly expensive thermal cycler. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) may be the most promising alternative to PCR, as it offers several advantages, in terms of specificity, sensitivity, reaction efficiency and product yield. For example, a reverse transcription (RT)-LAMP assay has been developed, targeting Nsp3 for SARS-CoV-2 detection, of which the limit of detection was 100 copies per reaction [

Yu etÂ al. prepared an RT-LAMP assay targeting ORF1ab and the spike gene, of which the limits of detection were 20 copies/reaction and 200 copies/reaction, respectively, within 60 min. The evaluation of a small clinical sample has demonstrated that some of the developed RT-LAMP assays have 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity [
