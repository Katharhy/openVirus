<p id="p0175">Serological tests, such as ELISA, can detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (such as IgG, IgM and IgA) from clinical specimens, which may not be as complicated as molecular tests and may be used in some cases for diagnosis [

 <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. A negative result cannot sort out SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in people who have recently been exposed to the virus. Antibodies that cross-react with non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus proteins are also a possible problem, and the results of past or current contact with other human coronaviruses are encouraging [
