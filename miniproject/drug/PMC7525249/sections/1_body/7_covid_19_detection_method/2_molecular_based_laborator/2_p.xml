<p id="p0160">Flocking swabs are the best choice for sample collection; it is best to use a swab with a plastic shaft or aluminium. Cotton swabs containing calcium alginate should be avoided as it may affect PCR testing. After collecting the sample, it should be transferred to a universal transport medium to preserve the viral nucleic acid. Samples collected from endotracheal aspirates, sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid can also be sent directly to the laboratory for processing, which may be more sensitive than the upper respiratory tract specimens [

The CDC and WHO have developed the most widely used SARS-CoV-2 detection method. The kit designed by CDC contains PCR primer probes for the two regions (N1 and N2) of the viral nucleocapsid gene, but the WHO PCR primer probes are different, and probe the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) gene and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) [
