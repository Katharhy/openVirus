<p id="p0165">Both detection methods have high detection sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 and have limited cross-reactivity with other circulating coronavirus strains, and both have a circulation threshold of &lt;40 as a positive standard (

In another report, SARS-CoV-2 was studied by inspecting a strong correlation between Ct and sample infectivity in a cell culture model. According to that study, infected individuals are can be detected up to 20 days after the onset of symptoms using PCR; however, isolation of the virus is not possible after day 8 because of high viral loads of approx. 10
 <sup>5</sup> RNA copies per mL. RT-PCR can show that patients with a Ct value ≥ 34 can be discharged. It has been suggested that the sensitivity of amplification on gene E detection would be less than on gene N. Moreover, the correlation between the viral RNA load and cell culture model for each centre can be performed independently [
