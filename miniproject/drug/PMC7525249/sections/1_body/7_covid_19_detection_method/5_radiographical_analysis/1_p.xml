<p id="p0185">The image features reported in COVID-19 are variable and uncertain, and there is a great overlap with the image features of SARS and MERS. Early evidence suggests that initial chest imaging will show abnormalities in at least 85% of patients and that, initially, 75% of patients will have bilateral lung involvement, most often occurring in the sub-pleural and peripheral areas as ground-glass appearance with distortion and convergence. Older age and gradual merger can predict a poorer prognosis. In addition to the acute phase, CT monitoring of individuals recovering from COVID-19 is recommended to assess long-term or permanent lung injury, including fibrosis, such as in SARS and MERS [

An analysis of five people who were initially diagnosed with COVID-19 with a negative viral swab test showed the importance of early CT results for disease diagnosis. This study suggests that the presence of typical CT findings in people suspected of having the virus may be useful for initial screening [

However, early reports indicate that preliminary imaging examinations can show normal findings in 15% of people, so standard chest imaging examinations cannot eliminate infections. Because chest imaging of individuals with COVID-19 is an important part of patient care, further research is needed to expand the understanding of imaging results during disease. SARS and MERS results indicate that people recovering from COVID-19 should be followed to check for signs of repeated lung injury (i.e. interlobular trapped air, thickening or fibrosis). Preventive measures may play a key role in reducing the spread of disease from person to person in the hospital. Radiologists should pay attention to all procedures and techniques to reduce the risk of infection by medical staff and patients [
