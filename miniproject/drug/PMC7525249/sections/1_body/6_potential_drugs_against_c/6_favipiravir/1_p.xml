<p id="p0080">The pro-drug favipiravir (6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazine carboxamide) is activated by intracellular phosphoribosylation to favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5B-triphosphate (Favipiravir-RTP), which acts as a substrate for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and potentially inhibits the activity of RdRp in RNA viruses. Among several types of RNA viruses, the catalytic domain of RdRp is conserved, so the broad antiviral activity of favipiravir is supported by this mechanism of action. The active Favipiravir-RTP with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.022 μg/mL hinders influenza virus RdRp, although up to 100 μg/mL does not affect the human DNA polymerase α, β, γ subunits. Additionally, favipiravir has a broad range of inhibitory effects on RNA viruses, e.g the arena-, bunya-, flavi- and filoviruses causing haemorrhagic fevers [

 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], and to some extent it is effective against Ebola virus [

 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Favipiravir is one of the possible drugs for COVID-19, as SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as a single-stranded RNA virus with an RdRp gene like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. However, there are no authentic 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and preclinical animal studies available. In an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study, favipiravir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 61.88 μM [
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], but other studies showed that 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> at concentrations under 100 μM favipiravir did not affect SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. At present, the existing knowledge is not sufficient to endorse the use of favipiravir to treat COVID-19, and further research is needed.
