<p id="p0120">Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. In recent years, it has shown 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiviral activity against various viruses. Initially, it was considered to be an inhibitor of the interaction of importin 1 heterodimer (accountable for nuclear importation of integrase protein) and human immunodeficiency virus 1. This confirms that ivermectin is responsible for inhibiting the nuclear import of integrase protein and human immunodeficiency virus type-1 replication. Other effects of ivermectin have been reported, other than the inhibition of the nuclear import of host and viral proteins. It has been shown to limit the infection of certain RNA viruses (including influenza virus, dengue fever virus and West Nile virus). Ivermectin has been similarly proven to be effective against the DNA virus pseudorabies virus both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and increased survival of pseudorabies virus-infected mice [

 <italic>in vitro</italic> study reported that ivermectin was found to be an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2. A single addition to Vero-hSLAM cells 2 hours after their infection with SARS-CoV-2 can effectively reduce the viral RNA approximately 5000 times for 48 hours. The authors assumed that this may be accomplished by inhibiting importin-α/β1-mediated nuclear importation of viral proteins and that this inhibition would disrupt the immune escape mechanism of the virus [

 <italic>in vitro</italic>, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and clinical trials are required to conclude its role in COVID-19 treatment.
