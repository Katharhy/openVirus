<p id="p0065">Chloroquine phosphate is an old drug used to treat malaria, it has been verified in a multicentre clinical trial conducted in China, with excellent efficacy and adequate safety in the treatment of COVID-19-related pneumonia [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Chloroquine phosphate was also used against the SARS-CoV and Zika virus epidemics as an important controlling agent. The role of chloroquine is to increase the pH of intracellular vacuoles and to change the protein degradation pathway by acid hydrolase in the lysosome, macromolecular production in the endosome, and post-translational protein modification in the Golgi. It also interferes with macrophages and other antigen-presenting cells, thus having an anti-rheumatic response [

The activity of chloroquine against viruses and as an anti-inflammatory agent might be one of the reasons for its effective efficacy to treat individuals with COVID-19 pneumonia. Over the last 70 years, chloroquine has been found to be a cost-effective and safe drug [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and in China, chloroquine phosphate at a dose of 500 mg/day in numerous clinical trials has shown potential activity against COVID-19. Hence, it is postulated that chloroquine could be used as a possible treatment for individuals with COVID-19-related pneumonia [
