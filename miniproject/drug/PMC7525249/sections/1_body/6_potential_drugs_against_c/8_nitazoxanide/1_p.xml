<p id="p0110">Nitazoxanide and its active metabolite tizoxanide have been shown to have effective 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV in Vero E6 cells, with EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2.12 μM and 0.92 μM, respectively. In addition to coronavirus, it also exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, rotavirus and norovirus [
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. It is believed that this broad-spectrum antiviral activity is due to the following characteristics. The basis of its activity is to interfere with the host regulatory pathways associated with viral replication, rather than virus-specific pathways [
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Nitazoxanide up-regulates the innate antiviral mechanism through extensive amplification of cytoplasmic RNA induction and the type I IFN pathway. Nitazoxanide interferes with viral infection by up-regulating the specific host mechanism of viral targeting to avoid host cellular defence [
