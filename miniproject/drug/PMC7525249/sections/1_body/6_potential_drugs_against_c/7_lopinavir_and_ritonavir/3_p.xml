<p id="p0095">Another study of 47 individuals with COVID-19 compared the standard of care (arbidol plus interferon-α inhaler) in five patients with combined treatment of lopinavir/ritonavir plus the standard of care (arbidol plus interferon-α inhaler) in 42 patients, and reported shorter times to normal body temperature and negative test in clinical samples for SARS-CoV-2 [

In another report, 44 patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 were randomly assigned to receive lopinavir/ritonavir (21 patients), arbidol (16 patients) or no antiviral drugs (7 patients as controls). There was no statistically significant difference in the fever reduction rate, cough relief rate, chest CT scan improvement rate, or clinical condition deterioration rate among the three groups (all p &gt; 0.05). Overall, 5 (23.8%) patients in the lopinavir/ritonavir group experienced adverse events during follow up whereas no obvious adverse events occurred in the arbidol or control groups. The study concluded that lopinavir/ritonavir or arbidol monotherapy seemed to have little benefit in improving the clinical outcome of mild/moderate COVID-19, but lopinavir/ritonavir may cause more adverse events [
