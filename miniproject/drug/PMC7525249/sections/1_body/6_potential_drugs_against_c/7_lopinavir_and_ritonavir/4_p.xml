<p id="p0100">In a randomized trial of 199 individuals with severe COVID-19, compared with standard treatment alone, lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg) was added to standard treatment twice a day for 14 consecutive days and did not decrease clinical improvement time [

Lopinavir/ritonavir had a tendency to reduce mortality (19% versus 25%, respectively), and there was a greater difference in mortality within 12 days of symptom onset, although the difference was not statistically significant. The rate of SARS-CoV-2 decrease was similar between the group receiving lopinavir/ritonavir and the group not receiving lopinavir/ritonavir. The proportion of early discontinuation for with lopinavir/ritonavir treatment was 14%. The patients engaged in this study had a progressive infection and previously had considerable tissue damage (as shown by compromised lung function and a 25% death rate in the control group). Even highly active antibacterial agents have limited efficacy in advanced bacterial pneumonia [
