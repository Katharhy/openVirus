<p id="p0075">The novel pro-drug remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue intracellularly activated to adenosine triphosphate analogue, which hinders the viral RNA polymerase, was initially developed as an antiviral drug against Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections. Remdesivir has potential activity against a broad range of virus families such as filoviruses (e.g. Ebola) and coronaviruses (e.g. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), displaying an effective therapeutic and prophylactic action against these coronaviruses in non-clinical models. An

 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.76 μM, which suggests that in non-human primate models the working concentration is expected to be achieved [

The group of patients severely affected by COVID-19 were treated with remdesivir, and it was found that among 53 individuals, 36 (68%) showed clinical improvement [

Because there are no placebos or active comparators in this study, it is difficult to draw any specific conclusions, and the determination of efficacy will require ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled results of remdesivir treatment. At present, four clinical trials recruiting patients in the USA and two other trials enrolled only in China have been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov:

 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Brouqui et al. have also compiled the critical data published on remdesivir use in COVID-19 patients. They found that no research supports convincingly the use of remdesivir in seriously ill patients. Treatment at the time of diagnosis is the key outcome for individuals with COVID-19; however, the adverse reaction associated with remdesivir sometimes leads to the interruption of treatment, and the intravenous route in this regard would probably restrict the use of remdesivir [
