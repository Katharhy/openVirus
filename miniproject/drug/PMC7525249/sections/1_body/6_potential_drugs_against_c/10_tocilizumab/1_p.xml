<p id="p0125">Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody IL-6 receptor inhibitor used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Tocilizumab binds to the soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors, ultimately binding to gp130 on the cell membrane, thereby inhibiting signal transduction and acting as a pro-inflammatory agent [

Similar to the alterations in SARS and MERS, the plasma of an individual with COVID-19 had high levels of the cytokines IL-6, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, tumour necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ-inducible protein, macrophage inflammatory protein 1α, monocyte chemoattractant protein and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, which suggests a cytokine storm [

In autopsy samples from individuals who died from severe COVID-19, histological examination revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar injury with fibrinous mucus-like exudates. Mononuclear inflammatory lymphocytes were observed in both lungs [

Some studies have reported the immune properties of individuals with COVID-19 and found that T cells and inflammatory monocytes are highly activated, resulting in excessive production of cytokines and inflammatory storm. Among the cytokines, IL-6 is the significant cytokine that causes an inflammatory storm, which may lead to increased pulmonary alveolar–capillary blood gas exchange dysfunction, particularly impaired oxygen diffusion, which ultimately leads to pulmonary fibrosis and organ failure [
