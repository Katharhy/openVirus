<p id="p0070">Hydroxychloroquine, an aminoquinoline, is less toxic; with the 
 <italic>N</italic>-diethyl chain of chloroquine substituted by an 
 <italic>N</italic>-hydroxyethyl side chain. This alteration in the side chain makes the hydroxychloroquine more soluble than chloroquine. The antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine is similar to that of chloroquine; by increasing the pH the hydroxychloroquine affects the activated immune cells and Toll-like receptor-mediated signal transduction, down-regulating Toll-like receptor expression and reducing the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) [

Prolonged treatment (at least 5 years) with hydroxychloroquine may cause retinopathy, which is a dose-limiting adverse effect of hydroxychloroquine, and a safe daily dose appears to correspond to 6.5 mg/kg of ideal body weight and 5.0 mg/kg of actual body weight [

 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Availability of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine is low in some countries, and chloroquine has a more adverse effect than hydroxychloroquine. For instance, in individuals with COVID-19, chloroquine leads to prolongation of the QT interval when interacting with lopinavir/ritonavir. Consequently, it is crucial when unable to treat COVID-19 patients, to consider using hydroxychloroquine instead of chloroquine. In Iran, it was necessary to use hydroxychloroquine instead of chloroquine due to scarcity. Hydroxychloroquine hindrance by other antiviral agents, such as oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, and by interferons and intravenous immunoglobulins is currently under investigation. Million et al. conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis on the use of chloroquine derivatives in COVID-19 patients. It was observed that the combined therapy of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin was more effective than hydroxychloroquine alone and the combined therapy was considered more important than monotherapy [

 <italic>in vitro</italic> study and this combination should not be neglected in COVID-19 therapy [
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Despite controversy as the virus spreads across borders, chloroquine derivatives are used by physicians on a large scale [
