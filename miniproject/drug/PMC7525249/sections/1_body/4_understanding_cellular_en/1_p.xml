<p id="p0030">Coronaviruses use spikes of advanced glycoprotein (S) (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) homotrimers to promote binding, fusion and entry to the host cell. These spikes are the core antigen existing on the viral surface and the target for neutralizing antibodies during the infection. As a result, glycoprotein (S) acts as a potential residue for vaccine design. Glycoprotein (S) synthesized as a single polypeptide of ∼1300 amino acids precursor belongs to class I viral fusion protein [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In most of the coronaviruses, the S protein is processed by host proteases and forms two subunits, named S1 and S2, that remain non-covalently bound in the pre-fusion conformation. The S1 N-terminal subunit contains four domains rich in β, respectively named as A, B, C and D, where the domain A or B serves as a receptor-binding domain in different coronaviruses. The S2 subunit transmembrane C-terminal is a metastable spring-loaded fusion mechanism [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. During the entry process, the S2 subunit is further cleaved proteolytically at the S2 site instantly upstream of the fusion peptide [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The second cleavage step occurs for all coronaviruses and is believed to activate proteins for membrane fusion, which occurs through irreversible conformational changes [
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Recently, cryo-electronic microscopy has led to the determination of the extracellular domain structure of the coronavirus S glycoprotein before and after fusion, providing an image of the beginning and end of the fusion reaction [

 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The entrance of coronavirus into the host cell is a complex process, necessitating several cellular factors. First, the attachment of the virus to the binding receptors, which enhances the cell surface density of the viral particles and/or promotes interaction with the fusion receptors. For instance, the binding of HCoV-OC43 and bovine coronavirus to 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-9-
 <italic>O</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], binding of HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV to heparan sulphate proteoglycans [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and binding of HCoV-HKU1 to 
 <italic>O</italic>-acetylated sialic acid [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In some cases, the attachment of the viral particle to the host cell is redundant [
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In other cases, the reduction of adhesion receptors primes to a lack of interaction between the virus and host cells, which leads to a significant decline in viral infectivity [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Coronaviruses use multiple fusion receptors, except for HCoV-NL63, which similar to SARS-CoV uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, most α-coronaviruses use aminopeptidase N (CD13) to enter cells [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. According to reports, HCoV-OC43 uses HLA class I molecules or sialic acid [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26) [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and the receptor for HCoV-HKU1 is still unknown [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Recognizing different receptors means not only different cell orientations, but also different internalization pathways. It is worth mentioning that the recent study also emphasizes the importance of other cytokines for viral tissue specificity, including tissue-specific proteases [
