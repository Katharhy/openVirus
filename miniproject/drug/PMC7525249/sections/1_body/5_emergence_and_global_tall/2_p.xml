<p id="p0040">Like other RNA viruses, SAR-CoV-2 has a high mutation rate, which is closely linked to increased virulence and virus evaluability [
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Mutation in the S protein is of significant clinical and public health concern as it may alter a virus's tropism, including the adaptation of the virus to new hosts, or increase the virus's pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Recently Yao etÂ al. accounted for a direct link of genetic mutation and variation of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. They investigated 11 samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Interestingly six different mutations were detected in the S protein. Two of these mutations were single nucleotide variants that led to similar missense mutations [
