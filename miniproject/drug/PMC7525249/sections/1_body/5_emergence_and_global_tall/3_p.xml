Despite substantial efforts by the global health community, the impact of COVID-19 in terms of morbidity and mortality rates remains high, especially in high-income countries compared with low-income countries. It was reported that in the first 5 months of the pandemic, the high-income and upper-middle-income countries had higher incidences and death rates per million compared with low-income and middle-income countries [
