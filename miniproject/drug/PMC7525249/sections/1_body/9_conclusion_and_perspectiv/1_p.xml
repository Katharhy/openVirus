<p id="p0200">There is an intensifying health crisis around the globe caused by COVID-19, mainly distressing economically developed countries and responsible for high morbidity and mortality rates. An escalating threat to global COVID-19 control mandates the development and application of new tools. At the forefront, the diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 from clinical samples must be rapid and accurate. Urgency is required for investigations to unravel the complex pathways that hamper not only the clinical application of available drugs but also the development of new anti-COVID-19 treatments. The absence of effective drugs is the prime reason for the rapid spread of COVID-19. In this review, we discuss drugs used against COVID-19 and their mechanisms of action, both those used initially and those drugs that are still in use, such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, remdesivir, tociluzimab, nitazoxanide and ivermectin [

Some of the drugs are not effective and have been suspended by WHO. New knowledge along with detailed understanding of COVID-19's mechanisms would be tremendously helpful in the development of new, highly effective anti-COVID-19 drugs. Studying coronaviruses will assist in understanding the principles of cross-species transmission and adaptation to humans and prepare for possible outbreaks of zoonotic diseases in the future and their treatment.
