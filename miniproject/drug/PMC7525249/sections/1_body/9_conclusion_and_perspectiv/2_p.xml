<p id="p0205">From the perspective of the current pandemic, designing effective therapies for SARS-CoV-2 is another challenge for scientists. Although many antiviral treatments against SARS and MERS have been reported to have strong 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity, there are limited options with clinical potential. Treatment options are now available that can be used clinically during the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Some of the broad-spectrum antiviral drugs may be effective against SARS-CoV-2, and the current scenario of COVID-19 around the globe provides an opportunity to test them. The design and development of new broad-spectrum antiviral drugs that could potentially target all coronaviruses may be the only treatment option to prevent re-emerging and circulating coronaviruses. Moreover, new data on the clinical characteristics, treatment options and outcomes of COVID-19 appear constantly, and doctors working in patient care should keep up to date with the latest information on this issue. Finally, people should practice good hygiene, frequently washing their hands, maintaining social distances and wearing masks.
