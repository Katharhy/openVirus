<p id="p0100">Personal protective equipment (PPE) is specialised clothing or equipment worn by healthcare workers for their protection and to help prevent the spread of infection between patients. It includes gloves, gowns, aprons, goggles or visors and facemasks. Wearing PPE does not guarantee total protection and must be used in combination with precautionary measures such as meticulous ‘doffing’ (protocolised removal of PPE to minimise the risk of self-contamination) and rigorous hand hygiene.
