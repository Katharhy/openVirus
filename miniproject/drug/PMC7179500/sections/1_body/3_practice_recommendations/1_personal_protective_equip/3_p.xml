<p id="p0110">Europe has two different standards for these devices. The ‘filtering face piece’ score (FFP) comes from EN standard 149:2001. The EN 143 standard covers P1/P2/P3 ratings. The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health classifies particulate filtering facepiece respirators into nine categories (N95, N99, N100, P95, P99, P100, R95, R99, and R100). A comparison of filter capacity of the different masks (percentage of all particles 0.3 microns in diameter or larger that are removed) is shown in
