<p id="p0225">The PPE worn during general anaesthesia for caesarean section should include protection against aerosol exposure (e.g. an FFP respirator). As always, closed-loop communication is recommended, especially because the use of PPE for AGP can impair verbal communication. An HME exchanger with viral filtration should be present within the circuit at all times. Disconnection of the circuit should be avoided but, if necessary, should be between the HME and the circuit. Cardiovascular collapse following induction of anaesthesia has been reported in the non-obstetric population with severe COVID-19 and vasopressors should be immediately available for managing hypotension. Impairment of respiratory function with COVID-19 lower respiratory tract infection, coupled with pregnancy-related reduction in lung capacity, means that rapid desaturation should be anticipated following induction. Pre-oxygenation is mandatory but high-flow nasal or face mask oxygen is not recommended because of the increased risk of aerosolisation. A tight-fitting facemask applied using a two-hand technique (to ensure a good seal), with standard flow-rate oxygen, is advised. Gentle, low-pressure manual ventilation using a tight seal on the face mask or via a supraglottic airway device may be necessary if desaturation occurs. The intubating clinician should ensure that at least two pairs of gloves are worn. In some centres, three pairs are worn with the external pair being removed immediately after intubation. It would be prudent to decontaminate the work surfaces around the patientâ€™s head and the anaesthetic machine after intubation to reduce risk of viral transmission from fomite spread.</p>
