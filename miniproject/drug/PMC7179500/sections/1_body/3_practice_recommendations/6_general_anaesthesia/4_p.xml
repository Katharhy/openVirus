<p id="p0230">Tracheal extubation is also a high-risk procedure for aerosol generation. Avoid coughing by the patient and where possible minimise the number of staff in the room during extubation. A recent analysis has evaluated pharmacological methods to minimise emergence coughing after general anaesthesia with tracheal intubation.

 </xref> A variety of agents (dexmedetomidine, remifentanil, fentanyl, intra-cuff or intravenous lidocaine and lidocaine via tracheal or topical application) were evaluated and found to be better than placebo or no medication in reducing moderate to severe emergence cough; dexmedetomidine was ranked the most effective. However, whether these findings could be useful in a population at high-risk of emergence coughing is unknown. The use of agents such as remifentanil and dexmedetomidine has to be carefully balanced against their sedative, respiratory and haemodynamic effects on the mother. A further consideration is that using small amounts of these drugs in this context is usually associated with significant waste. This may become relevant as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, with the possible development of drug shortages due to increased demand and disruption in the supply chain.
