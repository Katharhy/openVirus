<p id="p0135">Labour ventilation is not aerosol-generating, therefore only droplet transmission PPE precautions are indicated in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. As such, for neuraxial placement, a hat, eye protection, a surgical mask, sterile fluid-resistant long-sleeved gown and sterile gloves should be worn.
