 </xref> Therefore, PPE for AGP should not be required for staff caring for women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who wish to use nitrous oxide analgesia during labour. There is, however, a risk of viral contamination of the breathing system and the equipment circuit must contain an anti-viral filter.

 </xref> Many commonly available heat and moisture exchangers (HME) used in anaesthetic practice meet this standard and many Entonox® delivery systems come with a suitable filter as standard.
