<p id="p0150">There are no data currently about the use of remifentanil PCA in obstetric patients with COVID-19 infection. It should be used with caution in labour due to the risk of respiratory depression, especially in women with respiratory symptoms. Remifentanil should be avoided in women with oxygen saturations &lt;95% due to the risk of further desaturation.</p>
