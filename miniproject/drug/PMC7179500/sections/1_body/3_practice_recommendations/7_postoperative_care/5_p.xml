<p id="p0255">There is emerging evidence suggesting that individuals admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection are hypercoagulable. This, coupled with the hypercoagulability of pregnancy, would suggest that pregnant women with COVID-19 are more vulnerable to thromboembolism. The risk may be compounded by self-isolation at home or hospital admission. A UK recommendation is that all pregnant women admitted with COVID-19 infection (or suspected COVID-19 infection) should receive prophylactic low molecular weight heparin unless birth is expected within 12â€¯h (e.g. for a woman with increasing oxygen requirements).
