 </xref> The clinical outcomes of pregnant women during the SARS epidemic were worse than those of non-pregnant women, with higher rates of tracheal intubation, renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

  <sup>15</sup>
 </xref> Data for pregnant women from the MERS outbreak are also suggestive of worse outcomes.

 <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> As well as the viral inflammatory process, pregnant women were vulnerable to secondary bacterial infection pneumonia. The cardiorespiratory physiological changes of pregnancy may predispose women with pneumonia to respiratory failure.

  <sup>18</sup>
 </xref> Fetal outcomes in pregnant women with pneumonia are significantly worsened; the fetus is vulnerable to intra-uterine growth restriction and in utero demise.
