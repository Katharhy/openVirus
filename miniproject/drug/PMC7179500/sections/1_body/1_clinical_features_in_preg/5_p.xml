 </xref> Computed tomography (CT) chest imaging revealed features of severe atypical pneumonia with ground-glass opacities. The patient was admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory support, but following a decrease in fetal movements and a loss of fetal heart rate variability, she underwent emergency caesarean delivery under combined spinal-epidural (CSE) anaesthesia. The preterm infant tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Subsequent serial CT scans showed resolution of pneumonic changes and both mother and baby experienced an uncomplicated postnatal course.
