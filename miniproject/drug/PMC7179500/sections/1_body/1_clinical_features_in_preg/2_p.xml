<p id="p0070">Polymerase chain reaction testing for acute SARS-Cov-2 infection requires nasopharyngeal swabs. Inpatients or patients requiring admission to hospital who have clinical or radiological evidence of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or a fever &gt;37.8°C, in combination with a persistent cough, hoarseness, nasal discharge/congestion, shortness of breath, sore throat, wheezing or sneezing, require testing. Patients who meet these criteria should be isolated and managed as ‘positive’ until test results are available.
