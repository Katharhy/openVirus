<p id="p0040">Coronaviruses were first identified as a cause of infection in animals in the 1930s and human infection in the 1960s. They are named after the ring of spiked glycoproteins forming a halo structure on the outer surface of the virus. There are three groups and four types (alpha, beta, gamma and delta) of coronavirus; human infection arises from viruses in Groups I and II.

Much like the coronaviruses that caused SARS and the 2012–2014 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which are also beta coronaviruses, COVID-19 is thought to have originated in a non-human species. The closest match to the human coronavirus has been found in a bat in China’s Yunnan province; 96% of the genetic material of bat coronavirus is shared with SARS-CoV-2.
