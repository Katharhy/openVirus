<p>Media is the primary source of information and plays a vital role in educating the masses. However, when overly eager sources spread information without proper verification, not only can it be harmful but it can have unintended consequences. The hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) example fits the scenario. HCQ, a lyso-somatotrophic agent, is an approved drug to treat malaria and some autoimmune diseases. Its propensity to fight certain viruses is explained by its role in blocking the function of lysosomes. It is postulated that at an acidic pH, certain viruses, after being internalized through the plasma membrane of cells, can fuse with lysosomal membranes, thus entering the cells and replicating. Chloroquine being a weak base, enters into lysosomes and raises the pH of the lysosome. As the pH rises, lysosomal enzymes fail to function, and viruses requiring acidic pH can no longer enter the cells. The productive role of chloroquine against SARS-CoV- 2 has been demonstrated in vitro [

 <xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The first trial was done by Chinese investigators, followed by the French, which showed the drug’s efficacy in the duration of symptoms, radiological picture, and hospital stay. These trials were limited, non-randomized, and done on a small scale. Based on these limited trials, ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) recommended using chloroquine in healthcare workers and asymptomatic contacts without significant data. However, the CDC's clinical guidance on the use of chloroquine for prophylaxis was lacking because of the absence of results from Randomized Control Trials (RCTs).
