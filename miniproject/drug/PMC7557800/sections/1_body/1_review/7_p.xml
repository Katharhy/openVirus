<p>The implausible claim of the virus affecting the geriatric population made the young vulnerable. This ultimately resulted in a large number of young affected by the virus. This unscientific and unproven fact spread like wildfire in the media and made the elderly go through many psychological and physical terrors. There were reports of old people being removed from family homes, and increased emotional abuse cases among them. This changed the public’s perception of the elderly population and caused increased depression among them based on society’s prompt reactions. In contrast, the millennials, college students, and high schoolers made their way to beaches to party in anticipation of their annual Spring Break Weekend, which later proved hazardous. Social media spread this spurious information regarding the virus that played with the minds of people who started refuting the importance of social distancing. Moreover, disruption in professional lives and sticking to social media in all this free time, highlighted the problems like racism and wealth inequality. Many cases of domestic violence were also reported. This further adds to the already growing depression due to quarantine.</p>
