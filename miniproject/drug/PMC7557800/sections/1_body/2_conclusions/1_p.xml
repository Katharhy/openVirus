<p>COVID-19 is a global crisis that has spread throughout the world at a dangerously fast pace. Mass media plays a huge role in circulating information, influences the public behavior and can curtail the spread of disease. In this article, we discussed the positive and negative impacts of media and proposed steps that can be taken to use media effectively in outbreaks. Furthermore, we recommend creating a model to evaluate the media response at the end of each epidemic and pandemic. This evaluation can serve as a feedback for the media to help devise better and more effective strategies to control and prevent subsequent outbreaks.</p>
