  <p>The potential therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. The spikes of the virus attach ACE2 receptor on the host cell membrane and this ACE2 could be a target to prevent viral entry. Moreover, Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is helper membrane protein for the viral entry, on which any modification could control cellular infection. The same also could be applied to ACE2 receptor, which when blocked, the viral particle would not be able to enter the host cell. Although the blocking ACE2 will affect patients as they will suffer from the negative effect of angiotensin II. Vaccines against spike protein is also a proposed intervention strategy.</p>
