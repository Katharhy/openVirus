<p id="p0105">Researchers all over the globe are striving to develop effective vaccines or therapeutic molecules to combat the deadly COVID-19 infection. For the sake of developing novel drugs, the COVID-19 main protease was made publicly available to expedite the process. 
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Ton et al. (2020)</xref>, have developed a tool, namely Deep Docking for the computer-based screening of a large number of molecules in a very short time. They identified 1000 potential ligands for the main protease of COVID-19 from nearly 1.3 billion compounds available in the ZINC15 library. These generated compounds are available for further characterization and improvements. Since no specific antiviral agents are available, therefore, the provided treatment options to COVID-19 patients are all supportive in nature. Besides effective treatment options and preventive strategies must be developed and practiced as the COVID-19 has the highest potential to spread compared to its family members; SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (
