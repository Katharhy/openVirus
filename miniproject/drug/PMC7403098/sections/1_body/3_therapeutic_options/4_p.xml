 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Matsuyama et al. (2020)</xref>, reported that VeroE6 cell line expressing transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is highly susceptible to COVID-19 infection, thus, it can be used for isolating and propagating SARS-CoV-2, and developing novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. Despite their effectiveness against COVID-19 infection, ganciclovir, acyclovir, ribavirin, oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir are not promising options to treat COVID-19. However, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and monoclonal antibodies can be used to treat COVID-19 after evaluating their safety and efficacy on a large scale until, a promising drug is developed (
