<p id="p0175">The deadly and highly infectious COVID-19 pandemic is spreading unstoppably in almost all countries of the world. Until now, no promising vaccines or drugs are available that could be recommended on a large scale. The actual numbers of the infected people may be larger than reported figures due to the lack of high testing capacity in some countries, accurate data recording systems in different countries, or the presence of weak systems for data collection. This pandemic may get worsened in the near future if not effective treatment or vaccine is developed to combat or prevent the virus. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs have been sequenced and are available online, as well as all research reports on COVID-19 are freely available, therefore, the scientific community should take advantage of them in order to develop strategies to control the rapid spread of COVID-19 and eradicate the SARS-CoV-2. There is a possibility that more coronaviruses could emerge in the future and cause deadly outbreaks. Therefore, strategies should be developed that could prevent the emergence of new viruses and/or minimizing the health consequences if any new pathogenic virus emerges.</p>
