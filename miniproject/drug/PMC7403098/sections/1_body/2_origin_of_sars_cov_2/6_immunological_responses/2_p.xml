<p id="p0090">In COVID-19, the immune response is less rigorous, as a result, the elder people and individuals with underlying conditions are prone to develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and death (
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2020a</xref>). However, fever associated with ARDS may lead to better outcomes among patients. COVID-19-infected individuals demonstrate increased levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines. For example, attenuation or even reduction in the number of T cells was observed in severe cases. Moreover, suppressor T cells, regulatory T cells, memory helper T cells, and helper T cells were negatively affected while naive helper T cells showed an increased level in severe cases, suggesting that the primary target of COVID-19 infection is T lymphocytes (

 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al. (2020)</xref> (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2020</xref>) reported a comprehensive decline of lymphocytes including CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, B cells, and NK cells, and the elevation of interleukins (IL-2 and IL-6), which can be considered as reliable biomarkers in severe COVID-19 disease (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> ). Furthermore, analysis of ILs in the serum samples of critical, severe, and mild COVID-19 cases showed that the expression of Interleukins (IL-2 receptor and IL-6) was comparatively higher in the critical cases than severe and mild ones. However, no statistical differences in the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>), Interleukins (IL-1, IL-8, IL-10), High-sensitivity C-reactive Protein (hs-CRP), lymphocyte count, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) between the three patient groups were reported (

 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2020a)</xref> suggested that the severity of COVID-19 is correlated with increased IgG response, where the blood group is linked with the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A recent study in COVID-19 patients (n = 1775) reported that individuals with blood group A have a substantially higher risk, whereas those with blood group O are comparatively at lower risk for contracting COVID-19 infection (
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). Although it is very early to conclude, however, the results obtained in this study were similar to a previous study on SARS, where SARS-CoV was reported with a lower rate of infectiousness in individuals with blood group O (
