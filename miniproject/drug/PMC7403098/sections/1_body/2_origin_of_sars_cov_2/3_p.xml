<p id="p0075">Bats are the natural reservoirs of highly pathogenic viruses especially, coronaviruses which constitute 31% of their virome. They are immune to viral infection and the characteristics such as higher species diversity (over 1400), roosting, longer life span (over 30 years), and migration transmit the viral pathogens across the political and geographical boundaries (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Allocati et al.</xref>). Globally, only 77 countries reported 5717 bat-associated animal viruses in 207 different bat species (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al.</xref>). However, in bats, the traits including roosting, grouping, and unique immune system can interfere with the genetic system of the viruses to generate novel mutant and recombinant viruses (Han et al.). 
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Han et al. (2019)</xref>, investigated 831 bats belonging to 15 species and reported 11 coronavirus strains in four bat species. Further investigation revealed that the four 
 <italic>α</italic>-CoVs from bats species were similar to that previously isolated from porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), indicating a common ancestor of the CoVs in both bats and pigs. Moreover, a synthesized CoV revealed that the PEDV possibly evolved from the CoV of bats, while another 
 <italic>α</italic>-CoV (
 <italic>α</italic>-YN2018) might be originated from other bat species. These observations suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may have multiple host origins. An intensive study on immortalized bat cell lines indicated that human CoVs can spread 
 <italic>via</italic> zoonotic-reverse zoonotic transmission cycles, and this might give some CoVs the chance to circulate and exchange segments of genetic material between strains detected in bats and other mammals, including humans. Furthermore, CoV can infect other vertebrates including ducks, geese, chickens, quails, pigeons, and sparrows, and use these hosts as a natural reservoir (
