<p id="p0160">Recent pandemic of COVID-19 has encouraged several research groups all over the world to develop promising vaccines, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies. The traditional antiviral agents are not promisingly effective against the COVID-19, therefore, searching for novel therapeutic options is global demand. Recently, several research groups have investigated various options to treat COVID-19 disease, however, until now, they have not found any drug that could be approved and recommended worldwide. Therefore, further investigations and experiments are necessary to reach an effective treatment strategy. Active hexose correlated compound (AHCC) is an

Although the efficacy of AHCC has not been investigated in COVID-19 patients, it could be used at least to boost the immune response against the COVID-19 (
