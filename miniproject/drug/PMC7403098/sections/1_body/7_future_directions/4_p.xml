<p id="p0170">The need for a faster sensing process at a lower detection limit is an important but challenging strategy. Designing novel antibody conjugated composite electrodes is critical for more sensitive and rapid practical applications. It is clear that the electrical charge transport improves the sensing characteristics of the biosensor, thus, conducting polymers such as polyaniline (PAN) can be proposed as a host matrix. It is well known that the chain length and positive charge in its backbone are reversible with the applied electrical pulse (

These cost-effective and eco-friendly composite assays can be developed from disposable electrodes for multi detection purposes.
