INVALID CITATION (Yang et al., 2020c)!!!) reported that out of 52 COVID-19 patients, 32 were suffering from chronic diseases such as cerebrovascular diseases (22%) and diabetes (22%). Meanwhile, 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Guan et al. (2020)</xref>, analyzed data from 1099 COVID-19 patients and found that 173 patients had chronic diseases: diabetes mellitus (16.2%), coronary heart diseases (5.8%), cerebrovascular disease (2.3%), and hypertension (23.7%). The expression of ACE2 is elevated in diabetic and hypertensive patients, which are treated with inhibitors for ACE and angiotensin II type-I receptor. ACE inhibitors and ARBs increase the expression of ACE2. Consequently, this would facilitate the infection with SARS-CoV-2, which uses this protein as an entry point to the cells (

In addition, ACE2 is not only expressed in the alveolar epithelial cells, but also in the heart, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, testis, and pancreas, and thus makes these tissues and organs susceptible to COVID-19 infection and damage to multiple organs (
