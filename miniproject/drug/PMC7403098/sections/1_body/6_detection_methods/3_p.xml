<p id="p0155">Besides PCR-based methods, researchers and clinical laboratory workers are making efforts to develop and use faster, reliable, and more efficient techniques for COVID-19 detection. For instance, a CRISPR-Cas12-based method has been developed with an estimated detection limit of 10 copies/μL (

 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al. (2020b)</xref> developed a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method, using RNA reverse transcription and nucleic acid amplification in a single step within 30 min. According to 
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2020)</xref>, nanopore target sequencing (NTS) method can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses simultaneously within 6–10 h. Nonetheless, an efficient, rapid, and cost-effective technique is still required to be developed so that testing procedures could become easy in low income and hardest hit countries.
