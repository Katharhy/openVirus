 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] by adding polar hydrogen atoms, removing water molecules, implying amber parameters, followed by minimization with the MMTK method in 500 steps with a step size of 0.02 Ã…. SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> contained chain A and B of 306 amino acids sequence length. Chain A of PDB ID: 6Y2G containing alpha-ketoamide (O6K) inhibitor was used for identification of substrate binding site.
