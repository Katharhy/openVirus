<p id="Par34">The docking of SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> specific pharmacological inhibitors into the catalytic site was performed by the AutoDock 4.2 program [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The alpha-ketoamide (O6K) inhibitor was extracted from the SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> protein. The polar hydrogen atoms were added, the non-polar hydrogen atoms were merged, Gasteiger charges were assigned and solvation parameters were added to the protease, SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> protein. The protonation state for all inhibitors and O6K were set to physiological pH and rotatable bonds of the ligands were set to be free. The AutoGrid program was also used to generate grid maps. Cys145 residue in the SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> protein was selected with grid box dimensions of 40 × 40 × 40 Å formed around the Cys145 protease residue, which is present in the substrate binding site. Protein rigid docking was performed using the empirical free energy function together with the Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. LGA default parameters were used in each docking procedure and 10 different poses were calculated. Chimera and Discovery Studio (DS) Visualizer2.5 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] software were used for visualisation and calculation of protein–ligand interactions.
