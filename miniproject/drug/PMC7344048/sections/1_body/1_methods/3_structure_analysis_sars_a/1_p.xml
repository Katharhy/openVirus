<p id="Par31">Crystal structure of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> with bound inhibitors were collected from the protein data bank (PDB) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. PDB ID: 3TNT, SARS main protease was selected as reference to analyse the variants in SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> (PDB ID: 6Y2G). All the PDBs were visualised using UCSF Chimera software [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Multiple alignment, ribbon, surface and superimposition module in Chimera software were used for analysis and image generation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].
