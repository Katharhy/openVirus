<p id="Par26">Since the initial stages of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, laboratories and hospitals around the world have sequenced viral genome data with unprecedented speed, enabling real-time understanding of this novel disease process, which will hopefully contribute to the development of novel candidate drugs. The complete genomes of SARS-Cov-2 from all over the world have been deposited at The Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] database and more sequences continue to be deposited with the passage of time. Development of a novel vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 so far remains elusive and requires a thorough understanding of molecular changes in viral genetics. This may be attained by freely accessing the GISAID database and processing the data to enhance our understanding of the fine biochemical and genetic differences that differentiate this virus from the previously known strains [
