<p id="Par28">The purpose of this study is to characterise known viral variants that have spread across different countries, especially hot-spot regions, with a focus on recurrent mutations in South American and African geographical regions. We also focused on the SARS-CoV-2 main proteinase, 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> which is highly conserved in most of the coronaviruses and has been suggested to be a potential drug target to fight against nCovid-19. Repurposed drugs such as flavonoids and biflavanoids, known anti-malarial and anti-viral drugs and the inhibitory effects of vitamins could selectively inhibit this enzyme and can be used either alone or in combination with other disease management approaches to suppress the virulence of SARS-CoV-2. These bioinformatics, computational modelling and molecular docking approaches using repurposed drugs could be particularly useful in the current nCovid-19 outbreak.
