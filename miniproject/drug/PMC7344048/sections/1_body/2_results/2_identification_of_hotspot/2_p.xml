<p id="Par38">For its actions, single-stranded SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral genome encodes two protease polyproteins (i) papain-like cysteine-protease (PL
 <sup>pro</sup>) and (ii) the chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease known as 3C-like protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>). 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, which is a main protease and therefore important in order to examine the incidence of any mutation in SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. Multiple sequence alignment of the SARS-CoV-2 genome collected from patients in six different geographical locations exhibited 100% similarity and no discernible variations in sequences obtained from diverse geographical regions, for this enzyme.
