<p id="Par36">Sequences from bat-SARS-CoV and Pangolin-SARS-CoV were aligned and compared to the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2) as a reference genome. To determine the evolutionary relationship among bat-CoV, Pangolin-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, we estimated a phylogenetic tree based on the nucleotide sequences of the whole-genome sequence. Bat-SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were grouped together and were observed to share &gt; 96% similarity, whereas the Pangolin-SARS-CoV was closest evolutionary ancestor (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). Isolate of human Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2) shared 85.98% identity with Pangolin-SARS-CoV which suggests that Pangolin may be associated with SARS-CoV-2 evolution or subsequent outbreak [
