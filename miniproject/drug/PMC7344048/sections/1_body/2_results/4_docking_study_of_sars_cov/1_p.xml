<p id="Par40">The SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> receptor binding pocket was determined by superimposing SARS and SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> with their respective inhibitors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Interestingly, Needleman-Wunsch alignment algorithm and BLOSUM-62 matrix analysis revealed 94.44% sequence identity between SARS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, grey) and SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, Cyan). Cys-His catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) comprises the active catalytic binding site in SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a’, b) and indicated the strong possibility that intended pharmacological inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> may also suppress the activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> viral enzymes. Docking protocol for the Autodock 4.2 program was optimized by extracting and re-docking the alpha-ketoamide inhibitor named O6K in the binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. The lowest binding energy − 6.45 kcal/mol and 18.72 µM inhibitory constant (K
 <italic>i</italic>) was predicted for alpha-ketoamide inhibitor (shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Re-docking of O6K inhibitor occupied the similar docking pose in the SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> catalytic dyad active site as previously reported in the crystal structure (PDB ID: 6Y2G) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c, d).
