<p id="Par42">Amentaflavone, a biflavonoid showed the highest binding energy (− 8.49 kcal/mol) implicating a strong affinity with SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. This corresponded with previously reported enzyme inhibitory assays with amentaflavone that showed the highest IC
 <sub>50</sub> value at low concentrations of the molecule, 8.3 ± 1.2 µM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, bilobetin demonstrated the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> value at a higher concentration of 72.3 ± 4.5 µM in SARS-CoV enzyme activity assays [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In contrast, our docking studies revealed that bilobetin, predicted almost comparable binding energy with that of amentaflavone (− 8.29 kcal/mol) suggesting that mutation in SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> could potentially disrupt hydrogen bonding or induce some conformational change that could result in alterations in the binding site thus affecting inhibitor interactions with the enzyme active site residues. Amentaflavone showed H-bond interactions with the catalytic dyad residues (Cys145 and His41) as well as noteworthy interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> residues Thr26, Ser46, Ser144 and Glu166 whereas His164, and Gln189 amino acids contributed to the hydrophobic interactions for the SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors (Fig.
