<p id="Par39">SARS and SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes were collected from NCBI, GenBank database (NC_004718 and NC_045512). Protease nucleotide sequences were extracted from SARS (NC_004718) and were aligned with SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512). Clustal Omega alignment of 918 SARS nucleotides showed around 95% similarity with SARS-CoV-2 (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). Higher amino acid sequence identity was also observed in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) derived from Wuhan and US patients. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> showed highly conserved region in both the catalytic sites, His41 and Cys145 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and substrate binding region of the enzyme (163-167 and 187-192) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a), inferring that these proteases exhibit high similarities. Furthermore, 12 variant positions (Thr35Val, Ala46Ser, Ser65Asn, Leu86Val, Arg88Lys, Ser94Ala, His134Phe, Lys180Asn, Leu202Val, Ala267Ser, Thr285Ala and Ile286Leu) were observed in SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, c). The effects of mutations and potential resultant amino acids on SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> structure are expected to conserve the polarity and hydrophobicity, except when the resulting amino acid is Leucine at 286 position. However, it is important to mention that these 12 variants are not present in catalytic and substrate binding regions which are involved in critical proteolytic activity of the SARS-CoV-2 protease molecule.
