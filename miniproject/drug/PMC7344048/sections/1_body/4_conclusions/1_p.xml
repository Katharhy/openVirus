<p id="Par50">Various theories have been proposed regarding the origin of highly virulent SARS-CoV-2 particle. Our analysis shows that Bat-SARS-CoV shares &gt; 90% similarity with the SARS-CoV-2, however it is possible that the bat coronavirus infected another “intermediate host”, such as Pangolin, which subsequently transmitted the virus to humans. Pangolin isolates do share sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2 genomes and could be an intermediate host. We identified novel mutation hotspot regions from South American and African isolates of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. Interestingly, double point mutations in RdRp at position 14,805 and 14,808 and triple point mutations in nucleocapsid protein at position 28,881, 28,882 and 28,883 were identified in both South American and African genomic sequences, suggesting the vulnerability of these genetic loci to undergo change. In addition, a novel mutation pattern specifically oriented towards nucleocapsid phosphoprotein in both South American and African sequences was noted while novel ORF3a and RdRp specific variants were observed particularly from African genomic sequences. The potential effects of double and triple point mutations on translated proteins and the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 requires further investigations. SARS-CoV-2 main proteinase, 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> genome was observed to be conserved across all collected genomic sequences. Despite significant similarities in the SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> structure with SARS-CoV protein, SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> revealed certain key differences, which highlight the extreme need for identification of novel mechanism-based drugs to target the virus processing. Repurposed drugs including natural flavonoids and bioflavonoids, antimalarial, antiviral and vitamins-based compounds have previously been shown to be beneficial in several viral infections and outbreaks. The novel data generated from this study enhances our knowledge of the fine molecular differences that differentiate SARS-CoV-2 virus SARS-CoV. It also highlights the emerging variations in the viral genome across different populations as the virus evolves to local genetic and environmental factors. These findings will likely play a key role in the development of mechanism-based and targeted therapeutic strategies to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduce its virulence.
