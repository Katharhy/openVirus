<p id="Par47">Based on more recent virus genome sequencing results and evolutionary analysis, the origins and transmission of nCovid-19 have uncovered bats as the natural host of the virus origins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. As such, studies earlier this year queried the unknown intermediate host between bats and humans, and recent studies have pointed this to pangolins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. To determine the extent of the evolutionary relationship between bat-CoV, Pangolin-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, we corroborate that based on the nucleotide sequences of the whole-genome sequence, bat-SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are grouped together and share &gt; 96% similarity, with Pangolin-SARS-CoV as the closest evolutionary ancestor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Furthermore, we report that in isolates of human Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 there is an 85.98% similarity in identity to Pangolin-SARS-CoV, which suggests that Pangolin may be associated with the evolution of subsequent outbreaks of COVID-19.
