<p id="p0030">Immune cells have been known to express vitamin D receptors (VDR) and various immune cells (monocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells and T cells) are capable of converting 25-hydroxy Vit D (25OHD) into active form 1,25-(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> D. This permits local regulation of the 1,25-(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> D at the site of inflammation [
 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Binding of 1,25-(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> D to the VDR leads to translocation of the complex into the cell nucleus where it modifies the expression of hundreds of genes, including those for cytokine production [
 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The complex also induces the production of antimicrobial peptides including cathelicidin and defensins [
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A study by Zhao et al [
 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] showed reduction in the replication of rotavirus both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> by administration of Vit D at dose of 5000 IU/kg. Induction of cytokine storm is reduced by Vit D. The innate immune system generates both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in patients suffering from COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Vit D can decrease the production of T helper cell type 1 (Th1) cytokines such as interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) [
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Also, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages is reduced and anti-inflammatory cytokines is increased by Vit D administration [
