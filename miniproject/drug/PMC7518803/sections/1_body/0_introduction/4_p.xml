<p id="p0145">In general, SARS-CoV-2 first causes pneumonia via the respiratory tract. The main symptoms are fever, dry cough, fatigue or myalgia. Chest X-ray shows extensive inflammatory infiltrates of the lungs. While most patients with COVID-19 present with respiratory symptoms as the primary clinical manifestations, some patients present with cardiovascular symptoms, including palpitations and chest tightness, as the initial symptoms. Therefore, it is essential to investigate SARS-CoV-2â€“related cardiovascular symptoms and potential mechanisms and search for potential treatment targets and practical treatment strategies to facilitate epidemic prevention and control.</p>
