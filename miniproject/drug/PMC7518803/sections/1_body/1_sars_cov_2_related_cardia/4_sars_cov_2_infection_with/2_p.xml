<p id="p0170">Some SARS-CoV-2 patients have chronic underlying diseases, especially cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and these patients are more susceptible to severe conditions after infection [

The Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report of more than 70,000 COVID-19 cases that showed that mortality was significantly higher in patients with comorbidities, with overall mortality rates of approximately 10.5% in patients with cardiovascular disease and 6.0% in patients with hypertension [

 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Chronic cardiovascular diseases reduce the natural cardiac reserve and impair the patient's ability to fight severe pneumonia. As a result, these patients are more susceptible to acute cardiovascular events after infection. For example, the systemic inflammatory response and its procoagulant effects may lead to plaque rupture, thrombosis and myocardial infarction in patients with coronary heart disease [

Further analysis showed that the SARS-CoV-2 infection only induced heart failure and systemic multiorgan dysfunction in the patient [
