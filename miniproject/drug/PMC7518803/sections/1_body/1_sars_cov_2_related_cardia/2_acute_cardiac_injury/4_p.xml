<p id="p0160">Some coronavirus infections may seriously affect the heart. For instance, in rabbits, coronavirus may induce cardiomyopathy that may result in cardiac chamber dilatation and impairment of systolic function [
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Chen et al. found that patients, even without underlying cardiovascular diseases, can also suffer from severe heart failure in the wake of SARS-CoV-2 infection and eventually die of sudden cardiac death [
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Likewise, Hu et al. reported a case of coronavirus infection presenting fulminant myocarditis [
 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and Gnecchi et al. reported a case of acute myocarditis in a 16-year-old boy positive for SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The patient, complaining of chest pain, did not have any of the signs or symptoms typically reported in COVID-19, indicating the possibility that cardiovascular involvement may exclusively be due to COVID-19 and not a comorbidity. As SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV both belong to the Betacoronavirus genus, electrocardiographic changes and troponin elevation may signal underlying heart injury, and echocardiography frequently demonstrates subclinical left ventricular diastolic impairment in COVID-19 patients.
