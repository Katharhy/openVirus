<p id="p0150">With the increase in confirmed cases, acute cardiac injury is not rare. Early COVID-19 case reports suggested that 5 of the first 41 confirmed COVID-19 patients (12%) had acute myocardial injury, characterized by high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) &gt; 28 pg/mL; of these patients, 4 had severe forms of the disease [

In addition, critically ill patients had significantly higher levels of myocardial markers, such as CK-MB and hs-cTnI, suggesting that severe patients were more susceptible to acute myocardial injury [
