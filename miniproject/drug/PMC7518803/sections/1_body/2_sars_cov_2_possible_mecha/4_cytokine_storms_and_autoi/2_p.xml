Cytokine storm, also known as cytokine release syndrome, refers to the rapid production of a large amount of various cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interferon-γ (IFN-γ), in body fluids following microbial infection. It is an important cause of acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan disorders in patients with viral infections [

Moreover, Ang II levels in COVID-19 patients are closely correlated with viral titer and lung injury, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may lead to acute lung injury due to an imbalance in the renin-angiotensin system in patients and that ACE2-associated pathways may be involved in the inflammatory storm.
