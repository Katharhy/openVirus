<p id="p0215">One retrospective study found that increases in COVID-19 patient serum hs-cTnI, CK-MB, IL-6, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were associated with a decrease in lymphocyte counts and CD4/CD8 ratios, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infections may lead to heart damage through excessive inflammatory responses [

Moreover, a study proposed three characteristics of poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients, including older age, higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), and obviously elevated levels of D-dimer (&gt;1 μg/L). In particular, the increase in D-dimer reflected a persistent state of inflammatory response, which may exacerbate myocardial injury [

The first minimally invasive autopsy of a SARS-CoV-2 patient showed markedly elevated pro-inflammatory cells, such as CC chemokine receptor 4-positive (CCR4+), CC chemokine receptor 6-positive (CCR6+) and helper T 17 (Th17) cells, which may partially explain the severe lung immune injury. Additionally, the autopsy showed inflammatory infiltration of a small number of mononuclear cells in the myocardial stroma, implying cardiac inflammation [
