<p id="p0220">Hypoxemia caused by viral infection is another important mechanism of cardiac damage since it can induce some adverse responses, such as mitochondrial injury and oxidative stress. Acidosis and the generation of oxygen free radicals during hypoxia and hypoxia-reperfusion can aggravate myocardial injury, while hypoxia can also induce inflammatory responses, thereby further aggravating cardiac tissue damage [
