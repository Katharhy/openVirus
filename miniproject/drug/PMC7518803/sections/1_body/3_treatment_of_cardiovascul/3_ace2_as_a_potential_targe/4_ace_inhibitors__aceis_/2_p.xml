<p id="p0255">SARS-related studies have shown that after SARS-CoV infection, ACE2 was downregulated in the lungs, causing ACE/ACE2 imbalance. Moreover, the increase in Ang II may result in overactivation of the AT 1 receptor and acute lung injury [
 <xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Decreased ACE2 combined with elevated Ang II is a potential mechanism of lung injury, which also indicates that ACEIs and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) may inhibit such injury. In animal studies, the administration of enalapril in mice with acute lung injury quickly reduced Ang II levels [
