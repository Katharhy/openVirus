<p id="p0280">Current data show that all age groups are at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the condition is generally more severe in elderly patients and those with underlying diseases [
 <xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Fifty percent of COVID-19 patients had complications, of which hypertension was the most common comorbidity, followed by diabetes and coronary heart disease, that led to high mortality [
 <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Therefore, COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease should be closely monitored for any symptoms and signs of cardiovascular dysfunction. Recently, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) released a clinical bulletin [
 <xref rid="bb0375" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] that proposed that elderly patients should be closely monitored for cough or shortness of breath and indicated that a personalized regimen that helps stabilize plaques (involving treatments such as statins, Î²-blockers, ACE inhibitors, aspirin) and provides additional protection for cardiovascular patients should be administered. When acute myocardial injury occurs, medication to improve myocardial energy metabolism can significantly protect and improve cardiac function, and when heart failure occurs, etiological treatment is the optimal choice. In addition to routine anti-heart failure treatment, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) should be implemented as early as possible. Moreover, for COVID-19 patients comorbid with chronic underlying cardiovascular disease, the primary cardiovascular disease must be managed, and organ protection and homeostasis maintenance must be ensured during antiviral therapy. If a critical cardiovascular condition occurs in a COVID-19 patient, the treatment principles include treatment of the viral infection first, followed by risk assessment, conservative treatment (preferred), and self-protection. Thrombolysis is preferred for patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) without relevant contraindications; emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may be performed under close monitoring in patients with acute STEMI with hemodynamic instability and patients with life-threatening NSTEMI [
