 <italic>The Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Coronavirus 2019 (Tentative seventh version)</italic> recommends the use of antiviral drugs, including α-IFN, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin (combined with one of the above medications), chloroquine and Arbidol [

Previously, the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China officially announced that both favipiravir and remdesivir were scheduled for clinical trial. The results of the “Clinical Study on the Safety and Efficacy of Favipiravir in the Treatment of Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)” (Registration Number: ChiCTR2000029600) suggested that favipiravir may be effective in reducing the clearance time of SARS-CoV-2. Compassionate use of remdesivir for severe COVID-19 patients may have certain benefits [

In addition, researchers found that early treatment with the triple antiviral therapy combination of interferon beta-1b (IFN β-1b), lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin may help patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 recover [

Aside from antiviral drugs, a recombinant adenovirus type-5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine, a subunit vaccine created by Chen Wei et al., has been approved for clinical trials, and the data from the first phase of trials of the vaccine showed that it is safe, tolerable, and immunogenic in healthy adults [
