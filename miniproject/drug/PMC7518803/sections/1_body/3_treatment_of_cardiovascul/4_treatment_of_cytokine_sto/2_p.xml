<p id="p0270">As mentioned previously, SARS-CoV-2 infection could induce overactivation of the immune system, resulting in cytokine storms, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and even death. Therefore, the combination of blocking cytokine storms, regulating homeostasis, and protecting organ function is a promising approach to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduce mortality. Currently, most targeted drugs for COVID-19 are still being tested in preclinical studies, and symptomatic treatment remains the primary therapy. It is essential to promptly and effectively block the occurrence and development of the inflammatory response to improve patient outcomes. The expert panel of the Chinese Society of Immunology recommended the following treatments for cytokine storms: antishock therapy, supportive and symptomatic treatment, proper steroid treatment at an appropriate dose level, and neutralizing antibodies [

 <italic>The Diagnosis and Treatment plan of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (Tentative Seventh Edition)</italic> recommends that patients with an excessive inflammatory response receive short-term (3 to 5â€¯days) steroid therapy [
