<p>Kampo drugs were dissolved at concentrations of 2.5 or 3 mg/ml in DMEM supplemented with penicillin G and streptomycin at 50°C for 1 h, clarified by low-speed centrifugation following the manufacturer's instructions and sterilized with a 0.22-
 <italic>µ</italic>m filter. One milliliter of the filtrate was lyophilized, and the actual weight of the solute was measured. Crude drugs were similarly dissolved in DMEM and filtrated as Kampo drugs. Since almost no insoluble material was found after the low-speed centrifugation, the weight of the initial powder was used for the weight of the solute.
