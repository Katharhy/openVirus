<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, when MDCK(+) cells were infected with influenza virus at an m.o.i. of 5, strong inhibitory activity of 
 <italic>Glycyrrhizae radix</italic> was observed. At 6.3 mg/ml, a concentration at which no cytotoxicity was observed, 
 <italic>Glycyrrhizae radix</italic> inhibited viral growth. Infection at an m.o.i. of 0.2 also resulted in inhibition of virus replication by 
 <italic>Glycyrrhizae radix</italic> and by 
 <italic>Cnidii rhizome</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). When IC
 <sub>50</sub> was assessed in virus infection at an m.o.i. of 0.2, 
 <italic>Glycyrrhizae radix</italic> showed the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> value (0.27 mg/ml), followed by 
 <italic>Cnidii rhizoma</italic> (0.78), 
 <italic>Citri unshiu pericarpium</italic> (0.89), 
 <italic>Rehmanniae radix</italic> (1.1), and 
 <italic>Atractylois lanceae rhizome</italic> (2.1) (
