<p>Kampo drugs are mixtures of multiple crude drugs, each of which is derived mainly from roots and leaves of plants. 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the compositions of crude drugs contained in the Kampo drugs that were tested for their ability to inhibit influenza virus replication. Maoto and kakkonto, both of which inhibited virus replication (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), contain 
 <italic>Ephedrae herba</italic>. Since there are reports on the antiviral activity of 
 <italic>Ephedrae herba</italic> [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], its antiviral activity was not analyzed in this study.
