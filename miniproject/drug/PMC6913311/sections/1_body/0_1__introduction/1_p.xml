<p>Influenza viruses, which belong to the family 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>, are enveloped viruses with segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genomes [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In seasonal influenza epidemics, mortality is a particular concern in the elderly [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and some children may require inpatient care [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition, a new type of influenza virus may emerge and cause a pandemic. Several antiviral drugs including neuraminidase inhibitors have been developed for treatment of influenza. However, there are problems such as high cost and the possibility of appearance of drug-resistant virus variants. The development of new anti-influenza drugs and the establishment of novel therapeutic measures are needed.
