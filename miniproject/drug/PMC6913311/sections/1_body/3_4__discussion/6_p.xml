<p>The exact acting point of 
 <italic>Glycyrrhizae radix</italic> is unknown. It was shown in this study that the crude drug did not affect virus particles or increase the pH in endosomes, where influenza virus envelope fusion occurs. The drug thus seems to inhibit viral protein synthesis in the step after viral invasion to a cell. The step may be transport of viral nucleocapsids into the nucleus or viral mRNA synthesis. Polymerase acidic (PA) protein, one of the three polymerases of influenza virus that works for cap snatching and mRNA synthesis, may be the target of 
 <italic>Glycyrrhizae radix</italic>. Shirayama et al. [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reported that PA endonuclease activity of influenza virus PA protein was inhibited by Kampo drugs 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. This is the point of action of baloxavir marboxil, an orally administered and long-acting anti-influenza drug. This activity was inhibited by extracts of kakkonto, shosaikoto, saikokeishito, keishito, maobushisaishinto, and maoto but not by an extract of chkujountanto [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Two of these Kampo drugs (kakkonto and maoto) were Kampo drugs tested in the present study, and both were effective. 
 <italic>Glycyrrhizae radix</italic> is included in different proportions in all five of the effective Kampo drugs investigated in the present study. The possibility that 
 <italic>Glycyrrhizae radix</italic> inhibits PA nuclease activity and specifically inhibits viral protein synthesis should be investigated in a future study.
