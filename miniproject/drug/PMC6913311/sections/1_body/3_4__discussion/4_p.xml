<p>A Kampo drug is a mixture of crude drugs derived mainly from plants at a fixed ratio. Maoto and kakkonto both contain the crude drug 
 <italic>Ephedrae herba</italic>. Mantani et al. (1999) showed that 
 <italic>Ephedrae herba</italic> inhibited influenza virus A/PR8 replication in MDCK(+) cells. In this study, maoto was found to be more effective than kakkonto. The ratio of 
 <italic>Ephedrae herba</italic> contained in maoto is about two times larger than that in kakkonto (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), which may indicate that 
 <italic>Ephedrae herba</italic> is a primarily active ingredient. Furthermore, Cinnamomi cortex, a crude drug commonly found in maoto and kakkonto, has also been reported to inhibit virus replication 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
