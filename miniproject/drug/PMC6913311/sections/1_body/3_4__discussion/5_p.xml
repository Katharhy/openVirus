<p>We studied crude drugs other than 
 <italic>Ephedrae herba</italic> and Cinnamomi cortex in jiinkokato and senkyuchachosan. Anti-influenza virus activity of some of the crude drugs was found. 
 <italic>Glycyrrhizae radix</italic> had a particularly strong anti-influenza virus activity among the crude drugs studied. 
 <italic>Glycyrrhizae radix</italic> has been reported to be effective for a wide range of diseases as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antidiabetic reagent [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Its constituents, Isoliquiritigenin and Liquiritigenin, have been reported to have antidepressant, antiparkinsonian, anti-Alzheimer's, and central nervous system-protective effects [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The anti-influenza virus activity of 
 <italic>Glycyrrhizae radix</italic> was reported to be effective against influenza virus A/H2N2 in mice infection experiments but not in cultured cells [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In this study, we found that 
 <italic>Glycyrrhizae radix</italic> had strong anti-influenza virus activity and that it selectively inhibited influenza virus protein synthesis.
