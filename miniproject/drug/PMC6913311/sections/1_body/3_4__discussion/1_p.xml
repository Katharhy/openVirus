<p>The emergence of drug-resistant viruses with the development of anti-influenza virus drugs is becoming a problem. The 2009 Pandemic virus was resistant to amantadine, an M2 ion channel blocker, from the beginning, and almost all of the current seasonal influenza viruses and avian H5N1 viruses have acquired resistance to amantadine. Viruses that are resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors have also emerged [
