<p id="p0010">Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses containing a large (25 to 32 kb), single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. These viruses circulate continuously in human populations and generally cause mild respiratory diseases, including the common cold. In contrast, the zoonotic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cause severe respiratory diseases and are associated with a high mortality rate when they spread to humans (

COVID-19 is characterized by acute pathological outcomes, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and has a substantial mortality rate (

COVID-19 is more severe in individuals with comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and hypertension) and in the elderly (
