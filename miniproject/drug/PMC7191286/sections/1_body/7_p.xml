<p id="para0008">Personal protective equipment (PPE: masks, gowns, gloves and eye protection) for health professionals should be of high quality, be personalised for fit, and be changed between contacts with patients. Amongst highly developed countries, the UK appears to be particularly unsuccessful in providing international standard PPE in sufficient quantities for acute health care staff and for the social care sector. Early approaches by UK manufacturers to provide supplies appear to have been largely ignored by the UK government in favour of international sources which, many weeks into the pandemic, have not as yet proved to be able to meet essential UK demand 
 <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The UK has also been very late in engaging with EU-led commissioning consortia to secure further PPE supplies and reportedly too late to join EU-led approaches to secure ventilators 
 <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. There are continuing widespread reports in the UK of health professional staff not being provided with adequate PPE. If these reports are correct, the consequences are unacceptable â€“ avoidable deaths from COVID-19 in health professionals and their unaffected patients and social contacts.
