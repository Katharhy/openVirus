<p id="para0016">It remains to be seen how well the world's financial systems and businesses will survive the pandemic and how long it will take to emerge from the current major economic downturn. In prospect are sustained increases in remote ways of working, within business sectors generally, as well as within health services. This journal will continue to report on the Health Policy and Technology implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and welcomes manuscripts on key themes relating to COVID-19 and how best to be prepared for future epidemics and pandemics. The journal will also welcome papers on the opportunity cost of the COVID-19 pandemic for effective management of common and serious diseases, whether related to physical or mental health.</p>
