<p id="para0011">An expected side-effect of economic downturn because of COVID-19 has been a remarkable decrease in atmospheric pollution 
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, a well-recognised contributor to severity of many clinical disorders, from heart and lung disease to cancers. Outcomes from COVID-19 appear worse in people historically exposed to atmospheric particulate pollutants and the inflammatory gas nitrogen dioxide 
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This should contribute to evidence to influence political support for continued reduction in harmful emissions into the atmosphere to reduce the severity of any future recurrent waves of COVID-19.
