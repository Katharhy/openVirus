<p id="p0090">Beyond question, the best chance to track down an efficient treatment for COVID-19 in a close future relies on repurposing an already existent and approved drug, as this would considerably shorten the duration of clinical trials without jeopardising patient safety [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Before the era of computational approaches, this strategy would have relied uniquely on trial and error experiments [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], but lately, the process sped up greatly by machine learning. “Deep neural networks”, is the latest shibboleth somewhere between dystopian science-fiction and flying cars, and refers in brief to an algorithm's ability to recognise or predict novel elements based on a training dataset and permanent feedback loops.
 <xref rid="fn4" ref-type="fn">4</xref> Incontestably, the method has already come a long way from its original playground made of the MNIST database of handwritten numbers, as proven here by Ke et al. and their machine learning approach to identify known drugs with potential to fight SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The authors trained their system both on a dataset consisting of compounds reported active against other RNA viruses, and another one made of known 3C-like protease inhibitors, and tested hits subsequently

 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], were fed back into the algorithm, leading to the identification of 13 promising candidates for further experimental validation.
