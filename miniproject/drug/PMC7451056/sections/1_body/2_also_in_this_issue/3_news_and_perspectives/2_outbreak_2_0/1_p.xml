<p id="p0110">Digital tools have been proven of great use at many levels during the COVID-19 pandemic: on the one hand, artificial intelligence has been recruited to screen known molecules for inhibitory potential against SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], on the other, phone applications and web interfaces have allowed for a bidirectional information flow between authorities and public. Taiwan's efficient containment of the crisis [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] partially relied on screening checkpoints and a tight follow-up of a patient's contact history through an epidemiological investigation questionnaire. Indeed, contact tracing is a powerful way to alleviate the strain on the health personnel in the early stages of any novel highly transmissible infectious disease. On these grounds, Chen et al. are in the process of developing an online questionnaire for COVID-19 and other diseases termed “e-Outbreak Platform”, allowing for individuals to enter all types of relevant information, such as source of exposure, contact history, and clinical features [
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The authors briefly describe the platform framework, including the user-friendly graphic portal, flexibility of information input, compliance with data security, and correcting algorithms, leading altogether to the generation of knowledge graphs. Based on the accumulated statistics, authorities would then be able to quickly adjust counter-measures, individuals to avoid risk zones, and scientists to use it for data-mining, leading to an optimal exhaustion of shared information.
