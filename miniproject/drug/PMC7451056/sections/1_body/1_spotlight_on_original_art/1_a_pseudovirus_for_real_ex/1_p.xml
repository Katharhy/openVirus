<p id="p0045">Discovering a functioning treatment for COVID-19 as quickly as possible is imperative, and developing a safe and efficient vaccine probably even more important in the long run. Accordingly, research power worldwide has focused on the task at full tilt. For instance, at the moment of writing and according to the New York Times' 
 <italic>Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker</italic>, over 165 vaccines against the coronavirus are at different stages of testing, 8 of them in phase III clinical trials and 2 approved for early or limited use.

 <xref rid="fn2" ref-type="fn">2</xref> Nowadays it designates a recombinant viral particle made from a well-known backbone, like the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) or the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and envelope proteins from the virus to be investigated. Usually, an additional plasmid or viral vector, such as a packaging vector, is required to allow for the production of the pseudovirus, and the latter can replicate only once in the infected host cells. As a consequence, the system can be handled in BSL-2 laboratories, while being still a good model for viral entry and of great use for the study of virus–host cell interaction, drug screening, antibodies, and vaccines [
