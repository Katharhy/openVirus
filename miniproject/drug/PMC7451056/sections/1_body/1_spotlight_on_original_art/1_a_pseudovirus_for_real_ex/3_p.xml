<p id="p0055">First, proper expression of the S or HA proteins on the virions is assessed, revealing the presence of complete S proteins but the partial cleavage of HA proteins, probably due to the 293T cell-specific host proteases. Indeed, apart from the interaction of the S protein with the host ACE2 receptor, the requirement of the host cell serine protease TMPRSS2 to cleave it into S1 and S2 subunits for envelope fusion, has been considered another targeting hotspot for potential drugs [

For instance, camostat mesylate, a TMPRSS2 inhibitor and drug used to treat chromic pancreatitis and reflux oesophagitis, is being tested for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 fusion with host cells [
