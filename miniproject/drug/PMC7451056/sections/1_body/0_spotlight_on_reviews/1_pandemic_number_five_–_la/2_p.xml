<p id="p0015">Both articles set forth by reminding the reader of the chronological milestones; from the onset of the disease in Wuhan, December 2019, to the official declaration of a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on March 11th 2020 – rendering it the 5th registered pandemic since the 1918 Spanish influenza – and the process leading to the final nomenclature SARS-CoV-2. Subsequently, the virology, origin, and molecular features of the novel coronavirus are elucidated. In this respect, two elements are of particular interest, starting with the fairly recent increase in aggressive coronavirus cases [

 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Yet 2002 witnessed the first Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, 2012 the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) crisis, and 2019 the COVID-19 pandemic [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the important element is not particularly the culprits being coronaviruses, but rather zoonoses, that is to say diseases circulating in an animal reservoir and eventually acquiring animal-to-human, and sometimes human-to-human transmission [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For instance, all three dangerous coronaviruses stem from bats, with various intermediate animal hosts, such as civets (SARS), camels (MERS), and maybe pangolins in the case of COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. On a more general level, zoonoses are the most threatening providers of epidemics and pandemics [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and one thing is certain, COVID-19 was certainly not the last, nor the worst outbreak that mankind will have to face. In addition to the eruptions caused by the above-mentioned coronaviruses, the past two decades alone cumulate swine flu (H1N1), several threatening versions of avian flu (H5Nx), two massive Ebola crises, and the expansion of insect vector-mediated parasitic diseases such as Dengue, Zika, or Malaria. The reasons are rather obvious: increased human population and mobility, climate change, intense animal farming, human intrusion into every ecosystem, and displacement of both humans and animals as a consequence of global warming and ensuing political unrest [
