<p id="p0080">Another important aspect in CoViD-19 is that patients are not able to initiate a valid and rapid type I IFN response [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], but the mechanisms underlying this defective response are not completely clear. In SARS, macrophages and dendritic cells are only abortively infected and natural killer cells are not activated by the virus, thus suggesting a defective innate immune response with an altered virus clearance [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In a mouse model using the related coronavirus, delayed type-I IFN responses (with IFN levels peaking later in the immune response and remaining elevated) were associated with mortality from severe lung disease, due to recruitment of highly inflammatory macrophages into the lung [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Studies of human SARS-CoV infections also strongly suggest that dysregulated and persistently elevated type-I IFN responses are associated with severe human lung disease [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the mouse model, absence of Type-I IFN signaling (achieved by knockout of the IFN-receptor) abolished lung mediated lethality. These data also suggest a second possible explanation for a therapeutic effect of JAK inhibitors such as baricitinib, since they block the downstream signaling of alpha and beta IFN receptors. The situation is complicated by the finding that very early administration of IFN-Î² in the mouse model also decreased lung disease, suggesting that timing and duration of type-I IFN responses is critical to whether the outcome is helpful or deleterious [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. What does this imply for patients on JAK inhibition therapy? They may have a decreased IFN response to the virus, which would cause excess virus replication, but they also might have less risk of severe lung disease due to downregulation of the IFN signaling pathway. This illustrates the difficult balance between an adequate immune response to prevent viral replication and an over-exuberant immune response that causes severe lung pathology [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The role of type I IFN in SARS-CoV2 and the role of blocking IFN-I pathways therefore requires more detailed studies.
