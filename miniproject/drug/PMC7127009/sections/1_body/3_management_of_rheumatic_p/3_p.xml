<p id="p0095">For the same reason, rheumatic patients on long term oral glucocorticoid treatment should not only never stop these abruptly but in addition it should be kept in mind that ending of such therapy may also lead to adrenal crisis. Prevention measures suggested by the Italian Ministry of Health must be applied to everyone, in particular by rheumatic patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapies. Patients are therefore strongly encouraged to avoid social contact and maintain isolation. Chronic therapies will be guaranteed for rheumatic patients also in these weeks of CoViD-19 outbreak in which the routine outpatient clinics are closed, as the National Health System has authorized people to move for very specific reasons such as health issues and the need for biologic therapies which are available only in some hospitals. As tocilizumab and baricitinib may start to be used to treat CoViD-19 severe pneumonia cases, their availability must be guaranteed for the treatment of rheumatic patients who are using these compounds. If a rheumatic patient develops symptoms of any infection, it is important to follow the guidelines suggested by the rheumatology community and immunosuppressive therapy should be paused for the duration of the infection. The one exception is hydroxychloroquine, which may have therapeutic potential for CoViD-19 infection and should therefore not be stopped in patients who have been taking it for a rheumatic disease. As mentioned above, it is possible that IL-6 blockade and the use of JAK inhibitors could have beneficial effects on severe lung disease, but we don't yet know enough to recommend continuing these agents, since they could adversely affect viral clearance. Much more study of the kinetics of SARS-CoV2 in the lung, and the relation of the immune response to the onset of CRS, is therefore needed to clarify recommendations for patients on these agents.</p>
