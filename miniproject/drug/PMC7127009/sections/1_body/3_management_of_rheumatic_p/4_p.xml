<p id="p0100">The epidemiological scenario is rapidly changing daily and we still have no knowledge about the infection rate and course of CoViD-19 in rheumatologic conditions. Therefore, a national or international registry is strongly encouraged to understand the impact of the infection on specific rheumatic diseases or treatments and the risk factors for poor outcomes. The Italian Society of Rheumatology has established such a registry in March 2020 and data are being collected. Although our observations have no epidemiological grounds, we are quite surprised by the limited number of rheumatic patients contacting us because of a CoViD-19 infection. Furthermore, an international registry supported by America College of Rheumatology, European League Against Rheumatism and other rheumatologic societies worldwide is being launched.</p>
