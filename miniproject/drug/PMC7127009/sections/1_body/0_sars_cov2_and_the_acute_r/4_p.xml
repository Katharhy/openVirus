<p id="p0060">The CoViD-19 infection is suspected when patients develop fever, cough, myalgia and fatigue, with bilateral interstitial pneumonia diagnosed in most patients (up to 76% in the earliest series) by ground glass opacity and patchy infiltrates in the chest as visualized by computerized tomography. Around 20% of cases rapidly worsen into respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a mortality rate of approximately 2â€“3%, being highest in older age patients particularly those with chronic diseases and who are currently hospitalized in ICUs (up to 38%) [
