<p id="p0085">The evasion of the immune system checkpoints are often used by both malignant cancer cells and pathogens to escape immune surveillance. One of the most interesting checkpoint inhibitors is the CD200-CD200R1 system (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). This checkpoint negatively regulates the immune response with the aim to prevent an excessive inflammatory response to different triggers [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, it has been shown to down-modulate TLR7 (single strand RNA virus sensor) in plasmacytoid dendritic cells of a mouse model of coronavirus infection [

Checkpoint inhibitors are currently and effectively used as therapeutic agents for a variety of cancers, but have only minimally been studied in human infectious diseases, although their function was clearly defined using the murine model of LCMV infection. A CD200-Fc fusion protein has been successfully used in experimental settings [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and trials on inhibitory antibody targeting of CD200 has been tested for the treatment of human cancer [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], thus suggesting the intriguing possibility to use currently available checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of CoViD-19. A trial with another checkpoint inhibitor, anti-PD1, is also ongoing in CoViD-19 patients.
