<p id="p0095">As SARS-CoV-2 contains a single stranded positive sense RNA genome, I propose that laboratory experiments may be carried out on the ability of 5-FU to treat mice infected with SARS-CoV-2; even though 5-FU on its own has not acted as curing agents due to possible proof-reading of the viral genome by exoribonuclease (ExoN) hampering the activities of nucleoside-based therapeutics 
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, it may be possible that when 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (5-FU-dRib) is inserted in the RNA and it may escape proof-reading and lead to lethality and/or lethal mutagenesis in the virus. In addition to 5-FU + deoxyadenosine, research could also be carried out on the efficacy of 5-FU + deoxyguanosine, 5-FU + deoxyuridine, 5-FU + deoxyribose and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine. My PubMed search could not find any publication showing the deoxyuridine and or combination drugs have been tried on any RNA viruses. As for my knowledge goes there is no deoxyuridine phosphorylase present in any RNA viruses, hence when tested in animal studies infected with SARS-CoV-2, can enter in RNA leading to lethality/lethal mutagenesis.
