<p id="p0040">My search of PubMed (25th March 2020) to find any research publications showing “5-Fluorouracil and Covid-19” has failed. However, a search “Coronavirus and 5-fluorouracil” has identified 10 publications. The most recent in 2019 showed that 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) has remained ineffective to treat any coronavirus infection. None of the other 9 papers (during 2016–1983) address the application of FU in the treatment with any concrete data.</p>
