<p id="p0055">This work involved genetic, biochemical and physiological studies of a number of enzymes involved in the catabolism of nucleosides and deoxynucleosides in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Two analogues, azauracil (Azu) and 5-FU were used, and preliminary tests showed that 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was significantly more sensitive to 5-FU (sensitive to 0.25 µg ml
 <sup>−1</sup>) than Azu (requiring 100 µg ml
 <sup>−1</sup>) to kill equivalent concentration of the bacteria.
