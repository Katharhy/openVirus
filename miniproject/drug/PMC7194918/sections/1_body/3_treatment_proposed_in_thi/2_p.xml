<p id="p0045">The reason proposed for the failure of 5-FU may be that Coronaviruses have RNA proofreading activities involving a 3′→5′ exoribonuclease within non-structural protein 14 (nsp1-ExonN), and these remove 5-FU from their RNA during replication and metabolism hence making 5-FU ineffective when used on its own
