 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, based on the high mortality rates induced by the two Coronaviruses, SARS and MERS, questioned whether the induced pro-inflammatory response plays a role in pathogenesis, and, if so, should inflammation induced by the infection be targeted to control the progression of the disease. It remains debatable whether drugs targeted to treat Coronaviruses infections may be enough to reverse the highly pathogenic infection, especially when certain anti-inflammatory drugs may have the ability to decrease the most important defence machinery against viruses, the immune system.
