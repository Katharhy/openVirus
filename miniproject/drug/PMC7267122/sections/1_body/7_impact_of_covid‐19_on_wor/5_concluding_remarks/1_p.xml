<p>This overview provides the basic, biomedical, and translational research communities some key insights on COVID‐19. We believe that the focus of future studies still lies in the progress of effective drugs in general and development of SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccines in particular. While uncertainty lingers, credible, coordinated, and coherent policy responses would deliver the best chance at limiting the fallout from this human tragedy. Time alone can tell how the virus is going to affect our lives, but future outbreaks of pathogens of zoonotic origin and viruses are likely to continue. As such, besides curbing this epidemic, efforts should be implemented to devise inclusive measures to avert future outbreaks of zoonotic origin. Though the virus has reshaped the geopolitical globalization, multilateralism and integration of countries are indispensable. Without a doubt, we must move toward policy making and greater coordination to combat the current health crisis.</p>
