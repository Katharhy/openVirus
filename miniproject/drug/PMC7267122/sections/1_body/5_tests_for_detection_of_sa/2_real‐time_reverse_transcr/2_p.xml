<p>Specimens include nasopharyngeal swab, tracheal aspirate (if patient is intubated), broncho‐alveolar lavage, or induced sputum. The SARS‐CoV‐2 RT‐PCR test is a real‐time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT ‐PCR) test in which the RNA isolated from the specimen is reverse transcribed into cDNA and then subsequently amplified. It utilises one primer and probe set to detect human RNase P (RP) as a control and three primer and probe sets to detect three regions in the SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleocapsid (N) gene in a clinical sample.
