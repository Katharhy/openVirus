<p>This mode of transmission is usually overlooked, but it is very important. It works in four chains of reactions:
 <list list-type="order" id="rmv2113-list-0005">
  <list-item id="rmv2113-li-0034">
   <p>Infected person coughs or sneezes and emits large virus‚Äêloaded droplets. The droplets settle on surfaces of formites (inanimate objects) to create a thin film of the virus.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="rmv2113-li-0035">
   <p>Depending upon the type of the surface, the virus resides on fomites in the environment for hours or days.

   <p>The virus gets transferred from the contaminated surface to the hands of the person who touches the surface subsequently.</p>

  <list-item id="rmv2113-li-0037">
   <p>From their hands, the virus comes in contact with a mucous membrane (mouth, nose, or eyes) and subsequently transmits the infection.</p>
