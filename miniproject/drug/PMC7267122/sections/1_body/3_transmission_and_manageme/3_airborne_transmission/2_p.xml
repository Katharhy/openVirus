<p>It is not yet clear whether SARS‐CoV‐2019 can spread through an airborne route. This would necessitate the use of N95 masks rather than standard surgical masks. However, the possibility of aerosol transmission is enhanced by a very recent study that established the capacity of the virus to remain in aerosols for hours.

 </xref> Nevertheless, The World Health Organization and Canadian guidelines have recommended the use of only droplet precautions for routine care of COVID‐19 patients. However, both of these guidelines endorse airborne protections for aerosol‐generating procedures (eg, noninvasive ventilation, bag‐mask ventilation, intubation, CPR prior to intubation, extubation, high‐flow nasal cannula, tracheostomy, and bronchoscopy). On the other hand, The United States CDC first recommended the use of airborne precautions for managing COVID‐19 patients but recently stated that the use of surgical masks can be acceptable when N95 masks are no longer available.
