<p>The patients may move through different stages of illness:
 <list list-type="bullet" id="rmv2113-list-0002">
  <list-item id="rmv2113-li-0022">
   <p>Replicative stage ‐ The virus may take several days to replicate. Initially, it evokes the first line of defence, that is, innate immune response, but this fails to contain the virus resulting in fairly mild symptoms due to direct viral cytopathic effect.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="rmv2113-li-0023">
   <p>Adaptive immunity stage ‐ The innate immune response is eventually followed by the adaptive immune response which tends to decrease the titer of the virus. Meanwhile, the inflammatory cytokines show augmented levels culminating in tissue damage and consequent clinical deterioration.</p>
   <p>This explains the sudden deterioration of the patients after being relatively fine for several days.
