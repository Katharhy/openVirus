<p>Research suggests that the cellular receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2 is angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),

 </xref> Eighty‐three percent of Type II alveolar epithelial cells express ACE2 receptor. The binding of SARS‐CoV‐2019 to ACE2 results in an augmented expression of ACE2, which can result in alveolar cell damage. This in turn triggers a cascade of systemic reactions. It has also been suggested that the receptor‐binding ability of SARS‐CoV‐2 is 10‐20 times stronger than that of SARS‐CoV.

 </xref> Moreover, the virulence and transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2019 may shift over time. Very recent study, however, suggests that SARS‐CoV‐2 has evolved in two different types designated as L (aggressive and more prevalent) and S (evolutionarily older and less aggressive), explaining the higher mortality of initial reports from Wuhan compared to series of recent cases.
