<p>An RNA polymerase inhibitor, Favipiravir, from Toyama Chemical of Japan, is in a trial for experimental treatment of COVID‚Äê19 in China. Unfortunately, it is ineffective in in vitro tests. However, the human trials are still underway and have shown good clinical efficacy. The preliminary results from a study of 80 patients have shown that favipiravir had more effective antiviral action compared to lopinavir/ritonavir.
