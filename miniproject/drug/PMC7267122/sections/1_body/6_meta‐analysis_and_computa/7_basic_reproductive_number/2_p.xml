<p>In the past 3 months, various mathematical models have estimated the basic reproductive number (

 <inline-formula>
  <italic>R</italic>
  <sub>0</sub>
 </inline-formula> is affected by factors like behavior of the infected population and environmental conditions. 
 <inline-formula>
  <italic>R</italic>
  <sub>0</sub> &gt; 1
 </inline-formula> marks the start of the spread of the infection,

  <italic>R</italic>
  <sub>0</sub> &lt; 1
 </inline-formula> signifies the decline in the number of cases, and
