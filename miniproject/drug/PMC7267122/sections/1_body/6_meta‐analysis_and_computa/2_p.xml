<p>For the purpose of characterization of the epidemic of COVID‐19, various mathematical models have been released that include the Returning Traveller Study (RTS) and the Bats‐Hosts‐Reservoir‐People (BHRP) transmission network model.

 <xref rid="rmv2113-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">55</xref> Among them, the deterministic “Susceptible‐Exposed‐Infectious‐Recovered” (SEIR) compartmental model, that predicts the properties of COVID‐19 spread, is the most important and is being used by many researchers. It is based on the epidemiological status of the individuals, clinical progression of the disease, and the intervention measures such as isolation, quarantine, and treatment. The SEIR model, as depicted in Figure
