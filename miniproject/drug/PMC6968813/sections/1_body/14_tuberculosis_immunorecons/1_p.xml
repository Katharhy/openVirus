<p>TB-IRIS is an unusually exaggerated immunoresponse against viable or dead 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> antigens, and occurs frequently in HIV-infected patients compared with uninfected ones. It has emerged as an important complication of ART. It is relatively common, reported in up to a third of patients, in mild–moderate forms in patients with TB started on ART.

 <xref rid="CIT0096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref> However, it is relatively rare in its severe forms, and observed particularly when the site of involvement is the central nervous system. IRIS has been observed for other opportunistic infections or HIV-associated illnesses apart from TB. A retrospective meta-analysis of 54 cohorts showed that the incidence of TB-IRIS in PLHIV on ART treatment was 15.7% (95% CI 9.7%–24.5%), with mortality of 3.2% (95% CI 0.7%–9.2%).
 <xref rid="CIT0097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref> Two forms of IRIS exist: paradoxical and unmasking. The paradoxical form is either appearance of new lesions or deterioration/recurrence of preexisting pulmonary or extrapulmonary tubercular lesions in patients undergoing anti-TB treatment. It may occur during or even after completion of anti-TB therapy. It generally presents within 3 months of the initiation of ART, and is more common with CD4 count &lt;50 cells/cm

 <xref rid="CIT0095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref> This syndrome can present as a paradoxical worsening of the patient’s clinical status, often due to a previously subclinical and unrecognized opportunistic infection. Clinical features include hastening of symptoms, deteriorating pulmonary lesions, or exacerbation of inflammation, such as enlarging lymphadenopathy or pleural effusion, at the sites of involvement. The unmasking form is an inflammatory manifestation of an apparently asymptomatic subclinical infection occurring after initiation of ART, resulting in clinical worsening. Patients with advanced disease may show clinical deterioration caused by other reasons. It is important to note that IRIS is a diagnosis of exclusion. Clinical suspicion of IRIS is high, provided there should be initial improvement of symptoms after adequate therapy, followed by paradoxical worsening and other possible factors responsible for reducing efficacy, such as poor compliance and drug malabsorption or drug toxicity, are ruled out. Other causes mimicking TB-IRIS include superimposed infections, treatment failure, and relapse and progression of disease due to drug resistance. Strict criteria should be defined to diagnose this entity. Management of IRIS is complicated. Prognosis depends on the existing clinical profile, extent of disease, and site of involvement. Various treatment modalities have been used depending on the severity. These include observation with continuation of ART and anti-TB therapy. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be used in mild disease and corticosteroids in moderate–severe disease. Interruption of ART is usually required in a few cases.
