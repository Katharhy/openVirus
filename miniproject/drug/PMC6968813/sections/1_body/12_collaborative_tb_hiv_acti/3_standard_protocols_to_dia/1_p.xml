<p>New protocols need to be devised, especially for enhancing the diagnosis and treatment of PLHIV with smear-negative pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB. Mycobacterial cultures (conventional or liquid) of sputum or other fluids and tissue apart from smear microscopy are recommended to help in the diagnosis of sputum smearâ€“negative and extrapulmonary TB. Smear microscopy carries inadequate diagnostic accuracy in the majority of HIV-coinfected patients, particularly those with advanced immunosuppression. The CBNAAT should be considered up front in the protocol for establishing rapid diagnosis by detecting R resistance.
 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Only Ethiopia and South Africa have been able to scale up GeneXpert MTB/RIF in primary health care.
 <xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref> Nearly 500,200 PLHIV have been offered the CBNAAT for diagnosis in India.
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> A study reported that GeneXpert MTB/RIF utilization was low due to lack of technical expertise, even though the majority of sites had access to the test.
 <xref rid="CIT0077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref> A concerning issue is that there is a high probability of amplification of drug resistance leading to suboptimal treatment, as current diagnostic policies rely primarily on the CBNAAT for rapid diagnosis, which detects only R resistance, so the possibility of the more frequent H monoresistance at baseline cannot be ruled out.
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Samples should also be analysed with first-line LiPAs if possible. Second-line LiPA are also advised, in order to rule out additional resistance at baseline if there is documented multidrug resistance on the CBNAAT and firstline LiPA. Findings of genotypic tests should be cautiously interpreted and complemented with gold-standard phenotypic tests. WGS can be used as an initial diagnostic test, especially in high burden countries with epidemics or outbreaks of DR-TB and HIV coinfection. Utilization of WGS with preference over GeneXpert in programmatic conditions needs to be determined in the near future, with major concerns of expenditure and requirement of operational skills, as well as quality control. A consolidated algorithm to diagnose DR-TB in PLHIV is given in 
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Neither phenotypic nor genotypic tests are standardized in many laboratory settings for Z, S, Mfx, Cfz, Lzd, Bdq, and Dlm. National TB-control programs must scale up laboratory resources, training of health-care workers, quality-assured laboratory DST reporting for both first- and second-line anti-TB drugs, and DST-tailored individualized treatment. Prompt initiation of appropriate anti-TB regimens tailored to DST results followed by initiation of ART can reduce mortality and improve treatment outcomes. Although performing DST for all DS-TB and DR-TB remains the standard of care, it is infeasible in many resource-limited settings. Programs ideally should estimate the burden of M/XDR-TB and HIV epidemics.
