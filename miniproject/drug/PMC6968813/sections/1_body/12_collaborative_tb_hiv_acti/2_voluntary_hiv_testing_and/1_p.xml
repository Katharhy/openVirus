<p>Voluntary HIV testing and counseling is recommended for all TB suspects with clinical symptoms, especially in high-burden countries for TB and HIV coinfection. Diagnosed TB patients showing relapse or failure to treatment should also be screened for HIV coinfection. Testing for HIV should be performed simultaneously and preferably at the same center, along with sputa for smear microscopy or culture and also CBNAAT, if available. This will avoid referring patients elsewhere for HIV testing and counseling to prevent attrition or loss to follow-up.</p>
