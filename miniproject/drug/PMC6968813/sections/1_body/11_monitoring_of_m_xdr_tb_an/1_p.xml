<p>ART and anti-TB therapy must be taken daily without exception to prevent the evolution of drug resistance. The directly observedâ€“treatment strategy is an important component of the therapy. National programs should adopt this strategy or alternative methods of adherence support to provide anti-TB medications and ART. This is particularly essential for patients with DR-TB being treated with second-line anti-TB drugs resulting in larger pill burden and increased incidence of ADRs when given concomitantly with ART. The efficacy of therapy should ideally be determined by estimation of levels of serum-drug concentrations for both ART and anti-TB therapy. Extensive clinical supervision and decentralized or patient-centric care with an aim to ensure high levels of adherence, consistent virological suppression, and immunological recovery is required.

Issues responsible for unfavorable outcomes include poor tolerance of regimen, larger pill burden, and social stigma related to both the diseases, leading to serious discrimination and high risk of mortality. Therefore, these patients may require additional socioeconomic, nutritional, and psychosocial support to improve treatment outcomes.
