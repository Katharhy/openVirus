<p>Treatment of M/XDR-TB in PLHIV is similar to those without HIV. Treatment should be offered immediately with anti-TB and ART whenever this coinfection is diagnosed. The classification of anti-TB drugs recommended by WHO for designing regimens is given in 
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Classification of ART drugs is given in 
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The M/XDR-TB component should be treated with conventional regimens, with treatment duration of at least 18–20 months containing a combination of second-line anti-TB drugs that may also include newer drugs, such as Bdq and Dlm.
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Duration of treatment has to be decided on the basis of treatment response, and should be continued for 15–17 months after culture conversion. Various anti-TB regimens are described in 
 <xref rid="T0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The regimen can be individualized or standardized, depending on drug-sensitivity patterns and availability of resources at a particular center. At least five to six drugs should be used, as each active drug in a regimen boosts the chance of cure by 65%.
 <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> A conventional regimen containing at least five effective anti-TB drugs, including Z, and four core second-line anti-TB drugs — one chosen from group A, one from group B, and at least two from group C — is recommended during the intensive phase. If the regimen remains ineffective, drugs from groups D2 and D3 may be used.
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> The regimen may be further strengthened with high-dose H and/or E. Individualized regimens should be preferred, although their implementation remains challenging in resource-limited settings requiring support of quality-assured laboratory facilities and expertise in interpretation of results. Standardized regimens can be prescribed empirically in cases of strong suspicion of drug resistance based on the most prevalent local drug-resistance pattern. Once DST results are available, the regimen can be subsequently modified. Proper care should be taken not to compromise the regimen. Drugs should be administered daily under supervision. The conventional regimens are lengthy, expensive, and more toxic, leading to poor adherence and making treatment challenging for M/XDR-TB and HIV coinfection. The WHO has recommended a standardized shorter and economical 9–12 months treatment regimen for MDR‑TB cases containing a combination of second-line anti-TB drugs to improve treatment outcomes of MDR‑TB.

 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> The currently recommended shorter MDR-TB regimen consists of an intensive phase of 4 months (extended up to 6 months in cases of nonconversion of sputum smear) with Km, gatifloxacin (Gfx) or Mfx, prothionamide (Pto)/ethionamide (Eto), clofazimine (Cfz), high-dose H, Z, and E followed by a continuation phase of 5 months with Gfx or Mfx, Cfz, E, and Z. These are indicated only if the treatment history does not contain exposure to second-line anti-TB drugs for &gt;1 month and also no documented resistance to SLIDs and FQs is confirmed by second-line LiPA complemented by second-line phenotypic liquid-culture DST. Shorter regimens are not recommended for extrapulmonary M/XDR-TB (except lymph nodes and pleura) in PLHIV, as evidence regarding efficacy is still lacking. Other situations where shorter regimens are avoided include preference by the clinician and patient for longer regimens, confirmed resistance or suspected ineffectiveness or intolerance to drug(s), unavailability at the center, and such conditions as pregnancy, disseminated, meningeal, or central nervous system TB. Anti-TB drugs have been reclassified by the WHO based on emerging evidence regarding treatment outcome and profile of ADRs, especially with linezolid (Lzd), Cfz, Bdq, and Dlm.
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The conventional regimen contains all three drugs from group A and one from group B. If one of the drugs cannot be used from group A, then both drugs from group B should be considered. The number is reduced to four if these drugs can be used to design an effective regimen. Reduction in the number of drugs can improve adherence by reducing pill burden, particularly in M/XDR-TB and HIV coinfection. Exclusion of SLIDs, such as Km or Cm, and preference for complete oral drugs is recommended for designing a regimen to achieve better outcomes. High-dose H, Gfx, and clarithromycin (Clr) have been omitted from a recent classification, because of high frequency of H monoresistance, lack of evidence, poor efficacy, and high incidence of ADRs. Treatment outcome and monitoring of ADRs also have to be followed as per the recommendations by the WHO.
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Overall, it is recommended that shorter regimens be used as the first preference in eligible MDR-TB cases with or without HIV coinfection, otherwise all oral conventional regimens containing Bdq and Dlm should be offered. If second-line LiPA shows resistance to FQs including Mfx, then high-dose Mfx can still be used before switching to other drugs. Various trials on newer shorter regimens are ongoing in order to improve treatment outcomes. These trials are conducted by Research Excellence to Stop Tuberculosis Resistance, which is an initiative adopted under the End TB strategy by the WHO to promote and conduct research on therapy for rapid control of DR-TB.
 <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> Few of upcoming shorter regimens can treat DS-TB as well in addition to DR-TB, facilitating approach of universal treatment in subsequent years. These regimens are currently in phase 2A/2B trials and require to undergo phase 3 trials for further validation. The approach of universal treatment might have potential advantages in PLHIV such as reduction in drug burden as well as incidence of ADRs and shorter culture conversion time leading to decreased risk of transmission of infection.
