<p>PLHIV are also vulnerable to DR-TB infection. There are several epidemiological reasons that M/XDR-TB may be associated with HIV.
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The reasons suggested are rapid progression of disease due to harboring of DR strains, particularly in the immunocompromised compared to immunocompetent state; drug malabsorption of anti-TB drugs, such as R and ethambutol (E), leading to drug resistance and treatment failure; early reactivation of an infection due to increased vulnerability in an immunocompromised state acquired from community or institutional transmission; direct contact with DR-TB cases, suggesting primary or transmitted resistance; confounding by common risk factors, such as intravenous drug abuse, imprisonment, low socioeconomic status, alcoholism, and frequent hospitalization; repeated exposure to DR isolates; and poor adherence to treatment. The magnitude of global burden of DR-TB and HIV coinfection has not been exactly defined. The primary reason for the lack of data is that HIV infection and anti-TB drug-susceptibility testing (DST) are not adequately accessible for joint surveillance under routine conditions. Epidemiological studies from different countries have shown discordant associations. There has been heterogeneity in setting, demographic profile, methodology, and analysis of data. In the fourth WHO–International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease global drug-surveillance report, 24 countries reported data on MDR-TB stratified by HIV status.
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Only eleven countries, the majority from Eastern European and Central Asian regions, reported strong associations between HIV and drug resistance. There was a lower association for DR-TB infection in PLHIV from the US. Additional information on overlapping risk factors for coinfection, including history of hospitalization or imprisonment, was not available initially for this analysis, so specific reasons for the association were not known. There was heterogeneous geographic distribution, with the majority confined to high-risk groups, even in countries showing a high prevalence of MDR-TB along with an emerging HIV epidemic. Detailed analysis of surveillance data from Kazakhstan showed no change in the proportion of TB patients with drug resistance from 2007 to 2011 in PLHIV, with average prevalence of 36.1% for both new and retreatment cases, although there was a progressive increase in the burden of TB and HIV coinfection.
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The prevalence of MDR-TB was 20% higher in HIV-positive patients than HIV-negative ones. HIV was not an independent risk factor for MDR-TB, although such risk factors as male sex, young adult, urban residence, homelessness, and history of incarceration and drug abuse were largely overlapping. The last two subgroups were at particular risk of HIV and MDR-TB coinfection. Enhanced efforts are necessary to provide care to these high-risk groups. Further, a systematic review and meta-analysis has recently reported that HIV-positive cases have a 24% higher risk of MDR-TB compared to HIV-negative ones.
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Another study observed no significant association between MDR-TB and HIV coinfection.
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Institution-based studies have shown a stronger association than community- or population-based studies. With high prevalence of HIV seropositivity and M/XDR-TB, countries from sub-Saharan African and Asia-Pacific regions have reported very low prevalence of coinfection.
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Factors responsible for underestimation of prevalence were delay in diagnosis, increased susceptibility to infection or progression of disease, and lack of infrastructure. The WHO has projected 14 countries for high burden for MDR-TB and HIV coinfection. These are Angola, China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, South Africa, Thailand, and Zimbabwe. A few studies have estimated the burden of drug resistance among PLHIV ranging from 5.6% to 24% with genotypic tests, such as the cartridge-based nucleic acid–amplification test (CBNAAT), including automated GeneXpert MTB/RIF assays and polymerase chain reaction–based line-probe assays (LiPAs).
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, existing data remain sparse, as implementation of these tests remains suboptimal, particularly in resource-limited settings assumed to have a high burden of disease. Community-based surveillance at national level should be conducted for all regions worldwide to estimate the burden of coinfection in the near future.
