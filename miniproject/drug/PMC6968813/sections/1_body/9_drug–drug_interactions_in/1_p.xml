<p>Drug–drug interactions between second-line anti-TB drugs and ART are not well known, as information is limited.
 <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> R derivatives are the potent cytochrome (CYP
 <sub>450</sub>) inducers that lead to subtherapeutic concentrations of ART drugs. NRTIs, PIs, integrase strand–transferase inhibitors, and the CCR5 antagonist maraviroc are more prone to interactions with R than NRTIs, NtRTI, and fusion inhibitors.
 <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> The last three groups are not metabolized by CYP
 <sub>450</sub> enzymes. Rhas been reported to reduce levels of both Nvp and Efv on coadministration. The effect is stronger for Nvp than Efv. Nvp-based regimens are associated with virological failure and death more frequently than Efv-based regimens. R has significant pharmacokinetic interactions with PIs, which are all metabolized by CYP3A4 and have weak inhibitory activity. Of all PIs, ritonavir has a potent inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 and Pgp. It is frequently used with other PIs to pharmacologically boost their concentrations. Rifabutin, another rifamycin derivative, is a less potent inducer of the CYP
 <sub>450</sub> system and can be preferred to R in tubercular patients treated with PIs containing ART regimens. Rifapentine is metabolized by CYP3A4 enzymes, and reduction is required when coadministered with PIs. Use of triple or quadruple NRTI/NtRTI regimens with R or non-rifamycin–based anti-TB regimens could be other options, but efficacy of these regimens remains questionable. R is not routinely used in M/XDR-TB treatment. Therefore, the probability of clinically significant drug interactions becomes minimal. They are prescribed only in the treatment of R-sensitive poly-DR-TB and mono-DR-TB. Relevant drug–drug interactions are described in 
 <xref rid="T0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Buffered didanosine (ddl), which contains an aluminum magnesium–based antacid, may result in decreased FQ absorption when administered concomitantly. It should be given 6 h before or 2 h after FQ administration. Enteric-coated formulations can be preferred to buffer one, as they can be used concomitantly without this precaution. Eto/Pto is thought to be metabolized by the CYP
 <sub>450</sub> system, although data are lacking regarding responsible CYP enzymes. The rationale to modify doses of Eto/Pto and certain ART drugs during concomitant treatment has not been clearly specified. Clr acts as a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A, and has multiple drug interactions with PIs and NRTIs. Therefore, Clr should be avoided, because of both its poor efficacy against M/XDR-TB and multiple drug interactions. The newer drug Bdq is metabolized by CYP3A4, which is also inhibited or induced by various ART drugs, leading to significant drug–drug interactions.
 <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> Efv induces CYP3A4, leading to decreased levels of Bdq, whereas Nvp and Lpv/r have modest effects. Therefore, it has been recommended that ART can be switched from generic fixed-dose combination Efv-containing regimens to twice-daily Nvp with separate companion pills. Dlm has not shown any clinically relevant interactions when coadministered with other anti-TB drugs or ART.
 <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> Dtg-based ART regimens are expected to be safe when coadministered with those containing Bdq and Dlm.
