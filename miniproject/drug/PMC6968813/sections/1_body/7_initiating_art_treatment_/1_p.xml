<p>Concomitant use of ART with an appropriate anti-TB treatment improves survival for both DS-TB and DR-TB. However, the probability of overlapping or additive ADRs could compromise the treatment of HIV or M/XDR-TB if both are started simultaneously. However, undue delay in initiation of ART can result in increased risk of HIV-associated mortality, especially among patients with advanced disease. The exact timing for the introduction of ART in newly diagnosed HIV patients receiving DR-TB treatment remains undefined. ART should be initiated in all TB patients, including DR-TB, irrespective of CD4 count.
 <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> Anti-TB therapy should be started first, followed by ART as soon as possible within the first 8 weeks of treatment. ART should be immediately introduced within the first 2 weeks of initiating TB treatment when there is advanced disease with CD4 count &lt;50/cm
 <sup>3</sup>. This is also applicable for the pediatric population with HIV and DR-TB coinfection. Efv should be used as the preferred NRTI in patients starting ART while on anti-TB therapy, whereas Nvp should be avoided. Shorter regimens containing newer drugs should be preferred if there is no contraindication and an adequate supply of drugs.
