<p>Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 act through respiratory droplets and direct contact, though fecal-oral transmission might be possible. The incubation period can range between 0 up to 24 days, with an average of 3 days [
 <xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Common early symptoms include fever, dry cough, and malaise. Later on, symptoms such as dyspnea, vomiting, and diarrhea tend to appear. Moreover, the virus was characterized by rapidly progressive pneumonia, a range between 2 to 7 days after early symptoms appear, particularly at the elder and pre-conditioned patients [

A recent study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 (similar to SARS-CoV) primarily infects ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes, where it binds to the surface receptor, angiotensin-convertingg enzyme 2 (ACE2) and initiates fusion with the host cells [
