<p>PI is a method to obtain instant, short-term fortification against infectious agents by introducing the pathogen-specific antibodies to patients. These specific antibodies can bind to the pathogen antigens and block its interaction with a cell receptor, which is extremely applicable in the case of viral antigens that facilitate the attachment to the target receptors [

These antibodies in the blood of a recovered patient can be collected as convalescent plasma (CP) and transferred to the blood of a newly infected patient, where they can neutralize the pathogen, boost the immunity of that patient, and leads to its enucleating from the blood circulation after transfusion into the patient [
