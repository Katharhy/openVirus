<p>In view of the large amounts of cytokines produced during SARS-CoV infection, infection with SARS-CoV-2 similarly induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), IP10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP). Moreover, the levels of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF), IP10, MCP1, MIP1α and tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-α) were found to be higher in Intensive care unit (ICU) than non-ICU patients [
