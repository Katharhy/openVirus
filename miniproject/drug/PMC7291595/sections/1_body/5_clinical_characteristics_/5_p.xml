<p>The mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients varies in different studies. A study of 41 patients showed a mortality rate of 15% [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and the fatality of 138 patients in a clinical study was 4.3% [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, Chen showed that the mortality was 3%, a number closer to the official national statistics of China (2.01%) [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. These differences in mortality rates are possibly due to the difference in sample size. The reported mortality rate of SARS-CoV was 10%, and that of MERS-CoV was about 36% [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The currently estimated mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is therefore lower than that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">TableÂ 1</xref>). In summary, SARS-CoV-2 spreads more rapidly but has a relatively lower fatality rate as compared with two other related coronaviruses.
