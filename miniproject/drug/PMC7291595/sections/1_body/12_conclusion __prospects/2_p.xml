<p>The outbreak of COVID-19 has shown that there are still shortcomings in the prevention of public health diseases such as the lack of awareness of the frontline doctors and the early vigilance and attention from the government.

In addition, the development of targeted antiviral drugs should be anticipated and accelerated in the future.</p>
