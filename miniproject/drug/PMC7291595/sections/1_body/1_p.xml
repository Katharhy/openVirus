<p>SARS-CoV-2 is one of seven coronaviruses that have been identified thus far [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The other coronaviruses are 229E, HKU1, OC43, NL63, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9–12</xref>]. Of these, 229E, HKU1, OC43 and NL63 have relatively low pathogenicity [

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can cause fatal pneumonia with death rates of 10 and 37%, respectively [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 is associated with person-to-person transmission and with a low mortality rate (2–3%) [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As of 7 April 2020, COVID-19 has spread to 184 countries (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D), infected at least 1,347,804 patients worldwide (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D &amp; G), and has been the cause of 74,596 deaths globally (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>F &amp; I) (data from Johns Hopkins resource center). Currently, specific vaccines and medicine for SARS-CoV-2 infection are being developed [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This paper summarizes the epidemiological, genetic, clinical characteristics, laboratory diagnosis, animal models and therapeutics of this virus, which could be critical for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2.
