<p>The 2019-novel coronavirus, which was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, was classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Infection has spread to approximately 184 regions and countries including Japan, South Korea and the USA, Africa, Europe and Australia [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As of April 7, the total number of infections on the Chinese mainland was 83,071 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B) and the number of deaths had increased to 3340 (

 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> lineage, subgenus 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Symptoms of this virus include fever, cough, shortness of breath, leukopenia and pneumonia in both lungs [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Patients of advanced age (&gt;50 years) exhibit significant comorbidities [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Originally, it was thought to be mainly associated with the elderly, but now the virus is affecting younger people: even children [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Patients with severe viral infections need intensive care and are at high risk of death [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, except among elderly cases and those with chronic disease, the mortality rate of COVID-19 appears to be low at this point [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].
