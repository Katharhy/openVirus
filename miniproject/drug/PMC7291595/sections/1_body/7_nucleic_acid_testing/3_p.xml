<p>SARS-CoV-2 viral load is detectable from throat- and lung-derived samples; however, blood and urine have not yet yielded virus [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Patients with COVID-19 produced the highest viral load near symptom presentation, which may be the reason for the fast spread of the virus [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. An observational cohort showed that viral load in saliva was highest following symptom onset in the first week, then gradually declined with time [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Endotracheal aspirate viral load was available from day 8 after symptom onset and did not significantly decline thereafter [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Following symptom onset, virus load in 33% patients could be detected for 20Â days or longer in that study. Viral load in respiratory tract specimens was about sixfold higher than that in the nonrespiratory tract specimens [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In addition, elder patients reportedly had a greater virus load than that of younger patients. Studies showed that higher initial viral load was related to the severity of COVID-19 symptoms [
