<p>Moreover, a previous study showed that the specific probe 
 <italic>RdRP</italic>_SARSr-P2 (FAM-CAGGTGGAACCTCATCAGGAGATGC-BBQ) detected only the SARS-CoV-2 RNA transcript but not the SARS-CoV RNA [

 <italic>RdRp2</italic> was a non-specific assay for SARS-CoV-2, because this detected other betacoronaviruses such as SARS-CoV [
