<p>Virus from throat swabs, blood, urine, stool or respiratory tracts have been assessed by fluorescent reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Primers and probes targeting 
 <italic>RdRp/helicase (Hel)</italic>, 
 <italic>E, S, N</italic> and replicase 
 <italic>ORF 1a/b</italic> genes were designed and tested for SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. RT-PCR showed that primers of the 
 <italic>E</italic> and 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> genes demonstrated better sensitivity than that of the N gene, and the limit of detection (LOD) of 
 <italic>RdRp/Hel</italic> and 
 <italic>N</italic> gene was lower than that of S gene and RdRp-P2 [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Chan 
 <italic>et al.</italic> showed that the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay (
 <italic>RdRp/Hel</italic> probe, FAM-TTAAGATGTGGTGCTTGCATACGTAGAC-lABkFQ) was significantly more sensitive than the RdRp-P2 assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and detection targeted 
 <italic>ORF1a/b</italic>, 
 <italic>ORF1b-nsp14</italic>, 
 <italic>RdRp</italic>, 
 <italic>S</italic>, 
 <italic>E</italic> or 
 <italic>N</italic> genes was with less specificity for SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].
