<p>An ideal animal model for COVID-19 would reflect the clinical signs, viral replication and pathology displayed in humans. Non-human primate models (rhesus, cynomolgus macaques, African green monkeys, common marmoset, squirrel monkeys and mustached tamarins) have all been evaluated as models of SARS-CoV infection [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. All non-human primates had pneumonia, cough and respiratory distress after virus infection [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Mice (BALB/c, C57BL6 and 129S strains) supported SARS-CoV replication and showed clinical signs of SARS [

 <sup>−/−</sup> mice and Beige mice have been used to determine the role of immune effectors of the virus [

 <italic>AC70</italic> and 
 <italic>AC63</italic> transgene-positive mice also showed clinical manifestation after SARS-CoV infection, demonstrating their usefulness to study the pathogenesis and evaluation of vaccines and other therapeutics [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Hamsters also have been used to study immuno-prophylaxis and drug research as they harbored high viral titers and pulmonary histopathology upon virus infection [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Ferrets are another appropriate animal model to study this respiratory virus because the clinical symptoms, viral titers and histologic changes were similar to those of patients with virus infection [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. ACE2, the receptor of SARS-CoV, was also identified as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, therefore, mice, hamsters and ferrets may be animal models for studying the SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. An article reported in 
 <italic>Science</italic> shows that SARS-CoV-2 can replicate in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets, indicating that ferrets represent an ideal animal model for evaluating antiviral drugs or vaccine candidates against COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In addition, the domestic cat has shown multifocal pulmonary consolidation with infection of SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in cats and transmit between cats via the airborne route [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. By contrast, dogs, pigs, chickens and ducks are poorly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].
