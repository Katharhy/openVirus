<p>SARS-CoV-2 was first reported to be from the South China seafood market [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, subsequent studies have shown that more than 45% of the early patients before 1 January 2020 were not linked with this market [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV are closely related to each other and originated in bats, which most likely serve as reservoir host for these two viruses. MERS-CoV is also considered to originate from bats; however, the reservoir host is unequivocally dromedary camels [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Bats and minks may be intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% homology with bat coronavirus (bat CoV RaTG13) in Yunnan Province [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Due to their use in medicine and food, bats have been regarded as the ultimate host for transmission to humans [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Animals such as the snake and bamboo rat have also been considered as intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Snakes are reportedly the most likely wildlife animal reservoir of the virus because their relative synonymous codon usage bias was close to that of the SARS-CoV-2 virus [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, virologists have stated that no evidence supports this hypothesis for snakes as a SARS-CoV-2 host. The bamboo rat was also predicted to be an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Scientists are currently working to identify the source of SARS-CoV-2, including possible intermediate animal vectors.
