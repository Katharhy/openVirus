<p>The basic reproduction number (R0) of this virus reflects the dynamics of transmission during this coronavirus outbreak. The WHO has estimated that SARS-CoV-2 has a reproduction number of 1.4–2.5. However, a recent study shows the average R0 to be 3.28 (median: 2.79; interquartile range [IQR]: 1.16), an R0 considerably higher than the WHO estimate at 1.95 [

 <italic>et al.</italic> reported that the mean incubation period of the virus is 5.2 days (95% CI: 4.1–7.0), the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days, and the R0 was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI: 1.4–3.9) [

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In another study, R0 was computed to oscillate between 3.30 (95% CI: 2.73–3.96) and 5.47 (95% CI: 4.16–7.10) [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In addition, the study reported a transmission rate within Wuhan of 1.94 days (95% CI: 1.25–6.71), an infectious period of 1.61 days (95% CI: 0.35–3.23) and an R0 value of 3.11 (95% CI: 2.39–4.31) [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Based on the nowcasting and forecasting approach, Wu 
 <italic>et al.</italic> showed an estimated reproduction number of 2.68 (95% CI: 2.47–2.86), and an epidemic doubling time of 6.4 days [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Recently, Tang 
 <italic>et al.</italic> calculated the R0 as 6.47 (95% CI: 5.71–7.23), using Mathematical SEIR-type epidemiological model [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a higher transmission rate than that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Variation in viral transmissibility should be considered, and estimates of the reproduction number may change in the future.
