<p>SARS-CoV-2 can spread via direct contact and respiratory droplets. Respiratory particles are spread while breathing, speaking, coughing or sneezing [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition, aerosol and fomite transfer may promote transmission of the virus according to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Aerosolized virus may be generated by respiratory and surgical procedures. The study showed that the half-life of the virus is about 1.1–1.2 h, and it remained viable for 3 h in aerosols. Meanwhile, the virus on plastic, stainless steel, copper and cardboard remained stable for 4–72 h [
