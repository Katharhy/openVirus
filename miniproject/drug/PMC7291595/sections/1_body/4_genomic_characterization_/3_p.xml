<p>The spike glycoprotein plays an important role in binding to receptors on host cells and, therefore, is involved in host tropism [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have S proteins containing 1,273, 1,255 and 1,270 aa, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The S protein mediates entrance into human respiratory epithelial cells by interacting with the cell-surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It is comprised of S1 and S2 subunits (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C), and the S1 subunit shares approximately 70% identity with that of human SARS-CoV and bat SARS-like CoVs (SL-COVZXC21 and ZC45). The S1 subunit has an N-terminal domain and a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that are both responsible for the binding of virions to host cells [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bind to ACE2 through the C-terminal domains (CTD) of their S1 subunits, and MERS-CoV utilizes the CTD to bind proteinaceous dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The RBD of SARS-CoV-2 has 73% identity to that of SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is greater than that of SARS-CoV, which may be because the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is slightly different from that of SARS-CoV. The S2 subunit shares 99% identity with two bat SARS-like CoVs and human SARS-CoVs [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The S2 subunit contains a fusion peptide (FP) and heptad repeats (HRs) 1 and 2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). After the S1 RBD binds to the ACE receptor on the host cell, the FP of S2 is inserted into the host cell membrane, and then HR1 and HR2 form a six-helix bundle (6-HB), which helps the virus fuse with host cell membranes [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) protein, matrix protein, accessory proteins p6 and p8, nonstructural protein 7 (nsp7), and nsp13 are homologous with those of SARS virus [
