 <italic>SARS-CoV-2</italic> has 12 open reading frames (ORFs) encoded by nine subgenomic mRNAs that carry nine transcription regulatory sequences, two terminal untranslated regions (UTR) and a conserved leader sequence [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The large replicase polyprotein pp1a contains ten nonstructural proteins (nsp1–nsp10), and pp1ab contains 15 nonstructural proteins (nsp1–nsp10, nsp12–nsp16), which are all encoded by 
 <italic>ORF1a</italic> and 
 <italic>ORF1ab</italic> [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). With the exception of nsp3 and nsp5, which are cysteine proteases, most nonstructural proteins play an important role in the transcription and replication of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. 
 <italic>Pp1ab</italic> has different lengths in COVID-19, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV of 29,844 bp (7096 aa), 29,751 bp (7073 aa) and 30,119 bp (7078 aa), respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Furthermore, there is no obvious difference between SARS-CoV-2and SARS-CoV nonstructural proteins and ORFs.
