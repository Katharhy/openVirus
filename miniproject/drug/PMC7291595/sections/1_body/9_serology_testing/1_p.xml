<p>In addition to hematological detection and nucleic acid testing, serological diagnosis is important for patients who present late with a very low viral load, below the detection limit of RT-PCR assays [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. IgM and IgG titers were relatively increased on day 5 and rapidly raised 10Â days after symptom onset in most patients [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The IgM-positive rate increased from 50 to 94%, whereas the IgG-positive rate increased from 81 to 100% [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In addition, the IgM- and IgG-positive rates were not significantly different before and after patients were found to be virally negative [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Therefore, virus-specific IgM and IgG serological testing may be used to confirm current or previous infection with SARS-CoV-2.
