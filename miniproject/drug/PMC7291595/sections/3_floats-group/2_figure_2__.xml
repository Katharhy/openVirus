  <title>Clinical disorders caused by COVID-19 infection.</title>
  <p>Patients infected with COVID-19 had some unique clinical features including rhinorrhoea, sneezing, sore throat. Most patients had haemoptysis dyspnea, fever, headache, fatigue, sputum production, pneumonia and ground-glass opacities. However, only a low percentage of patients developed intestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting. Leucopenia, lymphopenia, pro-inflammation cytokines increasing, acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute organs damages (such as cardiac, liver or kidney) were common features in some intensive care unit patients.</p>
