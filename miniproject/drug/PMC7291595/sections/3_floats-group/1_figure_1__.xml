  <title>Genome composition, schematic diagram and functional domains of spike protein in SARS-CoV-2.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>(A)</bold> Schematic diagram of the genome organization and the encoded proteins of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Structural proteins included spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). Pp1a and pp1ab were all encoded by the 
   <italic>orf1a</italic> or 
   <italic>orf1ab</italic> genes. Pp1a protein contained ten nonstructural proteins (nsps) (nsp1-nsp10). Pp1ab protein contains 15nsps (nsp1-nsp10 and nsp12-nsp16). The protein-encoding genes of the genome of SARS-CoV-2 were from GeneMarkS or ORFfinder. The differences in the arrangement of the envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N) among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are shown at 3′ end. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Schematic diggram of SARS-CoV-2 virus. SARS-CoV-2 was an RNA virus. The envelope was a lipid bilayer membrane. Matrix protein, below the lipid membrane, formed a shell which could give strength and rigidity to the lipid membrane. RNA segments were in the interior of virus, which were the genetic materials of the virus. Spike protein was the structural protein responsible for the crown-like shape of the coronavirus particles. S-protein was processed at the S1/S2 cleavage site by host cell proteases, during infection.
