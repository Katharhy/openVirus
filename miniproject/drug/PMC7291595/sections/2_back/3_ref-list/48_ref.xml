  <p>• Shows the characteristic chest CT imaging features of COVID-19 patients. Out of 21 COVID-19 patients, 71% had involvement of more than two lobes at chest CT, 57% had ground-glass opacities, 33% had opacities with a rounded morphology, 33% had a peripheral distribution of disease, 29% had consolidation with ground-glass opacities and 19% had crazy-paving pattern. The study is helpful to the radiologist for the early detection and diagnosis of this disease.</p>
