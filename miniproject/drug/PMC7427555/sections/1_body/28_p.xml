<p id="para0042">It is paramount to consider that a virus is fundamentally a ‘r
 <italic>eplicator</italic>’, and the new virus has reached, for the time being, the pinnacle of the functional capacity of a replicator. At the time I am writing these lines we are surpassing. 17 million people infected worldwide (&gt;11 million recovered) by the SARS-CoV-2, and a death toll of more than 680,000. This number pales when compared with the sum of deaths already provoked by other epidemics or with the yearly death toll of influenza mentioned early. But we must consider that the numbers of the actual statistics are very probably false, largely underestimated, for it depends to a larger extent on the number of tests, which as we know is far below what would be necessary. We have not yet a conclusion about a possible treatment (the family HxNy can be treated with several types of antiviral drugs) and much less is certain that we will have an efficient vaccine (as well as for the other SARS and MERS).
