<p id="para0056">Our results demonstrated that among the 98 materials investigated, at least 51 materials were evidencing some type of dematerialization or reducing their per capita consumption. Some may argue that this result is mainly due to a global picture of economic degrowth in the last couple of years. But regarding this point it is important to consider that many economists are suggesting that we are experiencing neither a global recession, nor a normal economic crisis, but instead that the global economy will not return to the roaring economic growth verified in several periods of the last sixty years. We call the attention to the fact that economic growth is not happening as it used to be, in other words, wealth is being created without necessarily more material consumption – our analysis demonstrated that, from the basket of 98 materials studied, humans needed to consume 480 g to produce one dollar output in 1960, and now can produce the same dollar with only 200 g.</p>
