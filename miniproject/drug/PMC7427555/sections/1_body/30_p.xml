<p id="para0045">On this point I would like to recall another paper of mine published also in 2010 in the pages of TF&amp;SC titled 
 <italic>“Crises, Depressions, and Expansions: Global Analysis and Secular Trends</italic>” (
 <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">Devezas, 2010b</xref>). The objective of the work at that time was to offer an interpretation of the 2007–2008 financial crisis (also coined as Great Recession) in the framework of the Kondratieff waves, as well as comparisons with previous crises. Moreover, I offered an interpretation of the reason for the crisis and a forecast on the paths of the global economy for the next 20 years. Four main economic agents – world population, global output (GDP), gold price, and the Dow Jones index – were minutely examined using data from several sources. Without going into details about the methodology used, I summarize the main conclusions below:

   <label>(1)</label>
   <p id="para0046">Fingerprints of Kondratieff longwaves are ubiquitous in all observed time series used in this research—world GDP growth rates, succession of economic expansions–contractions in the US, purchasing power of gold and the historical ratio DJIA/gold price;</p>

   <label>(2)</label>
   <p id="para0047">Regarding the present crisis we can state that it has some unique characteristics, which distinguish it from all previous economic depressions. Despite its unique characteristics a parallel with the panic of 1907 may be drawn—both have occurred amidst a strong international growth period and are perfectly symmetric in the observed space–time pattern;</p>

   <label>(3)</label>
   <p id="para0048">The most important conclusion concerning this crisis is that it seems to sum up a mix of a self-correction mechanism that brought the global output back to its original logistic growth pattern and signals an imminent transition to a new world economic order;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="celistitem0015">
   <label>(4)</label>
   <p id="para0049">The next decade will be probably one of worldwide economic growth, corresponding to the second half of the expansion phase of the fifth K-wave, but that will saturate soon after the 2020′s;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="celistitem0016">
   <label>(5)</label>
   <p id="para0050">There are strong signals that we are already witnessing a transition to a new global socioeconomic system, which will carry within it a profound restructuration of world economic affairs, with a multipolar world leadership and a new world currency.</p>
