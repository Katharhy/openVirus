<p id="para0053">Concerning the point 5, the transition to a new global socioeconomic system, also mentioned in point 3 (an imminent transition to a new world economic order) I have not delved into the analysis because I was not sure about two main points (see below) which would require a more detailed research. I limited myself to indicating only the trend of the curves and commenting on the observation that real growth rates of low-income countries have been growing increasingly apart from those of high-income countries. The fact is that since the onset of the Industrial Age high-income countries have contributed with at least about 70% for the global output measured as world GDP growth rate. This trend was maintained up to the mid-1990s, but after this point, and up to 2007, growth contribution from low-income countries surged by more than threefold, from around 10% (mid 1990s) to almost 35% (2007). In the mid-1990s high-income countries contributed with 77% for the global output growth, and low/middle-income countries contributed with 23%. Presently these numbers have radically changed to 95% from low/middle-income and only 5% from high-income countries. See for instance that, according to 
 <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">IMF (2020)</xref>, in 2018 the world GDP grew at 3.6%, with advanced economies growing at 2.2%, while developing economies grew at 4.5%. 
 <italic>Such change may well be interpreted as a signal to a transition to a new world economic order with a multipolar world leadership</italic>. As demonstrated by 
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Devezas et al. (2017)</xref> the driving force for this radical change was China's modernization, a process that has started slowly in the 1980s, but accelerated enormously in the 1990s – in 1992 China's annual GDP growth reached the incredible mark of 14,3%. After a slight decline in the second half of the 1990s, China's output continued to growth unabated in the first decade of the 21st century maintaining the two digits mark during most of this period. Importantly, during this period, China's global economic significance of course increased and in 2010 China became the world's second largest economy, and now more than twice as large as that of Japan.
