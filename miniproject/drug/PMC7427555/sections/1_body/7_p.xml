<p id="para0017">Regarding the first, I would like to bring to the reader's memory a discussion published in TF&amp;SC in 2010, ‘
 <italic>From My Perspective: On Ferguson’</italic>, with contributions of mine, George Modelski, Theodore Modis, and Harold Linstone (
 <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">Devezas, 2010a</xref>). The discussion was prompted by Niall Ferguson's article published in Foreign Affairs titled “
 <italic>Complexity and Collapse: Empires on the Edge of Chaos</italic>” (March 2010). Ferguson's motivation at that time was the same as ours today – an explanation of the worldwide perplexity in the face of the unexpected economic shock that happened as consequence of the defaults on subprime mortgages, which first produced a surge in 2007 in the United States, and then tipped the entire world economy into a financial blackout that lasted for at least two years (2007–2009).
