<p id="para0029">Airborne infections are caused by a wide family of viruses, including those that induce common cold, flu, and/or respiratory syndromes, that, as we know, have plagued humanity with some severity since the beginning of the 20th century. Among these we find the HxNy viruses (H2N2, H1N1, H1N2, etc., depending on the H or N antigen-proteins that express its metabolic synergy with living cells), mostly known as influenza viruses. The last serious pandemic provoked by this strain of virus was the 2009 H1N1 swine flu, which caused about 500,000 deaths worldwide (
