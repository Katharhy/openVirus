<p id="para0059">Over the past 250 years, since the inception of the Industrial Revolution (IR for short), the occurrence of at least four K-waves has been observed, and we were now experiencing the end of the expansion phase of the 5th K-wave. Each of these previous K-waves defined a clear ‘technosphere’ (
 <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">Devezas, Corredine, 2001</xref>) designed by the leading basic innovations of that period, a not very different view from that of the successive IRs (1st, 2nd, 3rd) defended by mainstream economists (

According to the neo-Schumpeterian school of economics (or evolutionary economics) the global economy is a far from equilibrium open complex system with an endogenous self-regulatory mechanism, characteristic of the self-organized complex systems. Such mechanism consists in the periodic swarming of basic (or disruptive) innovations that concentrate during the phase of economic recession, with a period of about a half-century. According to the Schumpeterian concept of creative destruction, these downwave swarming of innovations triggers the following upwave phase of economic expansion, during which the bunch of new radical technologies interact synergistically giving birth to a completely new ‘technosphere’.
