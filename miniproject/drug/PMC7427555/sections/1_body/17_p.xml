<p id="para0027">But in the case of the actual collapse, the threshold was reached through the mutual interaction of two decisive 
 <italic>GRAINS</italic>: too much connectivity and the very peculiar properties of the SARS-CoV-2. This interaction was catastrophic in the sense that it has revealed the fragility of our institutions and led to rapidly cascading effects on governmental and financial systems, which were prone to blow. The question that naturally follows is how to build systems of governance and trade that can handle probable (but unforeseeable regarding their exact timing) random events like a global pathogen outbreak? It is not my intention to address further this point in this short article, but I return briefly to it when considering the other question (
 <italic>secondo</italic>: what comes next?).
