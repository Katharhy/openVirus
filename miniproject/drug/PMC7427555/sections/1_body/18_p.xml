<p id="para0028">Finalizing now our 
 <italic>primo</italic> question, let us consider shortly the mentioned peculiar properties of this new virus. Among the epidemics I have mentioned earlier (pg2), it is necessary to distinguish between those that require body contact (body fluids) to infect (like HIV and Ebola) and those characterized as airborne infections that spread when bacteria or viruses travel on dust particles or small respiratory droplets that become aerosolized when an infected person sneezes or coughs. This latter group, despite a much lower lethality than the first group, constitutes the greatest threat as a global pandemic due to its greater ease of propagation through the mass movement of people in transport vehicles: trains, busses, ships, and airplanes.
