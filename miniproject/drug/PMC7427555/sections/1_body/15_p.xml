Worse, this whole new establishment that emerged in force for the last 40 years (1980−2020) was managed by institutions and conservative policies that had consolidated in the previous 30 years (1950–1980) or earlier. The present picture is of a European Union falling apart, and an accumulation of criticism for the United Nations’ (founded in 1945) way of acting and ineffectiveness in resolving enduring situations of regional conflicts. Now, UN's agency for health, WHO (World Health Organization, created in 1948) has notoriously failed to effectively coordinate an international preventive action to mitigate the impact of the already announced possibility of a pandemic. Add to this a global scenario of left-right polarization that is not very different from what we had at the beginning of the 20th century, and a weakening of democratic regimes when compared to the apparent strengthening of totalitarian regimes.
