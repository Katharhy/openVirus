<p id="para0055">In the last few years, I have driven my attention more intensively to the investigation of point 1, which resulted in the publication of three articles– 
 <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">Magee, Devezas (2017)</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Magee, Devezas (2018)</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Devezas et al. (2017)</xref>. The objective of this research, which was conducted in collaboration with my colleague Chris Magee (MIT, Materials Division), was to survey the worldwide production and consumption of a basket of 98 materials most used in modern engineering applications in order to find patterns of dematerialization and or materialization during the last half century. The results do not enable us to state that human society is ‘
 <italic>dematerializin</italic>g’, but we have pointed out that there are some positive trends which allow us to be optimistic regarding a reduced per capita consumption of materials in the future and less harm to the environment as well. In a nutshell, the patterns found indicate that 
 <italic>business is not simply proceeding as usual</italic>, for the 
 <italic>ever-increasing technological capability is contributing to an ever-improving efficiency in the usage and production of materials</italic>, allowing a hopeful vision of a future scenario that, if not showing absolute dematerialization, is evidencing a stabilized and sustainable path allowing economic growth without continuing increased material consumption.
