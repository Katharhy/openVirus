<p id="para0032">In 2012 it happened the outbreak of MERS, whose route of infection was probably the direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. WHO coined the causing pathogen as MERS-CoV, and since then about 30 countries have reported cases of MERS. Curiously, the R
 <sub>0</sub> (R naught â€“ the measure of transmission among people) of MERS is far lower than that of SARS, but its mortality rate is far higher (~34% for MERS, and ~10% for SARS).
