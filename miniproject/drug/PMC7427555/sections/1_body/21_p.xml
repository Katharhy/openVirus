<p id="para0031">The coronavirus that causes SARS is called SARS-CoV (for 
 <underline>Co</underline>rona 
 <underline>V</underline>irus). According to WHO, the first cluster of SARS cases occurred in China's Guangdong province in November 2002. Studies identified then horseshoe bats as the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV. Civets and other animals in wet markets may have contributed to the virus crossing from animals into humans. On March 2003, the WHO issued a global alert, warning of an atypical pneumonia spreading from China and coined the name SARS for the disease. Right after the first alerts the organization put out an emergency travel advisory and recommended that airports start to screen passengers coming from countries with cases of SARS â€“ it was the first case in history of an alert about the possibility of an epidemic being propagated through people using air transport.
