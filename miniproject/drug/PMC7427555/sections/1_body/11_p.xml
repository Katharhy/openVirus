<p id="para0021">I suppose that Ferguson was somehow influenced by Taleb's view that ‘
 <italic>History does not crawl, but it jumps’</italic> (chapter 1, pg 10, in The Black Swan), but he took his argument in a wrong way — Taleb speaks mostly about unpredictability (and levels of unpredictability) and not about causality. Ferguson tries to lock-in 
 <italic>immediate causes</italic> for disruptive historical events and overlooks the fact that in complex systems jumps are the result of the running of the evolutionary algorithm, which can only be understood through back casting, exactly what historians and evolutionary biologists do, and what Ferguson criticizes. To fundament his arguments Ferguson speaks of ‘phase transitions’ and uses the canonical example of 
 <italic>SOC</italic> (self-organized criticality) — 
 <italic>avalanches in a pile of sand</italic>. In both cases it is a regrettable misuse of physical concepts, above all because these are phenomena of completely different natures.
