<p id="para0034">A corona virus consists in a single-stranded RNA genome enveloped by a nucleocapsid (protein shell) of helical symmetry. An important characteristic of this virus family is that they are the largest RNA viruses, measuring about 30 kbp (kilo base pair), ca. 1 μm, the double of the HxNy viruses, which measure in average 15 kbp. As evolutionary biologists known, viruses are an important means of horizontal gene transfer, which increases genetic diversity. The fact that corona viruses are the largest class of RNA-virus in action, allows them a 
 <italic>key evolutionary feature</italic>: having a much longer RNA strand they have a greater chance for mutations and plastic adaptability to the environment (living organisms where they reproduce). This is the core point of my present analysis, one of the 
 <italic>GRAINS</italic> referred previously – a powerful new characteristic favorable to their aggression to homo sapiens.
