<p id="para0024">Now to the case of the pile of sand. A sandpile exhibits 
 <italic>punctuated equilibrium</italic> behavior, where periods of stasis are interrupted by occasional sand slides, or small avalanches, caused when a single grain pushes many other grains and causes them to topple. Sometimes one observes a much larger avalanche, collapsing a large fraction of the sandpile, after which a new period of stasis follows and the sandpile grows again. It is very important to observe in this simple example that large catastrophic events occur in consequence of the same dynamics that produces small ordinary everyday events. This last observation runs counter the usual way of thinking about disruptive events, which looks for specific reasons, but is not the only consequence of the last occurring event. That single grain of sand that caused the larger avalanche would not cause the collapse if all other grains of sand were not there previously, distributed in a given geometric form, under the action of the gravitational field and submitted to their mutual interaction forces. It is important to recognize that the 
 <italic>collapse</italic> (or sudden change) happens because some threshold was reached, and the path until this critical point is a function of the previous evolutionary history of the system. 
 <italic>Summarizing, history does matter indeed and physicists as well as evolutionary biologists know this very well.</italic>
