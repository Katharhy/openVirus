<p id="para0023">The process of 
 <italic>self-organization in complex systems</italic> takes place over a very long transient period! Complex behavior, whether in history, biology or geophysics, is the result of a long process of evolution. It cannot be understood by studying the system within a time frame that is short compared with this evolutionary process. As very well stated by Per Bak in his 1972 opus “
 <italic>How Nature Works</italic>” — “the phrase ‘you cannot understand the present without understanding history’ takes on a deeper and more precise meaning”. In other words, there is no such thing, as Ferguson tries to convince us, of an independent event that can be seen as the main causation of a sudden and/or abrupt change — an evolutionary process is the result of the succession of stasis and accelerations.
