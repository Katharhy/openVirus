<p>Our findings cannot be generalized to all PWID. We decided to focus on the PWID most at risk of transmission of blood-borne viruses by obtaining evidence of heroin injection (urine testing and recent skin injection marks) which excluded individuals carrying out recreational injections and/or those successfully controlled on methadone and thus at low risk of HCV transmission. Therefore, our sample typically consisted of PWID “from the street.” These people inject drugs frequently and have no or little contact with the health care system but on the other hand could benefit from harm reduction activities. Although we had to marginally modify some of the RDS rules, the decent representativeness of our sample led us to obtain robust estimations of the target population. Our results could therefore be of interest for other urban settings in Asia.</p>
