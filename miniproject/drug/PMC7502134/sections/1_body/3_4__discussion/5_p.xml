<p>Prevention campaigns and needle/syringe exchange programs are efficient in decreasing both HIV and HCV. However, in this setting, additional interventions are required to tackle HCV transmission, which remains highly prevalent and incident. In our study, very few participants reported sharing needles and syringes (around 5%). HCV routes of transmission are not well known by PWID, in particular transmission via water or other dilution liquids, i.e., novocaine, and very few PWID were tested for HCV despite their high level of risk. These practices should be targeted by preventive interventions. The risk of HCV transmission with methamphetamine use is also possible. Indeed, formation of microlesions by lip burns during smoking can transmit HCV if smoking material is shared [

Focusing prevention on sharing drug use material and a good knowledge of the disease are necessary to effectively manage and control HCV spread among PWID. Our findings suggest that resource-limited HCV control should first target the profiles of PWID with a high potential of HCV transmission. During peer-led interventions, a quick assessment could be done to identify to which profile the individual belongs in order to then deliver interventions tailored to his or her profile-specific risks. For low-risk profiles, minimal general information on HCV infection could be provided, but the risk level should be maintained over time through continuous counseling.
