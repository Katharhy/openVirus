<p>We identified five profiles of PWID in Haiphong City exhibiting different levels of drug use, drug- or sex-related risk behaviors, and mental health disorders. Among the profiles, three (profiles 1, 2, and 4) demonstrate behaviors commonly associated with transmission of blood-borne viruses, either through unsafe injection practices, unsafe sex, high stimulant (methamphetamine) consumption, or at-risk alcohol consumption. These three profiles, representing 41% of PWID, are priority targets for blood-borne virus control interventions. Profile 2 could particularly expose PWID to HCV transmission through frequent water/novocaine sharing (70%) in addition to syringe sharing. It should be noted that this latter group reported the lowest rate of HCV awareness and testing. Furthermore, these PWID were the youngest and the most at risk with respect to several aspects (social precariousness, former history of overdosing, mental health condition, and at-risk sexual behavior). They also reported the highest rate of street methadone use. CBO members indicated that the use of street methadone was a way to cope with heroin shortage. Outreach interventions targeting awareness on transmission of blood-borne viruses, rapid on-site testing, free injection solution provisions, and facilitation of free access to methadone treatment would likely be adapted to this subpopulation.</p>
