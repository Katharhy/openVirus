<p>Our study presents some limitations. We cannot exclude a selection bias due to police enforcement that changed the drug scene, reducing contacts between PWID due to the elimination of many drug purchasing hotspots.

Indeed, questions on injection practice, drug use, and sexual behaviors are very sensitive as they are designed to elicit very personal information. Some participants may have underreported certain behaviors because they felt embarrassed or guilty regarding these behaviors. Finally, some HCV infection risk factors were not evaluated, including tattoos, blood transfusion, or surgery history [
