<p>One of the strengths of our study is that it describes a hard-to-reach population having never before been characterized in terms of risk profiles. We were able to enroll a large sample size, about the third of the total population of active PWID, likely being representative of the target population, given that the RDS assumptions were met [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Finally, we adopted a cluster analysis which is likely the most appropriate approach to define various profiles of a marginalized population [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our study also showed different PWID profiles and the persistence of risk behaviors among some PWID.
