<p>Twenty seeds (10 individuals from each site) were selected to initiate the RDS. These included PWID recently, PWID for a long time, sex workers who inject drugs, and men who have sex with men who inject drugs from various districts. As the proportion of women among PWID was expected to be low in Haiphong (5%), we set the male/female seed ratio at 4/1 to ensure their inclusion. The seeds received three coupons each on the first day of RDS and were told by the CBO members to give the coupons to other PWID actively injecting and within their network. Each coupon was valid for one week. The network size of each participant was collected in the RDS Coupon ManagerÂ® 3.0 software.</p>
