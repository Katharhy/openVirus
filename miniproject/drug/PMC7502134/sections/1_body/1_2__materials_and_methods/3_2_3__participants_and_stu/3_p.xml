<p>One month after recruitment, the number of participants recruited per day decreased below the initial target. This was mainly due to police harassment at “hotspots” where PWID were known to congregate and purchase drugs. In order to improve cohort size, we added five new seeds and temporarily increased the number of coupons up to 10 for the very few participants describing a very large network. This strategy was actually not very successful and was discontinued, with only 33 participants recruiting more than four other PWID.</p>
