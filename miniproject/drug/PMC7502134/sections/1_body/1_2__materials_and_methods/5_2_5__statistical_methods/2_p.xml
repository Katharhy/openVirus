<p>We used a cluster analysis to determine different profiles according to their risk behaviors towards blood-borne viruses, drug/alcohol use, sexual behavior, and mental health status. We first conducted a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) to reduce the dimensions of the data set using active variables reflecting drug use, risk behaviors, and mental health (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Briefly, active variables included items related to heroin and other drug use, injection and risky sexual behaviors, methadone use, and mental health. We did not include HCV or HIV status among the active variables as they reflected former risk factors. The number of dimensions/axes maintained was determined using the elbow criteria. The Benzecri adjustment was applied to calculate the contribution of the selected axes to the total inertia [

The clustering was based on a mixed method combining a hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), to determine the optimal number of subgroups, and the
