<p>Vietnam is particularly concerned with illicit drug use since the economic reform promoted liberalization of the economic market in 1986 (Doi Moi) [

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and approximately 67% in Haiphong [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We recently estimated both the incidences of HIV and HCV infections among PWID in Haiphong; we reported a low HIV incidence (between 0 and 1.8 per 100 person-years (PY), contrasting with a very high HCV prevalence (19.4/100 PY, 95% CI: 11.5-30.7) [
