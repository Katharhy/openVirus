<p>CD4+ T cells are the major targets of HIV infection, although DCs may play a large part as they can influence transmission, target cell infection, and antigen presentation [
 <xref rid="B39-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. HIV must overcome the epithelial barrier within the genital tract to reach immune target cells beneath the epithelial lining, where DCs are one of the first immune cells to come in contact with the virus [

 <xref rid="B41-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. DCs are capable of binding to the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 present on HIV-1 through high expression of entry receptors C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), as well as relatively low levels of CD4 [
 <xref rid="B39-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Along with DCs, LCs are also one of the first immune cells that come in contact with the HIV virus. LCs are resistant to HIV infection by binding to the viral envelope glycoprotein gp160 through langerin, which leads to the endocytosis of the virus and prevents infection [
 <xref rid="B42-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, LCs also express the HIV entry receptors CD4 and CCR5, which mediates the fusion of gp160 and leads to productive infection of the cell [
 <xref rid="B42-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This can lead to transmission and rapid spread of the infection to CD4+ T cells through cell-to-cell interactions [
 <xref rid="B42-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Considering the impact of HIV in DCs compared to LCs, HIV-primed monocyte-derived LCs lead to a higher amount of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells being induced, as well as a lowered induction of Tregs compared to HIV-primed monocyte-derived DCs [
