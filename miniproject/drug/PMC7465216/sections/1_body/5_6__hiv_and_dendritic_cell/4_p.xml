<p>Following binding, activation of DCs upon HIV infection is unclear. HIV is able to escape detection from MDCs, resulting in the avoidance of viral nucleic acid coming in contact with pattern recognition receptors, which would allow MDCs to become appropriately activated. One study has found that the ability of HIV to undermine the immune system may be due to the lack of the accessory protein, vpx, in its genome. Without vpx, SAMHD1 inhibits viral replication at the level of reverse transcription, therefore enabling HIV to escape detection [

Studies have shown that viral replication is inhibited, allowing HIV to escape detection, whereas other studies have shown increased viral replication stimulating an immune response.
