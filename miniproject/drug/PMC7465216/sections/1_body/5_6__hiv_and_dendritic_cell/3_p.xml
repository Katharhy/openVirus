<p>DC subsets express other receptors that can bind the envelope glycoprotein gp120, such as which express the C-type Lectin Receptor (CLR) Langerin (CD207) and conventional DC (cDC) express DC immunoreceptor (DCIR). In addition, other CLRs such as DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) and dermal DC expressing mannose receptors can also bind the glycosylated gp120 [

A broad division of DCs is found in peripheral blood, myeloid DCs (MDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are also susceptible to infection with HIV. MDCs are more frequently found and can secrete high levels of IL-12, whereas pDCs can produce high levels of IFN-Î± [
