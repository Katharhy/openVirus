<p>However, HIV-1 infection in LCs has been a source of controversy because new studies demonstrate that CD1a+ vaginal dendritic cells (VEDCs) are a more likely possible reservoir and source of HIV-1 transmission in the female genital tract, rather than LCs [

This notion was corroborated by the presence of significant amounts of HIV-1 DNA copies in VEDCs in samples of vaginal tissue from HIV-1 infected women. HIV-1 DNA copies have not been measured before in LCs in vivo. It has also been shown that epidermal dendritic cells that are CD11c+ and enriched in anogenital tissues are more likely to be infected by HIV-1 and efficient at transmitting HIV-1 to CD4+ T-cells. CD11c+ DCs express higher levels of CCR5 and were found to have higher levels of HIV RNA when compared to LCs [
