<p>Sexual transmission of HIV is the most common route of HIV-1 acquisition worldwide and is characterized by the progressive depletion of CD4+ T lymphocytes [

For HIV to infect cells, its surface envelope glycoprotein, gp120, must be able to bind to primary receptors CD4 and a co-receptor CXCR4 or CCR5 for viral entry [
 <xref rid="B19-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Once inside the cell, the virus will replicate and will induce a cellular immune response and synthesis of viral proteins. Within the first few weeks of symptomatic primary infection, viremia develops accompanied by symptoms in some patients. During the first few weeks of acute HIV infection there are high levels of replicating virus in the cells of the genital tract and continue to remain elevated for the first 10â€“12 weeks [
