<p>Studies have shown that redox homeostasis can regulate the functions of DCs against both TB and HIV infections. Glutathione (γ-
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamyl-
 <sc>l</sc>-cysteinyl-glycine) is a tripeptide antioxidant composed of glutamine, cystine, and glycine. It is found at millimolar concentration in nearly all eukaryotic as well as many prokaryotic cells [

 <sub>c</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>), an amino acid antiporter that mediates the exchange of extracellular 
 <sc>l</sc>-cystine (L-Cys
 <sub>2</sub>) and intracellular 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamate (L-Glu) across the cellular plasma membrane. The influx of L-Cys
 <sub>2</sub> is the rate-limiting step in providing the intracellular L-cysteine required for the synthesis of GSH [

 <xref rid="B102-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. When exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS), two molecules of GSH are converted to GSSG and water. In this mechanism, GSH contains antioxidant properties, whereas GSSG is a simple by product of the oxidation of GSH with no antioxidant effects.
