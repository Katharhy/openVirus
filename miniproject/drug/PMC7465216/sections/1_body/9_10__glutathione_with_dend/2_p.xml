<p>GSH plays a critical role in maintaining DC redox homeostasis (

Studies have shown that an altered cellular redox has a profound role in inflammation through the activation of various kinases and redox-sensitive transcription factors such as NF-kB rel proteins, which differentially regulate the genes encoding various pro-inflammatory cytokines [

IL-12 is produced by the activation of inflammatory cells, such as DCs, macrophages, and monocytes and is a key regulator of T-cell differentiation via the formation of IFN-γ [
