<p>Cystine, the rate-limiting factor in GSH biosynthesis, is supplied to lymphocytes during their encounter with DCs [

 <xref rid="B112-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. This is further evidenced with diminished levels of GSH in plasma, erythrocytes, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HIV+ individuals. This reduction was coupled with decreased levels of cystine in plasma, thereby affecting DC functionality [
