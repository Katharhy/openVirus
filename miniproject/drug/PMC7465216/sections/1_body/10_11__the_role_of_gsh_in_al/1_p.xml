 <italic>M. tb</italic> infects DCs via ligation of DC-SIGN by the mycobacterial surface-exposed lipoglycan lipoarabinomannan (LAM) [
 <xref rid="B109-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. By increasing intracellular levels of GSH, thereby stimulating the NF-kB rel proteins, DC performance is enhanced in its innate function by inhibiting the intracellular growth of 
 <italic>M. tb</italic> as well as its adaptive immune role as the key APC [
 <xref rid="B32-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In an 
 <italic>M. tb</italic> infection, exogenous GSH addition results in more robust granuloma formation due to the enhancement of DC and cytokine activity. Further research is needed to determine the mechanism by which DC enhanced functionality against 
 <italic>M. tb</italic> infection occurs.
