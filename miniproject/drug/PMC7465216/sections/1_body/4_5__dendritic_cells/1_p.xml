<p>Dendritic Cells (DCs) have a significant role in host immune responses against 
 <italic>M. tb</italic> infection. The mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) is a class of cells that have the specialized function for processing and presenting antigens to activate lymphocytes [
 <xref rid="B26-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The MPS is comprised of monocytes, macrophages, and DCs [
 <xref rid="B27-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Within this system, DCs are known as the most efficient antigen-presenting cells in the immune system. This antigen-presenting function is a key component for the DCs to link the innate immune system with the adaptive immune response. Since protein antigens cannot be recognized by T cells in their native state, DCs are needed to process the complex protein antigens into peptides and conjugate these antigenic peptides to MHC I or II complexes that can then be recognized by CD8 and CD4 T cells, respectively, thereby activating an appropriate adaptive immune response. DCs perform these functions by using different receptors that can detect pathogen-derived components expressed on the plasma membrane (TLR) or within the cytoplasm (NOD-like receptors) [

 <xref rid="B29-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The immature form is found in peripheral tissues, which are responsible for detecting pathogens or injured host cells. This form is very efficient at performing endocytosis; however, they are equally as inefficient at generating peptide-MHC complexes [
 <xref rid="B28-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In order for the correct immune response to activate, the immature DC must become triggered by pathogens to develop into a mature DC. These mature DCs are now more efficient at producing peptide-MHC complexes as well as allowing these complexes to present at the cell surface [
