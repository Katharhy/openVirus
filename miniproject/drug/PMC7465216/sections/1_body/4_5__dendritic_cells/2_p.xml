<p>Depending on the nature of the pathogen that is endocytosed, the DC activates varying forms of T cell responses through presenting these peptides on either MHC I or MHC II [
 <xref rid="B29-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. MHC I antigenic peptide complex are known to be processed forms of antigens synthesized endogenously such as peptides being presented by virally infected cells. MHC II antigenic peptide complexes are known to be from peptides that are associated with exogenous sources such as peptides from endocytosed bacteria. In addition to producing more peptide-MHC complexes, the mature DCs can now migrate into lymphoid organs, which are T cell rich, to stimulate extremely specific T cell responses [

 <xref rid="B31-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Within these T cell rich organs, DCs are also responsible for secreting polarizing cytokines that induce CD4+ T cells to differentiate into various subtypes, which include Th1, Th2, Th17, and regulatory T cells [
