<p>Inside the granuloma, effector responses, along with a lack of nutrients and oxygen, cause 
 <italic>M. tb</italic> to become dormant and remain in a non-replicating state. The contained 
 <italic>M. tb</italic> within a granuloma in the lungs is referred to as latent tuberculosis (LTBI). In immunocompromised individuals, a breakdown of immune responses can result in reactivation of 
 <italic>M. tb</italic> [
 <xref rid="B9-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. An immune-compromised state promotes liquefaction of the caseum in the granuloma and bacterial replication, thereby promoting cavity formation and the release of 
 <italic>M. tb</italic> to the exterior during coughing, causing spread of the infection to other parts of the lungs [

 <italic>M. tb</italic> deflects the host defense mechanisms via cord factor, preventing fusion between the phagosome and lysosome and degradation of the bacterium [
