<p>Initial infection with 
 <italic>M. tb</italic> involves the inhalation of aerosolized infectious droplets containing the pathogen, which travel down the respiratory tract to infect the lungs’ alveoli. Thereafter, 
 <italic>M. tb</italic> can travel throughout the body via systematic and lymphatic circulation and infect other organs, such as the brain, kidney, bone, or apex of the lungs. Within 2–8 weeks, macrophages—specialized immune cells—mount an immune response by ingesting and destroying the 
 <italic>M. tb</italic>. However, some of the macrophages aggregate and form a granuloma, an immune barrier that encloses and suppresses the 
 <italic>M. tb</italic>, instead of completely clearing the infection [

Alongside macrophages, cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs), neutrophils, natural killer cells, fibroblasts, CD4 T cells, and cytotoxic CD8 T cells are also recruited to the granuloma via cytokine mediation, leading to further containment of the bacterium [
