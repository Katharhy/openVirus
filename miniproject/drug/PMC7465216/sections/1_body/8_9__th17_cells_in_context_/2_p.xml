<p>TGF-β and IL-6 exhibit a regulatory relationship in which TGF-β influences IL-6 in its role in Th17 differentiation. Studies show that the role of TGF-β in Th17 and Treg differentiation is influenced by the inflammatory cytokine environment as levels of Foxp3
 <sup>+</sup> were found to be inversely related to levels of IL-6, suggesting that IL-6 inhibits the generation of Tregs in the presence of TGF-β. This essentially shifts this Th17/Treg balance towards Th17 differentiation during a pro-inflammatory state [
