<p>HIV infection can be characterized as loss of mucosal CD4+ T cells along with a preferential loss of Th17 cells, although this mechanism is still under investigation. Despite low levels of Th17, levels of IL-6 and TGF-β have been found to be increased in those infected with HIV, therefore suggesting that this loss of Th17 cells is likely not due to a lack of Th17-inducing cytokines [
 <xref rid="B95-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Th17 cells are preferentially infected in the earliest stages of transmission in cases of macaque simian immunodeficiency virus with Th17 markers CCR6 and RORγt being initial targets [

This permissive effect of infection on Th17 cells is likely due to multiple factors including expression of HIV dependency factors and lack of HIV restriction mechanisms. The presence of these Th17 cells on the surface of gut-associated lymphoid tissues as well as its contribution to the persistence of HIV infection, especially during antiretroviral therapy, poses Th17 cells as a potential target for immunotherapy [
 <xref rid="B97-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Studies suggest that during HIV infection, Th17 cells are unable to express IL-17 and lose ability to be maintained by IL-23 [
 <xref rid="B98-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. This deficiency and impaired function of Th17 cells depletes the immune response at mucosal surfaces, resulting in increased translocation of microbes across the intestinal epithelium into the systemic circulation [

 <italic>M. tb</italic> and HIV coinfection, the respiratory mucosal defense towards inhaled 
 <italic>M. tb</italic> is compromised in HIV infection largely due to this loss of Th17 cells. In conjunction with reduced IL-17 chemoattractant properties, as well as an increase in the number of Tregs resulting in immunosuppression, this results in advancement of active TB infection [
