<p>Th17 cells, another subset of CD4+ T-cells that reside at mucosal surfaces, play a significant role in immunity and the inflammatory response, including protecting against extracellular pathogens during autoimmune diseases [

 <xref rid="B89-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Th17 cells secrete IL-17, which serves as a chemoattractant to recruit neutrophils to the area of infection [

 <xref rid="B91-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Differentiation, stabilization, and amplification of Th17 cells is largely dependent on the presence of TGF-β, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-21, and IL-23, although the individual roles of these cytokines are known to be different across some species, most notably between mice and humans [
