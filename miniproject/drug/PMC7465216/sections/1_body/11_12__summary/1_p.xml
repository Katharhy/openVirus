<p>Research has shown that DCs play an important role in mucosal immunity. Given the mode of transmission for HIV via mucosal transmission, the first cells infected are the DCs by the dendrites on the cell surface. If a treatment strategy is formed to target dendrites, this could be a breakthrough for HIV infection. Previous studies have demonstrated that the loss of DCs could be relevant in treatment strategies for TB and HIV. Immunotherapies and vaccines specific for strengthening DCs could result in further management of these diseases. However, these treatments cannot be accomplished with the lack of research. Knowledge gaps still persist in the class of DC that should be targeted to reduce further loss in response to an HIV or TB infection. Further research in the field of GSH enhancing DCs could lead to the beginnings of immunotherapy for these immunocompromised patients.</p>
