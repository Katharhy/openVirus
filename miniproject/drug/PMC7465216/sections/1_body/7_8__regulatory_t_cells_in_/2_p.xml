<p>Upon formation of a granuloma, Tregs infiltrate the site of infection to regulate the increased immune response against 
 <italic>M. tb</italic> and release IL-10 and TGF-β1, which suppress the actions of antigen-presenting cells like DCs [

 <xref rid="B83-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Studies have shown an increase in levels of Tregs in patients with 
 <italic>M. tb</italic> both peripherally and at the site of infection, with levels at the site of infection being greater [

 <xref rid="B85-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The relationship of Tregs in those infected with HIV is not clearly understood as some studies have shown a deficiency of Tregs following HIV infection while others have shown an increase [

 <xref rid="B87-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. However, a more recent study demonstrates a decrease in Foxp3 expressing CD4 T cells during the early stages of HIV infection peripherally thus contributing to increased immune response leading to an permissive effect on HIV-1 replication [
 <xref rid="B87-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Upon progression of the HIV infection, an upregulation in both levels of Tregs and Foxp3 expression with a prominent inverse relationship of CD4 count was reported, thus making these subjects more prone to being infected by active TB [
 <xref rid="B87-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. This suggests that the hallmark immunodeficient state in those with HIV due to loss of CD4+ cells is perpetuated by the increase in number of Tregs, further compromising the immune system and increasing the individual’s susceptibility to infection by 
 <italic>M. tb</italic> [
 <xref rid="B87-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. However, due to the conflicting nature of data regarding the role of Tregs in HIV, further investigation is needed to clearly delineate this role in the context of HIV and TB.
