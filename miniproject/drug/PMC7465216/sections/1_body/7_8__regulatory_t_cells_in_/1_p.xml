<p>Regulatory T cells (Treg), a subset of CD4+ T cells, play a significant role in regulating the immune response as well as maintaining self-produced antigen recognition by suppression of the activation and expansion of self-reactive T cells, which prevents autoimmune disease [

 <sup>+</sup>), a transcription factor that is essential for proper Treg differentiation [
