<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a respiratory infection that originates from the bacteria 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (
 <italic>M. tb</italic>). TB is recognized as one of the top 10 leading infectious killers globally; it is also the most common opportunistic infection and a contributing cause of death for HIV patients. Globally, it is estimated that TB has 10 million incident cases and an estimated 1.9 million deaths [

According to the World Health Organizationâ€™s Annual Tuberculosis Report in 2019, the highest estimated total incidence of TB was in Southeast Asia, with 4,370,000 incident cases. Africa was second to Southeast Asia with 2,450,000 incident cases. Thus, most cases and deaths are in developing countries. Individuals with other comorbidities and factors that suppress the immune system, such as uncontrolled diabetes, HIV infection, chronic renal failure, and use of immunosuppressive drugs, are at higher risk for contracting primary 
 <italic>M. tb</italic> infection and undergoing reactivation of latent 
 <italic>M. tb</italic> infection [

 <italic>M. tb</italic> disease burden and, thus, concentrate the disease in socio-economically disadvantaged countries [
 <xref rid="B3-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In developing regions, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, limited access to ART increases the susceptibility to HIV and other co-infections most commonly seen with TB and HIV comorbidities [
 <xref rid="B4-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Administration of ART reduces TB incidence by 67% [
 <xref rid="B5-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], as well as mortality if ART is started early [
