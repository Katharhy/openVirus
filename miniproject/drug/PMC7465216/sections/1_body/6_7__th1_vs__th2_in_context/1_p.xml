<p>In the context of 
 <italic>M. tb</italic> infection, Th1 cells are hypothesized to be the critical effector subtype because 
 <italic>M. tb</italic> is primarily an intracellular infection as opposed to Th2, which is typically significant in extra-cellular parasitic infections. Th1 cells clear the 
 <italic>M. tb</italic> infection by their secretion of IFN-Î³, which activates macrophages and CD8+ Cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs). Macrophages can then exhibit their antimicrobial properties involving phagocytosis and release of reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates [

 <italic>M. tb</italic> via antimicrobial peptides, perforin, and granulysin [
