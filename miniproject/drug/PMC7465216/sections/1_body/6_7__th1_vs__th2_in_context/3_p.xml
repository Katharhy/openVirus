<p>Furthermore, in vitro glutathione (GSH) treatment of immune cells isolated from

GSH treatment has been shown to increase production of the cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α, resulting in enhanced effector functions of macrophages, natural killer cells, and CD8+ T-cells. GSH treatment of DCs also induces increased production of IL-12 [

Together, the effects of IFN-γ and IL-12 improves polarization towards the Th1 subclass and enhance the Th1 response. Overall, these studies support the importance of Th1 cells’ role in inhibiting
