<p>In addition, HIV-1 infection and the progression to full-blown AIDS is recognized to cause a depletion in CD4+ T-cells [
 <xref rid="B75-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Activated CD4+ T-cells release IL-2, a key cytokine for CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell proliferation, differentiation, and viability [

 <xref rid="B77-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Compromised IL-2 levels prevent activation of other downstream effector cell sub-types, including CTLs, and progressive decline in CD4+ T-cell levels. Low CD4+ T-cell counts lead to increased risk for opportunistic infections, and
