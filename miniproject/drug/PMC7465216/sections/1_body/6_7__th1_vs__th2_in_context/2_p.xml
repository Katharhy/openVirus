<p>Accordingly, patients with pulmonary TB infections have been shown to have higher Th1:Th2 ratios [
 <xref rid="B66-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In TB patients treated with antimycobacterial agents, there were both a significant increase in serologic Th1 markers ((sLAG)-3) accompanied by a decrease in Th2 markers (IgE, soluble CD30, and CCL22/macrophage-derived chemokine) when compared to healthy controls at both 2–3 months and 6-month time points. Additionally, impairment of receptors or production of key cytokines, such as IFN-γ or IL-12, required for Th1 polarization and down-stream effects result in increased susceptibility to
