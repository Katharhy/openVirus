<p>Interestingly, in chronic HIV-1 infection, HIV causes the Th1 subclass to switch predominately to the Th2 subclass [

 <xref rid="B71-jcm-09-02661" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. This leads to a decrease in the Th1:Th2 ratio from an alteration in cytokine balance. This is exemplified by a reduction in Th1 related cytokines, IL-2 and IFN-γ, and an increase in Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-10 [

CTLs are critical for destroying virally infected HIV cells through interactions with the MHC-I receptor. Therefore, HIV can cleverly evade its own destruction by reducing CD8+ CTL activation and response by perturbing the source of their activation, Th1 cells [
