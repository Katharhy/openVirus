 <p>Dendritic cells are the principal antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the host defense mechanism. An altered dendritic cell response increases the risk of susceptibility of infections, such as 
  <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (
  <italic>M. tb</italic>), and the survival of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The altered response of dendritic cells leads to decreased activity of T-helper-1 (Th1), Th2, Regulatory T cells (Tregs), and Th17 cells in tuberculosis (TB) infections due to a diminishment of cytokine release from these APCs, while HIV infection leads to DC maturation, allowing DCs to migrate to lymph nodes and the sub-mucosa where they then transfer HIV to CD4 T cells, although there is controversy around this topic. Increases in the levels of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) plays a critical role in maintaining dendritic cell redox homeostasis, leading to an adequate immune response with sufficient cytokine release and a subsequent robust immune response. Thus, an understanding of the intricate pathways involved in the dendritic cell response are needed to prevent co-infections and co-morbidities in individuals with TB and HIV.
