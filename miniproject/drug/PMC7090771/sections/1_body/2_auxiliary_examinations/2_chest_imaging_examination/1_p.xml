<p id="Par15">Suspected cases or confirmed cases should undertake chest X-ray examination as soon as possible. Chest CT scan is required when necessary. In the early stage of disease, chest images show multiple small plaques and interstitial changes, which are obvious in the lung periphery, further deteriorate to bilateral multiple ground-glass opacity and/or infiltrating shadows. Lung consolidation may occur in severe cases. Pleural effusion is rarely seen.</p>
