<p id="Par106">Patients infected with 2019-nCoV are the main infection sources. Children infected by novel coronavirus should be isolated at home or admitted to designated hospitals under the guidance of healthcare workers depending on the severity of their medical conditions. Try to provide single rooms for isolated children, and reduce the chance of contact with the co-residents. There are enormous demands for room ventilation, necessary cleaning, and disinfection work for the articles used by children. Equally crucial is the need of equipment with disposable masks and properly disposal after use when taking care of the sick.</p>
