<p>In the SARS-MERS antiviral therapy section, inclusion criteria consisted of clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of antiviral drugs administered for management of ARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The exclusion criteria in this section contained observational studies, guides, animal studies, and review articles. Since SARS and MERS outbreaks happened in recent years, and there was the opportunity for conduction of clinical trials, only clinical trials were included in this section, as they provide the highest level of evidence. In this section, antiviral therapies for COVID-19 are to be suggested, so the provided underlying evidence should be of highest validity.</p>
