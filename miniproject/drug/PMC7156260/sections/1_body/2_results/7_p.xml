<p>Guan et al. studied 1099 patients, 393 of which were treated with oseltamivir and showed that ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, or death rate was 9.2% among the oseltamivir-treated group, whilst the rate was 4.4% in the group that was not treated with oseltamivir. In other words, oseltamivir administration was ineffective in decreasing ICU admission rate, the need for ventilator and death rate among the patients (

In their study, the mortality rate was 12.9% among the group treated with antiviral drugs, whereas the group which did not receive the antiviral treatment had a mortality rate of 5.6% (

Furthermore, in Singapore, Young et al. studied 18 patients, and administered lopinavir/ritonavir for only five patients, two of whom recovered and two deteriorated. Only one patient tolerated the antiviral regimen and completed the 12-day treatment course. After the start of antiviral treatments, liver test results became abnormal in three of the patients (
