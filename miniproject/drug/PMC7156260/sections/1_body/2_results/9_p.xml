 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and Wang et al. (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) also observed no deaths in their studies. However, the majority of the patients they reviewed were still under treatment, with an unclear final outcome, at the time of the publication of their articles.
