<p>The only clinical trial found was performed on 199 patients with severe COVID-19, using Lopinavir-Ritonavir regimen. In this randomized open-labeled clinical trial, patients were divided into two groups: lopinavir-ritonavir (99 patients) group and standard treatment group. In addition to lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg / 100 mg, twice daily; 14 days), standard treatments such as antibiotics, invasive or non-invasive ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and vasopressor were also used. The findings of this study showed that patients receiving lopinavir-ritonavir had a similar recovery process to those receiving standard treatment. 28-day mortality and viral RNA load were not significantly different between the two groups (
