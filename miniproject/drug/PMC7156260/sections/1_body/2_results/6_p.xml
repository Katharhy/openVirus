<p>As previously mentioned, all of the other studies were case-reports and case-series. Moreover, most of the studies did not provide an analysis regarding the efficacy of antiviral therapy in the treatment course of COVID-19 patients. For instance, Chen et al. reported no deaths among nine patients treated with Lopinavir/Ritonavir. However, the sample size of the mentioned article was quite small (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). According to the existing statistics, the mortality rate of COVID-19 among patients aged 10 to 60 years, varies between 0.2% and 1.3% (

Therefore, the sample size was probably not large enough to observe at least one death. In another study, Hu et al. studied 24 asymptomatic patients and reported no mortality or ICU admission, and no serious complication in 21 patients treated with antiviral agents. Nonetheless, in addition to the small sample size, since the patients were asymptomatic, the severity of COVID-19 was rather mild in them. Therefore, the recovery of the patients might have been due to their mild disease, rather than the efficacy of the antiviral drugs used (
