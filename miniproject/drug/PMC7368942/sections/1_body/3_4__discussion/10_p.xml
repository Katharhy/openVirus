<p>The limitations of this study include the retrospective cross-sectional character, leading to possible memory biases; however, as the inclusion of the patients in this study occurred immediately after the period of the epidemic and the symptoms of chikungunya are intense and characteristic, this tendency is likely to decrease. It was also not possible to include a matched number of cases in the control group since most patients came to the consultation unaccompanied, and it was not possible to form a larger sample of controls due to the fact that the socioeconomical conditions of those patients were low and it was not possible for more than one person of the household to go to the appointments to answer the questionnaires. Perhaps with a larger sample, it would be possible to demonstrate the significant difference in the number of cases with subclinical infection between the two groups.</p>
