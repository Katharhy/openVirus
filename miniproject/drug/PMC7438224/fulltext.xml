In the last two decades, one of the worst pandemics is known as the Pandemic H1N1/09 virus. The Pandemic H1N1/09 virus spread from human to human, and all age groups were susceptible (<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">WHO,&#x000a0;2010</xref>b). It spread like wildfire through droplets of coughs and sneezes or through the touching of a surface or one's face (<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">WHO,&#x000a0;2010</xref>b).

Two other infectious diseases of the same viral family, SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), caused much destruction globally (<xref rid="bib0053" ref-type="bibr">WHO,&#x000a0;2020</xref>). SARS has since been controlled and had more than 8000 confirmed cases (<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">WHO,&#x000a0;2020 n.d.</xref>), while the ongoing MERS has affected over 27 countries, with 2519 confirmed cases and 886 deaths (<xref rid="bib0052" ref-type="bibr">WHO,&#x000a0;2020</xref>b). Both diseases were more severe in people with chronic medical histories or conditions such as lung diseases and compromised immune systems (<xref rid="bib0052" ref-type="bibr">WHO,&#x000a0;2020</xref>b). COVID-19 was first detected in humans in December 2019 (<xref rid="bib0053" ref-type="bibr">WHO,&#x000a0;2020</xref>c). Some symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, tiredness, dry coughs, and aches, and these symptoms are usually mild or can go undetected (<xref rid="bib0053" ref-type="bibr">WHO,&#x000a0;2020</xref>c). Safety measures, such as social isolation, social distancing, and the practice of personal hygiene, have been put in place in affected countries to prevent a widespread of the virus (<xref rid="bib0053" ref-type="bibr">WHO,&#x000a0;2020</xref>c).

A review of 11 pregnant women who were infected with MERS revealed that 91% had poor obstetrical outcomes (i.e. premature delivery, neonatal mortality, and severe respiratory disease) (<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">Favre&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Hence, both SARS and MERS infections were associated with aversive obstetrical outcomes but not maternal-fetal intrauterine transmissions.</p><p id="para0016">Existing COVID-19 studies that focused on infected pregnant women, though limited, revealed no vertical transmissions of the virus thus far (<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">Chen&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">Liu&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>).

However, the available sources that investigated the area of interest were mainly quantitative (<xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">Ng&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>), vaccination-related (<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">Clark&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib0048" ref-type="bibr">Wilson&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>), or focused on nurses from other departments (i.e. emergency wards and intensive care units) (<xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">Kang&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr">Kim,&#x000a0;2018</xref>). Therefore, there is an urgent need to consolidate evidence on the experiences and needs of pregnant women and maternity units&#x02019; nurses and midwives during public health crises so that needed support can be activated. Hence, the purpose of this meta-synthesis was to consolidate qualitative studies that examined the perspectives of pregnant women, midwives, and nurses of maternity units to gain a deeper and more holistic insight into their experiences and needs during past epidemics and pandemics to pave a way forward for future research and clinical implications during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.</p></sec><sec id="sec0002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec0003"><title>Aim</title><p id="para0018">This qualitative systematic review aimed to synthesize knowledge on the experiences and needs of pregnant women, midwives, and nurses of maternity units and how they were supported during past epidemics and pandemics.</p></sec><sec id="sec0004"><title>Design</title><p id="para0019">
<xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">Sandelowski and Barroso's (2007)</xref> meta-synthesis of qualitative studies approach was used to summarize and synthesis evidence from the included qualitative studies.

A three-step approach was used to identify the studies: (a) a systematic search of electronic databases, (b) a manual search of journal references, and (c) a discussion with content experts. For validity and relevance purposes, four electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Scopus) were searched based on their relevance and availabilities. English-only studies were searched from January 2000 until 4 April 2020 to gather evidence on recent outbreaks. An initial search was conducted on PubMed using the main concepts derived from the aim: (&#x0201c;pregnant&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;nurse*&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;midwife&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;midwives&#x0201d;) and (&#x0201c;epidemic&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;plagues&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;pandemic&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;infectious disease outbreak&#x0201d;) and (&#x0201c;experiences&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;needs&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;perceptions&#x0201d;). Truncation symbols and Boolean operators were used to combine keywords and index terms, and search results were refined using filters depending on each database. The titles and abstracts of the studies were screened prior to full-text screening according to the eligibility criteria by two independent reviewers (i.e. the authors of this review). Any discrepancies that arose were discussed between the reviewers until a consensus was reached. The search strategy for the four databases can be found in Supplementary Table A1 (Supplementary Material).</p></sec><sec id="sec0006"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p id="para0021">The inclusion criteria for eligible qualitative studies were (a) study samples of pregnant women and/or midwives and/or nurses who were assisting pregnant women during an epidemic and/or a pandemic that occurred in the last 20 years and (b) qualitative studies exploring pregnant women and/or midwives and/or nurses&#x02019; experiences, needs, and/or perceptions. The exclusion criteria were (a) quantitative surveys, correlational studies, conference abstracts, and/or reviews and (b) qualitative studies that presented the process evaluation of interventions. Mixed methods studies were included, but only qualitative findings (where possible) were extracted and included in this review. Studies that explored the prevalence of pregnant women, midwives, and/or nurses who were diagnosed with the epidemic's or the pandemic's disease and studies that investigated the rates of pregnant women who accepted or declined vaccinations and/or treatments were excluded from this review.</p></sec><sec id="sec0007"><title>Critical appraisal</title><p id="para0022">The included studies were critically appraised using a ten-item Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool.

Each study was scored out of 30 and had an average score of 28, with scores ranging from 27 to 29 and an interrater reliability of 98%. The CASP scores for each included study are presented in Supplementary Table A2. The purpose of this review was to consolidate all qualitative evidence that presented the perspectives of pregnant women, nurses, and midwives from maternity units.

Firstly, publication details (author's name, year and country of publication, name of epidemic, study aim, methodology, sample characteristics, study design, and data collection and analysis) and findings were extracted. Secondly, both verbatim and non-verbatim statements about the experiences, needs, and/or perceptions of pregnant women, midwives, and nurses who lived through the epidemics and/or the pandemics were extracted for a subsequent thematic analysis within and across all included studies.

Firstly, the findings of the included studies were meta-summarized into statements, and initial ideas were extracted, separated, and grouped. The experiences and needs of the pregnant women, midwives, and nurses of maternity units during past epidemics and pandemics were categorized into themes and subthemes in relation to the coded extracts and the data set through a thematic analysis (<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">Braun&#x000a0;and Clarke,&#x000a0;2006</xref>). A consensus was reached between the two reviewers before proceeding to the next step. Secondly, the themes generated were meta-synthesized into new concepts to provide more comprehensive and novel insights into pregnant women's and maternity units&#x02019; midwives&#x02019; and nurses&#x02019; perspectives. A triangulation approach was maintained throughout the process of the meta-synthesis by comparing each included study to discover a novel understanding of pregnant women's, midwives&#x02019;, and nurses&#x02019; experiences during epidemics and pandemics. A collaborative approach between the reviewers beginning from screening to synthesis helped in maintaining the rigor and quality of the meta-synthesis. Any discrepancies that arose were discussed between the reviewers until a consensus was reached. Both reviewers were trained in conducting qualitative research and to enhance the overall rigor of the meta-synthesis.

The review highlighted the psychological responses, multi-faceted challenges, coping strategies, sources of support, and support needs of pregnant women, nurses, and midwives.</p><p id="para0037">Most participants from the included studies expressed negative psychological responses to the crises faced. Pregnant women were in negative states of mind, such as being fearful and anxious, and these could have exposed them to increased risks of preeclampsia, pre-term birth, and low birth weight (<xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">Faisal-Cury&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">Kim&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). To avoid such unfavorable outcomes, it is imperative to provide timely psychological support to pregnant women during epidemics and pandemics as they are already experiencing fluctuating hormonal levels and are at higher risks of experiencing anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorders (<xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">Jahan&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib0301" ref-type="bibr">Vigod, Buist, and Steiner, 2016</xref>). Amid a public health emergency, restrictive control measures are imposed, and these may limit accessibility to psychological support as the main focus remains on the physical wellbeing of pregnant women and their babies. The current social distancing measures and keeping only necessary visits in place during the COVID-19 outbreak are perfect examples of such measures during such crises (<xref rid="bib0052" ref-type="bibr">WHO,&#x000a0;2020</xref>b).</p><p id="para0038">To overcome such barriers, technology can be incorporated to stay connected with pregnant women and their families as technological advancements have offered unlimited connectivity in healthcare provision (<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Bush&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">Halili&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). A review that examined the effectiveness of tele-counselling (i.e. the provision of counselling services via telephone, videoconferencing, or the internet) has shown promising results in improvements in depression, anxiety, quality of life, and psychosocial functioning (<xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">Dorstyn&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). Hence, it is an opportune time to design psychological support programs and support systems using technology to provide continual care and needed psychological support to reach out to pregnant women during public health emergencies such as the recent COVID-19 situation. Countries that have limited access to technology have limited skilled human resources and have limited accessibility to psychological support; they could consider training the lay or community volunteers to provide psychosocial support to pregnant women and new mothers within the community. Lay-trained peer-led programs have demonstrated significant benefits in recovery rates and lowered rates of depressive and anxiety disorders (<xref rid="bib0041" ref-type="bibr">Patel&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib0042" ref-type="bibr">Patel&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">Shorey et al.,&#x000a0;2019</xref>). Receiving a minimum of four phone calls from lay peer volunteers has been found to reduce depressive symptoms among pregnant women and new mothers (<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">Dennis&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">Shorey et al.,&#x000a0;2019</xref>). Therefore, authorities can look into training community paraprofessionals and developing structured programs to reach out to and support pregnant women by providing basic psychological support amid public health emergencies.</p><p id="para0039">Midwives and nurses in this review reported heightened levels of stress and tension amid the epidemics and pandemics. A review that analyzed 30 studies reported that midwives and midwifery students are at high risks of feeling stressed due to occupational and organizational sources (<xref rid="bib0302" ref-type="bibr">Pezaro, 2016</xref>). Hence, midwives and nurses from maternity units may experience exponential stress levels during public health emergencies. Future studies from different geographical regions should examine this phenomenon to present a global representation of midwives&#x02019; and nurses&#x02019; psychosocial needs. As occupational stress has been found to be detrimental to both physical and mental health (<xref rid="bib0302" ref-type="bibr">Pezaro, 2016</xref>), necessary initiatives need to be implemented to support midwives and nurses in maternity units. The focus of the interventions should be on prioritizing self-care and emotional wellbeing, providing psychologically safe working cultures, and promoting interprofessional support (<xref rid="bib0302" ref-type="bibr">Pezaro, 2016</xref>). Especially during epidemics and pandemics, interventions such as mindfulness-based therapy, resilience workshops, and provisions of clinical supervision and support may be beneficial and should be evaluated further. As time is of essence during epidemics and pandemics, short interventions maybe more practical and useful. Brief mindfulness exercises (i.e. five-minute sessions) for healthcare providers have shown effectiveness in instilling positive changes in levels of stress, resiliency, burnout symptoms, anxiety, and mindfulness (<xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">Gilmartin&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Hence, brief mindfulness exercises can be integrated into workflows for midwives and nurses and even for other healthcare professionals of maternity units to benefit from these quick exercises and to calibrate their minds to maintain their psychological wellbeing during public health crises.</p><p id="para0040">Furthermore, pregnant women faced economical and familial demands (e.g. added pressure from family members to stay safe), delayed and limited understandings of the crises, and how they and their pregnancies could be affected. They coped through adhering to safety measures and adjusted their lifestyles. They mostly attained information about the diseases online and a few approached healthcare providers, but they generally wished for more information that was readily available from reliable resources such as healthcare professionals. This suggests the need for hospital administrators and clinical stakeholders to develop educational resources that are specially catered during epidemics and pandemics to readily reach out to pregnant women and their families. Technology can be used to send knowledge-based push notifications, fliers, or other relevant contents to pregnant women in hospital databases. Having such close contacts and follow-ups with pregnant women may not only provide them with the necessary informational support but also emotional support so that they will not feel alone during their journeys. The use of technology has been found to be effective among Asian women who followed the &#x0201c;doing the month&#x0201d; practices and were &#x0201c;confined&#x0201d; to their homes (<xref rid="bib0304" ref-type="bibr">Shorey and Ng, 2019</xref>). They specially highlighted that technology provided them with &#x0201c;companionship&#x0201d; when they felt &#x0201c;isolated&#x0201d; during the confinement periods at home. Hence, technology may be one solution to stay connected with pregnant women during public health emergencies. Additionally, healthcare providers can develop an online platform whereby telecommunication allows them to answer questions that pregnant women may have about vaccinations, available treatments, and information from trusted resources about ongoing crises to overcome barriers to social distancing.</p><p id="para0041">Families can be educated through online materials that are made readily available and accessible by healthcare leaders (e.g. WHO) on pregnancy-related topics during COVID-19 (<xref rid="bib0054" ref-type="bibr">WHO,&#x000a0;2020</xref>d). These online materials can also be accessed by spouses and extended families who may be stranded in different parts of the world to help them to understand the situations better and enable them to empathize with and support pregnant women during crises. Future studies can evaluate telecommunicating platforms to cater to the needs of pregnant women and their families during and beyond public health crises. Awareness within a community and relevant support such as financial support to the needy are also essential to maintain the cohesiveness of the community. <xref rid="bib0303" ref-type="bibr">Zuo and Liu (2014)</xref> analyzed an epidemic model in which the effect of awareness programs that were driven by media on the prevalence of an infectious disease was examined. The results revealed that increasing the dissemination rate of information and the implementation rate of safety measures, such as safe distancing and providing economic support where needed, can reduce proportions of infective populations and enhance compliance rates with safety measures, hence controlling the widespread of outbreaks (<xref rid="bib0303" ref-type="bibr">Zuo and Liu, 2014</xref>). Therefore, policy makers and health systems can collaborate to create awareness programs and educational programs, monitor the disseminations and implementations of various programmes to inform pregnant women, their families, and the population. For developing countries, these resources may be limited, and consensus and mutual support within families through shared experiences and open communications is encouraged to help pregnant women through epidemics and pandemics. Trained paraprofessionals such as community volunteers can also reach out to pregnant women and their families to provide easy-to-understand information and emotional support by simply being there as listening buddies (<xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">Shorey et al.,&#x000a0;2019</xref>).</p><p id="para0042">Midwives and nurses were stigmatized from their families and the public who feared them due to their job scopes, inadequate healthcare resources, and self-conflict. They coped through their passions and competencies and found that the intangible returns of gratification that they felt in helping pregnant women kept them motivated. They hoped for more structured and supportive health systems. They suggested to counter stigma and that anti-stigma interventions could be implemented. Such initiatives have shown effectiveness in combating public stigma, reducing self-stigma, improving stress management, and boosting self-esteem (<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Cook&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Hence, future studies can develop and examine the effectiveness of educational anti-stigma interventions or campaigns to combat public stigma against healthcare workers during epidemics and pandemics and, more importantly, after such crises when the public may be less stressed to understand the true picture of effectiveness of such interventions.</p><p id="para0043">Health systems should consistently review their healthcare supply inventories to ensure the adequacy of resources for provisions of basic protection to safe keep healthcare providers and, in turn, the public during public health crises. Drills and exercises should be planned and executed on regular bases as part of the operations in healthcare settings. Psychologically safe working cultures that prioritize self-care and interprofessional support (Perzaro, 2016) should also be incorporated as routine workflows to ensure employees&#x02019; wellbeing, subsequently improving product or service deliveries (<xref rid="bib0038" ref-type="bibr">Nembhard&#x000a0;and Edmondson,&#x000a0;2009</xref>). Therefore, healthcare administrators and clinical stakeholders can adopt positive work cultures to help midwives and nurses cope with the self-conflicts that they may experience during epidemics and pandemics.</p><sec id="sec0018"><title>Limitations</title><p id="para0044">Due to unclear titles and abstracts, including English-only studies, and poor indexing, relevant studies may have been missed. Only eight studies that examined the experiences and needs of pregnant women, midwives, and nurses from maternity units were included. Most of the studies were Western-based, with only two studies conducted in Asia. The studies included were widely heterogeneous as the samples who experienced various epidemics and pandemics from different geographical regions were included. With the differing nature of each epidemic or pandemic and the standard of living in a geographical region, the experiences and needs of these samples could have been targeted towards specific epidemics and pandemics or based on political grounds. Additionally, the review focused only on pregnant women and missed the experiences and needs of new mothers who may have additional needs and concerns during public health crises. This implies the need for more studies with diverse global representations as well as future reviews that represent the perinatal period by including the perceptions of pregnant women, new mothers, and their family members during public health crises. However, the included studies sampled participants from different age groups, and the findings were synthesized upon thematic similarities among pregnant women and maternity unit staff. Therefore, despite the limitations, this review has broadened the current literature by collating and creating a better insight into the experiences and needs of pregnant women, midwives, and nurses from maternity units during past epidemics and pandemics. This review paves a path to prepare better for the current COVID-19 pandemic and future public health crises.</p></sec><sec id="sec0019"><title>Implications for future practice and research</title><p id="para0045">To overcome the psychosocial impacts of outbreak control measures and increase accessibility, future studies can design and evaluate technology-based psychological support programs and tele-counselling and telecommunication of epidemic- and pandemic-related information for pregnant women and their families.

The development of anti-stigma educational initiatives and awareness programs are essential to educate and bring awareness to the public to combat stigma and show appreciation and support to healthcare workers during and after pandemics. Anti-stigma campaigns may be especially effective after such outbreaks as the true stories of healthcare professionals&#x02019; sacrifices and hard work can be documented to provide authentic evidence for their work during crises. Administrators and healthcare stakeholders should adopt and create systematic and positive work cultures to help midwives and nurses to cope with public health emergencies such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks. Supportive programmes, such as brief mindfulness exercises, should be part of the routine supportive resources and can be introduced and evaluated during orientation programmes for midwives and nurses. These programmes may prepare the new generation's midwives and nurses to more prepared and resilient in facing public health crises.</p></sec><sec id="sec0020"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="para0047">This qualitative systematic review consolidated and meta-synthesized the available qualitative evidence on the perspectives of pregnant women, midwives, and nurses of maternity units to gain a deeper and more holistic insight into their experiences and needs during past epidemics and pandemics. They had negative psychological responses, ranging from fear to helplessness, and faced challenges, such as limited available information about epidemics and pandemics for pregnant women, and public stigma against midwives and nurses. Various coping strategies, such as actively looking for more information and seeking solace in religions, were practiced. They highlighted that families were both sources of support and stress and wished to have more readily available information. More culturally diverse research that includes the development and evaluation of technology-based supportive programmes, trained community based para-professionals, and psychosocial interventions, such as brief mindfulness exercises and resilience workshops, are needed. Anti-stigma and awareness initiatives for family members and the public during epidemics and pandemics are proposed. Ultimately, we hope that this review not only creates awareness about the experiences and needed support of pregnant women, midwives, and nurses from maternity units but also leads to more informed and supportive healthcare systems during the trying times of epidemics and pandemics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0021"><title>Contributions</title><p id="para0048">Data Search, Data Extraction and Review of Articles: SS and VC; Manuscript preparation: SS, and VC.</p></sec><sec id="sec0023"><title>Funding statement</title><p id="para0052">Nil.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="para0053">None.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebibl1"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0003"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0003"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Tian</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Presumed asymptomatic carrier transmission of COVID-19</article-title><source>JAMA.</source><year>2020</year><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1001/jama.2020.2565</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0004"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0004"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Braun</surname><given-names>V.</given-names></name><name><surname>Clarke</surname><given-names>V.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Using thematic analysis in psychology</article-title><source>Qual.
