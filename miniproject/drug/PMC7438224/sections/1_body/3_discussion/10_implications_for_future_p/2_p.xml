<p id="para0046">Psychosocial interventions such as brief mindfulness exercises and resilience workshops can be developed for midwives and nurses to practice and maintain their psychological wellbeing and to provide effective and efficient care with the right headspaces. Administrators and health systems should consistently review their existing policies, resources, and workflows to adapt to changes during epidemics and pandemics and be future ready for such public health crises. The development of anti-stigma educational initiatives and awareness programs are essential to educate and bring awareness to the public to combat stigma and show appreciation and support to healthcare workers during and after pandemics. Anti-stigma campaigns may be especially effective after such outbreaks as the true stories of healthcare professionalsâ€™ sacrifices and hard work can be documented to provide authentic evidence for their work during crises. Administrators and healthcare stakeholders should adopt and create systematic and positive work cultures to help midwives and nurses to cope with public health emergencies such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks. Supportive programmes, such as brief mindfulness exercises, should be part of the routine supportive resources and can be introduced and evaluated during orientation programmes for midwives and nurses. These programmes may prepare the new generation's midwives and nurses to more prepared and resilient in facing public health crises.</p>
