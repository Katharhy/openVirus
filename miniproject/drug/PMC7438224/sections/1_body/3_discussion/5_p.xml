<p id="para0040">Furthermore, pregnant women faced economical and familial demands (e.g. added pressure from family members to stay safe), delayed and limited understandings of the crises, and how they and their pregnancies could be affected. They coped through adhering to safety measures and adjusted their lifestyles. They mostly attained information about the diseases online and a few approached healthcare providers, but they generally wished for more information that was readily available from reliable resources such as healthcare professionals. This suggests the need for hospital administrators and clinical stakeholders to develop educational resources that are specially catered during epidemics and pandemics to readily reach out to pregnant women and their families. Technology can be used to send knowledge-based push notifications, fliers, or other relevant contents to pregnant women in hospital databases. Having such close contacts and follow-ups with pregnant women may not only provide them with the necessary informational support but also emotional support so that they will not feel alone during their journeys.

They specially highlighted that technology provided them with “companionship” when they felt “isolated” during the confinement periods at home. Hence, technology may be one solution to stay connected with pregnant women during public health emergencies. Additionally, healthcare providers can develop an online platform whereby telecommunication allows them to answer questions that pregnant women may have about vaccinations, available treatments, and information from trusted resources about ongoing crises to overcome barriers to social distancing.
