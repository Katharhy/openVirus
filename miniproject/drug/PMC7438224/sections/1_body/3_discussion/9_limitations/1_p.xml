<p id="para0044">Due to unclear titles and abstracts, including English-only studies, and poor indexing, relevant studies may have been missed. Only eight studies that examined the experiences and needs of pregnant women, midwives, and nurses from maternity units were included. Most of the studies were Western-based, with only two studies conducted in Asia. The studies included were widely heterogeneous as the samples who experienced various epidemics and pandemics from different geographical regions were included. With the differing nature of each epidemic or pandemic and the standard of living in a geographical region, the experiences and needs of these samples could have been targeted towards specific epidemics and pandemics or based on political grounds. Additionally, the review focused only on pregnant women and missed the experiences and needs of new mothers who may have additional needs and concerns during public health crises. This implies the need for more studies with diverse global representations as well as future reviews that represent the perinatal period by including the perceptions of pregnant women, new mothers, and their family members during public health crises. However, the included studies sampled participants from different age groups, and the findings were synthesized upon thematic similarities among pregnant women and maternity unit staff. Therefore, despite the limitations, this review has broadened the current literature by collating and creating a better insight into the experiences and needs of pregnant women, midwives, and nurses from maternity units during past epidemics and pandemics. This review paves a path to prepare better for the current COVID-19 pandemic and future public health crises.</p>
