<p id="para0047">This qualitative systematic review consolidated and meta-synthesized the available qualitative evidence on the perspectives of pregnant women, midwives, and nurses of maternity units to gain a deeper and more holistic insight into their experiences and needs during past epidemics and pandemics. They had negative psychological responses, ranging from fear to helplessness, and faced challenges, such as limited available information about epidemics and pandemics for pregnant women, and public stigma against midwives and nurses. Various coping strategies, such as actively looking for more information and seeking solace in religions, were practiced. They highlighted that families were both sources of support and stress and wished to have more readily available information. More culturally diverse research that includes the development and evaluation of technology-based supportive programmes, trained community based para-professionals, and psychosocial interventions, such as brief mindfulness exercises and resilience workshops, are needed. Anti-stigma and awareness initiatives for family members and the public during epidemics and pandemics are proposed. Ultimately, we hope that this review not only creates awareness about the experiences and needed support of pregnant women, midwives, and nurses from maternity units but also leads to more informed and supportive healthcare systems during the trying times of epidemics and pandemics.</p>
