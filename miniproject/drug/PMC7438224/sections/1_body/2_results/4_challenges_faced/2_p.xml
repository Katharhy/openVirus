<p id="para0031">Midwives and nurses faced public stigma, mistrust, and fear of the contagious diseases being passed on from themselves to the general population (

 <xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">Kollie et al., 2017</xref>). Important drugs for delivery were “stock-out”, and healthcare facilities had difficulties in ensuring that their staff had the equipment to be protected from the diseases (

 <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">Erland and Dahl, 2017</xref>). This was evident from a midwife who got fired from an Ebola center as she had been eager to provide better care for pregnant women but put herself and others at risk of the infection as she allowed the mother to continue skin-to-skin with her baby despite being prohibited to by the center (

The midwives and nurses faced self-conflicts and had difficulties prioritizing between the need for support from their families, family demands, the desire to protect their loved ones from the diseases, and their professional responsibilities to serve pregnant women (
