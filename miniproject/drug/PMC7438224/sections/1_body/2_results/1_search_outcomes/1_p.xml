<p id="para0025">One thousand nine hundred and thirty-six studies were initially identified, and 1927 studies were screened for their titles and abstracts after the removal of nine duplicates. Based on the eligibility criteria, 1870 studies were deemed irrelevant. Fifty-seven studies were retrieved for full-text reviews, and 49 studies were excluded as they did not fulfill the eligibility criteria. The process led to the inclusion of eight studies in this review.
