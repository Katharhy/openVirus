<p id="para0020">The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were adopted in this review (
 <xref rid="bib0036" ref-type="bibr">Moher et al., 2009</xref>). A three-step approach was used to identify the studies: (a) a systematic search of electronic databases, (b) a manual search of journal references, and (c) a discussion with content experts. For validity and relevance purposes, four electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Scopus) were searched based on their relevance and availabilities. English-only studies were searched from January 2000 until 4 April 2020 to gather evidence on recent outbreaks. An initial search was conducted on PubMed using the main concepts derived from the aim: (“pregnant” OR “nurse*” OR “midwife” OR “midwives”) and (“epidemic” OR “plagues” OR “pandemic” OR “infectious disease outbreak”) and (“experiences” OR “needs” OR “perceptions”). Truncation symbols and Boolean operators were used to combine keywords and index terms, and search results were refined using filters depending on each database. The titles and abstracts of the studies were screened prior to full-text screening according to the eligibility criteria by two independent reviewers (i.e. the authors of this review). Any discrepancies that arose were discussed between the reviewers until a consensus was reached. The search strategy for the four databases can be found in Supplementary Table A1 (Supplementary Material).
