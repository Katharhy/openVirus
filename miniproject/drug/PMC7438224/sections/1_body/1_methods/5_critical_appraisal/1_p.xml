<p id="para0022">The included studies were critically appraised using a ten-item Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool. The studies were assessed for the clarity of their aims, methodologies, designs, sampling strategies, data collections, reflexivity of the researchers, ethical considerations, rigors of data analyses, statements of the findings, and values of the research. Each study was scored out of 30 and had an average score of 28, with scores ranging from 27 to 29 and an interrater reliability of 98%. The CASP scores for each included study are presented in Supplementary Table A2. The purpose of this review was to consolidate all qualitative evidence that presented the perspectives of pregnant women, nurses, and midwives from maternity units. Therefore, all the shortlisted studies were included in the meta-synthesis regardless of their appraisal scores.</p>
