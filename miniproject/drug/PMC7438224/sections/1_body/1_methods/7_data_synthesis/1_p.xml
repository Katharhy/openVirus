 <xref rid="bib0044" ref-type="bibr">Sandelowski and Barroso, 2002</xref>), and the Microsoft Excel (2019) software was used to manage and structure the individual data of the included studies. Firstly, the findings of the included studies were meta-summarized into statements, and initial ideas were extracted, separated, and grouped. The experiences and needs of the pregnant women, midwives, and nurses of maternity units during past epidemics and pandemics were categorized into themes and subthemes in relation to the coded extracts and the data set through a thematic analysis (

Secondly, the themes generated were meta-synthesized into new concepts to provide more comprehensive and novel insights into pregnant women's and maternity units’ midwives’ and nurses’ perspectives. A triangulation approach was maintained throughout the process of the meta-synthesis by comparing each included study to discover a novel understanding of pregnant women's, midwives’, and nurses’ experiences during epidemics and pandemics. A collaborative approach between the reviewers beginning from screening to synthesis helped in maintaining the rigor and quality of the meta-synthesis. Any discrepancies that arose were discussed between the reviewers until a consensus was reached. Both reviewers were trained in conducting qualitative research and to enhance the overall rigor of the meta-synthesis. None of the shortlisted studies were removed based on their appraisal scores (
