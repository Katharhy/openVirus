 <xref rid="bib0037" ref-type="bibr">Mullins et al., 2020</xref>) have broadened and deepened the literature of pregnancy during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, there is a dearth of studies that examined the experiences and needs of pregnant women who are living through the COVID-19 epidemic despite evidence revealing heightened levels of stress, anxiety, worry, and fear (
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Fakari and Simbar, 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">Jeong et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 2004</xref>) among pregnant women who had experienced epidemics. Furthermore, midwives and nurses from maternity units play crucial and pivotal roles in providing care, counselling, and education to pregnant women during and after pandemics (
 <xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 2004</xref>). However, the available sources that investigated the area of interest were mainly quantitative (
 <xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 2004</xref>), vaccination-related (
 <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0048" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>), or focused on nurses from other departments (i.e. emergency wards and intensive care units) (
 <xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr">Kim, 2018</xref>). Therefore, there is an urgent need to consolidate evidence on the experiences and needs of pregnant women and maternity units’ nurses and midwives during public health crises so that needed support can be activated. Hence, the purpose of this meta-synthesis was to consolidate qualitative studies that examined the perspectives of pregnant women, midwives, and nurses of maternity units to gain a deeper and more holistic insight into their experiences and needs during past epidemics and pandemics to pave a way forward for future research and clinical implications during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.
