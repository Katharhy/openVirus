<p id="para0016">Existing COVID-19 studies that focused on infected pregnant women, though limited, revealed no vertical transmissions of the virus thus far (

 <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). A recent report regarding nine COVID-10 positive pregnant women who delivered through caesarean section found no evidence of vertical transmissions (
 <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). All nine women received empiric antibiotic therapy and were administered oxygen via nasal cannulas, and all the infants were live-born and had satisfactory one- and five-minute Apgar scores (

 <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Three infants were delivered full-term, and all had displayed good Apgar scores and tested negative for COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). During the COVID-19 epidemic, there were two cases of confirmed neonatal infections: one with a history of close contact with two confirmed cases (mother and nanny) and another who was found to be infected 36 h post-delivery (

 <xref rid="bib0047" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). With delayed viral testing, there was no direct evidence for vertical transmissions in both infants.
