<p>ACE2, a surface molecule, is localized in various human organs including oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, and heart [
 <xref rid="B85-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,
 <xref rid="B86-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,
 <xref rid="B87-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. In renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), ACE2 catalysis the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7, which acts as a vasodilator and exerts protective effects in the CV system [
 <xref rid="B88-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Moreover, ACE2 has been found to be protective from acute lung injury and myocardial injury in animal models [

 <xref rid="B89-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. As previously shown for SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 similarly utilizes ACE2 for viral cell entry [
 <xref rid="B17-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and after the initial engagement of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, there is subsequent downregulation of ACE2 abundance [
 <xref rid="B90-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Dysregulated ACE2 may result in unopposed angiotensin II accumulation and local RAAS activation, which can exacerbate lung and myocardial injuries induced by the viral infection.
