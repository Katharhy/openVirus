<p>According to the WHO interim guidelines, ECMO can be considered in COVID-19 patients with refractory hypoxemia despite lung protective ventilation [

Particularly, it is crucial to determine whether to choose venovenous or venoarterial ECMO cannulation in the context of mixed presentations of ARDS with systolic heart failure. Judgement will be needed to decide when and how ECMO can be worthwhile, by understanding the extent of cardiac function and many other factors. Lastly, providing ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases faces unique challenges. Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all crucial components of an ECMO action plan [
