<p>COVID-19-infected patients are likely at increased risk of VTE. However, increased coagulopathy abnormalities and thrombotic susceptibility in COVID-19 patients are far beyond the scope of this review. Higher thrombotic burden in the acute phase of COVID-19 relies on proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine release [

 <xref rid="B79-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], increased endothelial dysfunction/damage, and potential sepsis induced coagulopathy development in severe cases, all promoting coagulation activation. Recent insights found that severe lung inflammation and impaired pulmonary gas exchange in COVID-19 has been associated with upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine release and increased endothelial dysfunction [
