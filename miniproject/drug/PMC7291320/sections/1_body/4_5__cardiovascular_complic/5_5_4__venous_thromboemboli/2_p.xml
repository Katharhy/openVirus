<p>In a previously published necropsy series comprising a total of eight SARS patients, pulmonary thromboemboluses were found in four patients and three had deep vein thrombosis (DVT) [

 <xref rid="B75-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] reporting DVT and/or acute pulmonary embolism (APE) in COVID-19 patients paved the way for more comprehensive insights of thrombotic events in larger cohorts. To date, only one retrospective registry cohort of 25 COVID-19 patients in China with CT pulmonary angiography suggested a high rate of thrombotic events, with 10 patients (40%) with APE. With regards to initial sensitivity of RT-PCR at initial presentation that ranges between 60% and 71% [
