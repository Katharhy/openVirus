<p>APE may present with clinical deterioration, such as unexplained hemodynamic instability and hypoxemia. Elevated cardiac biomarkers and ST-T abnormalities may be detected in some cases [

The only widely available treatment for VTE is prophylactic dose low molecular heparin which could be considered in all patients who require hospital admission for COVID-19, in the absence of any contraindications [

The real incidence of VTE remains unknown in the sparse literature and is probably underestimated because of asymptomatic presentation and/or the lack of systematic imaging. Indeed, routine imaging according to a defined D-dimer threshold has been proposed in some centers such as ours. Special attention needs to be paid to the danger of VTE associated with COVID-19 infection in clinical practice.
