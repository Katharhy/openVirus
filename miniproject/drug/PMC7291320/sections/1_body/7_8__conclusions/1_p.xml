<p>COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV2, has resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide and has become an emerging health threat. Underlying CVD is a common condition among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and is associated with a higher risk of severe disease and morality. Myocardial injury and myocardiopathy are present in a considerable number of critical cases and patients with pre-existing CAD or underlying heart failure seem to be susceptible to myocardial injury. Despite the theoretical concerns and uncertainty regarding the effect of RAAS inhibitors on ACE2 and the way in which these drugs affect the severity of COVID-19, RAAS inhibitors are recommended to be continued based on the available evidence at this time. A large number of prospective RCTs and cohort studies are ongoing, but none have provided proven clinical efficacy to date.</p>
