<p>Previous studies have shown that CVD was a common comorbidity in patients with SARS and MERS. A retrospective case series including 144 patients with SARS examined the prevalence of cardiac disease, DM, and cancer to be 8%, 11%, and 6%, respectively [
 <xref rid="B40-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In MERS, a meta-analysis of 12 studies inclusive of 637 patients indicated that DM and HT were found in 50% of the cases, while CVD was present in approximately 30% of the patients [
 <xref rid="B41-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The higher prevalence of CVD in MERS may be partly explained by the older age distribution in MERS than that in SARS (50.0 years vs. 39.9 years) [

 <xref rid="jcm-09-01407-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In the studies reported from China, HT was present in 15.0%–34.7%, DM in 7.4%–20.0%, and CVD in 8.7%–15% [

 <xref rid="B43-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Most recently, an early report from New York City suggested that the incidence of HT (50.1%) and DM (25.2%) can be higher in U.S. cohorts [
 <xref rid="B34-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A data from 22,512 patients with COVID-19 in the Italian population has demonstrated that 355 patients died in this cohort and 30% of them had ischemic heart disease, 35.5% had DM, 24.5% had atrial fibrillation, and 9.6% had a history of stroke [
 <xref rid="B33-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The high proportion of older patients with COVID-19 in Italy (patients 70 years or older; 37.6% in Italy vs. 11.9% in China) was considered the main determinant of the increased morbidity and mortality. However, the data was derived from the early phase of the pandemic, and trends may change in the future.
