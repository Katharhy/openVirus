<p>Large case series from China including 72,314 patients with COVID-19 have indicated that the clinical severity was mild (no or mild pneumonia) in 81%, severe (dyspnea, respiratory frequency ≥30/min, blood oxygen saturation ≤93%, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio &lt;300, and/or lung infiltrates &gt;50% within 24 to 48 h) in 14%, critical (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure) in 5% of the population [
