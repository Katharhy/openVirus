<p id="p0040">We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry (CENTRAL), Chinese Clinical Trials Registry and MedRxiv (for preprints) according to the search strategy detailed in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">TableÂ 1</xref> . Bibliographies of eligible articles were also searched. The date of the last search was 30th April 2020. Two authors searched and selected abstracts independently, and all authors identified studies for full-text review by consensus. The following data items were extracted from each included study: study design and location, viral infection and diagnostic criteria, participant demographics, intervention and control groups (if any), drug doses, primary and secondary outcomes, and adverse events attributable to therapy. A meta-analysis was planned if any clinical trials were comparable in terms of participants, interventions, comparators and outcomes. Risk of bias for all randomized controlled studies, regardless of whether published or deposited as preprints, were assessed according to Cochrane guidelines [

 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. All other study designs were considered to have an inherent high risk of bias. Certainty of evidence was assessed for each infection (only from randomized controlled trials, RCTs) according to the GRADE recommendations [
