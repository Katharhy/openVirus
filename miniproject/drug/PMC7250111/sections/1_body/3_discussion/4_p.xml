<p id="p0125">The role of CQ in COVID-19 is also unclear and not supported by evidence at the moment. One small RCT reported no benefit of CQ in terms of achieving negative viraemia by day 14 compared to treatment with lopinavir and ritonavir [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The authors report faster radiological improvement and reduced hospital stay with CQ, but on average the CQ group received treatment at an earlier stage of the illness than the comparator group. This plus the small sample size make interpretation of the results difficult. The other RCT did not have a no-CQ control group, which is rather surprising. Instead of proving the efficacy of CQ, the authors investigated whether a higher dose of CQ was safe in patients with severe infection. Notably this CQ dose (1200 mg/d for 10Â days) was much higher than that used for cure of malaria which is the standard indication for CQ. Mortality was significantly higher in the high-dose CQ group, and patient recruitment was halted prematurely. Thus, this trial also doesn't help to confirm whether CQ is beneficial for COVID-19.
