<p id="p0010">With the advent of the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19), repurposing cheap and accessible drugs for off-label use as antivirals if they have demonstrated antiviral properties 
 <italic>inÂ vitro</italic> or in animal studies is gaining popularity. Chloroquine (CQ), a well-established antimalarial agent, and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a similarly established disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD), have both received increased attention in recent days for their purported efficacy as antiviral agents in the context of COVID-19. Both drugs are out-of-patent, cheap, and widely available in high-, middle- and low-income countries.
