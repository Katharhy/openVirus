<p id="p0045">A total of 2267 abstract results were found from all databases after removing duplicates (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). The majority of these (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2026) were published after 1990. After removing retrospective studies, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and animal studies, reviews, letters, opinion papers and editorials, only 209 abstracts remained. Further examination identified 26 articles for full-text review, revealing a significant disparity with the large number of articles demonstrating 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence for antiviral effects of HCQ and CQ. Only 19 publications (including two preprints) from this subset met the inclusion criteria. One full-text paper was in Mandarin but had an English abstract. The studies included randomized and non-randomized controlled trials and uncontrolled prospective studies equivalent to case series. These had tested the efficacy of CQ and HCQ in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), dengue, chikungunya, hepatitis C and COVID-19 infections. A meta-analysis was not performed due to unavailability of similar studies. A summary of risk of bias for all controlled clinical trials are given in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> . The results are discussed separately for each infection and under each section; randomized clinical trials are discussed first, followed by other study designs. Chronic infections (HIV/HCV) are discussed first as the aim of treatment is viral load suppression rather than cure. Details of study design and setting, participants, interventions, comparators, outcomes and risk of bias for each included study are given in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> . There are 23 trials still in progression, all examining the role of HCQ and CQ in COVID-19 infection (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> ).
