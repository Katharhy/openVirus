<p id="p0065">Use of CQ or HCQ for HCV infection has been evaluated in two RCTs, one a single-blinded study (
 <italic>n</italic> = 120, HCV genotype 4) and another a double-blinded study (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10, HCV genotype 1) [

 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>]. The first trial used HCQ 400 mg/d for 12 weeks added to interferon (IFN) and ribavirin therapy, while the control group received IFN and ribavirin only. HCQ was well tolerated and a significantly higher rate of early virological response was noted in the HCQ group (p 0.011). The other trial used CQ 150 mg base/d versus placebo in patients who had already failed IFN and ribavirin therapy, and noted a significant drop in viral RNA levels following 8 weeks of therapy (p 0.04), but this effect was transient.
