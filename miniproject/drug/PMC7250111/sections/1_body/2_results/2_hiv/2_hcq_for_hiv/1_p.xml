<p id="p0055">Enrolments in these RCTs varied from 40 patients [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] to 83 patients [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Two RCTs enrolled adults with a CD4 cell count &gt;200/μL [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and the other enrolled adults with a CD4 cell count &gt;400/μL [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. HCQ doses used ranged from 400 mg/d to 800 mg/d and comparators included placebo [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] or zidovudine [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Two RCTs reported a significant decrease in viral load with no change in absolute CD4 cell count with HCQ [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], while the third RCT [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] recorded a significant increase in viral load and a decrease in the CD4 cell count with HCQ. The two uncontrolled studies were small (
 <italic>n</italic> = 20–22) and used HCQ 400 mg/d alone [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] or in combination with hydroxyurea plus didanosine [
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. There was a modest reduction in viral load after 48 weeks with combination therapy [
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], while markers of HIV immune activation were reduced with HCQ in the other study after 6 months of treatment [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], suggesting an immunomodulatory role of HCQ. HCQ was well tolerated in all studies.
