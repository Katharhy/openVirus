<p id="p0100">Results of two more RCTs from China on using HCQ in COVID-19 are available as preprints [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The largest was a multicentre open-label clinical trial (ChiCTR2000029868) that enrolled 150 virologically confirmed COVID-19 patients (75 per group) to receive HCQ plus standard care (as defined by Chinese guidelines for COVID-19 management) or standard care only [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The HCQ group received 200 mg/d for 3 days followed by 800 mg/d for 14–21 days. Only two patients (one in each group) had severe illness. There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of aviraemic patients by day 28 (85.4% in the HCQ group versus 81.3% in the control group, p &gt; 0.05). There was also no difference in time to aviraemia or symptom resolution by day 28. Many secondary outcomes proposed in methods—including all-cause mortality—are not reported in results, presumably due to lack of events. The second study (ChiCTR2000029559) enrolled and randomized 62 virologically confirmed COVID-19 patients with evidence of pneumonia on CT scan to receive HCQ (400 mg/d for 5 days) or no HCQ treatment (31 in each group). The respiratory distress was not severe (PaO

 <sub>2</sub> &gt;300 or SaO
 <sub>2</sub>/SPO

The authors report faster time to clinical recovery (defined as normalization of body temperature and cough relief maintained for 72 h) and earlier radiological improvement in the HCQ group, but the calculations and radiological reporting standards for these conclusions are unclear. Four patients in the control group versus none in the HCQ group progressed to severe illness.
