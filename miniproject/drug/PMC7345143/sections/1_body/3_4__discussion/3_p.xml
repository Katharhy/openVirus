<p>Secondly, Blacks/AA are less likely to be screened due to implicit bias [

 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-17-04322" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Clearly, the dynamics of viral pathogens reflects the penetrance in populations with compromised immune systems, driven by structural poverty and food insecurity, which Blacks/AA are more predisposed to compare to Whites. With non-restricted conditions and the relaxation of clinical guidelines in infectious disease diagnosis during the pandemics, more cases are identified, isolated and contact tracing is performed for more screening. This effort lowers the transmission and the spread of the virus, enhances case detection, improves the prognosis and reduces case fatality at a population and individual levels. Such initiative will reduce the unequal burden of morbidity and mortality now and in future pandemics.
