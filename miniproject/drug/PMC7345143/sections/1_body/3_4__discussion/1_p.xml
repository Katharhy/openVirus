<p>With the current COVID-19 pandemic, and the USA with the highest confirmed cases and mortality globally as well as the disproportionately observed mortality in some subpopulations, there remains an urgent need to examine these data, provide a possible explanation to the observed racial disparities and propose feasible recommendations in racial gap narrowing in COVID-19 mortality. Aggregate data were utilized from the various state departments of health, where demographic information was available to determine the racial variances in the confirmed cases and mortality as well as risk differentials, comparing the Whites to the Black/AA subpopulation deaths. This preliminary study provides a few relevant findings to epidemic curve flattening and case fatality mitigation in the communities of color, namely Blacks/AA. First, of the limited data on race examined in the selected states and cities with race information, Blacks/AA despite the population size of 13% in the US, represented 34% of all deaths in the referenced states and cities. Secondly, there was a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 mortality among Blacks/AA. Thirdly, the case fatality was higher among Blacks/AA relative to Whites. Fourthly, Blacks/AA relative to Whites in all states and cities assessed for COVID-19 mortality had a higher risk of dying, implying excess mortality.</p>
