<p>This study has demonstrated that, despite the 13% population of Blacks/AA in the US, this population represented an estimated 34% of all deaths from COVID-19 in mid-April 2020. The observed population variance and the highest mortality among Blacks/AA had been observed in recent media reporting [

The spread of pathogenic microbes such as viruses historically and to date has been linked to social inequity, where the socially disadvantaged populations convey the highest burden of the disease, including poor prognosis and mortality. The flu or influenza pandemic of the 1918 through 1919 in the US observed a lower cumulative incidence of the disease among Blacks but higher mortality relative to Whites [

The current COVID-19 case confirmation among Blacks/AA mirrors the observed lower cases or morbidity among Blacks, due to decreased effort by the US public health system, local and county health departments and the healthcare institutions to provide the assistance needed such as transportation for Blacks/AA to access the screening centers and sites.
