A recent review of race and 1918 influenza pandemic in the USA observed lower transmission (13% vs. 25%) among Blacks but higher case fatality (1–2% vs. 2–3%) relative to Whites [

The current COVID-19 global pandemic, caused by SARS-COV2, a ribonucleic acid (RNA) single-stranded enveloped pathogenic microbe remains very virulent, with the potential to be transmitted by asymptomatic individuals or carriers. While population density increases the risk of COVID-19 as observed in New York City, Detroit and Los Angeles, race as a socio-demographic factor may play a role in transmission as well as mortality and higher case fatality among Blacks/AA compared to their White counterparts. Moreover, relevant to increased or differential exposure to SARS-COV2 is low-income households, as reflected in Blacks/AA residing in apartment complexes and crowded neighborhoods in the US. The higher case fatality among Blacks/AA reflects the poorer health outcomes as observed in Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs), hypertension, malignant neoplasm, diabetes, asthma, bronchopulmonary diseases, such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and immunologic disorders [
