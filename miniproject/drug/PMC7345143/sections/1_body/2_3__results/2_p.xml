<p>The cumulative Incidence (CmI) of COVID-19 mortality by race in selective US States and regions is illustrated in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-04322-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The cumulative Incidence of COVID-19 mortality in selected states and regions or cities with data on race reflects a relative increase in mortality of Blacks/AA with respect to population size, and Whites. These states were IL, LU, MI, NY, NC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-04322-f001">Figure 1</xref>A) and WI (Milwaukee County). While Blacks/AA represent 13% of the population of the US as per US Census projection (2020), overall mortality was 34% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 19,062), with a 21% excess cumulative incidence of dying as per the 04/09/20 data with a total death of 5700. In the limited data on mortality by race, while Blacks represent 6% of the CA population size, the mortality data indicated 8% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 21). With the population size of Blacks/AA in LA county (8%), excess mortality was observed by the reported 16 deaths, (17%). Similarly, whereas Blacks/AA represent 16% of the FL population, the mortality from the limited data, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 318 (race/ethnicity data not available, 354â€“318) was 20% among Blacks, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 63.
