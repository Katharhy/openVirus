<p id="p0155">Clinicians, scientists, patients, and their families must be cautious about interpretation and application of early results. The rapid evolution of COVID-19 knowledge combined with amplification by the lay press has resulted in several misinterpretations and high-profile study retractions. Clinical trials of therapeutic, prophylactic, and preventive interventions are underway, and therapeutic development is being expedited by unprecedented collaboration and removal of unnecessary barriers in the scientific process. The actions of the scientific community in combating the COVID-19 pandemic provide hope that after the current global health crisis, the acceleration of preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic discoveries will become the “new normal” for science. This approach might be replicated for a wide variety of complex diseases in need of effective treatments and cures such as cancer, obesity, Alzheimer disease, diabetes, or opioid and alcohol addiction. The COVID-19 pandemic is a formidable health care challenge, but also an opportunity to foster the collaboration of multiple stakeholders; utilization of technologies for big data management, storage, and sharing; and the rapid and continuous knowledge integration necessary to accelerate the bench-to-bedside process. In the long run, as a public health emergency of international concern, COVID-19 provides the necessary lessons for developing rapid learning health care systems that can help expedite the discovery of novel therapeutics and their efficient introduction into practice.</p>
