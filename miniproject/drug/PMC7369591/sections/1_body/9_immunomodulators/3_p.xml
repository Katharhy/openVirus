<p id="p0095">Publication of in vitro experiments establishing the JAK inhibitor baricitinib’s ability to reduce viral load in human primary liver spheroids and a 4-patient case series exhibiting improvement in signs and symptoms including cough, fever, IL-6 level, and viral load seem to validate its identification as a potential therapeutic for COVID-19.

 </xref> Addition of baricitinib to LPV/RTV therapy in 12 Italian patients resulted in improvements in clinical and respiratory parameters in the following 2 weeks.

 </xref> In a 41-patient, multicenter, single-blind, randomized trial of a different JAK inhibitor, ruxolitinib, patients receiving ruxolitinib had numerically faster, but not statistically significant (

 </xref> However, a retrospective study of 14 patients in Germany with progressive hyperinflammation due to COVID-19 reported a 58% decline in inflammation scores 7 days after treatment with ruxolitinib (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;.01) and 76% of patients had clinical improvement on the WHO ordinal scale.
