<p id="p0090">A study of 21 patients in China receiving tocilizumab in addition to standard of care found clinical improvements including fever resolution and improved oxygen saturation within 24 hours of treatment.

 </xref> patients receiving tocilizumab plus LPV/RTV or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) compared with LPV/RTV or HCQ alone, respectively, found that 25% of patients receiving tocilizumab experienced death and/or ICU admission and a hazard ratio for death of 0.035 (95% confidence interval, 0.004 to 0.347; P=.004). In a retrospective study of 100 consecutive patients receiving tocilizumab in Italy, 77% of patientsâ€™ conditions stabilized or improved while in 23% their condition worsened.

 </xref> A prospective, open, single-arm, multicenter study of 63 patients receiving tocilizumab reported improvement in respiratory and laboratory parameters. In this same study, administration of tocilizumab within 6 days of admission was associated with an increased likelihood of survival (hazard ratio, 2.2, 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 6.7; P&lt;.05).

 </xref> Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of 78 patients receiving tocilizumab suggested that IL-6 levels in patients with hyperglycemia persisted at levels 5-fold higher than those in patients with normoglycemia and that treatment failed to attenuate the risk of severe outcomes in these patients.
