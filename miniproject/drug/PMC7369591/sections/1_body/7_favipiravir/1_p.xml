 </xref> In the before-after study, 91.43% of the 35 patients receiving favipiravir exhibited improvement in chest imaging and had a median time of viral clearance of 4 days compared with 62.2% (P=.004) of the 45 patients receiving LPV/RTV exhibiting improvement in chest imaging and a median of 11 days for viral clearance (P&lt;.001). The randomized multicenter trial reported a 7-day clinical recovery rate (&gt;72 hours normalization of temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and cough) of 71.43% and 55.86% (P=.0199) for patients with mild or moderate disease treated with favipiravir or arbidol, respectively, but no difference in critically ill patients or those with hypertension and/or diabetes (P=.4712 and P=.7704).
