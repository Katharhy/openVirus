<p id="p0130">The development of novel drugs and vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2 is a fundamental step in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. A detailed review of these efforts is beyond the scope of this work, but it is important to highlight that dozens of small molecule, biologic, and RNA-based therapies are being actively developed for the treatment of COVID-19 (reviewed in reference

On June 1, 2020, a first of its class targeted COVID-19 therapy, LY-CoV555, a monoclonal antibody targeting SARS-CoV-2, began clinical evaluation in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase I clinical trial assessing its safety and tolerability in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
