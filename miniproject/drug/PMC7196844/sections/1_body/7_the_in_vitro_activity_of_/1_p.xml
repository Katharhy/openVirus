<p>The first data on inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by various substances in cell culture were published online on 4 February 2020 (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). Seven different pharmaceuticals were investigated in Vero-E6 cells, a renal cell line from primates. The concentration that evoked a half-maximal response (EC50) varied between &lt;1 µM and &gt;100 µM. As shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>, the nucleoside analog penciclovir had a relatively weak effect (EC50: 96 µM). Favipiravir, licensed for the treatment of influenza in Japan, exhibited moderate activity, as did nafamostat. A striking finding was the relatively high in vitro activity of nitazoxanide, a drug that was developed mainly for the treatment of protozoal infections but also acts against some bacteria and viruses. The highest activity under the experimental conditions described in this publication was displayed by remdesivir, with an EC50 of 0.77 µM and an EC90 of 1.76 µM (1 µM = 0.6 mg/L) (
