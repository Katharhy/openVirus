<p>A detailed report of the treatment of a 35-year-old man with COVID-19 in the USA was published on 5 March 2020 (
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). This was the first instance of treatment with the as yet unlicensed nucleoside analog remdesivir. The otherwise healthy patient first a cough and fever, followed by vomiting and diarrhea. Four days after onset of the symptoms he was admitted to the hospital. The initial treatment was unspecific, with antipyretics such as ibuprofen and paracetamol. Chest radiography then indicated pneumonia, upon which the antibiotics vancomycin and cefepime were given. They were discontinued a day later, however, because the suspicion of bacterial pneumonia was not confirmed. Remdesivir was infused on the evening of day 11. The patient was no longer febrile the next day and could be discharged a few days later. Whether the recovery was effected by remdesivir or occurred spontaneously is unknown. Efficacy can be determined only in randomized controlled clinical trials. Large clinical studies of remdesivir were initiated in February 2020, and the first results can be expected in a few weeks.
