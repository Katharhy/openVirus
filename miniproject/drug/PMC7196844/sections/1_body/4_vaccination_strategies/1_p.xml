<p>Although vaccination strategies were developed in the context of previous epidemics, such as SARS and MERS, no vaccine for coronavirus infections is yet available. Potential vaccines are directed against the viral proteins. The spike (S) protein is of particular interest as a possible antigen for vaccination, because of its crucial role in viral dissemination. Different types of vaccines can be distinguished: For instance, they can contain inactivated viruses, which induce neutralizing antibodies. A plausible alternative is administration of RNA- or DNA-based vaccines, with nucleic acids coding for the S protein. In these cases, the human organism produces the protein by which an immune response is induced. Subunit vaccines contain the S protein or another viral protein, without carrier virus. However, the immunogenicity is relatively low, so an adjuvant is needed. Vector-based vaccines comprise a protein, e.g., the S protein, that is coupled to non-replicating carrier virus particles. This concept was pursued in the development of a vaccine for MERS, but no finished vaccine for this coronavirus infection ever became available. In any case, it will take some time until we have a vaccine for COVID-19. It goes without saying that the safety of a vaccine is extremely important (
