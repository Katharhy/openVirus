<p>According to preliminary reports, the antimalarial drug chloroquine prevents the terminal glycosylation of ACE2. Moreover, chloroquine—or its derivative hydroxychloroquine—increases the pH in the endosomes involved in the uptake of the virus into the cells. In cell cultures, the replication of SARS-CoV-2 was inhibited at a chloroquine concentration (EC50 = concentration with half-maximal effect) of 1.13 µM (
