<p id="Par112">The potent immunomodulatory capacity of MSCs renders it a promising option as a novel treatment method for COVID-19. Although there are currently 43 proposed or ongoing clinical trials employing stem cell therapy against Sars-Cov-2 infection, there are no approved MSC-based treatments or therapies. Preliminary results from the US and China demonstrate improved immune function without adverse events in COVID-19 patients treated with MSCs [

The similarities in systemic multi-organ complications between H7N9 and Sars-Cov-2 infections, along with direct evidence of the benefits of MSCs transplantation for COVID-19, further supports the potential of stem cells as an effective treatment [
