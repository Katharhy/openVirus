<p id="Par104">As noted above, plasma therapy involves the use of convalescent plasma to transfer antibodies and boost the patientâ€™s anti-inflammatory response against COVID-19 [

With the advancements in purification technology over the past several decades, human immunoglobulin for intravenous use have been used as the second line of passive immunotherapies against these diseases using manufactured plasma-derived immunoglobulins (IG) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>]. In addition to immunoglobulins, the blood contains a heterogeneous population of cells, one of which are stem cells, that may confer therapeutic benefits. If the stem cells stand as active components rendering the therapeutic inflammatory response in convalescent plasma, then isolating these stem cells, as opposed to the whole plasma treatment, may afford equally or more robust functional outcomes in COVID-19 patients.
