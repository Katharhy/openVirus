<p id="Par111">The envisioned MSC therapy for COVID-19 entails a minimally invasive approach. MSCs injected intravenously (IV) display the propensity to migrate to the lungs making IV administration favorable to treat pulmonary diseases [

These relevant findings from other disease indications highlight the many modes of delivery for stem cell therapy for COVID-19, which must be taken into consideration in future clinical trials. Furthermore, because inflammation is an evolving, progressive, and chronic pathology, prolonged treatment through repeated administration of MSCs may be necessary for COVID-19 patients. In this case, less invasive methods like IV injection or intranasal administration are favorable.
