<p id="Par90">Most of the COVID-19 vaccines that are being developed are in North America, while there is also development activity in China, other parts of Asia, Australia, and Europe. The global vaccine effort has been exceptional in terms of scale and speed. Projects indicate a vaccine may be available as soon as early 2021. This would be a massive change from traditional vaccine development which takes on average over 10 years. Even the accelerated development of the Ebola vaccine took 5 years [

Some researchers argue the best approach is targeting the full-length protein, while others believe that targeting only the receptor-binding domain is more efficient [

Researchers are also worried about exacerbating lung diseases as a result of antibody-dependent enhancement as seen previously with SARS and MERS vaccine candidates. This effect may be associated with a type 2 helper T-cell response. This is why it is critical to test all vaccines with a proper animal model and to safely monitor all clinical trials [

Adjuvants triggering a Th1 response and showing a high neutralizing antibody response are more suited to be protective (NCT04368988). Although we can infer the duration of protection received from a vaccine by looking at vaccine experience with SARS and MERS, we do not know the duration of protection from a COVID-19 vaccine. More research is required to find the duration of immunity as well if vaccines will be potent in single or multiple doses [

Moderna’s mRNA-based candidate entered clinical trials only 10 short weeks after the sequence was published. Since then many other developers have begun the clinical trial phase (NCT04283461). Some candidates have even begun to manufacture additional materials for clinical trials in phase 2 studies. After phase 2, commercial manufacturing will take place. Facilities capable of producing large quantities of product will need to be identified, proper technology will need to be transferred, and manufacturing processes will need to be adapted. All of the research and development procedures need to be performed without knowing the clinical efficacy of the vaccine candidate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. In situations like this COVID-19 outbreak, it is inefficient to conduct randomized and controlled trials with placebo groups. Although this approach is feasible, it is not nearly as fast, and results are often harder to interpret [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. A possible method moving forward could be to test several different vaccines simultaneously in a trial designed using one shared control group. This allows more participants to receive an active vaccine. This method is advantageous in terms of the number of participants receiving the vaccine and the speed of the trial, however, developers often avoid trials that generate comparative data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Currently, most of the leading vaccine developments are still in phase I of clinical trials. Further data and investigation on these possible vaccines are necessary to assess the efficacy of these vaccines. If any of these vaccines prove to be viable in their later phases, developers will be able to manufacture vaccines as early as the start of next year.
