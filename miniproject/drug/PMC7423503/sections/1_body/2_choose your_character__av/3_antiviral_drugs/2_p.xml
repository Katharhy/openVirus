<p id="Par92">There is currently no proven effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19. However, many antiviral treatments have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of COVID-19 including lopinavir and ritonavir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine that may help to alleviate symptoms in patients. With over 300 clinical trials currently testing various antiviral drugs, treatment has focused on the uses of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, remdesivir, and oseltamivir. The focus has been primarily on repurposing the available therapeutic drugs to treat patients with the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are antiviral drugs that possess similar chemical structures and have been commonly used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and malaria [

Chloroquine can inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV-2 and prevent virus-host cell fusion by interfering with glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor and its binding with SP. This suggests the potential use of chloroquine in the early stages of infection before the virus can reduce ACE2 expression and activity [

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for emergency treatment of COVID-19 and has the potential to decrease symptoms and progression of the disease. However, both drugs have been associated with cardiac risks in patients and more evidence is required to determine the safety and effectiveness of these medications in treating COVID-19.
