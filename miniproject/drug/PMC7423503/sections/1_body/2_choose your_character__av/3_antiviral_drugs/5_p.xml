 <italic>In vitro</italic> testing has developed to demonstrate remdesivir activity against SARS-Cov-2 and demonstrates clinical improvement. In animal experiments, the drug has proven to reduce viral load in lung tissue of mice with MERS-CoV, improve lung function, and alleviate the lung damage. Additionally, Remdesivir yields promising results for COVID-19 patients in recovering from pneumonia. In a study of patients using the drug in the United States, 70% of patients had improvement in regards to oxygen requirements and were extubated from mechanical ventilation [
