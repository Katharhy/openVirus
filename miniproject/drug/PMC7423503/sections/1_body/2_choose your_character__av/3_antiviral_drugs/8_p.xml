<p id="Par98">With over 300 clinical trials targeting various antiviral medications for the treatment of COVID-19, there are still no final verified antivirals specific to COVID-19. Further testing is still needed to explore the efficacy and safety of these antiviral drugs. Research regarding SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated the potential of repurposing drugs with appropriate pharmacological effects and therapeutic efficiencies in the treatment of COVID-19 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. The antiviral drugs being explored including hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, and lopinavir and ritonavir may be able to limit the spread of the virus and reduce morbidity and mortality caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since a vaccine is still not available, more research is required to approve antiviral drugs against SARS-Cov-2. From recent clinical trials, the antiviral drugs remdesivir, favipivir, and lopinavir and ritonavir can be administered for the treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and to lower the mortality rate of the disease [

To this end, antiviral treatment of COVID-19 is promising, with several potential drug candidates that demonstrate the capacity to perturb the growth and development by interfering with SP and ACE2. Azithromycin targets SP directly, preventing viral uptake, while hydroxychloroquine interferes with ACE2 terminal glycosylation, thus weakening SP-ACE2 binding [
