<p id="Par91">In response to the influenza virus, the Global Influenza Surveillance Network was established in 1947 and is responsible for the continuous monitoring of antiviral drugs for clinical treatment [

Two antiviral compounds, M2 ion channel blockers (adamantanes) and NA inhibitors are the current options available to combat infection and counteract the spread of viruses. Adamantanes are commonly used to inhibit IAV virus replication and block entry and NA inhibitors block the release of virions after budding from the host cell. However, the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viral strains has placed limitations on the use of NA inhibitors and M2 blockers [

The antiviral medication Amantadine is no longer recommended due to the increase in resistance to H1N1 and H3N2 and it only inhibits influenza A. Oseltamivir is continuously used, but the recent development of new target-oriented drugs such as zanamivir, favipiravir, baloxavir, and pimodivir sheds new light on the treatment for influenza.
