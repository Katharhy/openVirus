An equally essential hygiene protocol requires cleaning and disinfecting any surface that is touched daily like a phone or a light switch. Additionally, mask-wearing has been recommended by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) to block pathogens from entering the respiratory tract. It is recommended to wear a mask whenever in public and in direct contact with other individuals regardless of whether they are ill or not. Stronger masks such as N95 masks can block 91% of pathogens [

While wearing a mask has been recommended by health officials, the need for better equipment to avoid the spread of the virus intranasally may require innovations in the use of air purifiers and nasal protective devices. Finally, it is critical to monitor oneâ€™s health and be alert for any possible symptoms of COVID-19. For those experiencing the symptoms of COVID-19, urgent medical care is highly recommended. If the COVID-19 test comes back positive, the CDC recommends staying at home except to receive medical care. It is essential to stay away from others while ill and to disinfect any surfaces that come into contact with the patient. The best methods to stay proactive about COVID-19 are to maintain good hygiene and follow the CDC behavioral guidelines. Washing hands frequently, remembering to wear a face mask in public areas, and practicing social distancing guidelines are all efficient ways to protect from COVID-19.
