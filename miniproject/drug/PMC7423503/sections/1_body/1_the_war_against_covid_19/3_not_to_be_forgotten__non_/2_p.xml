<p id="Par69">Cardiac involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection is prevalent among patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. As noted above, the acute disease progression begins by infiltrating the lungs via SP-ACE2 interaction and is then followed by collateral tissue injury and inflammation. Along with inflammation arises vasodilation, endothelial permeability and, leukocyte recruitment, which contribute to the exacerbation of pulmonary injury, hypoxemia, and cardiovascular distress [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Severe patients present with systemic inflammation which has the propensity to damage the heart without direct viral infection of the tissue [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Direct SARS-CoV-2 infection, hypoxemia, and respiratory failure all also contribute to myocardial injury seen amongst patients. Out of these 3 factors, it remains unclear which is the main contributor to myocardial complications. Cell populations in the heart most vulnerable to infection may be distinguished by expression of ACE2. For instance, myocardial pericytes express ACE2, and infection or disruption caused by inflammation may lead to ischemic injury and disruption of the microvasculature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Biomarkers troponin I and Brain-type natriuretic peptide were both present at augmented levels in severely ill patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Blood pressure elevation and arrhythmias are common symptoms in patients however this may be due indirectly by systemic inflammation. Acute coronary syndromes are present with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The risk of this instance is significantly increased when an underlying disease is present creating a systemic prothrombotic state [
