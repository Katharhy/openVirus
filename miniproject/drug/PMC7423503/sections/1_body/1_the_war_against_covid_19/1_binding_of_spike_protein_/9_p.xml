<p id="Par53">The critical interaction of SP and ACE2 as the gatekeeper of SARS-Cov-2 entry into host cells can be confirmed and exploited using human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2). ACE2 is a transmembrane protein and is not present endogenously in a soluble form; therefore, SP always binds to cell-surface ACE2. However, the administration of hrsACE2 introduces soluble ACE2 into the circulation that can complex with free SARS-Cov-2, thus blocking its ability to bind to cell-associated ACE2 [
