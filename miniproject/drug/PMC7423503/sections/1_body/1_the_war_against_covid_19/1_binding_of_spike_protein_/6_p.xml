<p id="Par50">After binding and proteolytic processing, the final step for infection is the viral entry into the host cell. It is not entirely clear how SARS-Cov-2 enters the cell, as there is evidence for both fusion and endocytosis. In a fusion-based entry model, SARS-Cov-2 fuses its envelope with the plasma membrane of the host cell and empties its genetic contents into the cytosol, where it hijacks the host machinery to replicate its genes and produce more virus. In the endocytosis model, SP interacts with ACE2 to cause a pH-dependent internalization of the virus-receptor complex [

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis involves the formation of vesicles coated by the protein clathrin that form following internal budding of the plasma membrane. Caveolar endocytosis occurs when oligomerized caveolin membrane form scaffolds that invaginate into endocytic vesicles. The precise type of endocytosis that results in the internalization of SARS-Cov-2 is unknown but does not involve these two mechanisms.
