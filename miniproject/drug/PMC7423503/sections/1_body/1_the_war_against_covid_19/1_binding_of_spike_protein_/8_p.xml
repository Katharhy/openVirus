<p id="Par52">SP is integral for SARS-Cov-2 to recognize and internalize into cells. Viral binding and fusion with host cells are obliterated in the absence of SP expression. After uptake, the virus uses host cell ribosomes to replicate; however, the cell will eventually undergo apoptosis or immune system-mediated destruction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Therefore, SARS-Cov-2 must continuously infect new cells using SP-mediated uptake mechanisms. SP is also crucial for SARS-Cov-2 to infect other tissues beyond the original site in the respiratory tract. The virus travels to other organs through the bloodstream and, upon SP binding, fuses with ACE2-expressing organs to establish secondary sites of infection. Thus, SP and ACE2 must co-exist for the virus to propagate its growth and remain contagious.
