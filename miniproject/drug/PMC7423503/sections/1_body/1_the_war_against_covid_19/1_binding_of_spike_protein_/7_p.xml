<p id="Par51">The SP gene of SARS-Cov-2 determines its affinity for ACE2, in contrast to the SPs of related coronaviruses with slightly different sequences that favor binding to other targets. Each cycle of viral replication within the host cell produces additional copies of the viral RNA genome, including the regions that encode this specific SP variant. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) recognizes the SP of SARS-Cov-2 and measures total viral load. This technique utilizes a primer that binds to regions of the SARS-Cov-2 RNA genome, including the SP region, and amplifies the amount of virus present such that the fewer cycles it takes to reach a threshold value indicates a higher initial concentration of SARS-Cov-2. SP expression and viral load are highest at the onset of infection and lowest during recovery [
