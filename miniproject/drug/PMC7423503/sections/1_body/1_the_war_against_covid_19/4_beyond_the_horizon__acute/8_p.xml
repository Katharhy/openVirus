<p id="Par80">Although the exact mechanism mediating the chronic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently unknown, the interaction of SP and ACE2 contributes significantly.

Therefore, the serious long-term repercussions of COVID-19 should be closely monitored in infected patients with high SP and ACE2 expression.</p>
