<p id="Par78">Along with ischemic stroke, other acute cerebrovascular diseases in the clinical setting of COVID-19 have been explored. In Wuhan, 36% of 214 COVID-19 patients suffered from neurological complications, and 6% of the patients developed acute cerebrovascular disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. COVID-19 may injure the neurological system through direct impairment to particular receptors, secondary hypoxia, cytokine storm generation, and retrograde nervous transport [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Starting in the lung, the virus can retrogradely move across neuronal synapses to infiltrate the brainstem, demonstrating how COVID-19 has also caused brainstem-induced cardiovascular and pulmonary complications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. COVID-19 can spur glial cell activation and heightened inflammation in the CNS through the escalation of IL-6, IL-12, and IL-15, as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. The virus may also bind to the ACE2 receptors in endothelial cells along the blood-brain barrier, allowing the virus to infiltrate the central nervous system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Moreover, COVID-19 can potentially impair the blood-brain barrier, leading to acute necrotizing encephalopathy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. 20% of hospitalized patients developed hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy after the onset of COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Additionally, the pathology behind COVID-19-induced encephalitis can be linked to inflammation and edema [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. PCR has revealed the presence of COVID-19 in cerebrospinal fluid, which may also stimulate encephalitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. In some cases, COVID-19 has incited the development of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), where the body’s immune system attacks nerves, leading to flaccid paralysis. The virus has been associated with 5 GBS cases in Italy and 2 GBS cases in Wuhan [
