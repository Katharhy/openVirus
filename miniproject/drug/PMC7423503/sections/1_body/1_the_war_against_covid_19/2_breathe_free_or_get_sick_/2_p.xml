<p id="Par59">The lungs are the primary organ of the respiratory system and oversee numerous critical functions for survival and homeostasis, including acid-base balance and thermoregulation. They perform their primary role of gas exchange by drawing air into alveoli lined with pneumocytes. Oxygen diffuses across type 1 pneumocytes, which comprise 95% of the surface area of the alveoli. Type 2 pneumocytes are the most common cells in the alveoli, although they are small and do not constitute a large proportion of the total surface area. They secrete the pulmonary surfactant that prevents the alveoli from collapsing, and they can divide into type 1 or type 2 pneumocytes.</p>
