<p id="Par63">One of the highest concentrations of ACE2 in the body is in the lung tissue. The potent binding of SP to ACE2 and subsequent cellular infection may explain the prevalence of respiratory symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Transgenic mice expressing hACE2 in the lungs exhibit a very similar pathology in the lungs compared to human patients, including pneumonia and macrophage infiltration; however, these respiratory symptoms are absent in wild-type mice [
