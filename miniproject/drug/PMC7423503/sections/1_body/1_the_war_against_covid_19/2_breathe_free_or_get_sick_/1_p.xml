<p id="Par58">The lungs are the primary site of infection and nearly all patients with COVID-19 present with some form of respiratory impairment. The most common complaints upon hospitalization are cough and shortness of breath, with 69% and 66% of patients reporting these symptoms, respectively. SARS-Cov-2 spreads through person-to-person contact or via small droplets, measuring less than 10 µm in diameter, that enter the respiratory tract after inhalation [

It preferentially infects cells of the alveoli, although it can also infect cells of the upper respiratory tract. Viral infiltration of the lung parenchyma directly precipitates the onset of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Despite the crucial role the respiratory tract plays in the transmission of SARS-Cov-2, airborne transmission is not an appreciable route of spread.
