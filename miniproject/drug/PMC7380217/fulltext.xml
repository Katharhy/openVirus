Realizing the challenges as a result of this pandemic affecting the daily practice of the HCT centers and the recognition of the variability in practice worldwide, the Worldwide Network for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (WBMT) and the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research's (CIBMTR) Health Services and International Studies Committee have jointly produced an expert opinion statement as a general guide to deal with certain aspects of HCT, including diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 in HCT recipient, pre- and post-HCT management, donor issues, medical tourism, and facilities management. During these crucial times, which may last for months or years, the HCT community must reorganize to proceed with transplantation activity in those patients who urgently require it, albeit with extreme caution. This shared knowledge may be of value to the HCT community in the absence of high-quality evidence-based medicine.</p><p>&#x000a9; 2020 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.

The issues arising from these epidemics were relatively geographically limited compared with the current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2. By July 19, 2020, more that 13 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported worldwide <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Numerous aspects of the virus remain unknown, including the immune response and natural course of the disease, the exact incubation period, and the rate of spread among asymptomatic people, among other factors. These uncertainties make it particularly challenging to study the pattern of possible spread and create efficient management and prevention strategies. It is also difficult to predict the disease severity of COVID-19 in HCT recipients. Thus far, limited data have been published on disease severity, clinical course, and duration of infectivity of COVID-19 in HCT recipients [<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Importantly, HCT remains the standard of care and the sole potential curative therapy for many hematologic malignancies, genetic diseases, hemoglobinopathies, autoimmune diseases, and immunodeficiencies [<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The transplantation community is facing many challenges concerning the day-to-day practice of HCT, with disruptions in the entire process of referrals for evaluation, scheduling, admission, chemotherapy/radiation administration, donor procurement, and discharge planning, among other aspects (<xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>
).<fig id="fig0001"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>General principles for management of HCT patients during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.</p></caption><alt-text id="alt0001">Figure 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1_lrg"/></fig></p><p id="para0003">SARS-CoV-2 is a highly communicable virus that incites a variable immune response, resulting in uncertainties about protective as well as deleterious immune responses to the virus. Although the majority of infected individuals clear the virus without major complications, in a minority of the patients, the infection leads to a life-threatening clinical situation involving any organ (especially the lungs), diffuse intravascular thrombosis, and ultimately acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure, which has a complex pathology and mechanism <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p id="para0004">Whether the incidence of the severe syndrome of COVID-19 infection is diminished or enhanced in patients post-HCT relative to the general population or other cancer populations, and what risk factors are predictive of lower respiratory infection and infection severity, are unclear at present. In addition, many donor issues have arisen as a consequence of global lockdown, travel restrictions, and quarantine procedures in various countries. Finally, many drugs currently used in the HCT arena, such as Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, ibrutinib), ruxolitinib, tocilizumab, azithromycin, and mesenchymal stromal cells (all used to treat acute or chronic graft-versus-host-disease [GVHD]), are being studied in clinical trials to evaluate their efficacy (or lack thereof) for treating COVID-19 and/or its complications. Therefore, many practice issues regarding the use of these agents in HCT recipients are currently under debate.</p><p id="para0005">The Worldwide Network for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (WBMT) is a nonprofit organization for education, scientific inquiry, and philanthropy serving all aspects of HCT under the laws of Switzerland and as a nongovernmental organization (NGO) in an official relationship with the World Health Organization (WHO) since 2007. The WBMT serves philanthropic purposes concerning aspects of global HCT and represents 22 international societies working in the field and more than 1600 transplantation centers worldwide. The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) is a working group of &#x0003e;380 international transplantation centers (and a founding member of the WBMT) that collects detailed information on autologous and allogeneic HCT recipients as well as on recipients of cellular therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. The CIBMTR's Health Services and International Studies Committee deals with aspects related to HCT. The WBMT and CIBMTR experts and leadership acknowledge the challenges of the COVID-19 crisis that may differ in developing vs developed countries.</p><p id="para0006">While acknowledging all the aforementioned challenges and taking into account current recommendations and guidelines issued by the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy and the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) (both of which are WBMT members), here we aim to provide a consensus opinion from the WBMT, the CIBMTR's Health Services and International Studies Committee, and other HCT experts from multiple continents regarding the current worldwide threat to HCT recipients from the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For Recommendations regarding the management of patients being treated with CAR T cell therapy are presented in a recent publication on this topic <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec0002"><title>ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES</title><p id="para0007">Creating hospital-wide multidisciplinary COVID-19 teams (including specialists in infectious diseases, critical care medicine, pulmonary medicine, etc) is essential to facilitate the management of patients and make adjustments based on new information as it becomes available. Enabling telephone or video communication for multidisciplinary team&#x000a0;meetings is important for the coordinated care of patients. To facilitate reporting, some registries, including the CIBMTR and EBMT, are actively collecting information on HCT and other cellular therapy patients infected with COVID-19. HCT programs require adequate HCT staff resuming transplantations during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></sec><sec id="sec0003"><title>SUPPORTIVE CARE</title><p id="para0008">Continuing availability of blood products is a prerequisite for planning HCT, given that blood supply has been a major issue during the pandemic. The possibility of reducing the threshold for blood product transfusion should be discussed at the beginning of HCT. In addition, blood loss prevention strategies (eg, minimizing blood draws or treatment with tranexamic acid if clinically permissible) should be maximized <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The use of pediatric tubes and reassessment of scheduled laboratory work may be useful as well.</p><p id="para0009">Holistic management of patients remains as essential as ever, maybe more important than ever. Patients undergoing HCT should have regular visits with social support services, given the uncertainties around returning to work and associated healthcare costs, particularly those in a jurisdiction without universal healthcare, to minimize financial and social toxicity. It is appropriate to vigilantly monitor for the psychological effects of the current COVID-19 pandemic on HCT survivors and the staff taking care of them. At the same time, the risk of infection from these visits must be considered, including such factors as the time after HCT. Additional measures to ensure construction of well-rounded management plans include providing appropriate physiotherapy and nutritional guidance.</p><p id="para0010">Transplantation pharmacists should continuously monitor the potential drug toxicities and interactions of the medications given post-HCT via telehealth. In addition, the drug inventory should be evaluated at routine intervals for the essential drugs used for HCT patients. The use of any over-the-counter drugs or self-treatment with complementary and alternative medicine without discussion with the primary transplantation physician and the clinical pharmacist is not recommended. We refer the readers to the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy&#x02019;s pharmacy practice management guideline for COVID-19 patients <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec0004"><title>COVID-19: CLINICAL SPECTRUM AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTING</title><p id="para0011">Individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 can present with a variety of symptoms, including fever, rhinorrhea, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, diarrhea, and skin rash.</p><p id="para0012">Two kinds of tests are available for COVID-19: a viral test using PCR to detect the virus and an antibody-based test to detect the occurrence of previous infection (which can take 1 to 3 weeks after infection to become positive). Notably, PCR-based testing does not distinguish between live and dead SARS-CoV-2. For diagnosing COVID-19 infection in HCT recipients, testing with real-time RT-PCR ideally should be done on nasopharyngeal swabs; however, sputum samples and nasal swabs also can be used <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Each center needs to understand the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the specific test being used, which may be affected by the regional prevalence of the infection. Pitfalls in SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostics have been reported recently <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. At present, there is no known role for antibody-based (serologic) testing for SARS-CoV-2 for diagnostic purposes. Exposure (especially to contacts with COVID-19 patients) and symptom history, physical examination, and chest imaging are helpful in evaluating HCT recipients.</p><p id="para0013">In the event that the diagnosis is not clear, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage may be pursued in selected cases, albeit with extreme caution because this procedure also puts the pulmonologist at risk of acquiring the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specific symptoms/findings ascribed to SARS-CoV-2 infection including fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle/body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. The degree of symptoms may range from asymptomatic (eg, no fever) to mild to severe <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Laboratory tests, such as C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase levels, may help assess the severity of infection and optimally should be performed in every patient with confirmed COVID-19 [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Suspected patients with classic COVID-19 symptoms in an appropriate medical setting may be cohorted or isolated as soon as possible in special wards or units (temporary or permanent depending on the institutional policies and/or resources). Only when the RT-PCR test comes back negative should these patients be considered standard-risk HCT recipients and managed accordingly.

Coordination with the local and international authorities (especially with the border customs officials in certain countries) may be needed to ensure trouble-free transport of cell therapy products.

If conditioning duration/intensity has passed that point, then conditioning should be completed and the HCT product infused. If sufficient myeloablative conditioning has been delivered to a recipient and SARS-CoV-2 is confirmed, the transplantation process should continue owing to anticipated bone marrow aplasia.

Theoretically, the inflammatory cascade in ARDS <xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> (mediated in part by IL-6) may be enhanced by cytokines; however, at present there are no data to support G-CSF administration.

As general guidance, autologous HCT recipients beyond 6 months post-transplantation and allogeneic HCT recipients beyond 1-year post-transplantation without immunosuppression and GVHD may be treated according to general COVID-19 management guidelines. This has practical implications for vaccinations and COVID-19 treatment strategies.

During these crucial times, the HCT community must reorganize to proceed with transplantation in those who urgently need it and concurrently deal with the factors that accompany a pandemic, such as prevention of nosocomial transmission, protection of HCT staff, and treatment of COVID-19 in HCT recipients. The extreme changeability of the global geopolitical climate due to COVID-19 requires that HCT programs rethink their practices. We hope that this article provides general guidance to clinicians and institutional leadership to deal with the real-world scenarios.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebibl1"><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="bib0001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other" id="sbref0001">World Health Organization.
