<p id="para0022">In general, using peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) with cryopreservation and testing the quality of thawed product before the start of conditioning are strongly encouraged. The use of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide has increased significantly worldwide for both haploidentical and HLA-matched HCTs, and a recent study showed no detrimental effect of cryopreserved products on survival when using post-transplantation cyclophosphamide for GVHD prophylaxis in patients undergoing HCT for hematologic malignancies 
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Therefore, we consider this a reasonable strategy for HCT for hematologic malignancies; however, for bone marrow failure (especially for severe aplastic anemia), fresh bone marrow products remain the standard of care, as supported by a recent study
