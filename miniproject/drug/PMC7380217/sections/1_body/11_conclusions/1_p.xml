<p id="para0044">The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all aspects of HCT. We believe that our shared knowledge will be of value to the HCT community in the current absence of high-quality evidence-based medicine. This emergency situation may persist for months or even years until herd immunity is achieved, owing to the availability of an effective vaccine or as a result of natural infection. During these crucial times, the HCT community must reorganize to proceed with transplantation in those who urgently need it and concurrently deal with the factors that accompany a pandemic, such as prevention of nosocomial transmission, protection of HCT staff, and treatment of COVID-19 in HCT recipients. The extreme changeability of the global geopolitical climate due to COVID-19 requires that HCT programs rethink their practices. We hope that this article provides general guidance to clinicians and institutional leadership to deal with the real-world scenarios.</p>
