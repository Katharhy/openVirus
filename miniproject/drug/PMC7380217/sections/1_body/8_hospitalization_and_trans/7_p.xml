<p id="para0037">Prophylactic G-CSF therapy for early neutrophil engraftment may be considered for HCT recipients unless contraindicated. There is no published evidence indicating that this practice can improve outcomes; however, there could be an advantage of early hospital discharge to reduce the risk of infection. Theoretically, the inflammatory cascade in ARDS 
 <xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> (mediated in part by IL-6) may be enhanced by cytokines; however, at present there are no data to support G-CSF administration. Cytokines may accelerate the risk of ARDS in confirmed cases of COVID-19 
 <xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The transfusion thresholds should be minimized in the light of an actual or anticipated shortage of blood products. As a general guideline, a hemoglobin threshold of &lt;70 g/L should be considered as an indication for blood transfusion in both autologous and allogeneic HCT recipients 
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. For platelet transfusion, a threshold of &lt;10 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/μL is reasonable in most cases.
