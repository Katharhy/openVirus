<p id="para0031">Special infection control measures, including strict use of proper personal protective equipment, should be followed as recommended by international, national, and local guidelines. A team/unit dedicated to the care of COVID-19 patients should be separated and isolated from staff caring for HCT recipients. Ideally, there should be a specific site/unit for cohorting these patients. Some hospitals in developing countries may have little capacity for private rooms; nonetheless, given their immunocompromised state, HCT recipients should not be cohorted in shared rooms.</p>
