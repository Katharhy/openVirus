<p id="para0036">Staff should be screened for symptoms before entering the HCT unit, and surgical face masks and eye protection should be worn at all times during ward rounds, as recommended by the EBMT 
 <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Social distancing rules should be strictly enforced. The number of individuals should be minimized during ward rounds and adequate distance from patients maintained to the degree possible. For the protection of the patient and the medical team, visitors should not be allowed during the hospital stay. An exception may be made in extraordinary circumstances (eg, patient dying from COVID-19) if this does not represent a conflict with the hospital's strategy or policies. Video communication may help in such circumstances.
