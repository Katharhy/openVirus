<p id="para0009">Holistic management of patients remains as essential as ever, maybe more important than ever. Patients undergoing HCT should have regular visits with social support services, given the uncertainties around returning to work and associated healthcare costs, particularly those in a jurisdiction without universal healthcare, to minimize financial and social toxicity. It is appropriate to vigilantly monitor for the psychological effects of the current COVID-19 pandemic on HCT survivors and the staff taking care of them. At the same time, the risk of infection from these visits must be considered, including such factors as the time after HCT. Additional measures to ensure construction of well-rounded management plans include providing appropriate physiotherapy and nutritional guidance.</p>
