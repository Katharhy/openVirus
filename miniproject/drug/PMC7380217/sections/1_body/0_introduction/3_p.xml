<p id="para0004">Whether the incidence of the severe syndrome of COVID-19 infection is diminished or enhanced in patients post-HCT relative to the general population or other cancer populations, and what risk factors are predictive of lower respiratory infection and infection severity, are unclear at present. In addition, many donor issues have arisen as a consequence of global lockdown, travel restrictions, and quarantine procedures in various countries. Finally, many drugs currently used in the HCT arena, such as Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, ibrutinib), ruxolitinib, tocilizumab, azithromycin, and mesenchymal stromal cells (all used to treat acute or chronic graft-versus-host-disease [GVHD]), are being studied in clinical trials to evaluate their efficacy (or lack thereof) for treating COVID-19 and/or its complications. Therefore, many practice issues regarding the use of these agents in HCT recipients are currently under debate.</p>
