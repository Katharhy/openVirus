<p id="para0002">In recent history, several epidemics have affected the care of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients/donors, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), influenza A virus subtype H1N1, Zika virus, and Ebola virus. The issues arising from these epidemics were relatively geographically limited compared with the current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2. By July 19, 2020, more that 13 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported worldwide

Numerous aspects of the virus remain unknown, including the immune response and natural course of the disease, the exact incubation period, and the rate of spread among asymptomatic people, among other factors. These uncertainties make it particularly challenging to study the pattern of possible spread and create efficient management and prevention strategies. It is also difficult to predict the disease severity of COVID-19 in HCT recipients. Thus far, limited data have been published on disease severity, clinical course, and duration of infectivity of COVID-19 in HCT recipients [

The transplantation community is facing many challenges concerning the day-to-day practice of HCT, with disruptions in the entire process of referrals for evaluation, scheduling, admission, chemotherapy/radiation administration, donor procurement, and discharge planning, among other aspects (
