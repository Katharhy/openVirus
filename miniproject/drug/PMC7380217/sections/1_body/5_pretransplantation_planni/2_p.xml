<p id="para0018">All patients, including those without symptoms, should be thoroughly evaluated for clinical symptoms that might suggest incipient COVID-19, and both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 with RT-PCR 1 or 2 days before entering the transplantation ward for conditioning. In patients at high risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2, such as patients exposed to persons with active upper respiratory tract infection symptoms, then a second RT-PCR analysis is advisable even if the first RT-PCR was negative, owing to the possibility of false-negative results. In addition, a computed tomography scan of the chest can be very helpful in these cases, given its greater sensitivity than chest radiography 
 <xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Centers should allocate adequate space for symptomatic patients awaiting the results of SARS-CoV-2 testing; ideally, this should be in a negative-pressure room preferably separate from the transplantation unit. Patients scheduled for transplantation should attempt to reduce the risk of exposure by home isolation for at least 14 days before starting conditioning. If the transplantation is postponed owing to concerns about intensive care unit capacity or infection prevalence, it is imperative to complete the proper risk assessments and clearly communicate the reasons for the delay to the patient. Furthermore, it is necessary to document the multidisciplinary meeting discussions in the medical record.
