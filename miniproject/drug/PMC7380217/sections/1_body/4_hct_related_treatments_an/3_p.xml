 <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> reviews several of these agents, including their current uses in HCT recipients and in treating GVHD. It is important to consider the possible increased risk of complications in HCT recipients with COVID-19 owing to the status of immune reconstitution (delayed in allogeneic HCT recipients for up to a year), concurrent medications including immunosuppressive drugs, the general state of the patient (ie, performance status and psychosocial condition), existing comorbidities (especially cardiovascular and pulmonary), presence or absence of GVHD, disease status (ie, COVID-19 severity), mucositis (because mucosal barrier injury predisposes to infection), and malnutrition (which itself can suppress the immunologic response to infection)

In addition, superimposed bacterial infection, fungal infection, and reactivation of other common viral infections, such as cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr virus infection, may occur, and patients should be closely monitored and treated as indicated. There are no data to support the discontinuation of immunosuppressive drugs in HCT recipients infected with COVID-19. At present, little data are available on the effectiveness of various drugs/immunomodulators for treating COVID-19; however, numerous randomized clinical trials are currently underway using a variety of agents for COVID-19 management. Therefore, we recommend that unapproved drug use in HCT recipients should be considered in a clinical trial or approved for exceptional use after hospital Ethics Committee approval.
