<p id="para0041">A real-world practice question is when and how to manage an HCT recipient who contracts COVID-19 post-transplantation. This should be an individualized decision. As general guidance, autologous HCT recipients beyond 6 months post-transplantation and allogeneic HCT recipients beyond 1-year post-transplantation without immunosuppression and GVHD may be treated according to general COVID-19 management guidelines. This has practical implications for vaccinations and COVID-19 treatment strategies. If possible, these patients should be cared for in the transplantation center and entered into a clinical trial if available. Of note, the role of convalescent plasma for treatment of COVID-19 has not been proven in the allogeneic HCT setting.</p>
