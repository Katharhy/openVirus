<p id="para0007">Creating hospital-wide multidisciplinary COVID-19 teams (including specialists in infectious diseases, critical care medicine, pulmonary medicine, etc) is essential to facilitate the management of patients and make adjustments based on new information as it becomes available. Enabling telephone or video communication for multidisciplinary teamÂ meetings is important for the coordinated care of patients. To facilitate reporting, some registries, including the CIBMTR and EBMT, are actively collecting information on HCT and other cellular therapy patients infected with COVID-19. HCT programs require adequate HCT staff resuming transplantations during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
