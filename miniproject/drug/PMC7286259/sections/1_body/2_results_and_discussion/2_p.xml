<p id="p0040">The binding affinities of a total of 1390 FDA approved drugs were tested against three enzyme targets-SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup>, SARS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> and MERS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup>. The docking scores were benchmarked using three control inhibitors- α-ketoamide 13b (O6K), SG85 (G85) and GC813 (AW4). The top five lead molecules identified for SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> were Dihydroergotamine (ZINC000003978005), Avodart (ZINC000003932831), Irinotecan (ZINC000001612996), Ergotamine (ZINC000052955754) and Olysio (ZINC000164760756) with binding energies of −9.4 kcal/mol, −9.3 kcal/mol, −9.3 kcal/mol, −9.3 kcal/mol and −9.2 kcal/mol respectively (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The best lead molecule Dihydroergotamine (ZINC000003978005) binds to a pocket within the Cys145-His41 dyad and exhibits two hydrogen bonds with backbone nitrogen (N) atom of Gly143 and the binding pose further shows the participation of nine residues (Thr25, His41, Cys44, Met49, Asn142, Cys145, His164, Met165 and Glu166) in hydrophobic interactions with SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). The control inhibitor, α-ketoamide 13b (O6K) scored binding energy of −6.9 kcal/mol with two hydrogen bonds-one with the side chain nitrogen (NE2) atom of His41 and the second one with the backbone nitrogen (N) atom of Glu166 and hydrophobic interactions via residues-Thr26, Met49, Cys145, His163, Met165, Pro168, Gln189 and Thr190 (
