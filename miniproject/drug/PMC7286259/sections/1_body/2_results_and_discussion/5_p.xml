<p id="p0055">The molecules- Dihydroergotamine (ZINC000003978005) and Ergotamine (ZINC000052955754) were identified to be common leads interacting with all the three target enzymes with good binding energies and the favourable number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Both Ergotamine and its derivative, Dihydroergotamine have been used in clinical practice for the treatment of acute migraine for many years. Both the drugs exhibit complex modes of pharmacological binding with several receptors such as 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine), dopamine and noradrenaline receptors and are potent vasoconstrictors (
