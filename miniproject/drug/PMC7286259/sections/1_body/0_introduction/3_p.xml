<p id="p0010">The coronaviruses (CoVs) RNA genome has a size ranging from 27 to 31Â kb and it is the largest viral RNA genomes known to date (
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Lai and Holmes, 2001</xref>). The two overlapping polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) encoded by the CoV replicase gene are essential for viral replication and transcription (

 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2003</xref>). These polyproteins need to undergo a complex cascade of proteolytic processing for maturation which in turn regulates viral gene expression and replication (
 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">Xue et al., 2008</xref>). The enzyme CoV main protease (CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup>; also known as 3C-like protease or 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) catalyzes the most of the maturation cleavage events within the precursor polyproteins (
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 1991</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Ziebuhr et al., 2000</xref>). It is a three-domain (domains I to III) cysteine protease with a chymotrypsin-like fold at the N terminus and a Cys-His catalytic located in a cleft between domains I and II (

 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2003</xref>). The CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> has emerged as an attractive drug target for anti-coronaviral drug design because of its vital role in the maturation and processing of the replicase polyprotein (
