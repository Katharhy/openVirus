    "Background The COVID pandemic has had a major impact on healthcare in hospitals, including the diagnosis and treatment of infections. Hospital-acquired infective endocarditis (HAIE) is a severe complication of medical procedures that has shown a progressive increase in recent years. Objectives To determine whether the incidence of HAIE during the first two months of the epidemic (March–April 2020) was higher than previously observed and to describe the clinical characteristics of these cases. The probability of the studied event (HAIE) during the study period was calculated by Poisson distribution. Results Four cases of HAIE were diagnosed in our institution during the study period. The incidence of HAIE during the study period was 2/patient-month and 0.3/patient-month during the same calender months in the previous 5 years (p=0.033). Two cases presented during admission for COVID-19 with pulmonary involvement treated with methylprednisolone and tocilizumab. The other two cases were admitted to the hospital during the epidemic. All cases underwent central venous and urinary catheterization during admission. The etiology of HAIE was Enterococcus faecalis (2 cases), Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans (one case each). A source of infection was identified in three cases (central venous catheter, peripheral venous catheter, sternal wound infection, respectively). One patient was operated on. Two patients died during hospital admission. Conclusions The incidence of HAIE during COVID-19 pandemic in our institution was higher than usual. In order to reduce the risk of this serious infection, optimal catheter care and early treatment of every local infection should be prioritized during coronavirus outbreaks."
