<p id="p0165">The recent emergence of the Wuhan CoV (SARS-CoV-2) has put the world on alert. The rapid worldwide spread and the high human-to-human transmissibility, combined with the inability to contain the pandemic, is causing an increasing death toll and also considerable paralysis of the world economy. The COVID-19 could decrease and disappear or could be established worldwide in the human population and reoccur seasonally in future mutations through zoonosis from one of the animal reservoirs. However, it is very likely that in the upcoming years, we will see more outbreaks from CoV and other viruses. The basic, translational, and public health research communities have to prepare for this much better. The outbreak has emphasized the urgent need for renewed efforts to develop broad-spectrum antiviral agents to combat CoVs. On the positive side, much new information of the virus biology and the spread was immediately shared, whereas, on the negative side, many past opportunities to develop antivirals against CoVs were not taken, despite a large number of promising approaches and compounds.

 </xref> The past decade has shown that CoV outbreaks are regularly reoccurring with more or less health effect on human and livestock. It remains to be hoped that the current pandemic will slow down and end as predicted in summer. Furthermore, it turns out that containment measures are not effective to avoid more severe spread. It remains to be seen whether efficient and long-lasting immunity will develop in the infected population with regard to future outbreaks and whether pharmacological measures can be rapidly developed to be able to treat severely sick people.
