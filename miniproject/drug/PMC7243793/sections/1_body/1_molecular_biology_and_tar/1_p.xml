<p id="p0050">Despite the rather large size of the RNA virus genome of ~30,000 bases, the SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes for few proteins (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> ): the structural spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein, and the envelope (E) protein, which are needed to produce a structurally complete viral particle. Additionally, the SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes 16–17 non-structural proteins (ns1 to ns17), such as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).
