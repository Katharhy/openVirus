<p id="p0110">It is the affinity between the viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the host receptor in the initial viral attachment step that primarily determines which host is susceptible to SARS-CoV infection. The SARS-CoV-2 entry through receptor binding was elucidated independently by several groups.

 </xref> On the basis of the rich knowledge about SARS-CoV and the sequence homology, it was suggested that SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its receptor (

 </xref> The interplay of the ACE receptor in cardiovascular diseases (with the well-known drug class of ACE inhibitors) and as the docking point for SARS-CoV-2 cellular infection is a current point of intense debate and research.
