<p id="p0155">The role of the other SARS-CoV-2 N proteins as drug-discovery targets is less clear. For the assembly of the replication and/or transcription complexes, there is a vast interaction network described between the non-structural proteins. Similarly, viral particle assembly requires orchestrated interaction between N, S, M, and E proteins. All these interactions can be potential targets, but the structural information is currently minimal. Resolution of the protein and complex structures will provide new unique drug targets. For example, the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 N protein RNA-binding domain was just published and will give structural insight as a potential drug target.
