 </xref> Remdesivir (
 <bold>25</bold>) reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection of monkey kidney cells with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.77 μM. The compound is in late-stage clinical development and has been recently described to inhibit multiple RNA viruses on a cellular level, including Ebola and SARS. The presumed mode of action of the adenosine analog prodrug remdesivir is pre-mature RNA synthesis termination by incorporation into nascent viral RNA chains.

 </xref> Galidesivir (
 <bold>26</bold>) is another antiviral drug under clinical development with potential in COVID-19 treatment (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). It is an adenosine analog and is currently developed for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus disease. It also shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against RNA virus families including CoVs.
