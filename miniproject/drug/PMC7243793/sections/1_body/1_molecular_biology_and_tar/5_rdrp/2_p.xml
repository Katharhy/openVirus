 </xref> RdRp proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share 96% sequence identity. Favipiravir (
 <bold>24</bold>) is an approved RNA polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of the influenza pandemic. It has been shown not only to be active in influenza but also active against other RNA viruses (

 </xref> Favipiravir is a prodrug, which is metabolized in cells into the active purine-mimicking nucleotide favipiravir-ribofuranosyl-5-triphosphate that inhibits the RNA replication and thus the viral progression.
