<p id="p0025">In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of an unknown cause was reported in Wuhan, in Hubei province, China. It was speculated that the first patient caught the infection from a seafood market that also traded wild animals. The causing agent was quickly identified as a novel coronavirus (CoV). The CoV responsible for the outbreak is now called SARS-CoV-2. The respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 is called COVID-19. The symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2 infection range from asymptomatic to mild to severe to death.

 <sup>th</sup> led to &gt;4.5 million infections and 300,000 fatalities. Based on the previous experience with the SARS-CoV outbreak at the beginning of this century, very stringent measures were taken by the Chinese government, and several multimillion-inhabitant cities were isolated and put under quarantine in order to slow the pandemic spread. Different hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 are proposed, including snails, bats, and pangolins.
