<p id="p0030">CoVs are a large family of zoonotic viruses and their outbreaks are common to humans, although major outbreaks have been experienced in animals, especially in cattle. Under the electron microscope, they exhibit formations that are reminiscent of the solar corona. The common cold is often caused by human CoVs. They are single-stranded enveloped positive RNA viruses and stand out because of their rather large genome. As with viruses in general, the structure is rather simple. SARS-CoV-2 is generally less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, much less pathogenic than the Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS-CoV, but more pathogenic than practically harmless HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63. The reported case-fatality rate of COVID-19 is â‰¤3% and is thus rather low as compared with SARS (30%,
