<p id="p0040">What are the issues and chances for a rapid approval of a new medicine to treat COVID-19? In principle, there are several potential strategies to pharmacologically fight COVID-19: vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, oligonucleotide-based therapies, peptides, interferon therapies, small-molecule drugs, or natural medicines (e.g., traditional Chinese medicine [TCM]). The timelines for 
 <italic>de novo</italic> development of a small-molecule drug are historically &gt;6–7 years, and in the best case less than 2 years. Vaccines can be developed much faster, but rapid development in the range of 1–2 years is very challenging. Antibodies to support the body’s immune system are also a strategy to combat viral diseases. Again, the typical development timelines are several years. Therefore, is there a hope for a drug to come rapidly to the market? A strategy that is promising in the current situation is drug repurposing. Drug repurposing aims to discover novel indication areas for already approved drugs.

 </xref> The overwhelming advantage of drug repurposing is the potential for much faster market approval because of the already extensive knowledge of the drug’s behavior in humans.
