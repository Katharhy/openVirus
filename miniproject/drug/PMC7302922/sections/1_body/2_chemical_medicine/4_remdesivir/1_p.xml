<p id="Par11">Remdesivir is a nucleoside drug and an RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor which was developed by Gilead Sciences in the USA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Accumulating evidence indicates that remdesivir could inhibit virus replication and play an antiviral role through blocking the synthesis of negative-strand RNA by inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, subgenomic mRNA, and subviral genomic RNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Remdesivir has shown good anti-MERS-CoV and anti-SARS-CoV activities in vitro and in animal models [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] and has anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro, indicating it could be used as a potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. On January 31, 2020, the prestige medical journal “New England Medical Journal” (NEJM) reported the diagnosis and treatment process of the first SARS-CoV-2 infected patient in the USA, showing that remdesivir has a certain role in the treatment [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Cell research published an article stating that among the six antiviral drugs tested, remdesivir had the strongest inhibitory effect of COVID-19 in vitro (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.77 μmol/L) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Currently, remdesivir’s clinical trials have been officially launched in China that a total of 761 patients are planned to be included in this study.
