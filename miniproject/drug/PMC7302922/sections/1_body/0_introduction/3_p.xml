<p id="Par6">As the epidemic is getting worse, the control of COVID-19 presents multiple challenges in the short term [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Nevertheless, no specific antiviral medicine is available either to treat or to prevent the aggravation of COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. More potent antiviral drugs are urgent to be developed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. It usually takes about 12 to 15 years for a new drug transitioning from development to market, which is a fairly long process. Therefore, it is not feasible to study antinovel coronavirus drugs from the beginning to get a direct effect on the prevention and control of this outbreak. Only by adopting the strategy of “old drugs for new use,” that is, finding effective drugs against novel coronavirus from existing drugs on the market, making it be rapidly applied to clinical practice [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. COVID-19’s therapeutic strategies mainly relied on the experience of clinicians [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Up to now, some medicines are confirmed clinically to be effective in eliminating SARS-CoV-2 and improving symptoms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Among them, traditional Chinese medicines have received broad adoption, especially in treating cases of mild symptoms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In this review, we summarized the drugs used for COVID-19 treatment in China based on the emerging basic and clinical data. It is hopeful that this review will be useful to provide guidance for the prevention and control of COVID-19.
