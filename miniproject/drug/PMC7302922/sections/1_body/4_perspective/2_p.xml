<p id="Par23">Currently, the enthusiasm for COVID-19 drug research runs high, but whether long-term scientific research can persist after the epidemic is a bit more in doubt. The isolation and structure analysis of various coronaviruses have been completed in early period, but there is still no specific drug for each coronavirus in the world. The reasons are as follows: firstly, the replication mutation rate of the virus is very high, and it is easy to produce drug-resistant strains. Secondly, after the acute infectious period of a novel coronavirus, the patient is likely to have developed a corresponding durable immunity. However, compared with the transient infection of virus epidemic, the new drug development cycle is fairly a long time, which is not suitable for the development of coronavirus drugs economically. Therefore, the joint efforts of government departments and drug research and development departments are needed to achieve a breakthrough in a short period of time, for accumulating experience of the possible future coronavirus epidemic.</p>
