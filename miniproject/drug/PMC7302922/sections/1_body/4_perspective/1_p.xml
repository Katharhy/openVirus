<p id="Par22">As for a new emerging acute infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, there are still no specific antiviral drugs. All options for its prevention and treatment are based on previous experience in the treatment of SARS, MERS, or other new influenza viruses. Active treatment based on the patientâ€™s symptoms is still the main direction of treatment. Up to now, China has made a great breakthrough in fighting against COVID-19, but the situation outside China is not optimistic. The Chinese Health Commission has established several versions of diagnosis and treatment plans on COVID-19, which was formulated in a short time by professionals in various fields. But it is just a temporary solution at present. Since these drugs were not developed for the treatment of COVID-19, the clinical therapeutic effect is surely limited. Besides, the efficacy and safety of involved medicines still need to be confirmed in further clinical treatment and research. Even though those medicines we used have certain therapeutic effect, it is still urgent for medical researchers to carry on the research and development of specific medicine and vaccine according to the infection mechanism and characteristic structure of new crown virus. What is more, an effective mechanism for drug development of coronavirus should be established.</p>
