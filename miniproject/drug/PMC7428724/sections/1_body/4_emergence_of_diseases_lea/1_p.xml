<p id="p0230">Whatever human behaviors lead to the emergence of infectious diseases, the newly emerged organism cannot survive continually in humans without adapting to one of several direct or indirect mechanisms of person-to-person spread (
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> ). Many emerging organisms, such as the hantaviral agents of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and Korean hemorrhagic fever, or the arenaviruses causing Argentine, Bolivian, and Lassa hemorrhagic fevers, result from dead-end exposures to reservoir rodents and rarely spread from person to person. Preventing and controlling these types of emergences thus focus on the enzootic reservoir.
