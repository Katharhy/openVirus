<p id="p0245">One of the most important unanswered questions we face in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic relates to the evolutionary potential of human-adapted SARS-CoV-2. Will it, similar to human IAVs in recent centuries, evolve to persist as a permanent human pathogen by mutating to escape the population herd immunity it creates? And if it does persist, will it attenuate over time, as the four endemic coronaviruses may have done centuries ago? Or, on the other hand, will it increase in pathogenicity as the pandemic H3N2 IAV has done over the past 52 years? Because SARS-CoV-2 lacks a segmented genome, we are spared at least one genetic trick (gene reassortment) underlying IAV pandemic emergences; however, like human IAVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be expected to evolve by mutation as it spreads through human populations, and it has the additional capacity of evolving by genetic recombination. Enzootic evidence supports a very high degree of recombination of SARS-like CoVs in nature. Will these capacities allow SARS-CoV-2 to escape from population immunity elicited by natural infection or future vaccination? Only additional time, and much important research, will begin to answer these questions.</p>
