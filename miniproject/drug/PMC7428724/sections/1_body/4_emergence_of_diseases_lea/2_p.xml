<p id="p0235">Person-to-person transmissibility, a necessary step in establishing epidemicity and pandemicity after host-switching, can occur via one or more of four basic mechanisms (
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>): respiratory;gastrointestinal; environmental spread via an intermediate environmental state such as waterborne, foodborne, and fomite-mediated; and environmental spread via inoculation, including vectorborne. It is noteworthy that these mechanisms reflect not only human societal practices such as sanitary practices, embracing physical closeness, and sexual activities but also ways in which people interact with the environment such as storage and drinking of water from different sources, food procurement, and food preparation practice. Even so, many variables interact to produce different clinical and epidemiologic aspects of disease transmitted from person to person. For example, while both Ebola and SARS-CoV-2 are potentially fatal diseases transmitted person to person, SARS-CoV-2 is, like most respiratory diseases, associated with asymptomatic infection in many and is often transmitted to others by an asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infected person. Ebola, on the other hand, has a lower frequency of asymptomatic infection and is of low transmissibility right up to the time of illness onset. Moreover, the mechanisms of person-to-person transmission are distinct for these two diseases. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via hands and fomites, respiratory droplets and aerosol, including transmission by superspreading events where large numbers of individuals are infected by a single person, almost invariably in closed crowded settings. Ebola, on the other hand, is transmitted via virus-contaminated bodily secretions, and infection is usually acquired by persons touching contaminated fluids or fomites, for example in providing nursing care, burial services, handling towels, bed linens, utensils, etc. (
