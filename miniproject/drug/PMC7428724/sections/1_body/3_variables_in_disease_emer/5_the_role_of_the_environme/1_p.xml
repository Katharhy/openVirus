 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, which created a secondary ecologic niche for the emergence of yellow fever virus and, centuries later, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, all of which then went on to spread pandemically. Depots of used rubber tires create ideal breeding sites for a related human-adapted mosquito, 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, which in recent decades has spread globally across the tropical and subtropical zones, transmitting many of these same arboviral diseases widely, if less efficiently. Predictably, viruses and viral vectors have adapted to environmental influences: a single locus mutation in the 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>-adapted Indian Ocean strain of chikungunya virus has newly adapted it, without loss of fitness for 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, to 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus,</italic> widely prevalent in the region (
