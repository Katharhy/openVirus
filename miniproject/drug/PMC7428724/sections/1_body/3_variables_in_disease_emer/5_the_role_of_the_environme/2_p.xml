For centuries, wars have precipitated the re-emergences of many diseases (

In the 1700s, when typhus had not been identified as a specific disease, textbooks listed two separate conditions under the nosologic terms “war typhus” and “jail typhus,” reflecting human activities that provoked long-ago disease emergences. A classic epidemiology text published over a century ago, still studied today, is titled
