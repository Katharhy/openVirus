<p id="p0140">Pathogenic variability undoubtedly applies to many other virus types, exemplified, for example, by comparing the highly pathogenic Ebola Zaire strain to the closely related but lowly pathogenic Ebola Reston strain (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Baseler et al., 2017</xref>). Although not yet adequately studied, pathogenic variability might also be a property of animal coronaviruses. That all three recently emerging human coronaviruses (the agents of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19) exact a high degree of human morbidity and mortality suggests that enzootic coronaviruses as a whole may be inherently pathogenic for humans. On the one hand, preliminary data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may elicit an unbalanced innate immune response associated with decreased expression of interferons I and III and with increased inflammatory cytokine production (

 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Vanderheiden et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, preliminary data suggest that viral-bacterial co-pathogenesis may be of somewhat less concern with SARS-CoV-2 than with influenza, measles, and other pathogenic respiratory viruses, although comprehensive clinical/autopsy series have not yet been published.
