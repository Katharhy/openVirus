<p id="p0115">Influenza A viruses (IAVs) infect cells via binding to terminal sialic acids found on lumenal respiratory epithelial cells of avian as well as mammalian and human hosts and contain a neuraminidase that cleaves these same receptors to allow viral release, which facilitates onward viral transmission (

 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Taubenberger et al., 2019</xref>). Since sialic acids are found on a wide variety of mammalian and non-mammalian cells, it is not surprising that many viruses attach to these receptors, although viral affinities to receptors are complicated. For example,

However, autopsy studies have confirmed fatal human infections caused by IAVs that prefer either receptor, reflecting the complexity of virus-host interactions across the animal kingdom.
