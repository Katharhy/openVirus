<p id="p0150">Moreover, viral evolution toward lower pathogenicity does not apply to all infectious diseases. For many other organisms such as cholera (expressing a bacteriophage toxin causing diarrhea) or rotavirus infection (with an NSP4 diarrhea-causing toxin), or for cough-inducing tuberculosis and many respiratory viruses, damage to the gastrointestinal tract and lungs, respectively, facilitates transmission, since diarrhea and coughing expel infectious pathogens into the environment, increasing the chance of infecting additional hosts. Disease severity thus reflects a balancing act between killing or incapacitating hosts, on the one hand, and optimizing microbial transmission, and therefore survival, on the other. Similar principles may also apply to non-viral diseases with environmental modes of transmission: for example, with enzootic anthrax, host-killing may be an important transmission mechanism, as rotting carcasses leave anthrax spores in the ground to reignite future infections (
