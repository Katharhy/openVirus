<p id="p0145">With regard to coronavirus disease severity, it is worth considering the conventional wisdom (not always correct) that viruses that kill their hosts limit their own ability to be transmitted and that, if transmitted person to person, they would be expected to be selected for attenuation of pathogenicity over time. It is conceivable that the four endemic coronaviruses of humans—the β-coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 and the α-coronaviruses 229E and NL63—emerged long ago as zoonotic and perhaps highly pathogenic viruses that evolved into attenuated forms over time (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2019</xref>). Such natural attenuation of pathogenicity has not yet been observed with the agents of SARS, MERS, or COVID-19, although with a SARS-CoV-2 case-fatality in the range of 1%, and with evidence for significant asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission in a largely susceptible population, evidence for selection pressures for attenuation may not be detectable in the short term.
