<p id="p0130">In experimental studies, early FIPV-associated feline deaths result from both FIPV spike protein vaccination and passive transfusion with anti-FIPV antibody (

 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Weiss and Scott, 1981</xref>). Neither FECV nor FIPV are phylogenetically close to SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, both being α-coronaviruses utilizing aminopeptidase N or other protein or glycan receptors rather than the ACE-2 receptors that bind SARS β-coronaviruses. But evidence for ADE with multiple different α- and β-coronaviruses suggests that as we proceed to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and therapeutic antibodies, much remains to be learned about this complex viral family.
