<p id="p0135">Also of importance to the infectivity of newly emerging infectious diseases are 
 <italic>viral genetic properties associated with pathogenicity and co-pathogenicity</italic>, exemplified most clearly with pandemic IAVs. The 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus, which killed an estimated 50 million people (equivalent to 200 million when adjusted to the 2020 population) was particularly lethal because of at least two inherent properties: (1) an avian-descended H1 hemagglutinin (HA) that is unusually cytopathic and immunopathogenic compared to the HAs of most other IAVs and (2) a marked co-pathogenic ability—the viral genetic basis of which remains poorly understood—to precipitate fatal bacterial bronchopneumonias in association with pneumopathogenic bacteria carried silently in the human upper respiratory tract (

A perhaps even more shocking example of pandemic emergence associated with enhanced pathogenicity is that of Zika, a flavivirus known for decades. Zika had never caused a human epidemic; however, in 2015, it suddenly spread pandemically around the global tropical belt, causing millions of infections and severe fetal losses and birth defects (
