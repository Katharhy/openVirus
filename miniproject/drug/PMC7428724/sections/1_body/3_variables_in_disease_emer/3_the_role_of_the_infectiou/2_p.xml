 <italic>Genetic instability of microorganisms</italic> is an inherent property allowing rapid microbial evolution to adapt to ever-changing ecologic niches. This is particularly true of RNA viruses such as influenza viruses, flaviviruses, enteroviruses, and coronaviruses, which have inherently deficient or absent polymerase error-correction mechanisms and are transmitted as quasispecies or swarms of many, often hundreds or thousands of, genetic variants.
