<p id="p0120">Yet another aspect of infecting viruses is that some (e.g., HIV, influenza) express immunodominant epitopes on external proteins that dominate the elicitation of immune responses, resulting in less robust immune responses to other, often adjacent, epitopes. This may have the effect of blunting, or limiting the breadth of, an otherwise optimal host immune response. Almost all viruses have proteins that inhibit innate protective host responses, such as the host interferon response (
