<p id="p0105">Other determinants of emerging infectious agents include cell tropism, ability to circumvent innate immune responses, and antigenic immunodominance, among others. Many viruses enter cells via one or more cell receptors (

 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Dai et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Jayawardena et al., 2020</xref>); some infect different cells via different receptors, while some cell receptors may be entry points for multiple different types of viruses. The situation is extraordinarily complex from the point of view of both virus and host, with a bewildering array of receptors, alternate receptors, and co-receptors and of countless viruses able to utilize them, reflecting that “viruses have deep evolutionary roots in the cellular world” (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Baranowski et al., 2001</xref>). This is exemplified by the SARS-like bat β-coronaviruses, or sarbecoviruses, whose receptor binding domains appear to be hyper-evolving by sampling a variety of mammalian receptors (
