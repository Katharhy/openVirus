<p id="p0100">Emergences of viral diseases begin with the genetic plasticity of the infectious agent, which may repeatedly encounter ecologic niches into which it can evolve and adapt under facilitative circumstances, e.g., those provided by the hosts in the context of the host environment. For viruses transmitted by person-to-person mechanisms, transmission by quasispecies may increase the likelihood that one or more viral variants within the quasispecies will be infectious for cells of a new host, leading to infection, viral amplification, and expansion of a new and different quasispecies, facilitating onward transmission (see below).</p>
