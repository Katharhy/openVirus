<p id="p0125">In considering SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development and antibody treatment/prophylaxis, it is also of some concern that natural infection with the feline coronavirus (FECV) initiates a non-fatal infection that sometimes leads to development of viral variants (known as feline infectious peritonitis viruses [FIPVs]) that are macrophage-tropic and that can bind to host anti-spike protein antibody (antibody against the external viral protein that attaches to ACE-2 receptors and elicits protective immunity) to allow viruses to enter macrophages via FcRs (ADE), leading to a distinct and universally fatal disease known as feline infectious peritonitis, or FIP (

Post-infectious gene editing by the host has also been proposed as a mechanism for development of subacute sclerosing pan-encephalitis (SSPE), a fatal human disease associated with persistent natural measles virus infection complicated by generation of host-edited mutant viruses (
