<p id="p0170">Some viruses enter cells via binding to two different proximate receptors, a primary and secondary receptor, e.g., receptors for binding and for fusion (for example, numerous flaviviruses [

These viruses are injected into perivascular dermal tissue by their respective vectors and are taken up by dendritic cells and carried to regional lymph nodes, where they initiate systemic infection. ADE, discussed above, and other ADE-like phenomena, may also facilitate cellular infection (
