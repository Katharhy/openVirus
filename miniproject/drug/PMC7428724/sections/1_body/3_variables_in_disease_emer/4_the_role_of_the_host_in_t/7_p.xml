<p id="p0185">Some emerging viruses encounter pre-existing 
 <italic>partial population immunity</italic>, e.g., pandemic influenza viruses. Most notably, in the influenza pandemics of 1968 and 2009, caused by an H3N2 and an H1N1 virus, respectively, segments of the population had pre-existing immunity that interfered with early viral spread and possibly with viral evolution. Although insufficient to prevent emergence, such population immunity did protect certain segments of the population (

In fact, in most influenza pandemics, influenza-specific case-fatality in the elderly, which increases regularly over about age 60 with seasonal influenza, is nevertheless apparently blunted by poorly characterized immune effects of prior influenza exposures, emphasizing the complexity of viral infectivity and host resistance factors (
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Morens and Taubenberger, 2011</xref>). In contrast, there are suggestions that decreases in natural infections with, or vaccinations against, pathogens may facilitate the emergence of related organisms, e.g., increased incidence of human monkeypox after the cessation of smallpox vaccination that followed eradication of the monkeypox-related smallpox virus (
