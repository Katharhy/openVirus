<p id="p0160">Major portals of host entry for infectious agents include those that are visibly external to the environment such as the skin or that can be reached directly from the environment such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, as well as organs reached systemically such as the liver, heart, and other internal organs. Human beings have many different organ systems, each with many different cell types, and with each cell having arrays of different receptors; therefore, it is not surprising that switching of a pathogen from an animal host to humans results in very different clinical and epidemiologic outcomes, including different disease manifestations and transmission mechanisms. These factors ultimately relate to the potential for establishment of infection in the new host as well as the likelihood of sustained transmission within the new host population and, as such, have a bearing on whether host-switching succeeds or fails.</p>
