<p id="p0210">The 1889 influenza pandemic traveled westward from Asia to Europe along railroad lines and then was exported globally along shipping routes. The 1957 influenza pandemic was spread by ships, but 11 years later the 1968 influenza pandemic was spread along air routes, the first example of global pandemic spread by airplanes. In 1981, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis was spread between international air hubs in the tropics and some temperate zones (e.g., to Florida and North Carolina). In 2002–2003, SARS was exported by air from Hong Kong to the Western Hemisphere and Europe. In 2019–2020, SARS-CoV-2 was spread globally from China in a similar manner. These many ancient and modern examples reflect the extraordinary importance of human population growth and movement in spreading diseases: the more populous and crowded we as a species become, and the more we travel, the more we provide opportunities for emerging diseases.</p>
