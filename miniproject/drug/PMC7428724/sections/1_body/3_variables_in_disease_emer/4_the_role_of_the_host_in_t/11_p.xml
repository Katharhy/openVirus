<p id="p0205">Among the most important host factors for infection and for disease emergences/re-emergences are those associated with 
 <italic>human behaviors</italic>, e.g., population growth, crowding, human movement, and many others, including behaviors that either perturb the environment or result in new human-created ecologic niches (

Regarding human movement, both the 1347–1348 Black Death (bubonic/pneumonic plague) and the 1832 cholera pandemic (which traveled from India to Europe and then to the Western Hemisphere) were spread along major trade and travel routes. In 1831–1832, 45 years before a coherent “germ theory” would be articulated, it was clear that as cholera spread slowly westward, it moved no faster than coaches and ships traveled: it slowed down in the winter as travel slowed down, and it picked up again in the summer as travel increased.
