<p id="p0195">There is preliminary but growing evidence that infectious disease severity or even susceptibility may in some cases be related to 
 <italic>host genetic variables</italic> associated with the innate immune response, as is the case with epidemiologic information concerning severe disease caused by H5N1 poultry-associated influenza (
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Morens and Taubenberger, 2015</xref>). Several host genes have been provisionally linked to susceptibility to such severe viral disease outcomes (

 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, differential interactions with IFITMs such as IFITM3 include inhibiting the human endemic α-coronavirus while enhancing entry of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV β-coronaviruses (
