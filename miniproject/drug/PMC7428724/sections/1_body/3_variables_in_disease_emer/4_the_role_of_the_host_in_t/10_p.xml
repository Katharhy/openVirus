<p id="p0200">With respect to COVID-19, several studies have associated blood group A in the ABO system with disease severity, although the mechanisms of this effect are not yet clear. ABO system associations with infectious diseases have also been shown for infections with noroviruses, 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic>, and falciparum malaria; however, any such associations might also be indirect markers for unrelated genes. Newer data are beginning to define human immonotype risks for more severe disease (
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Mathew et al., 2020</xref>), as well as posssible genetic signatures of severe diseases (
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Gussow et al., 2020</xref>). At this time, data establishing specific genetic susceptibilities remain inconclusive for most diseases, including coronavirus diseases. This is a research area likely to be important in the future, since identification of susceptibilities for human disease severity has great implications for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.
