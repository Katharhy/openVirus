 <italic>Tissue/cell tropism</italic> also has a bearing on the types of immune responses that are elicited. For example, in a systemic infection like measles, high-level viremia is associated with infection of multiple organs, tissues, and cell types; the resulting broad systemic B and T cell responses lead to lifelong protection from reinfection. In contrast, influenza A viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), among many other respiratory viruses that infect surface epithelial cells, do not cause viremia and infect only surface respiratory epithelial cells. As a result, infectious virions do not have intimate interactions with the systemic immune system. The major site of influenza virus-immune system interaction is in the semi-organized tear duct-, nasal-, and mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues (TALT, NALT, and MALT), as well as the post-natally generated inducible bronchus-associated iBALT (
