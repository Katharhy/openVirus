<p id="p0275">There are many examples where disease emergences reflect our increasing inability to live in harmony with nature. Nipah virus emergence followed agricultural burning of forests, which led to displacement of infected bats; bats then went to roost in trees that shaded intensively farmed pigs that were crowded into small areas, which led to infection of pigs via bat droppings, which in turn led to human outbreaks in pig farmers (

Fish meal farming by fishermen in waters around the globe damages ecosystems by over-fishing and deprives local residents of food sources, leading to poverty and human movement, which exacerbate the potential for disease emergence. In Asia, the fish meal is used for breeding and over-feeding of farmed animals, often in intensive farming practices, which increase the likelihood of zoonotic diseases. Yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika are all associated with urban crowding, poor sanitation, and water storage. Over many centuries, urbanization and crowding has led to rodent infestation and to rodent-borne diseases such as plague, murine typhus, and rat-bite fever. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic reminds us that overcrowding in dwellings and places of human congregation (sports venues, bars, restaurants, beaches, airports), as well as human geographic movement, catalyzes disease spread.
