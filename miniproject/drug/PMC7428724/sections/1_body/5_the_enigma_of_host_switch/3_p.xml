<p id="p0260">While it has long been assumed that the major determinants of host-switching are the evolutionary closeness of hosts A and B and the diversity of their transmitting quasispecies, recent research suggests that pathogen opportunity may be the major determinant of host-switching (

The implications are profound. If host-switching is opportunity driven, e.g., for SARS- CoV and CoV-2, Nipah, and Hendra, then prevention and control will have to focus not only on the infectious agents themselves but also on human behaviors, such as the animal-human interface, represented by shopping in live animal markets, preparation and consumption of bush meat, intensive farming/animal husbandry, environmental degradation, and other human behaviors (
