<p id="p0250">Perhaps the single biggest mystery of emerging diseases is how microorganisms, including animal-adapted microorganisms, switch species to infect humans. Host-switching from animal to human has long been conceptualized as the crossing of a 
 <italic>fitness valley</italic>, in which a virus adapted to transmitting between members of host species A must somehow simultaneously develop the capacity to productively infect cells of new host species B (

 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Parrish et al., 2008</xref>). In this paradigm, the depth of the fitness valley reflects host-to-host barrier challenges that have to be overcome. Our understanding of mechanisms of viral evolution and host-switching is nevertheless incomplete, in part because of inability to reconcile experimental within-host viral evolutionary findings and natural-world findings that examine viral evolution during outbreaks, including new disease emergences (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Geoghegan and Holmes, 2018</xref>). Among many complicating factors, rapid intense person-to-person transmission of new viruses in large human populations often produces complex genetic diversity, confounding attempts to link viral variation to viral phenotypic changes and selection pressures eliciting them.
