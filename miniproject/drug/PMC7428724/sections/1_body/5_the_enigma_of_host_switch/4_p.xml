<p id="p0265">Looked at another way, infectious diseases may be emerging into humans with greater frequency than appreciated; however, historically they have not usually achieved sustained-enough transmission that would lead to detection of the emergence. For example, before the recognized emergence of Zika, low human seroprevalence rates had been detected in enzootic areas for decades, but without detection of human outbreaks. Before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, antibodies to it or to closely related sarbecoviruses were detected in humans exposed to bat coronaviruses (

MERS has emerged from dromedary camels to humans on multiple occasions; however, despite limited chains of subsequent human-to-human spread, it has not become an established human disease. H5N1 avian influenza has infected millions of humans; however, only a small percentage manifest a recognized disease (often severe or fatal), and human-to-human transmission has been rarely reported (
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Morens and Taubenberger, 2015</xref>). These and many other examples suggest that disease emergence into humans may be common; however, sustained transmission between humans has been a rare occurrence resulting from incompletely understood factors. But in looking at the recent spate of deadly emergences noted above, we must now ask whether human behaviors that perturb the human-microbial status quo have reached a tipping point that forecasts the inevitability of an acceleration of disease emergences.
