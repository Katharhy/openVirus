<p id="p0255">The situation is particularly complicated for the most important category of newly emerging disease agents: the RNA viruses, which include SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS, Ebola, and influenza, as well as dengue, Zika, and other arboviruses. These viruses evolve as, and are transmitted as, complex quasispecies, or viral swarms, which contain many viral variants of differing degrees of relatedness. It is unclear whether and/or to what extent transmission/host-switching reflects Darwinian evolution of novel virus variants, as opposed to evolution based on whole-quasispecies fitness (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Geoghegan and Holmes, 2018</xref>). In the latter conceptualization, viral quasispecies evolve together as a diverse array of optimally fit, less optimally fit, and least optimally fit variants, trading off perfect host fitness for adaptational flexibility.
