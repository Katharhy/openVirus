<p id="p0270">Such enigmas need to be better understood if we are to control emergences of infectious diseases (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Dobson et al., 2020</xref>). Better understanding of the obscure mechanisms of emergences might allow us to anticipate emergence risks by (1) surveilling and characterizing taxonomic groups of potentially pre-emergent viruses, including viruses that may be the nearest to emerging, e.g., coronaviruses, henipaviruses, flaviviruses, arenaviruses, and filoviruses; (2) conducting intensive research on suspected high-risk viral categories to identify, in experimental animals, conserved epitopes for vaccine development and targets for antiviral therapies; (3) characterizing mechanisms of potential human transmission in experimental animal studies; (4) developing control mechanisms in areas such as animal husbandry, wildlife interaction, and rodent, vector, and mosquito/tick control; (5) devising environmental, land management, wildlife conservation/control programs; and (6) utilizing new virologic, informatic, and technological approaches to understand viral evolution and even predict emergence potential (
