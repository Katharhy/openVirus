<p id="p0060">Emerging diseases have been categorized as newly emerging, re-emerging, or “deliberately emerging,” that is, associated with bioterrorism (

 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Morens et al., 2004</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">2008a</xref>). To these we add “accidentally emerging” human-generated diseases, such as repeated emergences of vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) resulting from naturally occurring back-mutations of live virus vaccines, as well as a live human-engineered vaccine that escaped to cause a new epizootic disease: naturally transmitted vaccinia (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Lum et al., 1967</xref>). Although these four categories are distinct, they are also interrelated: newly emerging diseases can persist and then re-emerge and can also become agents of deliberate or accidental release. An example crossing the latter two categories is the 1979 Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinaberg) anthrax accident, in which an unintentional explosion in a Russian bioweapons factory released anthrax into the air, resulting in at least 100 human deaths (
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Meselson et al., 1994</xref>). Such deliberately emerging and accidentally emerging diseases represent a special case in which emergence/epidemicity is best prevented by global biosafety cooperation.
