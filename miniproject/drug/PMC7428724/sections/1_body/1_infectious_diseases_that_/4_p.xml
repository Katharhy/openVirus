<p id="p0045">From the human point of view, the fact that modern endemic diseases emerged and became established, at some unobserved time in the past (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ) (
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Morens etÂ al., 2004</xref>), and that some of these diseases survived by adopting complicated long-term survival strategies, provides a compelling rationale for dual strategies for immediate and long-term control. First, in the immediate sense, it is important to mitigate spread of infection, illness, and death. Second, it is critical to prevent the persistence of microbes that may lead to additional emergences that are cumulatively as deadly, or more so, than the original emergences (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Dobson and Carper, 1996</xref>). That viral genetic descendants of the 1918 influenza pandemic virus are still causing seasonal outbreaks throughout the world, and still killing cumulatively millions of people a century later (
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Morens and Taubenberger, 2020</xref>), is a powerful reminder that single disease emergences can have consequences beyond immediate morbidity and mortality. In the ancient ongoing struggle between microbes and man, genetically more adaptable microbes have the upper hand in consistently surprising us and often catching us unprepared.
