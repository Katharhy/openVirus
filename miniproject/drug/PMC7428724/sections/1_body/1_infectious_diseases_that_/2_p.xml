<p id="p0035">The fact that many past emerging infectious microbes and viruses (hereafter grouped together as “microbes”) have adapted to stable co-existence with humans is evidenced by the presence of endogenous retroviruses in human DNA (
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Johnson, 2019</xref>) and by latently infecting herpesviruses such as herpes simplex (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). VZV, for example, is a highly cytolytic, highly contagious, and potentially fatal virus that has adapted to long-term survival in human populations via a complex survival mechanism. Unlike other highly contagious human-adapted respiratory viruses such as measles—whose survival requires very large populations in order to avoid exhausting susceptible persons—VZV establishes latent non-cytolytic infections in human ganglia, periodically reactivating into an infectious/cytolytic form (zoster) that can be transmitted—even in populations without circulating varicella (“chicken pox”)—to new birth cohorts of susceptible persons to be manifested as highly contagious varicella.
