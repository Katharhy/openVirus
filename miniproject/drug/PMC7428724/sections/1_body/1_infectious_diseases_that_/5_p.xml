As COVID-19 is caused by a novel virus (SARS-CoV-2) producing a spectrum of disease whose clinical, pathologic, and epidemiologic patterns have never before been observed, we are gaining insights only incrementally. At some time in the future we will be better able to compare and contrast COVID-19 to other important emerging diseases; however, at this time we are still just entering a steep learning curve that will surely keep surprising us as we struggle to control what is already among the deadliest pandemics of the past century.
