<p id="p0040">Human infectious agents such as retroviruses, herpesviruses, and many others tell us that long-ago emergences of certain diseases can result in long-term microbial survival by co-opting certain of our genetic, cellular, and immune mechanisms to ensure their continuing transmission. In the terminology of British biologist Richard Dawkins, evolution occurs at the level of gene competition and we, phenotypic humans, are merely genetic “survival machines” in the competition between microbes and humans (
