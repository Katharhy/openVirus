   <p>Selected endemic and emerging infectious diseases transmitted to humans via multiple mechanisms. Many diseases are transmitted by more than one mechanism. For example, most of the respiratory-transmitted diseases are also transmitted by hands and on fomites; most of the gastrointestinal diseases are uncommonly transmitted directly and more commonly transmitted by water, food, and on fomites. Some enteroviruses are predominantly transmitted by the fecal-oral (gastrointestinal) route, whereas others are predominantly transmitted by the respiratory route. Anthrax is transmitted by respiratory, gastrointestinal, and inoculation routes. Understanding mechanisms of transmission is important not only because it helps control those diseases that emerge but also because it provides opportunities to control multiple diseases transmitted by the same mechanisms.</p>
