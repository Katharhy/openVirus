  <p>Proposed Molecular Mechanisms of Host-Switching</p>
  <p>Proposed mechanisms of cross-species host-switching of infectious agents (after 
   <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Kuiken et al., 2006</xref>). Steep (A) and shallow (B) fitness valleys between donor and recipient host species reflect adaptational barriers that need to be crossed. (A) and (C) show that a greater number of sequential adaptational mutations are needed in (A) to cross the fitness valley and then adapt to the new host, as compared to the situation shown in (B) and (D), where greater donor-host similarities facilitate switching. (C) and (D) represent the associated phylogenetic trees: in (C), the donor host and recipient host viruses most go through significant adaptational steps, including those associated with initial transmission in the new host. In (D), the new host receives an infectious agent that is partially pre-adapted; successful emergence requires fewer adaptational mutations.
