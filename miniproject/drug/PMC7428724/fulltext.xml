In addition to these established infections, new infectious diseases periodically emerge. In extreme cases they may cause pandemics such as COVID-19; in other cases, dead-end infections or smaller epidemics result. Established diseases may also re-emerge, for example by extending geographically or by becoming more transmissible or more pathogenic. Disease emergence reflects dynamic balances and imbalances, within complex globally distributed ecosystems comprising humans, animals, pathogens, and the environment. Understanding these variables is a necessary step in controlling future devastating disease emergences.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" id="abs0015"><p>Understanding the dynamic balance and interplay between complex and global ecosystems comprising humans, animals, pathogens, and the environment provides perspectives on how we got to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>infection</kwd><kwd>epidemic</kwd><kwd>epizootic</kwd><kwd>pandemic</kwd><kwd>One Health</kwd><kwd>zoonosis</kwd><kwd>virology</kwd><kwd>disease ecology</kwd><kwd>medical history</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Unimagined just a few short months ago, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has upended our entire planet, quickly challenging past assumptions and future certainties.

It combines the characteristics of being a virus that to our knowledge has never before infected humans in a sustained manner, together with its extraordinary efficiency in transmitting from person to person and its relatively high level of morbidity and mortality, especially among seniors and those with underlying co-morbidities.

The HIV/AIDS pandemic, recognized in 1981, has so far killed at least 37 million. And the past decade has witnessed unprecedented pandemic explosions: H1N1 &#x0201c;swine&#x0201d; influenza (2009), chikungunya (2014), and Zika (2015), as well as pandemic-like emergences of Ebola fever over large parts of Africa (2014 to the present).</p><p id="p0025">Since there are four endemic coronaviruses that circulate globally in humans, coronaviruses must have emerged and spread pandemically in the era prior to the recognition of viruses as human pathogens. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged from an animal host, likely a civet cat, in 2002&#x02013;2003, to cause a near-pandemic before disappearing in response to public health control measures. The related Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged into humans from dromedary camels in 2012, but has since been transmitted inefficiently among humans (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Cui et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). COVID-19, recognized in late 2019, is but the latest example of an unexpected, novel, and devastating pandemic disease. One can conclude from this recent experience that we have entered a pandemic era (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Morens et&#x000a0;al., 2020a</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Morens et&#x000a0;al., 2020b</xref>). The causes of this new and dangerous situation are multifaceted, complex, and deserving of serious examination.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Infectious Diseases that Have Emerged in the Past</title><p id="p0030">In thinking about these recent infectious disease emergences, it is necessary to first consider currently existing infectious diseases that newly emerged in the past and then over time became endemic (prevalent in humans) or enzootic (prevalent in animals) (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Fauci and Morens, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Morens et&#x000a0;al., 2020b</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Morens and Fauci, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Morens et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). Such existing diseases may provide important clues about the mechanisms of disease emergence and persistence and why thus far we&#x000a0;have been largely unable to prevent and control many of them.</p><p id="p0035">The fact that many past emerging infectious microbes and viruses (hereafter grouped together as &#x0201c;microbes&#x0201d;) have adapted to stable co-existence with humans is evidenced by the presence of endogenous retroviruses in human DNA (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Johnson, 2019</xref>) and by latently infecting herpesviruses such as herpes simplex (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). VZV, for example, is a highly cytolytic, highly contagious, and potentially fatal virus that has adapted to long-term survival in human populations via a complex survival mechanism. Unlike other highly contagious human-adapted respiratory viruses such as measles&#x02014;whose survival requires very large populations in order to avoid exhausting susceptible persons&#x02014;VZV establishes latent non-cytolytic infections in human ganglia, periodically reactivating into an infectious/cytolytic form (zoster) that can be transmitted&#x02014;even in populations without circulating varicella (&#x0201c;chicken pox&#x0201d;)&#x02014;to new birth cohorts of susceptible persons to be manifested as highly contagious varicella.</p><p id="p0040">Human infectious agents such as retroviruses, herpesviruses, and many others tell us that long-ago emergences of certain diseases can result in long-term microbial survival by co-opting certain of our genetic, cellular, and immune mechanisms to ensure their continuing transmission. In the terminology of British biologist Richard Dawkins, evolution occurs at the level of gene competition and we, phenotypic humans, are merely genetic &#x0201c;survival machines&#x0201d; in the competition between microbes and humans (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Dawkins, 1976</xref>). It may be a matter of perspective who is in the evolutionary driver&#x02019;s seat. This perspective has implications for how we think about and react to emerging infectious disease threats.</p><p id="p0045">From the human point of view, the fact that modern endemic diseases emerged and became established, at some unobserved time in the past (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>
) (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Morens et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>), and that some of these diseases survived by adopting complicated long-term survival strategies, provides a compelling rationale for dual strategies for immediate and long-term control. First, in the immediate sense, it is important to mitigate spread of infection, illness, and death. Second, it is critical to prevent the persistence of microbes that may lead to additional emergences that are cumulatively as deadly, or more so, than the original emergences (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Dobson and Carper, 1996</xref>). That viral genetic descendants of the 1918 influenza pandemic virus are still causing seasonal outbreaks throughout the world, and still killing cumulatively millions of people a century later (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Morens and Taubenberger, 2020</xref>), is a powerful reminder that single disease emergences can have consequences beyond immediate morbidity and mortality. In the ancient ongoing struggle between microbes and man, genetically more adaptable microbes have the upper hand in consistently surprising us and often catching us unprepared.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Emerging Infectious Diseases in History</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Year</th><th>Name</th><th>Deaths</th><th>Comments</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>430 BCE</td><td>&#x0201c;Plague of Athens&#x0201d;</td><td>&#x0223c;100,000</td><td>First identified trans-regional pandemic</td></tr><tr><td>541</td><td>Justinian plague (<italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>)</td><td>30&#x02013;50 million</td><td>Pandemic; killed half of world population</td></tr><tr><td>1340s</td><td>&#x0201c;Black Death&#x0201d; (<italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>)</td><td>&#x0223c;50 million</td><td>Pandemic; killed at least a quarter of world population</td></tr><tr><td>1494</td><td>Syphilis (<italic>Treponema pallidum</italic>)</td><td>&#x0003e;50,000</td><td>Pandemic brought to Europe from the Americas</td></tr><tr><td>c. 1500</td><td>Tuberculosis</td><td>High millions</td><td>Ancient disease; became pandemic in Middle Ages</td></tr><tr><td>1520</td><td><italic>Hueyzahuatl</italic> (<italic>Variola major</italic>)</td><td>3.5 million</td><td>Pandemic brought to New World by Europeans</td></tr><tr><td>1793&#x02013;1798</td><td>&#x0201c;The American plague&#x0201d;</td><td>&#x0223c;25,000</td><td>Yellow fever terrorized colonial America</td></tr><tr><td>1832</td><td>2nd cholera pandemic (Paris)</td><td>18,402</td><td>Spread from India to Europe/Western Hemisphere</td></tr><tr><td>1918</td><td>&#x0201c;Spanish&#x0201d; influenza</td><td>&#x0223c;50 million</td><td>Led to additional pandemics in 1957, 1968, 2009</td></tr><tr><td>1976&#x02013;2020</td><td>Ebola</td><td>15,258</td><td>First recognized in 1976; 29 regional epidemics to 2020</td></tr><tr><td>1981</td><td>Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis</td><td>rare deaths</td><td>First recognized in 1969; pandemic in 1981</td></tr><tr><td>1981</td><td>HIV/AIDS</td><td>&#x0223c;37 million</td><td>First recognized 1981; ongoing pandemic</td></tr><tr><td>2002</td><td>SARS</td><td>813</td><td>Near-pandemic</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>H1N1 &#x0201c;swine flu&#x0201d;</td><td>284,000</td><td>5th influenza pandemic of century</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>Chikungunya</td><td>uncommon</td><td>Pandemic, mosquito-borne</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>Zika</td><td>&#x0223c;1,000?<xref rid="tblfn1" ref-type="table-fn">&#x02217;</xref></td><td>Pandemic, mosquito-borne</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Selected important emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases of the past and present, 430 BCE&#x02013;2020 CE.

As COVID-19 is caused by a novel virus (SARS-CoV-2) producing a spectrum of disease whose clinical, pathologic, and epidemiologic patterns have never before been observed, we are gaining insights only incrementally. At some time in the future we will be better able to compare and contrast COVID-19 to other important emerging diseases; however, at this time we are still just entering a steep learning curve that will surely keep surprising us as we struggle to control what is already among the deadliest pandemics of the past century.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Global Daily Incident Cases of COVID-19 by World Health Organization Region as of August 18, 2020</p><p>The data (<xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization</xref>) show that beginning in March 2020, the pandemic exploded in Europe and the Americas, particularly in the United States, was blunted in these two regions between March and May 2020, and then began to explode anew in the Americas and to a lesser extent in Europe beginning in late May.

<italic>Genetic instability of microorganisms</italic> is an inherent property allowing rapid microbial evolution to adapt to ever-changing ecologic niches.

For viruses transmitted by person-to-person mechanisms, transmission by quasispecies may increase the likelihood that one or more viral variants within the quasispecies will be infectious for cells of a new host, leading to infection, viral amplification, and expansion of a new and different quasispecies, facilitating onward transmission (see below).</p><p id="p0105">Other determinants of emerging infectious agents include cell tropism, ability to circumvent innate immune responses, and antigenic immunodominance, among others.

The 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus, which killed an estimated 50 million people (equivalent to 200 million when adjusted to the 2020 population) was particularly lethal because of at least two inherent properties: (1) an avian-descended H1 hemagglutinin (HA) that is unusually cytopathic and immunopathogenic compared to the HAs of most other IAVs and (2) a marked co-pathogenic ability&#x02014;the viral genetic basis of which remains poorly understood&#x02014;to precipitate fatal bacterial bronchopneumonias in association with pneumopathogenic bacteria carried silently in the human upper respiratory tract (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Morens et&#x000a0;al., 2008b</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Morens and Taubenberger, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Taubenberger et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). We now know that not only avian H1s but also 4 of the other 15 avian HAs found within the wild waterfowl and shore birds (<italic>Anseriformes</italic> and <italic>Charidriiformes</italic>) reservoir have similar pathogenic properties, and thus they represent future threats for highly fatal pandemic emergences (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Morens and Taubenberger, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Taubenberger et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). A perhaps even more shocking example of pandemic emergence associated with enhanced pathogenicity is that of Zika, a flavivirus known for decades. Zika had never caused a human epidemic; however, in 2015, it suddenly spread pandemically around the global tropical belt, causing millions of infections and severe fetal losses and birth defects (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Fauci and Morens, 2016</xref>). The apparent cause of the pandemic was a mutation resulting in the change of a single amino acid in the external viral glycoprotein (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Shan et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0140">Pathogenic variability undoubtedly applies to many other virus types, exemplified, for example, by comparing the highly pathogenic Ebola Zaire strain to the closely related but lowly pathogenic Ebola Reston strain (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Baseler et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Although not yet adequately studied, pathogenic variability might also be a property of animal coronaviruses. That all three recently emerging human coronaviruses (the agents of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19) exact a high degree of human morbidity and mortality suggests that enzootic coronaviruses as a whole may be inherently pathogenic for humans. On the one hand, preliminary data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may elicit an unbalanced innate immune response associated with decreased expression of interferons I and III and with increased inflammatory cytokine production (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Mesev et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>), consistent with preliminary COVID-19 findings (<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Vanderheiden et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, preliminary data suggest that viral-bacterial co-pathogenesis may be of somewhat less concern with SARS-CoV-2 than with influenza, measles, and other pathogenic respiratory viruses, although comprehensive clinical/autopsy series have not yet been published.</p><p id="p0145">With regard to coronavirus disease severity, it is worth considering the conventional wisdom (not always correct) that viruses that kill their hosts limit their own ability to be transmitted and that, if&#x000a0;transmitted person to person, they would be expected to be selected for attenuation of pathogenicity over time. It is conceivable that the four endemic coronaviruses of humans&#x02014;the &#x003b2;-coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 and the &#x003b1;-coronaviruses 229E and NL63&#x02014;emerged long ago as zoonotic and perhaps highly pathogenic viruses that evolved into attenuated forms over time (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Cui et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). Such natural attenuation of pathogenicity has not yet been observed with the agents of SARS, MERS, or COVID-19, although with a SARS-CoV-2 case-fatality in the range of 1%, and with evidence for significant asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission in a largely susceptible population, evidence for selection pressures for attenuation may not be detectable in the short term.</p><p id="p0150">Moreover, viral evolution toward lower pathogenicity does not apply to all infectious diseases. For many other organisms such as cholera (expressing a bacteriophage toxin causing diarrhea) or rotavirus infection (with an NSP4 diarrhea-causing toxin), or for cough-inducing tuberculosis and many respiratory viruses, damage to the gastrointestinal tract and lungs, respectively, facilitates transmission, since diarrhea and coughing expel infectious pathogens into the environment, increasing the chance of infecting additional hosts. Disease severity thus reflects a balancing act between killing or incapacitating hosts, on the one hand, and optimizing microbial transmission, and therefore survival, on the other. Similar principles may also apply to non-viral diseases with environmental modes of transmission: for example, with enzootic anthrax, host-killing may be an important transmission mechanism, as rotting carcasses leave anthrax spores in the ground to reignite future infections (<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Turner et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>).

Since a virus replicates within the cells of the host, and since viruses usually infect hosts via specific receptors on the cells of various tissues and organs, the new host must express cellular receptors or other cell-surface properties to which the virus can bind and initiate viral internalization.</p><p id="p0160">Major portals of host entry for infectious agents include those that are visibly external to the environment such as the skin or that can be reached directly from the environment such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, as well as organs reached systemically such as the liver, heart, and other internal organs. Human beings have many different organ systems, each with many different cell types, and with each cell having arrays of different receptors; therefore, it is not surprising that switching of a pathogen from an animal host to humans results in very different clinical and epidemiologic outcomes, including different disease manifestations and transmission mechanisms. These factors ultimately relate to the potential for establishment of infection in the new host as well as the likelihood of sustained transmission within the new host population and, as such, have a bearing on whether host-switching succeeds or fails.</p><p id="p0165">SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter cells via ACE-2 receptors (<xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>), found on lung alveolar epithelial cells, gastrointestinal enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells, among other cell types (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Hamming et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>), which explains the excretion of SARS-CoV-2 and potential transmission via the respiratory and enteric routes. With regard to the latter, although SARS-CoV-2 infects cells of the gastrointestinal tract, fecal transmission has not to date been implicated in significant person-to-person viral spread.

As noted, mechanisms of viral entry into cells are exceedingly variable and complex (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Jayawardena et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Viruses may also infect macrophages and macrophage-like cells, as is the case with mosquito-borne and tick-borne flaviviruses. These viruses are injected into perivascular dermal tissue by their respective vectors and are taken up by dendritic cells and carried to regional lymph nodes, where they initiate systemic infection.

<italic>Tissue/cell tropism</italic> also has a bearing on the types of immune responses that are elicited. For example, in a systemic infection like measles, high-level viremia is associated with infection of multiple organs, tissues, and cell types; the resulting broad systemic B and T&#x000a0;cell responses lead to lifelong protection from reinfection. In contrast, influenza A viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), among many other respiratory viruses that infect surface epithelial cells, do not cause viremia and infect only surface respiratory epithelial cells. As a result, infectious virions do not have intimate interactions with the systemic immune system. The major site of influenza virus-immune system interaction is in the semi-organized tear duct-, nasal-, and mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues (TALT, NALT, and MALT), as well as the post-natally generated inducible bronchus-associated iBALT (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Moyron-Quiroz et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>), leading to tissue compartmentalization of the immune response, perhaps in part explaining the weakly protective immune responses of naturally acquired or vaccine-associated influenza and RSV.</p><p id="p0180">Preliminary evidence from clinical and pathological studies of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which indicate viral infection of multiple tissues, is consistent with elicitation of robust and hopefully long-lasting protective immunity, providing a potential for control of COVID-19 with vaccines.

Most notably, in the influenza pandemics of 1968 and 2009, caused by an H3N2 and an H1N1 virus, respectively, segments of the population had pre-existing immunity that interfered with early viral spread and possibly with viral evolution.

These many ancient and modern examples reflect the extraordinary importance of human population growth and movement in spreading diseases: the more populous and crowded we as a species become, and the more we travel, the more we provide opportunities for emerging diseases.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><title>The Role of the Environment in the Emergence of Infectious Diseases</title><p id="p0215">Many other human activities related to the environment have important consequences for disease emergence (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Allen et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Dobson and Carper, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Fauci and Morens, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Morens et&#x000a0;al., 2020b</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Morens and Fauci, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Morens et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">2008a</xref>, <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Morens and Taubenberger, 2020</xref>).

It is noteworthy that these mechanisms reflect not only human societal practices such as sanitary practices, embracing physical closeness, and sexual activities but also ways in which people interact with the environment such as storage and drinking of water from different sources, food procurement, and food preparation practice. Even so, many variables interact to produce different clinical and epidemiologic aspects of disease transmitted from person to person. For example, while both Ebola and SARS-CoV-2 are potentially fatal diseases transmitted person to person, SARS-CoV-2 is, like most respiratory diseases, associated with asymptomatic infection in many and is often transmitted to others by an asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infected person. Ebola, on the other hand, has a lower frequency of asymptomatic infection and is of low transmissibility right up to the time of illness onset. Moreover, the mechanisms of person-to-person transmission are distinct for these two diseases. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via hands and fomites, respiratory droplets and aerosol, including transmission by superspreading events where large numbers of individuals are infected by a single person, almost invariably in closed crowded settings. Ebola, on the other hand, is transmitted via virus-contaminated bodily secretions, and infection is usually acquired by persons touching contaminated fluids or fomites, for example in providing nursing care, burial services, handling towels, bed linens, utensils, etc. (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Baseler et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>).

As was true of SARS-CoV 18 years ago, the specific determinants of SARS-CoV-2 emergence remain obscure. Gaining a better understanding of the enormous reservoir of bat coronaviruses has been an urgent priority since the 2002 SARS epidemic, and remains so today. Considerable surveillance and phylogenetic and experimental work remains to be done.

Will it, similar to human IAVs in recent centuries, evolve to persist as a permanent human pathogen by mutating to escape the population herd immunity it creates? And if it does persist, will it attenuate over time, as the four endemic coronaviruses may have done centuries ago? Or, on the other hand, will it increase in pathogenicity as the pandemic H3N2 IAV has done over the past 52 years? Because SARS-CoV-2 lacks a segmented genome, we are spared at least one genetic trick (gene reassortment) underlying IAV pandemic emergences; however, like human IAVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be expected to evolve by mutation as it spreads through human populations, and it has the additional capacity of evolving by genetic recombination. Enzootic evidence supports a very high degree of recombination of SARS-like CoVs in nature. Will these capacities allow SARS-CoV-2 to escape from population immunity elicited by natural infection or future vaccination? Only additional time, and much important research, will begin to answer these questions.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>The Enigma of Host-Switching</title><p id="p0250">Perhaps the single biggest mystery of emerging diseases is how microorganisms, including animal-adapted microorganisms, switch species to infect humans. Host-switching from animal to human has long been conceptualized as the crossing of a <italic>fitness valley</italic>, in which a virus adapted to transmitting between members of host species A must somehow simultaneously develop the capacity to productively infect cells of new host species B (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>
) (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Dolan et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Geoghegan and Holmes, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Kuiken et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Parrish et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). In this paradigm, the depth of the fitness valley reflects host-to-host barrier challenges that have to be overcome. Our understanding of mechanisms of viral evolution and host-switching is nevertheless incomplete, in part because of inability to reconcile experimental within-host viral evolutionary findings and natural-world findings that examine viral evolution during outbreaks, including new disease emergences (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Geoghegan and Holmes, 2018</xref>). Among many complicating factors, rapid intense person-to-person transmission of new viruses in large human populations often produces complex genetic diversity, confounding attempts to link viral variation to viral phenotypic changes and selection pressures eliciting them.<fig id="fig5"><label>Figure&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Proposed Molecular Mechanisms of Host-Switching</p><p>Proposed mechanisms of cross-species host-switching of infectious agents (after <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Kuiken et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). Steep (A) and shallow (B) fitness valleys between donor and recipient host species reflect adaptational barriers that need to be crossed. (A) and (C) show that a greater number of sequential adaptational mutations are needed in (A) to cross the fitness valley and then adapt to the new host, as compared to the situation shown in (B) and (D), where greater donor-host similarities facilitate switching. (C) and (D) represent the associated phylogenetic trees: in (C), the donor host and recipient host viruses most go through significant adaptational steps, including those associated with initial transmission in the new host. In (D), the new host receives an infectious agent that is partially pre-adapted; successful emergence requires fewer adaptational mutations.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr5_lrg"/></fig></p><p id="p0255">The situation is particularly complicated for the most important category of newly emerging disease agents: the RNA viruses, which include SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS, Ebola, and influenza, as well as dengue, Zika, and other arboviruses. These viruses evolve as, and are transmitted as, complex quasispecies, or viral swarms, which contain many viral variants of differing degrees of relatedness. It is unclear whether and/or to what extent transmission/host-switching reflects Darwinian evolution of novel virus variants, as opposed to evolution based on whole-quasispecies fitness (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Geoghegan and Holmes, 2018</xref>). In the latter conceptualization, viral quasispecies evolve together as a diverse array of optimally fit, less optimally fit, and least optimally fit variants, trading off perfect host fitness for adaptational flexibility.</p><p id="p0260">While it has long been assumed that the major determinants of host-switching are the evolutionary closeness of hosts A and B and the diversity of their transmitting quasispecies, recent research suggests that pathogen opportunity may be the major determinant of host-switching (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Anishchenko et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Araujo et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). In essence, even a virus poorly fit to a potential host can adapt to infect that host if given enough chances. The implications are profound. If host-switching is opportunity driven, e.g., for SARS- CoV and CoV-2, Nipah, and Hendra, then prevention and control will have to focus not only on the infectious agents themselves but also on human behaviors, such as the animal-human interface, represented by shopping in live animal markets, preparation and consumption of bush meat, intensive farming/animal husbandry, environmental degradation, and other human behaviors (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Allen et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Carroll et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="p0265">Looked at another way, infectious diseases may be emerging into humans with greater frequency than appreciated; however, historically they have not usually achieved sustained-enough transmission that would lead to detection of the emergence. For example, before the recognized emergence of Zika, low human seroprevalence rates had been detected in enzootic areas for decades, but without detection of human outbreaks. Before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, antibodies to it or to closely related sarbecoviruses were detected in humans exposed to bat coronaviruses (<xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). MERS has emerged from dromedary camels to humans on multiple occasions; however, despite limited chains of subsequent human-to-human spread, it has not become an established human disease. H5N1 avian influenza has infected millions of humans; however, only a small percentage manifest a recognized disease (often severe or fatal), and human-to-human transmission has been rarely reported (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Morens and Taubenberger, 2015</xref>). These and many other examples suggest that disease emergence into humans may be common; however, sustained transmission between humans has been a rare occurrence resulting from incompletely understood factors. But in looking at the recent spate of deadly emergences noted above, we must now ask whether human behaviors that perturb the human-microbial status quo have reached a tipping point that forecasts the inevitability of an acceleration of disease emergences.</p><p id="p0270">Such enigmas need to be better understood if we are to control emergences of infectious diseases (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Dobson et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Better understanding of the obscure mechanisms of emergences might allow us to anticipate emergence risks by (1) surveilling and characterizing taxonomic groups of potentially pre-emergent viruses, including viruses that may be the nearest to emerging, e.g., coronaviruses, henipaviruses, flaviviruses, arenaviruses, and filoviruses; (2) conducting intensive research on suspected high-risk viral categories to identify, in experimental animals, conserved epitopes for vaccine development and targets for antiviral therapies; (3) characterizing mechanisms of potential human transmission in experimental animal studies; (4) developing control mechanisms in areas such as animal husbandry, wildlife interaction, and rodent, vector, and mosquito/tick control; (5) devising environmental, land management, wildlife conservation/control programs; and (6) utilizing new virologic, informatic, and technological approaches to understand viral evolution and even predict emergence potential (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Allen et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="p0275">There are many examples where disease emergences reflect our increasing inability to live in harmony with nature. Nipah virus emergence followed agricultural burning of forests, which led to displacement of infected bats; bats then went to roost in trees that shaded intensively farmed pigs that were crowded into small areas, which led to infection of pigs via bat droppings, which in turn led to human outbreaks in pig farmers (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Morens et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). Fish meal farming by fishermen in waters around the globe damages ecosystems by over-fishing and deprives local residents of food sources, leading to poverty and human movement, which exacerbate the potential for disease emergence. In Asia, the fish meal is used for breeding and over-feeding of farmed animals, often in intensive farming practices, which increase the likelihood of zoonotic diseases. Yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika are all associated with urban crowding, poor sanitation, and water storage. Over many centuries, urbanization and crowding has led to rodent infestation and to rodent-borne diseases such as plague, murine typhus, and rat-bite fever. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic reminds us that overcrowding in dwellings and places of human congregation (sports venues, bars, restaurants, beaches, airports), as well as human geographic movement, catalyzes disease spread.</p><p id="p0280">Living in greater harmony with nature will require changes in human behavior as well as other radical changes that may take decades to achieve: rebuilding the infrastructures of human existence, from cities to homes to workplaces, to water and sewer systems, to recreational and gatherings venues. In such a transformation we will need to prioritize changes in those human behaviors that constitute risks for the emergence of infectious diseases. Chief among them are reducing crowding at home, work, and in public places as well as minimizing environmental perturbations such as deforestation, intense urbanization, and intensive animal farming. Equally important are ending global poverty, improving sanitation and hygiene, and reducing unsafe exposure to animals, so that humans and potential human pathogens have limited opportunities for contact. It is a useful &#x0201c;thought experiment&#x0201d; to note that until recent decades and centuries, many deadly pandemic diseases either did not exist or were not significant problems. Cholera, for example, was not known in the West until the late 1700s and became pandemic only because of human crowding and international travel, which allowed new access of the bacteria in regional Asian ecosystems to the unsanitary water and sewer systems that characterized cities throughout the Western world. This realization leads us to suspect that some, and probably very many, of the living improvements achieved over recent centuries come at a high cost that we pay in deadly disease emergences. Since we cannot return to ancient times, can we at least use lessons from those times to bend modernity in a safer direction? These are questions to be answered by all societies and their leaders, philosophers, builders, and thinkers and those involved in appreciating and influencing the environmental determinants of human health.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Summary and Conclusions</title><p id="p0285">SARS-CoV-2 is a deadly addition to the long list of microbial threats to the human species. It forces us to adapt, react, and reconsider the nature of our relationship to the natural world. Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases are epiphenomena of human existence and our interactions with each other, and with nature. As human societies grow in size and complexity, we create an endless variety of opportunities for genetically unstable infectious agents to emerge into the unfilled ecologic niches we continue to create. There is nothing new about this situation, except that we now live in a human-dominated world in which our increasingly extreme alterations of the environment induce increasingly extreme backlashes from nature.</p><p id="p0290">Science will surely bring us many life-saving drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics; however, there is no reason to think that these alone can overcome the threat of ever more frequent and deadly emergences of infectious diseases. Evidence suggests that SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are only the latest examples of a deadly barrage of coming coronavirus and other emergences. The COVID-19 pandemic is yet another reminder, added to the rapidly growing archive of historical reminders, that in a human-dominated world, in which our human activities represent aggressive, damaging, and unbalanced interactions with nature, we will increasingly provoke new disease emergences. We remain at risk for the foreseeable future. COVID-19 is among the most vivid wake-up calls in over a century.
