  <p>Possible role of ACE/ACE2 ratio in therapies against COVID‐19 in the two sexes. It has been proposed that pathological conditions presenting with a high ACE/ACE2 ratio predispose towards worse COVID‐19 outcomes (Gemmati et al., 
   <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Pagliaro &amp; Penna, 
   <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). ACE2 is a membrane‐bound enzyme, whose gene lies on the X chromosome and is up‐regulated by oestrogens in males and females. Throughout the body, the ACE/ACE2 ratio may be lower in women than in men, and this is theoretically protective because of the anti‐inflammatory properties of ACE2. However, it must be kept in mind that ACE2 in the lung may act as the entry gate for COVID‐19, and the ACE/ACE2 ratio may be different in tissues and organs, and that this ratio is influenced by many factors including, exercise, ageing, and diseases (Crisafulli &amp; Pagliaro, 
   <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Therefore, more studies are necessary to clarify the role of the ACE/ACE2 ratio in the two sexes
