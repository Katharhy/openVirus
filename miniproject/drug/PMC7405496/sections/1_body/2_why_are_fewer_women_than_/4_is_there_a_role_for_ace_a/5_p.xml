<p>All in all, the role of ACE2 in the pathophysiology of COVID‐19 is not completely clear: it may act as a Trojan horse, but most evidence indicates that a low membrane‐bound ACE/ACE2 ratio may be beneficial. Indeed, ACE may be pro‐inflammatory and pro‐oxidant, whereas ACE2 may mediate antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory effects (Pagliaro &amp; Penna,

Nevertheless, the inhibition of ACE2 shedding, by regulating the activity of ADAM17 enzyme, has been suggested as a potential therapeutic approach in HF (Patel et al.,
