<p>Throughout the body, because the expression of ACE2 on the X chromosome can be influenced by oestrogens, the ACE/ACE2 ratio may be shifted towards the ACE2/Ang‐1‐7/

However, we have to acknowledge that there are tissue‐ and organ‐specific differences of the ACE/ACE2 ratio, which can be also influenced by exercise (Crisafulli &amp; Pagliaro,

Nevertheless, the beneficial effects by anti‐inflammatory drugs (see below) suggest an important role for inflammation and “cytokine storm” in COVID‐19 lethality (see below).
