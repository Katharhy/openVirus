<p>Clearly, ACE2 permits virus entry into cells, but ACE2 overexpression may protect against damage (by reducing Ang II and forming Ang‐1‐7; Bukowska et al.,

 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). However, ACE2 can be “shed” from endothelial cells, by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=1662" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">ADAM17</ext-link>) resulting in the release of a soluble circulating ACE2‐ectodomain with catalytic function (Patel et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Therefore, the picture is complicated by a different ACE/ACE2 ratio in various tissues and by different roles of membrane‐bound and soluble ACE2. For example, it has been proposed that soluble ACE2 could quench the coronavirus by limiting its attachment to cellular ACE2 (Monteil et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). However, Sama and colleagues (Sama et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) demonstrated that male sex is correlated with elevated plasma ACE2 in heart failure (HF) COVID‐19 patients. Nevertheless, the authors recognize they have no evidence of a correlation between the levels of membrane‐bound ACE2 and enzyme shedding in the two sexes. Actually, soluble ACE2 is increased in HF with preserved and reduced ejection fraction (Patel et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Moreover, the expression of ACE2 seems reduced in post‐menopausal women (Gagliardi, Tieri, Ortona, &amp; Ruggieri, 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Hilliard, Sampson, Brown, &amp; Denton, 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Interestingly, transgender males exposed to oestrogen (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=1013" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">estradiol</ext-link>) and androgen deprivation (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=2875" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">spironolactone</ext-link>) therapies display significantly higher ACE2 expression levels and a higher number of ACE2‐expressing Sertoli cells in the testis. As both oestrogens and androgens decrease with age (Horstman et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>), this decline in hormones is likely to contribute to the reduction of ACE2 expression in both sexes with ageing. However, a 2017 study showed no differences in ACE and ACE2 serum activity between the two sexes, while a lower ACE2 serum activity was observed in younger compared to older women (Fernández‐Atucha et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Overall, it appears that differences in the expression of ACE and ACE2 may be organ‐specific and age‐dependent in both sexes, in animals (Xie, Chen, Wang, Zhang, &amp; Liu, 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0084" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>) and humans (Gagliardi et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Hilliard et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) with a less clear role for soluble ACE2 (Monteil et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Patel et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Sama et al.,
