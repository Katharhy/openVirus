<p>ACE2 is located on the X chromosome and is one of the genes escaping X inactivation (Tukiainen et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0079" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that this plays an important role in determining protection in women. It can be hypothesized that the second X chromosome could protect females from fatal polymorphisms that make the COVID‐19 more aggressive in males, for example, by favouring coronavirus binding. Indeed, in a recent study, worse outcome in older COVID‐19 patients has been attributed to the presence of lower ACE‐2 levels and the subsequent up‐regulation of
