<p>Whether ACE2 levels in the lung are related to the susceptibility and severity of COVID‐19 infection is a matter of investigation (Gheblawi et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). In a preprint paper, it is reported that men may have higher expression of ACE2 in the lungs compared to women (Zhao et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0088" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), with potentially important consequences for COVID‐19 infections, as the respiratory tract is the entry route for SARS‐CoV‐2. However, polymorphisms in both ACE and ACE2 genes can explain the increased capillary permeability, coagulation, fibrosis, and apoptosis of alveolar cells, observed in SARS and COVID‐19 (Gemmati et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Tikellis &amp; Thomas, 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0077" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). These effects can explain lung damage and respiratory failure (see also below Section
