<p>Although some studies suggest that TMPRSS2 is involved in determining severity of influenza in animals and humans (Cheng et al.,

 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), its role during coronavirus infections and in the modulation of COVID‐19 severity is still unclear. Nevertheless, we have to consider that TMPRSS2 is mainly a

 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0078" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>), thus suggesting that COVID‐19 severity could be partially explained by TMPRSS2 up‐regulation in males (McCoy et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Sharifi &amp; Ryan,

 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0080" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Nevertheless, TMPRSS2 expression levels and function are also regulated by oestrogen‐dependent signalling (Setlur et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Intriguingly, an age‐dependent, different and overlapping expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 has been recently described in bronchial cells (Lukassen et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), but whether this may explain sex differences is still unknown. Therefore, the role of TMPRSS2 in determining sex differences in COVID‐19 severity needs to be further studied, as protease inhibitors seem effective in limiting SARS‐CoV‐2 cell entry (Hoffmann et al.,
