<p>Importantly, ACE2 may be protective against ARDS. In mice, ACE2 down‐regulation favoured more severe lung failure (Cheng et al.,

 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0084" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>) in rats showed that lung expression of ACE2 is drastically reduced with ageing in both sexes. As mentioned, the binding of SARSCoV‐2 spike to ACE2 down‐regulates ACE2, thus decreasing

The dysregulation of these factors may explain the pathogenesis of respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension (Gurwitz, 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Horn, Chakinala, Oudiz, Joseloff, &amp; Rosenzweig, 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Moreover, bradykinin accumulation may explain inflammatory processes, cough and fever. Bradykinin also favours both the complement system and coagulation, mechanisms typical of angioedema, sepsis, and cardiovascular dysfunction, as found in COVID‐19 patients (Colarusso, Terlizzi, Pinto, &amp; Sorrentino, 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Actually, a large number of COVID‐19 patients exhibit severe cardiovascular damage (Moccia et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) and, as reported above, patients with pre‐existing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) appear to have an increased risk of death (also see below).
