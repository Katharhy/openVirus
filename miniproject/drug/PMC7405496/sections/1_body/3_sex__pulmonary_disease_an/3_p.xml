<p>Epigenetics may play a role in the different response to the virus. Indeed, some studies suggest that different viruses utilize different epigenetic mechanisms to mediate antigen presentation and gene expression (Menachery et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0093" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Sex hormones influence epigenetic regulation of gene expression in the immune response (Klein &amp; Flanagan, 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Epigenetic compounds (Kiss et al.,

 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Lionetti, Tuana, Casieri, Parikh, &amp; Pierce, 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) may activate Nrf2 in a variety of tissues and could be suggested to patients who present with only a few symptoms, in order to reduce the risk of major complications from COVID‐19. Indeed, exercise is a natural way to increase the expression of ACE2 and to reduce the ACE/ACE2 ratio also in the respiratory tract (Crisafulli &amp; Pagliaro,
