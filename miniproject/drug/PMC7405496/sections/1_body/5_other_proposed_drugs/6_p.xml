<p>A recent study (Fagone et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) investigated the transcriptomic profile in primary human lung cells upon infection with SARS‐CoV‐2. In this study, the transcriptomic profile of lung tissue from healthy men and women were compared with the transcriptomic induced by the virus. It emerged that at ages 40–60 years, the transcriptomic feature of female lung tissue was more similar to those induced by SARS‐CoV‐2 than in male tissue. The authors suggest that a lower threshold of acute response to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in men may, at least partly, explain the lower lethality in women. Nevertheless, the potential factors that might induce this “COVID‐19‐resistant lung phenotype” in middle‐aged women is not clear. In this study, targeting the mammalian target of rapamycin (
