<p>Although these are cumulative/raw data, they confirm that there is a reduced susceptibility of women to severe outcomes from COVID‐19 infection. Due to the differences between pre‐ and post‐menopausal phases (Horstman, Dillon, Urban, &amp; Sheffield‐Moore, 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>), it is reasonable to speculate that there may be a role played by sex hormones in protecting against severe outcome, but it is not the only factor. Therefore, we need to consider other possible reasons for this difference in sex‐related lethality. First, is this difference confirmed also in populations from other countries? According to the latest publications, such differences in lethality between the two sexes have been shown elsewhere (see Table

 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>, Chen, Wu, et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Guan et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Huang et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0081" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Zhou, Yu, et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0089" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). In these studies, severe or deceased patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) were predominantly men, while women ranged between 30% (Huang et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) and 42.2% (Guan et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). In the largest study available from China (Guan et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), quite similar percentages to those reported for deceased women in Italy have been observed. Yet, in this latter study, the median age of patients was 47 years (IQR, 35–58), and the distribution between sexes according to age was not reported. For the United States, sex disaggregated data on case fatality are not available, but deaths were 57% for males and 43% for women (
