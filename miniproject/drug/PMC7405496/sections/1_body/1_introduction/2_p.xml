<p>The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is likely to have started in China (Zhou, Yang, et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0091" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) and rapidly turned into a global pandemic with Europe, the United States, and South America being particularly affected (

 <italic>case fatality</italic> (deaths/reported cases), and sex disaggregated data are now starting to be available for many countries. Looking at male/female ratio for death in confirmed cases, it appears that the ratio is always above 1.1 in 34 out of the 35 countries that provide sex disaggregated data (only for Pakistan, the ratio is 0.9). Many European countries (Spain, Italy, England, Belgium, Greece, Denmark, and The Netherlands) have a male/female ratio for death in confirmed cases equal or above 1.7 (

 <xref rid="bph15207-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Their mean age was 80 years (median, 81; range, 0–100; IQR, 74–87;

Deaths in women were 10,934 (lethality 9.6%), whereas for men there were 17,018 deatha (lethality 17.1%). For 951 Italian deaths, sex was not reported. At the moment of the revision of this article, this trend is confirmed in the majority of countries which provide disaggregated data (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://globalhealth5050.org/covid19/sex-disaggregated-data-tracker/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://globalhealth5050.org/covid19/sex-disaggregated-data-tracker/</ext-link>, accessed on June 28, 2020). In 47 countries, the male/female ratio for death results above 1, and in four countries (Albania, Costa Rica, Thailand, and The Netherlands), this ratio is even above 2. Only in five countries (Finland, Maldives, Pakistan, Slovenia, and Yemen), the male/female ratio for death is below 1, ranging from 0.94 to 0.55 (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://globalhealth5050.org/covid19/sex-disaggregated-data-tracker/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://globalhealth5050.org/covid19/sex-disaggregated-data-tracker/</ext-link>, accessed on June 28, 2020). In the vast majority of countries, the mortality rate among confirmed cases is lower in women than in men. The difference in lethality between sexes may suggest that women are either less prone to develop severe complications or that they are less likely to succumb to the severe complications that ultimately lead to death. The reasons for this sex‐based tolerance are still unknown. Among Italian patients in the age range 10–49 years, only 84 out of 32,345 women died (0.26% lethality), while in the range age of 50–90 years, they were 7975/67,263 (11.9% lethality). Of note, 0.89% of men died (225 deaths over 25,276 cases) in the range 10–49 years, and 21.8% (15,236/69844) in the range 50–90 years. Therefore, lethality seems to increase with age in both sexes, but it is 3.42‐fold higher in young men than in young women (10–49 years) and 1.84‐fold in older men than in older women (50–90 years;
