<p>Therefore, re‐establishing an adequate ACE/ACE2 ratio may lead to better outcomes in COVID‐19. Indeed, COVID‐19 depletes and down‐regulates ACE2 (Moccia et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Therefore, the anti‐inflammatory effect of drugs that activate ACE2 may be exploited as a potential therapy in this setting (Figure 
 <xref rid="bph15207-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Of note, oestrogens significantly down‐regulate ACE levels while up‐regulating ACE2 and MAS receptor expression, thus shifting from the classical RAS/ACE/AT
 <sub>1</sub> receptor axis to the protective RAS/ACE2/MAS axis (Bukowska et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Already in 2017, it was proposed that oestrogens have a protective role in SARS by regulating immune response and limiting SARS‐CoV replication directly (Channappanavar et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Therefore, exogenous oestrogen administration has been proposed for both male and female COVID‐19 patients (Cutolo, Smith, &amp; Paolino, 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Suba, 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0075" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), and a couple of Clinical Trials on the role of sex hormones in COVID‐19 patients are already ongoing (NCT04359329 and NCT04365127). Animal studies on drugs that can limit SARS‐CoV‐2 effects are lacking. Preliminary studies report that this virus may infect ferrets, hamsters, and cats, inducing mild symptoms, but not pigs or birds (Chan et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Shi et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0074" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Interestingly, a very recent preliminary study shows that mice overexpressing human ACE2 may develop COVID‐19‐like signs in response to infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 (Jiang et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). These animals showed different susceptibility and, intriguingly, the male mice showed a higher death rate than the females.
