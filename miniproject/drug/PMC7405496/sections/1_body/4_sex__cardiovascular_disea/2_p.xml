<p>Cardiovascular disease is more prevalent in males, and subjects with cardiovascular dysfunction infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 have a worse prognosis. As already discussed, the poor prognosis of patients with COVID‐19 is related to factors such as male sex, ageing, and underlying diseases, especially dysmetabolic and CVDs (see AlGhatrif et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Moccia et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). For example, among the deceased COVID‐19 patients in Italy, less than 4% had no comorbidity, while more than 60% had three or more comorbidities. Among these, cardiovascular comorbidities were the most represented and included arterial hypertension (about 70% of deceased patients), followed by ischaemic heart disease (about 30%), atrial fibrillation (about 20%), and HF (about 15%;

Most of the deceased patients were elderly (over 65 years) and obese (in the Italian report, obesity is present in 12% of the deceased patients). All these conditions are characterized by an abnormal ACE/ACE2 ratio in humans and animals (Colucci et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Koni &amp; Miyamori, 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Santos et al.,

 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0082" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). It appears that an abnormal ACE/ACE2 ratio is responsible, not only for a high incidence of severe ARDS but also for cardiovascular complications and the high lethality of COVID‐19. Oestrogens up‐regulate the expression of ACE2 in human atrial tissue (Bukowska et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), explaining the higher ACE2 expression in the heart of women. As early as 2002, immediately after the discovery of ACE2, a sex‐dependent role of ACE2 in HF, with less severe impairment in female than in male mice, has been described and subsequently confirmed (Crackower et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>; Patel et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). SARS‐CoV‐2 down‐regulates ACE2, and this may favour the ACE/

 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Indeed, down‐regulation of ACE2 has been observed in pulmonary arterial hypertension. ACE2 down‐regulation and inflammatory response may favour endothelial dysfunction and coagulopathy, thus worsening the CVD (Guzik et al.,

 <xref rid="bph15207-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Therefore, the lower ACE/ACE2 ratio in the female heart may limit coagulopathy and COVID‐19‐induced exacerbation of CVD (Gemmati et al.,
