<p>Significant sex‐related differences are present in the rate of severe cases of COVID‐19. Several potential factors underlying these differences in pathogenic mechanisms are identified at the molecular level. All the above‐mentioned drugs, targeting these mechanisms, would warrant clinical studies. In particular, the ACE/ACE2 ratio must be considered (Figure 
 <xref rid="bph15207-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and drugs that positively influence this ratio should be taken into account. Beside a wide range of factors that may influence outcome, sex should be one of the criteria to consider in order to select the appropriate therapies for the appropriate patients. Indeed, given the striking differences in lethality between the two sexes, we believe that studying sex differences may help to find appropriate therapies for all patients. Only large unbiased studies considering all factors and hypotheses mentioned here concerning sex differences may explain why women are less at risk of dying from COVID‐19 and might help to find patient‐tailored therapies. It is, therefore, recommended that sex‐disaggregated data are provided for all COVID19 studies.
