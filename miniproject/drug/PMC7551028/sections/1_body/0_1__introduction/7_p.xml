<p>One of the most significant examples is the currently ongoing global outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19. In current studies, commercially available drugs used to treat other diseases such as HIV and malaria are being carefully evaluated as treatments for COVID-19. Multiple types of drugs such as antimalarials, antivirals and antibiotics are being considered as potential treatments for COVID-19 either individually or in combination. Many are undergoing clinical trials to be evaluated for safety and efficacy in humans. An early example in research was the use of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in combination with azithromycin, which generated deep interest in the potential of Chloroquine (CQ) and its derivates for consideration as a potential treatment for COVID-19 [

In this review, we discuss how drug repositioning plays a crucial role in tackling epidemics and pandemics where little or no treatment is available, for orphan diseases and personalised medicine. Also, we present the current state of research, significance, prospects and challenges in drug repositioning.
