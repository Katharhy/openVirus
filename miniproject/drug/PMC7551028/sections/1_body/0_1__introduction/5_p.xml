<p>Drug repositioning plays a very crucial role in drug development, as it lowers the overall developmental costs by approximately $300 million. Also, drug repositioning results in lower development risk as the safety of the repositioned drugs has already been well established in humans and other preclinical models. Apart from that, this approach has a much shorter development timeline, as there is no need to repeat the safety assessment and formulation development protocols since they are already in place [

Furthermore, drug repositioning dictates high investment potential on old drugs, which were initially forfeited especially for long-term safety reasons. For instance, the Thalidomide tragedy which became widespread across Europe, Australia and Japan reported more than 10,000 children with an inborn defect known as phocomelia, where the limbs were severely underdeveloped or absent [

However, with a safer and more careful approach, the company Celgene successfully repositioned Thalidomide into an effective cancer drug therapy for multiple myeloma. In the year 2003 alone, it successfully captured $271 million in revenue [
