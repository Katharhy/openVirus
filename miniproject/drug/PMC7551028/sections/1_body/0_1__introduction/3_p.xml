<p>The above factors have driven numerous drug developers to pursue different alternative approaches for new drug discoveries. One such example is improvising existing drugs with an enhanced formulation such as extended-release and better dosing frequency. The existing drug Valproate IR (immediate-release) has been modified to ER (extended-release) for the treatment of epilepsy. Valproate ER has driven numerous promising outcomes with drug compliance of up to 71% as compared to 40% on the IR version [

It has been significantly improved in dosing frequency over the traditional methylphenidate like Ritalin, which requires up to three doses daily as opposed to a single daily dose for Concerta [

Also, being an extended-release drug, Concerta significantly improves drug adherence of patients and reduces side-effects such as nausea, vomiting, high blood pressure, irritability, sweating and numbness as it is gradually released in the blood.
