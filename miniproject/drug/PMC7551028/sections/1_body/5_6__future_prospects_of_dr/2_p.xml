<p>COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a positive-strand single-stranded RNA virus with a genome size of approximately 29.8 to 29.9 kilobase pairs [
 <xref rid="B84-viruses-12-01058" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. This virusâ€™ genome is reported to have 14 open reading frames (ORFs) that encode for 27 viral proteins [
 <xref rid="B85-viruses-12-01058" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The most prominent viral protein in the structure of SARS-CoV-2 is the spike (S) protein or spike surface glycoprotein known for its large role in host cell membrane fusion and viral entry. Other SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins include the matrix protein (M), nucleocapsid protein (N) and the small envelope protein (E) [
