<p>The exact mechanism of action for CQ and HCQ are yet to be fully discovered, especially in the context of this viral outbreak. The classical mechanism of action for CQ as an antimalarial drug involves preventing the polymerisation of Heme residues [

 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is a parasite that causes malaria disease in humans. For this parasite to grow whilst living within a host, it depends on amino acids from haemoglobin for essential nutrients. Once haemoglobin is broken down into amino acids, the Heme residues remain, which are toxic to the parasite. To protect itself from the toxic effect of Heme accumulation, the parasite polymerises Heme into Hemozoin. Therefore, CQ interferes here to prevent this polymerisation, thus leading to the accumulation of Heme within the parasite, consequently killing the parasite [

The mechanism of action of CQ against other parasites may be similar or entirely different, and therefore, further studies to elucidate the mechanism of action against other parasites such as viruses are always required. CQ has been reported previously to block virus infection in a few ways such as through increasing the pH in endosomal environments while virus-cell fusion occurs or by interfering with SARS-CoV surface receptors via glycosylation [
