<p>Apart from that, Auranofin has also shown a positive outcome in fighting HIV. One of the stumbling blocks to eradicate HIV is the harbouring of memory CD4 T cells. For HIV to replicate, the virus must attach itself to the host’s CD4 T cells. Subsequently, it will then fuse with the CD4 T cells. The HIV will then take over the host cell’s translation machinery, incorporate its RNA into the cell and produce its viral proteins to assemble and release [

 <xref rid="B80-viruses-12-01058" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. This study assessed and discovered that Auranofin successfully inhibited key factors in melanogenesis by inhibiting tyrosinase activity, significantly down-regulating cAMP levels and increasing the number of melanosomes in immature stages. With this promising outcome, repositioning Auranofin can undoubtedly benefit patients by providing a cheaper and effective alternative drug against metronidazole-resistant giardiasis, HIV and hyperpigmentation.
