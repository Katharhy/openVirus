<p>Drug repositioning has paved the path for the development of orphan drugs for orphan diseases. Orphan diseases (ODs) are denoted as a disease with a rare occurrence, affecting only a small population, typically less than 200,000, in which no effective treatment is available [

 <xref rid="B61-viruses-12-01058" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. This phenomenon is primarily due to the overall low drug demand [

The rapid increase of rare or orphan diseases estimated to affect up to 20% of the worldâ€™s population has driven governments and private pharmaceutical/biotechnology companies to explore cost-effective approaches by evaluating existing drugs [

Drug repositioning plays a crucial part in this perturbing situation in exterminating life-threatening and debilitating rare/orphan diseases, pulling the gap closer between the availability of drug treatment to diseases within a population.
