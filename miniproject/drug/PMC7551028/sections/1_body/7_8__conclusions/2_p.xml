<p>It is essential to highlight that drug repositioning attempts are crucial for the search for effective therapy in an urgent pandemic such as the COVID-19. Research and clinical evaluations are strongly urged to continue to evaluate the repositioning potential of existing drugs which yield significant alleviation in disease symptoms. In the current quest for a cure, a significant consideration is being given to existing antiviral drugs such as Ribavirin, Favipiravir and Remdesivir, amongst many other drugs. A call for more government participation in sponsoring research and development projects, via research grants, tax incentives, infrastructure or clinical cooperation support can bring exponential growth to future projects in drug repositioning.</p>
