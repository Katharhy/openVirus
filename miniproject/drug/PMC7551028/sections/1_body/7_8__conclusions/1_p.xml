<p>Despite the drawbacks and stigmas, drug repositioning still holds significant interest and potential for pharmaceutical companies and researchers for new discoveries and a new life for old drugs. New high throughput screening techniques coupled with advanced computational methods such as signature matching, molecular docking, GWAS and pathway mapping, old drugs should be relooked at and reconsidered with the aim of repositioning. Drug repositioning brings many benefits ranging from high capital returns, low developmental cost and a relatively low risk of failure to significantly reduced time to reach industrial-scale production and commercialisation. Besides, drug repositioning opens new opportunities for orphan diseases, pandemic outbreaks and highly resistant diseases. This approach is especially evident in repositioning drug Thalidomide, where a safe development resulted in new hope for multiple myeloma and brought in revenue of $271 million USD. Also, drugs with modified formulations such as Valproate and Concerta, for instance, attained enhanced activity as compared to their initial development for epilepsy and hyperactive disorder, respectively. Orphan diseases such as Cushingâ€™s syndrome and TSC obtained promising treatments through the repositioned drugs Korlym and Everolimus, successfully alleviating the symptoms in the affected patient. Apart from that, drug repositioning allows the development of personalised medication, which benefits not only the biotechnology and pharmacological companies but also the affected patients, who are provided with a more affordable drug with an increased efficacy against their aliment. </p>
