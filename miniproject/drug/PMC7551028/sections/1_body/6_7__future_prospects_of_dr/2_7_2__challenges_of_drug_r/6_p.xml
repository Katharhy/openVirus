Additionally, a lack in reporting of data or patients from the clinical settings may pose a limitation in identifying drug targets for rare or orphan diseases, making the practice of drug repositioning much harder. On a related note, as some drug targets are identified via in vitro experimentation, another limitation includes failure in pursuing a potential candidate drug that goes beyond the initial studies [
