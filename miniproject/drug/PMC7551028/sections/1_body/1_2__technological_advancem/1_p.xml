<p>Concerning the advancements in cell-based screening, multiplex assays, data mining, in-silico bioinformatics and cheminformatics databases, pharmaceutical industries have shown an increased interest in exhuming compounds that were once failed in development due to many reasons [

Typically, there are three steps before considering repositioning a drug: (1) the identification of candidate molecules for the given indication; (2) the theoretical assessment of the drug effect in preclinical models; and (3) the evaluation of safety efficacy in phase II clinical trials [

Using these approaches individually or in combination, it can form hypotheses on generating candidates for drug repositioning. A computational approach is typically driven by a massive amount of data, which entails the use of the genetic expression, chemical structure and proteomic data of the drug candidates. There are a few computational approaches that are widely used today, such as signature matching, computational molecular docking, genome-wide associated studies (GWAS), pathway mapping, retrospective clinical analysis and novel sources of drug repurposing studies [
