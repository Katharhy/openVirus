<p>While AI is a part of computer-aided drug design (CADD), this computational approach has been applied for drug discovery and repositioning for decades. The prime machine learning (ML) theories, such as the logistic regression (LR), naive Bayesian classifier (NB), k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, multiple linear regression (MLR), Gaussian process [

Today, the ML theory, accompanied by the advancement of AI, have moved forward to deep learning (DL) methods which promote stronger data processing accompanied by reliable results in the shortest possible time and with high cost-efficiency. For instance, with the use of the deep neural network (DNN), Ma and colleagues have successfully overcome a few limitations. As such, the difficulty in training and screening a large number of compounds accompanied by the improvement in the prediction accuracy of the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) method is essential for predicting on- and off-target activities in drug discoveries [

The DTI in drug repositioning lies within the traditional ligand and structure-based methods which utilise the QSAR to predict biological activities of target molecules with the assumption of structurally similar molecules that give almost similar biological activities and authentic molecular docking imitations [

For instance, a DL based algorithm framework namely, the DeepDTIs, has successfully predicted new DTIs between approved drugs and targets accurately without the need to separate the targets into different classes. The DeepDTIs has also been proven to outperform the other ML methods such as the random forest [
