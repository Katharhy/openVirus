<p>With the advancement of Computational Artificial Intelligence, the barrier and limitation of a computational approach for drug repositioning can also be vastly reduced. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be simply defined as the mimicking of human intelligence demonstrated by machines which entail reasoning, planning, learning and perception to maximise the chances of achieving different goals under extreme load and urgencies like pandemics or diseases of unknown aetiology. The emergence of AI is inevitable, especially in the context of the ever-complex process of drug discovery and repositioning. With the ever-expanding large pool of chemical and biological data, the need for powerful computing and algorithms for data mining is urgent to ensure a fast, high efficiency and low-cost drug discovery process [
