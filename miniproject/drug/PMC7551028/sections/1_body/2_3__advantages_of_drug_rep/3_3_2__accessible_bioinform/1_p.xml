<p>There are vast opportunities that arise from drug repositioning, in which researchers can pinpoint existing drugs that recognise specific targets based on the prior discoveries, without having to perform major experiments. This is achievable with the ever-expanding bioinformatics and cheminformatics databases such as the proteomic database (UniProt), genomic databases (Entrez-Gene) and pharmaceutical databases (DrugBank/Drug Central/PubChem), providing the necessary gene expression and chemical structures, in which relevant candidates can be screened for drug repositioning [

These unconventional in-silico strategies for drug repositioning are driven by massive amounts of data generated via various data mining tools and web technologies, such as PubMed Boolean-type online searching tools, making the retrieval of information more accessible [
