<p>Two patents in Korea present the use of RNA aptamers for inhibiting SARS‐CoV. One (KR2009128837) showed that RNA aptamers can combine with the helicase of SARS‐CoV to inhibit the unwinding of double‐stranded DNA. The other one (KR2012139512) indicated the potential therapeutic value of RNA aptamers with unique affinity for the SARS‐CoV nucleocapsid. Based on the above results, RNA aptamers may be another potential biological agent for combating SARS‐CoV‐2, similar to the treatment of SARS‐CoV.</p>
