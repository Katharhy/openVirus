<p>ASOs have also been designed to detect SARS‐CoV infections and to prevent or cure SARS‐CoV‐related disease (Lim et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Before the occurrence of SARS‐CoV‐2, a patent application submitted by Ionis Pharmaceuticals (WO2005023083) showed hybrid DNA/RNA ASOs designed for disrupting the pseudoknot in the site of the SARS‐CoV RNA frame shift. In addition to inhibiting the virus directly, ASOs are also expected to target the disease‐related proteins involved in the inflammatory cytokine storm process, which could be considered a promising therapeutic strategy for combating SARS‐CoV‐2 (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Therefore, ASOs may be a class of biological agents useful for the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2, similar to the situation for SARS‐CoV.
