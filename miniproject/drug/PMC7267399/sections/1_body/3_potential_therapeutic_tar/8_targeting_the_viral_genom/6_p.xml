Although the viral genome may be a potential target of siRNAs, RNA aptamers, ASOs, and nucleoside analogues for SARS‐CoV‐2, as was observed for SARS‐CoV, this approach presents several challenges. One of the most important challenges is the delivery of oligonucleotides into the lungs (Youngren‐Ortiz, Gandhi, Espana‐Serrano, &amp; Chougule, 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0109" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). In addition, even if siRNAs, RNA aptamers, ASOs, and other biological resources are effective clinically, a further significant problem will be how to scale up the production of these biological agents to treat large numbers of infected patients (Liu &amp; Gou 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Therefore, we have a long way to go to reach the goals for the production of these potential biological agents (siRNAs, RNA aptamers, and ASOs).
