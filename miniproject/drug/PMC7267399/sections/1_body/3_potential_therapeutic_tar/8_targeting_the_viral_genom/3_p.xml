<p>Recent studies have shown that two double‐stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) specifically bind to two separate regions of the mRNA of SARS‐CoV protein M, which was described in the patent application CN101173275. siRNA‐M1 binds to the 220‐241 position in the nucleic acid sequence of protein M mRNA, corresponding to two chemical substance registration numbers (CAS RNs), 1023405‐01‐7 and 1023405‐02‐8, while siRNA‐M2 binds to the 460‐480 position, corresponding to 1023405‐03‐9 and 1023405‐04‐0. Expression data analysis showed that the interference efficiencies of both siRNA‐M1 and siRNA‐M2 for the SARS‐CoV M protein gene were greater than 70% (Liu, Xiao, et al.,

In addition, the patent application CN1569233 describes promising siRNAs targeting SARS‐CoV genes that encode main components, including RdRP, the nucleoprotein N, and proteolytic enzymes. These siRNAs are reported to have a significant inhibitory or killing effect of approximately 50–90% of the SARS‐CoV virus BJ01 strain, in which the most effective are proteolytic enzyme‐targeted siRNAs. Based on these findings, siRNA may be a potential biological agent for consideration as a treatment strategy to kill SARS‐CoV‐2.
