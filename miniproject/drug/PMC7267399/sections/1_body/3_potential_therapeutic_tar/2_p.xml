<p>We know that the outbreaks of SARS‐CoV‐2 will be controlled with ideal drugs or effective vaccines and these therapies will eventually end the pandemic. However, what worries us most is that many existing, traditional, models of drug and vaccine development are inadequate for this outbreak. A long drawn out process, over several months or years, cannot rescue, in a timely manner, those patients who are dying or the failing economy. Vaccine and drug research and development should be given most attention because there is currently no ideal solution to clear SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, despite the immediate pressing need to identify symptomatic strategies to ease suffering and prevent potential death (Morse, Lalonde, Xu, &amp; Liu, 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0071" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Therefore, accelerating research for potential therapeutic target confirmation, promising drug discovery, and clinical verification development will speed up efforts to combat SARS‐CoV‐2. Based on the current studies, we summarize the potential therapeutic targets involved in virus transmission, infection, and pathogenesis processes. Additionally, we discuss the advances, possibilities, and significance of promising drugs based on these targets for combating SARS‐CoV‐2 (Figure
