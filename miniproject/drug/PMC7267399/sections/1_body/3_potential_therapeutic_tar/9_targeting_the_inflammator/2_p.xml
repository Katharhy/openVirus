<p>Although many strategies have been used to block the attachment, entry, replication, and release processes to inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, how to prevent viral evasion from host immune responses and virus‐induced cytopathic effects is considered one of the most urgent problems that need to be solved in SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced pneumonia‐associated respiratory syndrome (PARS) patients. Studies from SARS‐CoV‐induced deaths and animal models have shown that an aberrant and excessive host inflammatory cytokine storm results in a strong immunopathological response and lethal disease (Hui &amp; Zumla,

 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0086" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>), which was also confirmed in SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced PARS patients based on pathological features and autopsies. The phrase “inflammatory cytokine storm” refers to the dysfunction of the immune system and an excessive inflammatory response that becomes uncontrollable (Chen, Zhang, Ju, &amp; He, 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), and it is closely associated with multiple infectious and non‐infectious conditions and diseases including graft‐versus‐host disease, autoimmune disease, severe virus infection, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)‐T cell therapy (Channappanavar &amp; Perlman, 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Giavridis et al.,

 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0081" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). During infection, CD4‐positive T cells (CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells) are rapidly activated to form pathogenic T helper (Th) 1 cells and to produce GM‐CSF. The cytokine condition contributes to CD14

 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0119" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Recently, several clinical reports revealed that most patients infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 have increased plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins (

 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Huang et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Peeri et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0075" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). These clinical indicators reveal the presence of severe pulmonary inflammation and the production of inflammatory cytokine storms during SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Therefore, symptomatic treatments, especially strategies to eliminate inflammation and inflammatory cytokine storms, combined with organ support, in these critically ill patients are the most critical part of clinical management (Zumla, Hui, Azhar, Memish, &amp; Maeurer, 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0124" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Therefore, the inflammatory cytokine storm is a promising research and therapeutic target that may not only identify the immunopathological mechanism but also benefit the discovery of potential drugs.
