<p>As it takes a long time to evaluate and develop specific new drugs targeting SARS‐CoV‐2, several currently marketed drugs that target inflammatory cytokine storms and reduce immunopathology could be considered at this critical moment.

To date, a treatment programme utilizing tocilizumab based on conventional therapy has been administered to 20 patients (including 18 severe cases and two critical cases). The elevated body temperature was reduced to normal within 24 h, which was accompanied by varying degrees of improvement in the oxygenation index of respiratory function. After 2 weeks of careful treatment by the scheme, 19 patients recovered, and only one patient became severely ill due to critical illness (Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0119" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). This treatment programme utilizing tocilizumab based on conventional therapy has been carried out in many hospitals in Wuhan, China, and has achieved good results, which indicates that tocilizumab is a drug with great potential for targeting the inflammatory cytokine storm on the basis of conventional treatment (Xinhua Daily,

 <sub>50</sub> of 5.12 μM. Additionally, it significantly suppressed CpG‐induced IL‐6 production by 50% and 73% in peripheral blood mononuclear cells at 1 and 3 μM concentrations after 12 h, respectively. These findings suggests that CVL218 has a significant anti‐inflammatory cytokine storm effect, which is closely associated with SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced immunopathology prevention, especially for intensive care unit (ICU) patients (Ge et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Further in vivo pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies showed that CVL218 is distributed mainly in lung tissue without apparent toxicity, which makes it a valuable candidate for the treatment of inflammatory cytokine storms induced by SARS‐CoV‐2.
