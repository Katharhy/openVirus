<p>PLpro is a protease responsible for processing the polypeptide translated from the virus genetic material to form structural and non‐structural proteins, which play important roles in the processes of virus replication, assembly, and generation (Ma‐Lauer et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). When infected with MERS‐CoV or SARS‐CoV, PLpro also acts as a de‐ubiquitinase to promote the de‐ubiquitination of proteins, including IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF‐κB, to reduce the immune function and immunoreaction of host cells (Bekes et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Clasman, Everett, Srinivasan, &amp; Mesecar, 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). These capacities determine the important roles of PLpro in the virus replication and infection processes. A recent study demonstrated that PLpro in SARS‐CoV‐2 shares approximately 83% sequence identity with PLpro in SARS‐CoV at the protein level. The residue variations between the two original sequences are present throughout the entire surface of PLpro (Morse, Lalonde, Xu, &amp; Liu, 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0071" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). These amino acid composition differences are supposed to influence the interaction between the two PLpro enzymes and their ligands (Baez‐Santos, St, &amp; Mesecar, 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Ratia, Kilianski, Baez‐Santos, Baker, &amp; Mesecar, 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0080" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). However, there were no distinct differences in the three secondary structure components that formed the active sites of the two PLpro proteins, which indicated that PLpro should be considered a potential enzyme target for the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2. As research continues, several X‐ray crystallography studies have helped to characterize PLpro enzymes and identify PLpro‐related inhibitors (Hilgenfeld, 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). To date, different classes of SARS‐CoV PLpro inhibitors have been identified, including thiopurine compounds, small molecule inhibitors, natural products (tanshinones, geranylated flavonoids, and diarylheptanoid inhibitors), zinc ions, zinc conjugates, and one or more naphthalene inhibitors (Baez‐Santos, St, &amp; Mesecar, 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). The identified

 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). To date, no inhibitor targeting PLpro has been confirmed to be effective against SARS‐CoV‐2. However, the successful experience of designing inhibitors targeting SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV PLpro enzymes with antiviral activity and selectivity shows that there is a good possibility that specific inhibitors targeting SARS‐CoV‐2 PLpro could be as effective.
