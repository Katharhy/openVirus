<p>During the replication process of RNA viruses, RdRP determines the fidelity and the rates of replication and mutation of the virus to condition its adaptation to the environment and even to a new host, thus influencing the evolution of the virus (Hukowska‐Szematowicz, 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Targeting RdRP has become recognized as one of the most important means for the treatment of SARS‐CoV. Although SARS‐CoV shares approximately 82% sequence identity with SARS‐CoV‐2 at the level of genomic RNA, their RdRP enzymes share approximately 96% sequence identity at the protein level. A high level of protein sequence conservation of RdRP indicates that almost all of the potent agents developed targeting SARS‐CoV RdRP are likely to inhibit the RdRP of SARS‐CoV‐2 (Kirchdoerfer &amp; Ward, 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Although not yet approved for clinical trials, several agents targeting RdRP‐mediated generation and RdRP‐catalysed polymerization of SARS‐CoV have potential research value for SARS‐CoV‐2. Aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), a known anionic polymer, is known to combine with several protein targets, such as gp120 and E‐selectin, and to prevent the replication of SARS‐CoV through binding to RdRP with an IC

However, whether to choose RBV as a candidate drug is unclear, as some studies have shown a worsening of patient outcomes after RBV administration, indicating that RBV (at least itself) is not a good choice for anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 drug development (Stockman, Bellamy, &amp; Garner, 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0087" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Zhang, Huang, Zheng, &amp; Dai, 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0110" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Favipiravir is a new type of RdRP inhibitor. Research shows that favipiravir is activated through phosphoribosylation in cells to form favipiravir‐RTP, which is considered a substrate for viral RNA polymerase, thereby binding with RdRP to inhibit its activity (Furuta, Komeno, &amp; Nakamura, 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). A favipiravir clinical trial (ChiCTR2000029600) for treating SARS‐CoV‐2 infection achieved the expected results. In the clinical trial, a total of 80 patients were divided into two groups, that is, a control group and a favipiravir intervention group. The results showed that favipiravir has a better anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 effect than similar drugs (lopinavir/ritonavir). In addition, another prospective, multicentre, open‐label, randomized superiority trial (ChiCTR200030254) has come to the similar conclusion that favipiravir (1,600 mg bid on the first day; 600 mg bid from the second day to the end of treatment) should be regarded as one of the most promising candidate drugs for combating SARS‐CoV‐2 due to its higher rate of 7‐day clinical recovery and more effectively decreasing the incidence of clinical symptoms, such as fever and cough, than the currently recommended drug, arbidol (Chen, Huang et al.,
