<p>The main viral protease is also known as 3C‐like main protease (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=3111" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">3CLpro</ext-link>) due to its similar cleavage site specificity to that of picornavirus 3C protease (3Cpro) (Zhao, Weber, &amp; Yang, 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0117" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that 3CLpro is one of the most crucial proteases for RdRP generation, virus replication, and infection (Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0118" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Similar to the RdRP protein, SARS‐CoV‐2 and SARS‐CoV share approximately 96% 3CLpro sequence identity at the protein level (Morse et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0071" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Under natural conditions, 3CLpro easily forms a dimer through hydrogen bonds. In‐depth structure analysis found that each monomer contains two main regions, the N‐terminal catalytic region and the C‐terminal region, and that the difference is dependent mainly on the catalytic region located on the protein surface (Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Because SARS‐CoV‐2 may share with SARS‐CoV similar possible interactions of substrates or inhibitors towards its active sites, imperceptible structural alterations from A to S residues are not expected to significantly affect the binding characteristics of substrates and inhibitors to those active sites. Therefore, 3CLpro is expected to become another potential enzyme target for the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2. Lopinavir and

 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0077" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) and are now used mainly for HIV in combination with other drugs, that is, the commonly discussed antiviral cocktails. At present, several studies have shown that the two 3CLpro inhibitors have anti‐CoV properties both in vitro and in MERS‐CoV‐infected primates (not humans), and they have also shown activity in non‐randomized trials of SARS‐CoV patients (Wu et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0100" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Based on these results, lopinavir and ritonavir may also be promising drugs for SARS‐CoV‐2 treatment. Interestingly, treatment with a formulation of lopinavir and ritonavir in tablet form (800/200 mg·day
 <sup>−1</sup>) called Kaletra can quickly improve clinical symptoms by inhibiting SARS‐CoV‐2 replication (Han et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Moreover, a joint research team reported that there are approximately 30 candidate agents with potential antiviral activity against SARS‐CoV‐2 after virtual drug screening (in silico and enzyme activity test) on January 25, 2020, including lopinavir and ritonavir. Even though this combination has produced a high screening score, its effectiveness remains controversial due to the accidental consequences caused by the small sample size or combination with other promising drugs. To date, several clinical trials (such as ChiCTR2000029539, ChiCTR2000029603, and ChiCTR2000029759) have been approved in China to test the effectiveness of HIV protease inhibitors such as lopinavir and ritonavir in patients infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. However, an increasing number of clinical trials (such as NCT04252885 and ChiCTR2000029308) have not achieved the desirable results (no benefit was observed), indicating that this combination has most likely failed (Cao et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Zhu, Lu, et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0121" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Although hopes are fading for treatment with lopinavir and ritonavir, targeting 3CLpro is still a potential therapeutic strategy for combating SARS‐CoV‐2. As research has continued, a growing number of low MW inhibitors have been found to have high potential therapeutic effects against SARS‐CoV‐2 by targeting 3CLpro. Sun et al. found nine promising low MW inhibitors for the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2 after optimization based on targeting 3CLpro by 32,297 potential antiviral medicinal plant compounds (Sun, Wong, &amp; Gou, 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0089" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Moreover, Alessandro et al. screened multiple promising therapeutic drugs for SARS‐CoV‐2, such as indinavir, atazanavir, and 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=7535" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">cobicistat</ext-link>, among FDA‐approved drugs, by virtual screening. In addition, Zhang, Lin, et al. (
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0113" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) reported that α‐ketoamides can inhibit coronavirus and enterovirus replication as low MW inhibitors; among them, compound 11b is likely to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 replication with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.67 μΜ (Zhang, Wu, et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0113" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Based on the above research, we believe that low MW inhibitors that potently inhibit 3CLpro are promising drugs for SARS‐CoV‐2.
