Although there have been no related approved inhibitor‐based anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 therapies so far, those candidate compounds, especially remdesivir, could serve as potential leads and clinical medicines for developing effective anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 drugs with interpretation of the crystal structure of replicases.
