<p>In a review of past research, we found that coronavirus genomic RNA acts as the transcript to induce ORF1a translation in a cap‐dependent manner to form the polyprotein ppan after entering and uncoiling in the host cell. Near the end of ORF1a, there are two important structures, that is, a slippery sequence and an RNA pseudoknot, which were reported to be important for inducing 25–30% of ribosomes to undergo frame shifting, thereby promoting ORF1b translation to provide the longer polyproteins

Through the functional study of nsps, researchers found that nsp12 encodes RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) (Xu et al.,
