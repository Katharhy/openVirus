<p>Moreover, no significant adverse reactions were observed, and relatively high patient compliance was noted in the favipiravir treatment group, indicating that favipiravir is a potential anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 drug that requires particular attention (Dong, Hu, &amp; Gao,

 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Recently, Wang et al. found that remdesivir can effectively prevent the infection of SARS‐CoV‐2 at a very low concentration with a relatively high efficiency of selection (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.77 μM and a half‐cytotoxic concentration [CC
 <sub>50</sub>] &gt; 100 μM [SI &gt; 129.87]), suggesting that remdesivir is very likely to be a potential drug against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (Wang, Cao et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0096" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Furthermore, a report that remdesivir achieved the expected treatment effect in a patient infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 in the United States attracted much attention (Holshue et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Currently, remdesivir has become the most promising drug that has entered the Phase III clinical trial stage, shedding new light on the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced disease. Based on the above research, RdRP is one of the most promising therapeutic targets, and RdRP inhibitors (such as aurintricarboxylic acid, favipiravir, and remdesivir) will be the most promising drugs for SARS‐CoV‐2.
