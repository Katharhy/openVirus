<p>In addition to the S protein and ACE2, another study suggested that proteases may help activate the S protein by priming it to promote SARS‐CoV‐2 cellular entry. The endosomal cysteine proteases

 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Research has found that SARS‐CoV‐2 can use TMPRSS2 rather than CatB/L for S protein priming, and the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 might also be intimately associated with TMPRSS2 activity. In addition, an in vitro study found that the serine protease inhibitor

 <sup>+</sup>) cells rather than 293T (TMPRSS2
 <sup>−</sup>) cells (Hoffmann et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). This result indicates that blocking TMPRSS2 should be considered a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected patients. More remarkably, camostat mesylate has already been approved for safety for the treatment of pancreatic inflammatory disease in Japan, which reminds us that camostat mesylate should be given sufficient consideration as a promising therapeutic drug for combating SARS‐CoV‐2 without safety concerns (Gibo et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). According to a new finding from the University of Tokyo, a comparable drug named 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=4262" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">nafamostat</ext-link> mesylate can prevent TMPRSS2‐triggered SARS‐CoV‐2 membrane fusion at a concentration less than one‐tenth that of camostat mesylate, suggesting that nafamostat mesylate may also be a promising inhibitor of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection by targeting TMPRSS2 (Inoue, 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). As these two drugs have been prescribed in Japan for many years and have adequate clinical data with regard to safety, we expect that they can enter clinical trials for treating SARS‐CoV‐2 as soon as possible. More importantly, this process of diverting the two TMPRSS2 inhibitors into treating SARS‐CoV‐2 reminds us that searching for new therapeutic activities in marketed drugs that have been confirmed to be safe (drug repurposing) appears to be a good strategy and extremely worthwhile.
