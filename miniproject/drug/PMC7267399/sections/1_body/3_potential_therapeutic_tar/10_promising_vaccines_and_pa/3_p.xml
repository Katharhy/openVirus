<p>In addition to vaccines, a simple but potentially very effective strategy that could be used for combating SARS‐CoV‐2 is using convalescent patient sera, which can be obtained from patients who have recovered from virus infection. This passive strategy has been shown to be effective in the treatment of other viral diseases (Mire et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Based on experience, patients with resolved infection will develop viral antibodies at a high titre in response to different antigens of SARS‐CoV‐2 (Li, Wang, et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). One or more passive antibodies derived from convalescent patient sera will be likely to neutralize SARS‐CoV‐2 and prevent new rounds of infection. During the outbreak of Ebola in 2014–2015, this rationale was used to treat Ebola patients with convalescent serum and achieved very good results (Kraft et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). At present, in China, many patients with resolved cases of SARS‐CoV‐2 said they are willing to donate plasma if necessary. If possible, this plasma can be transfused into other infected patients to help them overcome viral infections. As plasma donation is a mature technology, and plasma transfusion is also a part of routine medical care, this proposal is the simplest and most feasible treatment under consideration (Thorpe, Masser, Nguyen, &amp; Davison, 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0091" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). At the same time, we also need to consider that this proposal is not a long‐term solution because the growing number of cases is far outpacing the speed of the recovery.
