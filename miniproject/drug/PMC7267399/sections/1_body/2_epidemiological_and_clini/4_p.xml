<p>To date, studies have shown that SARS‐CoV‐2 is spread between individuals mainly by means of the respiratory system and droplets (Phan et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0076" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). At present, several studies have put forward that SARS‐CoV‐2 can be transmitted not only by droplets but also potentially via the oral‐fecal route (Huang et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), but the latter requires formal proof. Long‐term observation and statistical analysis demonstrated that the incubation time is approximately 2 to 14 days after infection, with a median period of 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7 days) (Livingston, Bucher, &amp; Rekito, 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). The lungs and immune organs are the two main targets attacked by SARS‐CoV‐2. In addition, the virus also attacks other organs, such as the heart, kidney, oesophagus, and many other specific cell types (including alveolar cells, myocardial cells, renal proximal tubule cells, and oesophageal epithelial cells), and the most likely reason is related to infections and ACE2 distribution (Yang et al.,
