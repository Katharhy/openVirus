<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) are non‐segmented, positive‐sense, single‐stranded RNA viruses that belong to the subspecies Coronaviridae. The length of CoV genomes ranges from 26 to 32 kilobases, which makes it the largest viral RNA known (Livingston, Bucher, &amp; Rekito, 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Currently, six kinds of CoVs are known to cause human diseases, which can be classified into two groups: slightly pathogenic and highly pathogenic CoVs. Among the highly pathogenic CoVs, both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV, 2002, southern China) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV, 2012, Saudi Arabia), which mainly infect the lower airways and cause serious fatal pneumonia, are known and can affect humans (Cui, Li, &amp; Shi,
