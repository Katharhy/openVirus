<p>Epidemiological surveys have found that the clinical features of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are similar to those of SARS‐CoV and are characterized by fever (&gt;37.3°C), dry cough, dyspnoea, or shortness of breath in most patients, whereas non‐respiratory clinical symptoms such as diarrhoea, sore throat, muscle ache, headache, and vomiting have also been reported in a minority of patients (Meo et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Confirmed patients have also developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, while critical illness may present with respiratory and lung function failure, even multiple organ dysfunction and septic shock, which require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and intensive care support (Wang, Hu, et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0096" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). The major pathological characteristics of the lung include pulmonary alveolitis and bronchiolitis with epithelial cell proliferation, desquamation, squamous metaplasia, and the production of mucus and oedema fluid. Meanwhile, massive diffuse pulmonary interstitial fibrosis accompanied by excessive inflammation, a certain amount of hyaline degeneration, and variable levels of pulmonary haemorrhagic infarction have been observed at the lesion site (Luo et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Moreover, several kinds of immune cells, including focal monocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and several multinucleate giant cells along with intracytoplasmic viral inclusion bodies, infiltrate into the pulmonary interstitium (Cheng et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). In addition, immunohistochemical studies indicated positive results for immune cells, and pathological staining also showed extensive pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. Eventually, these abnormal pathological changes result in lung function failure or multiple organ failure. Although there has been some progress in the investigation and research of SARS‐CoV‐2, knowledge about this virus is still insufficient (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="bph15092-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). At present, the number of new confirmed cases and mortality are rapidly increasing daily, with only symptomatic treatment available. This situation means that research to confirm potential therapeutic targets and discover promising drugs, as soon as possible, is the current priority in the response to the SARS‐CoV‐2 outbreak.
