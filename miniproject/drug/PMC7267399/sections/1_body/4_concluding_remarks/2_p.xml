<p>Although the outbreak of SARS‐CoV‐2 in China was contained by the joint efforts of the government, society, and medical staff, outbreaks in other countries and regions outside of China have become increasingly severe and uncontrollable. By April 9, 2020, the number of cumulative confirmed cases is estimated to be close to 1,503,900 with approximately 89,931 deaths, worldwide. As the epidemic spreads, scientists around the world are studying the virus to understand its pathogenesis and explore potential targets and promising drugs that would be effective in combating SARS‐CoV‐2. Although there have been some clues regarding viral pathogenesis and potential targets, there are no verified antiviral drugs with specific effects against SARS‐CoV‐2. The efficacy and safety of these promising candidate drugs in the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2 need to be confirmed in further preclinical and clinical trials. With unremitting efforts to block the outbreak of SARS‐CoV‐2 worldwide, we hope that the infection and transmission of this virus will recede in a few months, as was observed for SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV. Although it will be a long and difficult road, the outbreak of SARS‐CoV‐2 worldwide has underlined the urgent need for renewed efforts to develop potential broad‐spectrum and targeted antiviral drugs to overcome this virus.</p>
