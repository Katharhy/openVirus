<p>In December 2019, a new coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) caused an epidemic in Wuhan, a major city in central China. This novel coronavirus had not been reported before and it took about 1 month to demonstrate that this virus had the ability to infect humans. Subsequently, it spread rapidly throughout China and caused outbreaks in many other countries, including Japan, South Korea, Italy, and the United States (Zhu et al.,

On January 31, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that SARS‐CoV‐2 caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), a public health emergency of international concern, and then designated it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. According to the latest data as of April 9, 2020, from the WHO, there are 89,931 deaths and 1,503,900 confirmed cases worldwide, with the mortality reaching approximately 5.980%, and the epidemic has followed a rapid growth model. A series of initiatives and statistical data hinted at the unusually severe effects of SARS‐CoV‐2, which induced serious attention and active prevention, worldwide. Although we are confident that a treatment will eventually be found, no specific vaccines or ideal drugs for SARS‐CoV‐2 have been identified for clinical use at present, so it is critical to understand the exact pathogenic mechanism and develop effective drugs and vaccines to respond to outbreaks of SARS‐CoV‐2 (Cabrini, Landoni, &amp; Zangrillo,

Additionally, many potential drugs have been suggested, and their assessment as treatments for the virus is underway. Also, several vaccines that have proven safety, efficacy, and quality are also in early clinical trials.
