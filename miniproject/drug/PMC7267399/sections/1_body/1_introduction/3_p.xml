<p>However, data from these assessments and trials are from many sources and in diverse forms, which makes it difficult to generate a comprehensive understanding for reference. Therefore, in this review, we comprehensively summarize the potential therapeutic targets involved in the processes of virus transmission, infection, and pathogenesis, based on recent studies. Additionally, we discuss in depth the advancements, possibilities, and significance of promising drugs based on these targets in the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2. We hope this review will facilitate the identification of potential targets and provide clues for drug discovery and development that can be translated into clinical applications for combating SARS‐CoV‐2.</p>
