  <p>Possible life cycle of SARS‐CoV‐2 and potential intervention strategy. Diagram showing the possible transmission, infection, and pathogenesis cycle of SARS‐CoV‐2. In the infection phase, SARS‐CoV‐2 attaches to the cellular receptor via the spike (S) protein or the transmembrane glycoprotein CD147 to enter the host cell by the endosomal pathway. At this point, the S protein is activated and cleaved by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to trigger membrane fusion. Then, SARS‐CoV‐2 releases its nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm to induce translation of ORF1a/b into the large replicase polyproteins 1a (pp1a) and pp1ab and replicates its genomic RNA. Subsequently, pp1a and pp1ab produce various non‐structural proteins (nsps), in which the RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), papain‐like protease (PLpro), and 3C‐like protease (3CLpro) are encoded. These replicases synthesize the full‐length negative‐sense antigenome template to produce new genomic RNA and further form the assembled virion, which is then released into the extracellular space by exocytosis. Uncontrolled replication promotes SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, leading to immune disturbances and inflammatory cytokine storms and eventually resulting in multiorgan functional damage, particularly in the lungs</p>
