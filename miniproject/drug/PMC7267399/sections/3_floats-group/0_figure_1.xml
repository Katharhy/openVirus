  <p>The genomic organization and virus structure of SARS‐CoV‐2. (a) The structure of SARS‐CoV‐2 consists of a single‐stranded positive‐sense RNA as the genetic material, which is surrounded by the nucleocapsid protein in the core area and a peripheral envelope consisting of the spike (S) protein, envelope ( E) protein, and membrane (M) protein. (b) The genomic organization of SARS‐CoV‐2 is based on a single‐stranded positive‐sense RNA, which contains a 5′‐methylated cap and 3′‐polyadenylated tail and is arranged in the following order: the 5′ end; open reading frame (ORF) 1a/b; spike (S); envelope ( E ) ; membrane (M); nucleocapsid protein (N); accessory proteins such as orf 3, 6, 7a, 7b, 8 and 9b; and the 3′ end</p>
