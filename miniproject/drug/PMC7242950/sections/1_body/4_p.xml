<p id="par0025">The first study of the use of chloroquine in coronavirus-19 infection was conducted in China and was published on 
 <bold>4th February</bold>. It analyzed the effect of various antivirals on Vero E6 cells, which come from kidney epithelial cells isolated from an African green monkey. To assess the effect, they measured EC50, the minimum concentration of chloroquine needed to inhibit 50% of the virus, and CC50, the concentration of the drug that kills 50% of the host's cells. Ideally, for a drug to be used in clinical practice, the EC50 should be as low as possible and the CC50 should be as high as possible. When this occurs, we have a remarkably high selectivity index, that is, the drug acts selectively against the virus without harming the organism, as was seen in the case of chloroquine and remdesivir.
