<p id="par0065">These findings are supported by a randomized clinical trial of 62 patients with mild pneumonia (without hypoxia) due to SARS-CoV2, published on 
 <bold>30th March</bold> in China, which found significant differences in the total or partial resolution of pneumonia among the group treated with 400Â mg/day of hydroxychloroquine for 5 days (80.6%) compared to the control group (54.8%), in which 4 individuals experienced progression to severe disease. Again, there were no serious adverse reactions with the administration of the drug, with only one case of rash and one of headache. It should be noted that, possibly to speed up the publication process, the article has not been peer reviewed.
