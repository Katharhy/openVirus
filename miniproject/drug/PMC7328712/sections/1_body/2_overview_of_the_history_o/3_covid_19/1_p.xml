The COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan quickly spread around the world within a very short period of time. There are 5.5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 347,587 COVID-19 related deaths worldwide up to 27 May 2020, giving a crude case-fatality rate of approximately 7%.
 <xref rid="b22-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Supportive treatment is the mainstay of management, as no antiviral therapy has been clinically proven to be effective against SARS-CoV-2, and no standard pharmacological treatment guidelines have been recommended by WHO.
