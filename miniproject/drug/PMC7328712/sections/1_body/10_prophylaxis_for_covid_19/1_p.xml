<p>Although the development of vaccines started towards the end of the 2003 SARS epidemic, as of 2020, there are still no approved vaccines for SARS-CoV. The main obstacle to the development of a vaccine is funding. Many vaccines that show promising results at the preclinical stage require further investments from governments or the private sector to progress to clinical trials. As SARS has largely disappeared since 2004 and MERS is primarily confined to Saudi Arabia and Korea, there is little urgency in developing vaccines for these coronaviruses and it would not be in the best interest of investors.
 <xref rid="b104-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">104</xref> There were 33 candidate vaccines targeting SARS-CoV and 48 candidate vaccines targeting MERS-CoV, but most only reached preclinical stages. So far, only two SARS-CoV and three MERS-CoV vaccines have reached the clinical trial stage.
 <xref rid="b105-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">105</xref> Nevertheless, the previous SARI outbreaks pale in comparison to the current COVID-19 pandemic. If vaccines for these previous coronaviruses had been successfully developed, we could have tested their efficacy and safety for COVID-19. Investments in vaccines for coronaviruses might now seem minuscule compared to the economic and social fallout of the current pandemic. The WHO has launched an international randomised trial of candidate vaccines against COVID-19. At the time of writing, there are 115 COVID-19 vaccine candidates and at least five candidate vaccines have reached phase I clinical trials.
