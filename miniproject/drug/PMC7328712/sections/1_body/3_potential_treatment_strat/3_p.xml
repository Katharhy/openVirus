<p>The similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that the development of potential prophylactics and therapeutics for COVID-19 could be based on research on SARS.

Immunomodulators could play a rescue therapy role, as pathological findings suggest that there is immunopathological damage.
