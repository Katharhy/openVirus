<p>The pathophysiology of COVID-19 has yet to be confirmed, but it is likely to involve inflammatory processes that can trigger a massive cytokine storm. The cytokine profile of critically ill patients revealed increased levels of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferon-γ inducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α, and tumour necrosis factor-α.
