<p>Convalescent plasma might be promising as a postexposure prophylaxis for COVID-19 and as a potential treatment after infection, as it was also used as a salvage therapy in the SARS and MERS epidemics.

 <xref rid="b84-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">84</xref> Considering the huge number of people exposed to COVID-19, use of convalescent plasma for post-exposure prophylaxis may not be justifiable, but could still be a treatment option. An observational study during the SARS epidemic showed a lower mortality rate in those receiving convalescent plasma as a treatment for SARS.
 <xref rid="b82-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">82</xref> Studies on the clinical effects and outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with convalescent plasma have so far shown encouraging results, although it should be noted that these studies were based on small case series.

Highly purified preparations of neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 would be preferable, as it would be safer and have higher activity, but it might be technically difficult to mass produce.
