<p>Corticosteroid therapies such as intravenous methylprednisolone are currently being tested as a treatment for COVID-19.
 <xref rid="b77-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">77</xref> Methylprednisolone has already been used in COVID-19 patients in combination with antibiotics, oseltamivir, and oxygen therapy.
 <xref rid="b25-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Long and colleagues reported that corticosteroid therapy using methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone was beneficial in treating SARS-CoV patients,
 <xref rid="b78-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">78</xref> and significantly prolonged survival time in clinical cases.
 <xref rid="b78-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">78</xref> However, other studies reported the use of corticosteroids in early stages of SARS infection increased the viral load.
 <xref rid="b79-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">79</xref> Furthermore, studies on the use of corticosteroids as an adjuvant therapy against MERS-CoV infection were unable to prove efficacy because all patients died.
 <xref rid="b80-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">80</xref> Based on the recommendation by frontline Chinese physicians and local clinical experience during the SARS epidemic, a short course of corticosteroids at a low-to-moderate dose is probably justifiable for critically ill patients.

 <xref rid="b81-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">81</xref> Corticosteroids are effective in treating the autoinflammatory cytokine activation syndrome. Reported side effects such as osteonecrosis are concerning, but data are still conflicting and recent recommendations against the use of corticosteroids are based on circumstantial evidence. Routine use of corticosteroids is not recommended as corticosteroids may prolong or worsen the disease, and were found to prolong viral shedding in MERS and SARS. Based on the current body of evidence, corticosteroids may be justified for certain medical indications (i.e. acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis) at the discretion of the physician in charge.
