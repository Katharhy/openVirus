 <xref rid="b62-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> From the experiences of SARS-CoV, the use of ribavirin as a monotherapy was limited as it required high concentration to inhibit viral replication, and ribavirin usage was associated with dose-dependent haemolysis and liver toxicity.

 <xref rid="b64-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> In the treatment of SARS and MERS, ribavirin is used in combination with interferon or lopinavir/ritonavir.

 <xref rid="b66-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">66</xref> A recent multicentre randomised phase 2 trial showed triple antiviral therapy of lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, and interferon β-1b was superior to lopinavir–ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms, shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.
