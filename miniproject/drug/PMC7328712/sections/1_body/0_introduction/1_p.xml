<p>Viral respiratory infections such as influenza and measles, which can cause severe acute respiratory symptoms, have been responsible for many epidemics. In the spring of 2003, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) spread globally.

In the summer of 2012, another SARI broke out in Saudi Arabia, which was found to be caused by a new coronavirus. The WHO named this respiratory disease Middle East respiratory syndrome also known by the acronym MERS and called the causative coronavirus MERS-CoV. In the winter of 2019, another SARI outbreak occurred in Wuhan, China, which very quickly spread around the world. The culprit was identified as another novel coronavirus, which the WHO named as SARS-CoV-2 due to similarities to SARS-CoV, and the disease was called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emergent coronavirus closely related to SARS and MERS.

Current reports suggest that COVID-19 causes milder symptoms in children, including fever and cough, but co-infection has also been observed.
