  <p>Reconstruction of Swedish HIV transmission chain 79 (c79) involving 8 MSM. (
   <bold>A</bold>) SCOTTI (ver. 2.4.7) [
   <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-01018" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] was used to infer the transmission tree. SCOTTI uses statistical and Bayesian frameworks to model host-to-host transmissions as between-host virus migration events, while accounting for within host evolution and undiagnosed hosts. To comply with SCOTTI requirements, an exposure interval was explicitly defined for all individuals. This interval limits virus exposure to the period between when a host was first infected (exposure start date) and last infectious (exposure end date). This information was not available for all individuals. We therefore assumed that individuals stopped being infectious the day they donated a blood sample for 
   <italic>pol</italic> sequencing after testing seropositive for HIV. Exposure begin date was then set to 10 years prior from the exposure end date. The HKY+G model was identified as the best fitting evolutionary model (AIC score = 3194) by the LANL FindModel implementation of ModelTest [
   <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-01018" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The SCOTTI Python script was modified to allow for gamma distributed rate variation across sites. SCOTTI configuration files were run in BEAST (ver. 2.5.2) [
   <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-01018" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] for 10 million iterations (10,000 trees sampled). A maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree is shown after 10% burnin. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Multiple virus transmission pathways are possible from the tree in (
   <bold>A</bold>). A few examples are shown to illustrate the underlying statistical uncertainty in inferring who infected whom.
