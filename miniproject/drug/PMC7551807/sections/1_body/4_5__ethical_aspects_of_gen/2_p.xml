<p>One possible approach to minimizing risk to individuals and communities would be to only record and use information that does not involve any statements (even probabilistic) about who transmitted to whom. For example, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01018-f006">Figure 6</xref> illustrates the use of how reconstructing epidemiological history gives an estimate of the number of undiagnosed persons that belong to that cluster but are not in the public health database. Using this information to triage contact tracing resources would not involve making any specific claims about who infected whom. Likewise, individual transmission clusters could be ranked on the levels of superspreading without having to rely on a single reconstructed history [
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-12-01018" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It is important to understand the probabilistic nature of these inferences, but if they are deemed to be too risky, there are still methods for obtaining useful information that uses epidemiological history reconstruction methods.
