 <italic>(3) Reconstructed transmission histories are sensitive to both methodological assumptions and the available data.</italic> This issue is expanded by considering that different kinds of data and assumptions can go into the analysis. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01018-f005">Figure 5</xref> illustrates this idea. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01018-f004">Figure 4</xref>A, we assume that all we know is the genetic sequence data, and we make the additional assumption that each sampled person was infectious for no more than 10 years prior to testing positive, which is reasonable on average for HIV. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01018-f005">Figure 5</xref>A, we re-run the analysis but restrict the potential window that each person is potentially contagious to include previous negative HIV tests, which are known for 5 of the 8 individuals. Finally, in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01018-f005">Figure 5</xref>B we relax the assumption that people do not transmit after they are diagnosed. The effects of including more data (i.e., previous negative HIV tests) and relaxing the assumption no transmission occurs after diagnosis changes our reconstruction of the transmission history. This occurs in part because the additional data further excludes certain possibilities, changing our reconstruction of the transmission history. For example, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01018-f005">Figure 5</xref>A now suggests that one or more unsampled persons started the two chains of HIV transmission we described above. Taking the inherent uncertainty in these analyses together with sensitivity to subjective assumptions, we believe that these kinds of analyses cannot be used to establish by any standard that a given person must have infected another person. Such strong statements are simply outside of the domain of this kind of work.
