 <italic>(2) The reconstructed transmission histories have a substantial-level of uncertainty about exactly who infected whom.</italic> The above narrative is only the most probable reconstruction. In fact, even under this fixed set of assumptions, there is substantial uncertainty in who, exactly, is infecting whom. The pie charts at each node indicate the uncertainty in who is the donor for that transmission event. While multiple infectors are possible, only two most probable are illustrated for clarity. The numbers indicate the number of times that we sample a transmission history where one of the persons is the donor. Likewise, the number in black next to each node is the number of times that node itself is sampled. For example, the node connecting p466 and p694 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01018-f004">Figure 4</xref>A only shows up in the analysis about 31% of the time and of those 31% of the time, the donor is inferred to be p466 about 40% of the time. While the data suggest that p466 is the most likely infector of p694, we only sample this particular transmission about 31% * 40% = 12% of the time. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01018-f004">Figure 4</xref>B illustrates multiple transmission chains compatible with the tree in panel A. In general, when we reconstruct transmission histories from genetic sequence data, we can make a case for what is most plausible given the data, but we also can compute that the probability of exactly that sequence of events occurring is low. This is due to the fact that for even a small number of linked cases, there is an astronomically high number of ways that they could have infected one another especially when you consider that unsampled persons may also be involved. Genetic sequence data constrain the possibilities but cannot elevate one possible outcome to the level of certainty. While we are neither lawyers nor legal scholars, we do not believe that these kinds of analyses even with nearly perfect data rise to the level of being legal evidence of direct transmission. However, even given high levels of global uncertainty, we can discern common features of transmission in such clusters; for example, we may observe a trend whereby older men are transmitting HIV to younger men.
