 <italic>(4) Reconstructed transmission histories provide actionable information.</italic> While uncertainty is an inherent part of epidemiological reconstruction, reconstruction yields not only insight but actionable results that are not obtainable from other kinds of analysis. An example of this kind of result is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01018-f006">Figure 6</xref>. This plot shows the distribution of the number of missing cases in this transmission cluster. Being able to quantify the evidence for missing cases allows public health agencies an ability to figure out not only how many undiagnosed persons might exist in the population but also where to look for them. Accounting for these unsampled persons can prevent further spread of HIV in the community. For example, if we reconstructed the history of multiple putative transmission clusters, we could prioritize limited contact tracing resources to cases that are likely to have contacted an undiagnosed person. Likewise, these reconstructions can reveal macroscopic patterns or population behaviors that can better guide public health response to HIV epidemics.
