<p>Recently, the results of a large-scale simulated data challenge investigating different transmission dynamics analyses of HIV genetic sequence were published [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-01018" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The simulated data included a wide range of different contexts including populations with ongoing HIV prevention interventions. While different methods showed highly variable quality in their results, a single team was able to correctly estimate HIV incidence, change in incidence due to intervention, and proportion of infections coming from recently infected persons in most of the simulated data scenarios.
