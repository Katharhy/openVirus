<p>Transmission dynamic analysis generally minimizes the risk of identifying transmission pairs in the databases. That is, fitting a mathematical model of transmission to genetic sequence data can describe the broad processes of transmission in a population but not necessarily the specific transmission history of a given sample. Formally, a transmission model fit to a set of genetic sequence data could be used to calculate the probability that two persons in the sample infected one another. However, transmission dynamics analyses are generally based on a sub-sample of the data that are unlikely to contain any direct transmission pairs. In practice, transmission dynamic analysis does not allow us to make any claims about who infected whom in a given sample and therefore carries a minimal risk of inadvertently identifying transmission pairs.</p>
