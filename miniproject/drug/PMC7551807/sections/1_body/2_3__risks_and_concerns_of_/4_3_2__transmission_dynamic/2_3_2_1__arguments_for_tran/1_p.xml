<p>The simplest argument for transmission dynamic analysis is that there is a large and well-documented body of literature showing that transmission dynamics of HIV and other pathogens can be modeled in terms of the kinds of data that are typically available to a public health department, e.g., partial 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequence data and standard epidemiological data such as case counts. Here, sequence data relates to what is happening in a population at a large, macroscopic level. An early example of this type of analysis was able to estimate the proportion of new HIV cases that were coming from both acutely infected and undiagnosed persons in Detroit over time [
