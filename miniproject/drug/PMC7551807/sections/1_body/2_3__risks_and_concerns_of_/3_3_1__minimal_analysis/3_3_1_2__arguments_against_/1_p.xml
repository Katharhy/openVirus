<p>The primary argument against minimal analysis is that we are grossly underusing public health HIV sequence collections to understand how HIV is spreading at the local level. Ultimately, HIV prevention is a local issue that requires adaptation to local populations. In the US, HIV transmission is highly heterogenous, including major demographic, geographic, and cultural distinctions such as sexual orientation, population density, race, education, and geography. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01018-f002">Figure 2</xref> shows the HIV diagnosis rates at both the state and county levels in the US controlling for the relevant population sizes. HIV diagnosis rates at the county level are much more variable between counties and within counties over time than at the state level. Aggregating data up to the state level hides heterogeneities that matter for local prevention, which are only apparent at smaller scales. Having a greater understanding of how HIV is actually spreading in local populations is necessary for curtailing its spread and for adapting prevention methods to future trends. Thus, HIV prevention needs to be agile, local, and adaptive to changing dynamics.
