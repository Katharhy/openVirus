<p>The primary argument for doing minimal analysis of HIV sequence data at a public health department level is that the potential harms to both the community and the individual are greater than the potential benefits of any deeper analysis. The analyses that we discuss below work by attempting to either reconstruct the flow of infection between and within sub-populations or the historical record of who likely infected whom and when. Both of these kinds of information have the potential to cause harm by potentially stigmatizing communities or making individuals susceptible to legal and criminal repercussions.</p>
