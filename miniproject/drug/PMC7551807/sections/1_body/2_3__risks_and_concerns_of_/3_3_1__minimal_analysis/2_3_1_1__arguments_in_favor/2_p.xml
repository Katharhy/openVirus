<p>One advantage of minimal analysis is that it does not require complex models, and the results generally have unambiguous interpretations. That is, any quantity that we can compute from the sequence data directly (i.e., the temporal/spatial dynamics of drug resistance or the rise and fall of specific HIV subtypes) can be interpreted as a description of temporal trends in the surveillance data rather than as a complex statistical inference procedure. The case for minimal analysis also includes arguments against more sophisticated analysis. As we will discuss later in this paper, more sophisticated analyses must include uncertainty from multiple sources such as in the reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree and mapping phylogenetic trees to transmission histories. Moreover, more sophisticated analysis can be based on highly subjective assumptions. That is, if we give one data set to multiple scientists, we may get multiple, possibly contradictory results that cannot be objectively ranked without diving into the technical aspects of the analyses. In fact, this is exactly what happened in a recent multi-team study with simulated HIV sequence data [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-01018" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A final epistemic argument for minimal analysis is that the potentially long delay between infection and diagnosis means that the information from even the most up-to-date analyses will be in some cases years old. While all analyses of HIV data are affected by delays in discovery of new cases, minimal analysis is not intended to actively direct resources to specific outbreaks or to recommend active changes in policy and is therefore less susceptible to delays.
