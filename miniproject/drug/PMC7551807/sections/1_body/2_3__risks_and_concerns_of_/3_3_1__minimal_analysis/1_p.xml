<p>If the risk of harm to individuals and communities is considered to outweigh any potential benefit, then genetic sequence data can still be used, but only in a limited, minimal way. These types of analyses would focus on aggregate properties of a sequence database such as changes in the transmission of HIV-1 subtypes or the prevalence of drug resistance mutations. These kinds of analyses give some sense of population-level health parameters with respect to a clinically relevant outcome (e.g., initial infection with a drug-resistant virus) while avoiding many of the potential risks associated with HIV sequence analysis for public health.</p>
