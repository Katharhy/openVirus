<p>Rapid progress in the analysis of genetic sequence data has led to an explosion of off-the-shelf methods for describing, in a range of detail, the historical dynamics of evolving epidemics [

 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-01018" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. That is, we have methods that allow us to reconstruct how an epidemic has played out in the past based on contemporary and historical genetic sequence data. Assuming fairly constant evolutionary rates, evolutionary theory predicts that sequences separated by a few mutations are more closely related than those separated by many mutations. Thus, the fundamental principle that is exploited here is that HIV rapidly accumulates mutations over time, which results in persons who have recently infected each other harboring HIV that is separated by fewer mutations from each other than from persons who are further away in the transmission chain. Hence, by comparing HIV sequences from persons in a public health database one could extract information about transmission heterogeneity in a population. Tight clusters would indicate recent transmissions among socially connected individuals, while HIV sequences further away might indicate separate transmission communities and distant sources of infection. These analyses therefore attempt to probabilistically infer the transmission tree or, synonymously, the transmission history of a sample, that is, the record of who transmitted to whom and when (see [
