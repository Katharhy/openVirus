<p>While identification of genetic clusters can find closely related transmissions and thereby guide prevention efforts, evolutionary theory has more to offer. Recently developed phylodynamic methods maximize what we get out from genetic clusters and data [

 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-01018" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These benefits can significantly enhance HIV surveillance and prevention efforts and yield direct and actionable insights. For example, clustering patterns observed in the same cluster can be consistent with multiple transmission scenarios. All members may have been infected by a single person or by multiple undiagnosed individuals. The latter emphasizes the need to identify undiagnosed HIV-positive persons involved in the outbreak to limit future spread. A cluster that may indicate existence of a large number of undiagnosed persons may demand immediate attention compared to a cluster that is nearly fully sampled. Thus, knowledge of the underlying transmission network structure can guide health agencies to prioritize clusters with the maximum potential of future spread. This knowledge can save many lives by alerting at risk individuals and enrolling undiagnosed HIV-positive individuals into care. Similarly, node labeling of age and gender, dates of diagnosis, and area zip codes on phylogenies can dramatically alter our understanding of transmission risk factors. For example, clusters where old individuals are infecting young MSM may suggest different actions. Recent advancements in phylodynamic methods now allow analysis of partially sampled outbreaks and also account for within-host virus diversity [

 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-01018" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. These features therefore significantly enhance the kind of information we get from HIV sequence collections and standard clustering analyses. The analyses can also infer the number and contributions of exogenous virus introductions as a result of migration or international travel in different states and countries. This information can further guide public health response to disease emergence.
