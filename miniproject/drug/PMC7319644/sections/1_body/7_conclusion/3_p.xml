<p id="par0285">Different studies affirmed that some pathophysiological changes were observed in the placentas of CoV-positive mothers. However, the vertical transmission for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses has not been detected, and few cases showed that the pregnancy resulted in intrauterine fetal death, congenital malformation (due to prematurity) or newborn death after emergency cesarean section. We believe that the coronaviruses infection on pregnant can promote multiple disorders, such as shortness of breath, fever, elevated blood pressure, preeclampsia, pneumonia, and multiple organ failure, which can affect the fetus's health. In relation to the few studies on SARS-CoV-2, as it is a new strain, it is still too early to draw conclusions.</p>
