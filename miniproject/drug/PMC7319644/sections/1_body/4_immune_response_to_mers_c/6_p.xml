<p id="par0110">In patients recovered from SARS, specific memory CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes for HLA-DR08 and HLA-DR15 restricted epitopes of the SARS-CoV S protein have been identified [
 <xref rid="bib0355" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Virus-specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes mainly exhibited a central memory phenotype (CD45RA
 <sup>−</sup> CCR7
 <sup>+</sup> CD62L
 <sup>−</sup>), while CD8
 <sup>+</sup> memory T lymphocytes were identified as memory effector cells (CD45RA
 <sup>+</sup> CCR7

 <xref rid="bib0365" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0370" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. These findings suggest that there is an activity of specific memory T lymphocytes in long-term protection against SARS-CoV infections. In addition, the response of memory B lymphocytes to SARS-CoV decrease significantly after 1–2 years of infection [
