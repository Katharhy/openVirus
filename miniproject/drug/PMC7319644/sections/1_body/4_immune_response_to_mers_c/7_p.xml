<p id="par0115">The immunological findings to date are too preliminary to draw definitive conclusions regarding to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recent studies have shown inconclusive pathways promoted by the virus in the immune system. Xu et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] showed that the number of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the peripheral blood of patiets infected with SARS-CoV-2 is significantly reduced. Zhou et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], investigating 99 cases, also showed a reduction in total lymphocytes (35 %) and an increase of serum IL-6 (52 %) and C-Reactive Protein (84 %) and several studies point to the importance of the "cytokine storm" leading to the 2019-nCoV severity. A recent publication points to the increase of the humoral response in patients who needed intensive care unit (ICU) care due to SARS-CoV-2, such as IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, TNF-Î± [

 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the peripheral blood of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients is reduced, but have excessive activation, demonstrating high proportions of HLA-DR (CD4 3.47 %) and CD38 (CD8 39.4 %) double-positive fractions [
