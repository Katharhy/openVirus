 <xref rid="bib0415" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] demonstrated that Saudi Arabia accounted for 1308 cases of MERS-CoV between November 2012 and February 2016, of which, five cases were confirmed for pregnant women by the Ministry of Health. Aged between 27â€“34 years, two of the five patients (40 %) died during the disease. Among the five pregnancies, two (40 %) resulted in perinatal death: one pregnancy resulted in intrauterine fetal death and one newborn died four hours after an emergency cesarean section (C-sec). As symptoms and worsening of the clinical picture, some patients presented: shortness of breath, fever, elevated blood pressure, pre-eclampsia, pneumonia, acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress, and multiple organ failure. Similar results were found by Payne et al. [
