<p id="par0200">In summary, the study conducted by Li et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] revealed that the ACE2 receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 was widely distributed in specific cell types of the maternal-fetal interface cells and fetal organs. Regarding maternal-fetal interface, ACE2 was found highly expressed in these cells, including stromal cells, perivascular cells of decidua and cytotrophoblast, and syncytiotrophoblasts in the placenta. In addition, ACE2 was also expressed in specific cell types of human fetal heart, liver, and lung, but not in the kidneys. Although previous clinical studies have not observed vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among limited cases, this phenomenon still needs to be investigated more carefully in clinical practice. Corroborating this study, the study conducted by Schwartz [
 <xref rid="bib0510" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] showed that all neonatal samples tested, including in some cases placentas, were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Thus, at this point in the global pandemic of Covid-19, there is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 virus undergoes intrauterine or transplacental transmission from infected pregnant women to their fetuses.
