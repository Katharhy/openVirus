<p>Corticosteroids have a rationale in Covid-19 for their potent anti-inflammatory effect and their potential role in suppressing cytokine-related lung injury. However, considerations have been made that beside suppressing lung inflammation, corticosteroids also inhibit immune responses and pathogen clearance. Observational studies in patients with SARS and MERS reported clinical efficacy but no clear association with improved survival, while demonstrating delayed viral clearance and high rates of complications [

In a recent meta-analysis evaluating the role of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in patients with severe pneumonia caused by influenza, corticosteroid therapy seemed to confer an increased risk of secondary bacterial infection and mortality [

Based on these experiences, further studies assessing the role of corticosteroids in Covid-19 would be of extreme importance, and several clinical trials are ongoing. The U.S. National Institute of Health Covid-19 expert panel considered their use in severely ill patients reasonable on a case by case basis, taking into account factors as pre-existing medical conditions requiring chronic corticosteroid use, or hemodynamic status [
