<p>Interferons are key molecules of innate antiviral response and might have a different role depending on the timing of administration, based on preclinical observation on a mouse model [

So far, the use of inhalatory INF-Î±1b has been used in China but no clinical data are available regarding its efficacy. Observations in SARS and MERS on the combined use of IFN and ribavirin failed to show any improvement in mortality or viral clearance [

 <xref rid="B180-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>]. Given the previously discussed role of IFN in coronavirus diseases, treatment timing could represent the most determining factor. In mouse models, IFN-I administration within 1 day after infection protected mice from lethal MERS infection, while delayed treatment failed to effectively inhibit virus replication, and resulted in worsening of inflammatory changes in the lungs [
