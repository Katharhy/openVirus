<p>Other anti-cytokine drugs seem to have a rationale for the treatment of Covid-19 associated inflammation. This is the case of anakinra, an interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist used for various rheumatologic conditions, especially considering the aforementioned ability of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to induce NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1beta. A recent report showed promising results using high doses of anakinra intravenously in 29 patients with severe disease [
 <xref rid="B164-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>], with rapid decrease of inflammatory markers, progressive amelioration of respiratory function and increased survival compared to a retrospective cohort, with a good safety profile. A second report on subcutaneous administration in nine patients [
 <xref rid="B165-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>] showed safety of the drug, with a slower response on inflammatory markers. Another experience of high intravenous doses also showed safety and efficacy in severely affected subjects [

 <xref rid="B169-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>], as well as the observation in preclinical model that anti-TNFs ameliorate the course of severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza in mice [
 <xref rid="B170-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. Notably, lack of TNF-α receptor as well as in vivo TNF-α neutralization resulted in protection against SARS-CoV morbidity and mortality in mice [
