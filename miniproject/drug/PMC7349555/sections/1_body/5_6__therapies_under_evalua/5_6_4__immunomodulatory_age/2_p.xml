<p>Preliminary observations have been reported with the use of tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting IL-6 receptor, approved for the treatment of cytokine-release syndrome following chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy [

In small case series, the repeated administration of tocilizumab to patients with severe Covid-19 was associated with rapid cessation of fever, improvement of respiratory functions and thoracic imaging, as well as reduction of C-reactive protein [

Several randomized-controlled trials are currently under way to evaluate the role of tocilizumab and other monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-6 such as sarilumab and siltuximab. Preliminary data on compassionate use of siltuximab in 21 patients with pneumonia have shown improvement in 7, yet no conclusions can be inferred given the lack of control arm in the study [
 <xref rid="B163-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. It should also be considered that IL-6 has also significant anti-infective roles, therefore caution is advised in respect to the possibility that its inhibition can result in greater incidence of opportunistic infections in treated patients, especially when given together with corticosteroids.
