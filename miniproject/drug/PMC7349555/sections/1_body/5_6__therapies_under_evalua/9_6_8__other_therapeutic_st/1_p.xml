<p>The observation that viral entry into cells via ACE2 receptor requires priming by cellular proteases, mainly TMPRSS2, prompted in vitro trials with two clinically approved drugs for acute pancreatitis (nafamostat and camostat) which resulted in blockade of viral entry [
 <xref rid="B16-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Another drug inhibiting TMPRSS2 is bromhexine, a widely used antitussive agent. Considering the role of TMPRSS2 in viral entry, these drugs could be suitable as prophylaxis in high-risk settings. All these three drugs are currently undergoing clinical trials.
