<p>Pending peer review, the results from several other works have emerged which question the safety and efficacy of this treatment. A retrospective analysis of data from 368 hospitalized patients with Covid-19 across the United States investigated the risk of death and the need for mechanical ventilation based on exposure to hydroxychloroquine alone or with azithromycin, placing a cautionary note. In the study, hydroxychloroquine, either with or without azithromycin, did not reduce the risk of mechanical ventilation. Moreover, an increased overall mortality was identified in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone [

Similarly, in a retrospective analysis of hospitalized patients evaluating probability of intensive care transfer or death, by means of an inverse probability of treatment weighting approach, did not find evidence of hydroxychloroquine efficacy [
