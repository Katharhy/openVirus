<p>Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine inhibit in vitro SARS-CoV-2 [

Given the long history of use in patients with malaria as well as in patients with rheumatologic conditions, and considered the lack of alternatives, the use of hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination with azithromycin (an antibiotic added mainly for its anti-inflammatory effects possibly due to attenuation of IL6), for the treatment of Covid-19 has widely spread despite very limited efficacy data and emerging concerns of cardiotoxicity, especially for the association of the two drugs. The only trial published so far is a small single center open label study on 36 patients with Covid-19. The primary outcome in the trial was viral clearance from the nasopharynx, not a clinical outcome. At day 6, 70% of patients who received hydroxychloroquine (n = 20) achieved viral clearance compared to 12.5% of patients in the control group (n = 16) [

The authors also pointed out the potential synergistic effect of the concomitant use of azithromycin since all the patients receiving the combination achieved viral clearance (n = 6). Following the publication, attention was drawn toward several design and methodological flaws of the study and the scientific validity of the findings have been questioned [

Beside the small sample size and the fact that no clinical or safety outcomes were reported, several confounding factors were observed including the fact that six patients in the hydroxychloroquine group that met the inclusion criteria were removed from the analysis due to cessation of treatment as a consequence of worsening illness or medication-related adverse effects. Another, still unpublished small clinical trial randomized 62 patients to receive hydroxychloroquine or placebo and found a reduction of time to clinical recovery. This work, nevertheless, did not stratify patients for comorbidities and the clinical endpoints were not clearly defined [
