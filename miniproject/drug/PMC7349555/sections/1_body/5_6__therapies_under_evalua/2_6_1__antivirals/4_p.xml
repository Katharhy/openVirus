<p>Favipiravir is a nucleotide prodrug whose active compound inhibits viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Favipiravir is approved for the treatment of influenza virus infections in Japan and China. The results of a small open-label non-randomized control study conducted in China in Covid-19 have been published recently [

In the study patients receiving favipiravir plus inhaled IFN (n = 35) were compared with an historical cohort of patients who had been treated with lopinavir/ritonavir during the prior weeks (n = 45). Patients in the favipiravir group had faster viral clearance (4 days vs. 11 days) and more frequent radiographic improvement (91% vs. 62%). Still under review, another Chinese open-label, randomized study showed that moderately ill patients (but not mildly nor severely ill patients) treated with favipiravir had higher clinical recovery rates at day 7 compared to patients treated with umifenovir, a membrane-fusion inhibitor active against influenza [
