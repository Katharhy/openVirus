<p>Antivirals aim at blocking viral replication and related cell damage. Even though antivirals seem to be the most obvious causative therapy, their efficacy might be limited to the initial phase of the illness and might not have any effect in the advanced stages, when inflammatory mechanisms seem to prevail. Antivirals that have been used or proposed in Covid-19 include lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, ribavirin, and favipiravir.</p>
