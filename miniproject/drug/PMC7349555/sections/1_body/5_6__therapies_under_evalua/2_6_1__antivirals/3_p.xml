<p>Remdesivir is a nucleotide analogue prodrug that inhibits viral RNA polymerases. In vitro testing of remdesivir has shown a potent activity against SARS-CoV-2 [

 <xref rid="B145-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. Clinical improvement in oxygen-support status was observed in 36 of 53 patients (68%). The results of one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial that included 237 patients with Covid-19 from China admitted to hospital with an interval from symptom onset to enrolment of 12 days or less and pneumonia, showed a small reduction in the time to clinical improvement with remdesivir but failed to find statistical significance [

Preliminary analysis from another randomized, controlled trial involving 1063 patients in the United States have also been recently made available. Preliminary results indicate that patients who received remdesivir had a 31% shorter median time to recovery (11 days versus 15 days) compared with placebo (

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.059). The trial closed to new enrollments on April 19 and more comprehensive results will soon be available (NCT04280705). While interesting, these data still suggest that the role of antiviral treatment may be limited, with a greater efficacy possibly to the early phases of infection, likely due to the rapid replication of the SARS-CoV2 virus.
