<p>Ribavirin has been empirically included into various treatment protocols for Covid-19 even though there is little evidence for its efficacy [

Ribavirin is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase with in vitro activity against SARS-CoV only at high concentrations. Ribavirin has been used for the treatment of SARS and MERS, mostly in combination with IFNs. Of 30 trials evaluating ribavirin in patients with SARS, 26 were classified as inconclusive and 4 reported possible harm due to the occurrence of hemolytic anemia and liver toxicity in a high proportion of treated patients [
