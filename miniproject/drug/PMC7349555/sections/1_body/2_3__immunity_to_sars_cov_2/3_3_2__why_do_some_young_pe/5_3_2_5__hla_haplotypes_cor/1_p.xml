<p>Bioinformatic tools have already shown the different affinities of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules haplotypes to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes [
 <xref rid="B125-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Those differences determine the quality of the immune response, therefore might have a role in vaccine design (i.e., to choose the most appropriate epitope in term of immune response to vaccine) and to provide information to identify subjects with increased risk of severe disease and guide social interventions. For example, HLA-B*46:01 haplotype has been predicted to be a risk factor for a severe disease, as already shown by genetic population analysis in patients affected by severe SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B126-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. On the opposite side, B*15:03 allele is predicted to have high affinity for epitopes shared by different coronavirus, thus representing a possible protective factor for disease severity through cross-response. To identify high risk populations is of key relevance to implement stratified social distancing rules and disease prevention (i.e., vaccine administration) priorities. To date, there are no population studies on Covid-19.
