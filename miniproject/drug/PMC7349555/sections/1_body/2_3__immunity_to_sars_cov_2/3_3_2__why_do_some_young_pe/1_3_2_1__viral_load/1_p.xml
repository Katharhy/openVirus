<p>In experimental conditions, the inoculum dose is a crucial factor influencing the outcome of the infection from many viruses. High inoculum dose of viruses with direct cytopathic effect can lead to severe damage and death before adaptive immune response develops, especially with fast-replicating viruses. In influenza virus infection, cytotoxic CD8 cells are the main player in killing virus-infected cells. However, with high viral inoculum dose cytotoxic CD8 cells can be killed by DCs, depending on the cytokine environment [

In an in vitro model to examine the effects of influenza infection on DC function, T-cell proliferation occurred at low multiplicities of infection, while at higher doses interaction between DC and T cells was defective, partly because of hyperproduction of Transforming Growth Factor beta 1 (TGFÎ²1) by DCs [
