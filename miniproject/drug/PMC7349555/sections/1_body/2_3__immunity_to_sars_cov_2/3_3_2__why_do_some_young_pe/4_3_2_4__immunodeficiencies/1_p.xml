<p>Severe cases of Covid-19 have been associated with the development of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH). Inborn errors of immunity affecting NK and CD8 T-mediated cytotoxicity have been associated with unexpected fatal infection from various viruses, presenting with the clinical picture of primary HLH [

Of note, HLH-related mutations are relatively rare in the population and therefore they are not likely to explain a significant proportion of severe cases. Patients with rheumatic conditions such as systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus who develop sHLH-like inflammatory complications (named macrophage activation syndrome) are more likely to carry heterozygous variants in genes mediating the release of cytotoxic granules from NK cells and CD8 T cells [
