<p>It is well-known that subjects with combined immunodeficiencies (CID) are susceptible to severe illnesses from various viruses [

However, only a few CIDs can remain undiagnosed for a long time, and thus it is unlikely that subjects with these disorders can encounter SARS-CoV-2 and develop a severe disease course. Indeed, the only records of CIDs detected after severe viral illness concern subjects with undiagnosed idiopathic CD4 T-cell lymphopenia who developed severe varicella [

 <xref rid="B121-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Covid-19 could also have a worse course in subjects with not-virologically suppressed HIV, while no fatality has been reported in a small series of young patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy [
