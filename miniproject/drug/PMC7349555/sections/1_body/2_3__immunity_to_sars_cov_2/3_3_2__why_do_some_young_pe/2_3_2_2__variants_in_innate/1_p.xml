<p>Point mutations in genes encoding for proteins involved in DNA sensing and IFN response, as mentioned before, have been found to confer susceptibility to a narrow range of virus infections or even one particular virus. Such an example is that of mutations in genes that participate in the TLR3 signaling pathway which predisposes to severe presentation of herpes simplex virus (HSV), including HSV encephalitis [

However, this hypothesis is being investigated in genetic studies on young patients developing severe disease.
