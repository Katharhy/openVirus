<p>Deterioration of immune response in elderly represents a well-known challenge to vaccine developers as immunosenescence also involves antibodies production. The contraction of B-cell repertoire with aging is less impressive than that of T cells [

Moreover, while T cells reactivity is restricted to specific peptides, antibodies frequently display some degree of cross-reactivity between distinct antigens. Consequently, old people can boost the production of antibodies directed against antigenically related viruses when exposed to an infection, maintaining a wider immunological memory. This mechanism has a role in the antibody response to influenza virus, where cross-reactive immune responses have been well described [
