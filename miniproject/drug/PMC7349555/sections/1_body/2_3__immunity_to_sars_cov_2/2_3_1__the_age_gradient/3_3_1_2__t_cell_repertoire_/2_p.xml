<p>Age-related changes in bone marrow result in decreased lymphopoiesis and increased output of functionally compromised myeloid cells. In thymus, tissue involution results in loss of naive T cells and contraction in T-cells repertoire diversity [

Coherently, a relatively better performance of children and elderly in contrasting the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic has been explained respectively by a wider lymphocyte repertoire in children and immune memory for past cross-reacting viral strains in old people.
