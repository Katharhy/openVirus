<p>The innate immune system also becomes dysregulated and is characterized by heightened levels of basal inflammation, because of increased baseline cytokine production, and failure of activation of innate immune mechanisms in response to pathogens or vaccines [

 <xref rid="B49-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Thus, it could be hypothesized that in the elderly dysregulation of IFN pathways could contribute to lethality from SARS-CoV-2 infection by determining the inability to control viral replication at the beginning of the infection, and later facilitating the occurrence of a deleterious exaggerated inflammatory response.
