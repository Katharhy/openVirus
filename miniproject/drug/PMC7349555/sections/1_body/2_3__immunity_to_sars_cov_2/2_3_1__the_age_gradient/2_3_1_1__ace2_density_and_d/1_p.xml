<p>Higher expression of ACE2 receptors may partly explain why young people seem to be less susceptible to severe infections from SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B101-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Besides age, several other factors also seem to modulate ACE2 expression, including diet, sexual hormones, drugs, glucose metabolism. Smoking upregulates the expression of ACE2; this may account for a lower than expected prevalence of smokers in diseases cohorts, even though the overall role of smoking as a risk factor is still unclear [
 <xref rid="B102-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Studies in animal models have suggested that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) upregulate ACE2 expression [

Those observations were used to speculate on a possible increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients under those treatments, or vice versa, if they could have a therapeutic role. However, three large studies (a database study [

 <xref rid="B105-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]) including a total of more than 21,000 infected patients failed to identify any correlation between ACE inhibitor or ARBs treatment and infection risk or disease severity. Scientific societies advice not to discontinue such therapies on the base of Covid-19 fear or actual disease.
