<p>Interestingly, bat immune cells also show significantly dampened activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to RNA viruses [
 <xref rid="B135-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. NLRP3 is an important sensor for cellular stresses as well as viral and bacterial infections. NLRP3 regulates the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 beta (IL-1Î²), a key cytokine in the development of inflammatory syndromes such as macrophage activation syndrome. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been shown to induce NLRP3 inflammasome in mouse and human cells with multiple mechanisms [
