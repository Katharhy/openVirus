<p>Understanding how can bats coexist with so many viruses with no overt disease could provide guidance for the identification of treatment targets in humans. One hypothesis is that the bat immune system coevolved with viruses mitigating cellular pathways activated by viral infection to reach a state of reciprocal tolerance. Bats may be capable of limiting the infection-induced immunopathology even in the most highly infected tissues as a result of these unique adaptations at the cost of infection persistence and prolonged viral shedding [

Bat cells are capable of containing virus propagation by inducing an effective IFN production in response to viral RNA, while limiting the expression of virus-induced inflammatory cytokines. As gene-expression analyses have revealed, bat cells have varied and tightly regulated expression patterns of different IFN stimulated genes (ISGs). Compared to human cells, bat cells have higher baseline ISGs expression levels and upon IFN stimulus show a higher peak but also a more rapid decline in ISGs expression levels [
