<p>Tissue DCs can be activated by cytokines and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) or can be directly infected by SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B59-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In the case of SARS-CoV, it has been shown that the virus fails to actively replicate in DCs, which in turn produce large amounts of inflammatory IFNs [
 <xref rid="B60-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] and chemokines [
 <xref rid="B59-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Within hours after infection, DCs migrate to the draining lymph nodes, and present viral antigens to virus-specific T cells triggering adaptive immune response [
 <xref rid="B61-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. However, it has been hypothesized that SARS-CoV may be able to modulate the secretion of cytokines and chemokines by DCs, among its mechanisms to evade immune response [
