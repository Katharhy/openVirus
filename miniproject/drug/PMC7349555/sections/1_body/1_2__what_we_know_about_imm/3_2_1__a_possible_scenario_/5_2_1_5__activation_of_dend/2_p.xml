<p>Macrophages and neutrophils are also part of the inflammatory reaction and the balance of their activation may be a crucial point in determining the fate of the infection. Macrophages are thought to be among the major players in the production of inflammatory cytokines associated with Covid-19, including IL-6, TNF-Î±, and IL-1. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that infected macrophages expressing ACE2 could migrate to blood and spleen contributing to the spread of the infection [

Liao et al., analyzing cells from bronchoalveolar lavage of patients with Covid-19, showed that severe disease course was associated with a prevalence of monocyte-derived macrophages that overwhelmed tissue resident macrophages and produced large amounts of cytokines involved in the inflammatory storm typical of the disease. Conversely, in milder cases, tissue resident macrophages contributed to the expansion of clonal CD8 T cells [

On the contrary, removal of neutrophils in a mouse model of severe influenza hindered viral clearance. In this model, ablation of IL-6 accounted for a similar effect, since the cytokine has antiapoptotic effects on neutrophils [
