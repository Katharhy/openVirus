<p>In most cases, antiviral antibodies are considered able to block further spreading of the virus to other organs and to provide prompt defense against new challenges with the same virus. Moreover, administration of hyperimmune plasma from recovered patients has been proposed to treat patients with severe Covid-19 [
 <xref rid="B70-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. However, the development of protective antibodies is not strictly required to overcome the disease, since two subjects with congenital agammaglobulinemia spontaneously recovered from Covid-19 pneumonia [
 <xref rid="B71-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In contrast, subjects with common variable immunodeficiency, who have defective but not absent B-cell function, tend to develop more severe disease, requiring multiple drug treatment [
 <xref rid="B72-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. This may suggest that B cells may also be implied in severe Covid-19 pathogenesis. Non-protective antiviral antibodies may also be produced, which could even enhance viral entry in cells expressing the Fc receptor for immunoglobulins [

This phenomenon, named ADE (antibody dependent enhancement of viral entry) has been well described for other viruses and represents matter of concern for the development of vaccines. For example, engineering of SARS-CoV antigens has been proposed to select peptides inducing blocking antibodies but not ADE [
 <xref rid="B74-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. So far, though, ADE has not been demonstrated for SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, ADE has been demonstrated to occur both in subjects previously exposed to the same virus and in subjects exposed to viruses from the same family. For example, subjects who recovered from a first infection with Dengue virus may get infected again with worse course because of the presence of enhancing antibodies [

 <xref rid="B76-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The occurrence of ADE has been hypothesized also in subjects with severe course of Covid-19 in China, in areas that were previously hit by the epidemics of SARS-CoV [
