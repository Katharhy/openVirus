<p>Apart from antiviral response, other kinds of antibodies may be involved in the modulation of Covid-19 immunopathology. Liu et al. showed in an animal model of SARS-CoV infection that the presence of anti-spike IgG actually promoted proinflammatory monocyte/macrophage recruitment and lung injury. Moreover, sera from SARS-deceased patients enhanced monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) and IL-8 production by human monocyte-derived macrophages, which was reduced by blockade of FcÎ³R [

Interestingly, several clinical observations both with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that natural anti-blood group antibodies may also play a role in the infection, as O blood type could represent a protective factor as compared to A blood type [
