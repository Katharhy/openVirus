<p>Recent findings support a primary role of endothelial cell infection and resulting endotheliitis in Covid-19 pathogenesis, which may lead to vasculopathy, coagulopathy, and multiple organ injury [
 <xref rid="B31-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Endothelial injury may be due to direct viral infection of endothelial cells as well as to endothelial activation and apoptosis from inflammatory cytokines, especially tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±) [
 <xref rid="B34-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. According to recent unpublished data from autopsies, it has been argued that vascular damage with peripheral lung microthrombi may be an early phenomenon directly linked to viral infection rather than to the inflammatory reaction. A significant incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation and thromboembolism has been also reported. This led to the suggestion to introduce prophylactic heparin in hospitalized patients with Covid-19 [
