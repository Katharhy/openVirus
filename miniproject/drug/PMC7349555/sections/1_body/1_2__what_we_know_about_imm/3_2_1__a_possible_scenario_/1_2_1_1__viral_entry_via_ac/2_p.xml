<p>Coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein binds to ACE2 initiating viral entry into host cells. Of note, the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein for ACE2 is higher than that of SARS-CoV [

 <xref rid="B21-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Binding of the S1 subunit of the S protein to ACE2 is followed by the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes mediated by the S2 subunit of S protein and requires S protein priming by cellular proteases. For this purpose, SARS-CoV-2 mainly uses a serine protease, transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), and the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (CatB/L) [
