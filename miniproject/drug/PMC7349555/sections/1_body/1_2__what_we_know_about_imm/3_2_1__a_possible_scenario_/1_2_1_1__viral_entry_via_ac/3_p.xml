<p>After viral entry into cells, expression of membrane ACE2 is downregulated because of endocytosis of the receptor together with the virus. This event results in reduced metabolization and increased levels of angiotensin II in lung tissues and increased stimulation of the Type 1 Angiotensin II Receptor (ATR1), which mediates angiotensin II-induced vascular permeability and severe acute lung injury [

All these observations may explain why SARS-CoV-2 primarily causes pneumonia with vascular injury, differently from influenzavirus, and suggest that higher availability of membrane ACE2 may be protective. Furthermore, activation of ATR1 receptor directly upregulates NF-kB, as well as a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) on cell surface; ADAM17 in turn cleaves membrane TNF to soluble TNF and processes membrane IL-6R to the soluble sIL-6R, which allows IL6 responsiveness by many tissues through IL6 trans-signaling, leading to Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) activation and the amplification of Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-kB) activation [

Notably, SARS-CoV has been shown to cause caspase-1-mediated cell death (pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of cell death) via the activation of the Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) mediated by the viral 3a protein which acts as a potassium ion channel (viroporin) resulting in inflammasome activation [
