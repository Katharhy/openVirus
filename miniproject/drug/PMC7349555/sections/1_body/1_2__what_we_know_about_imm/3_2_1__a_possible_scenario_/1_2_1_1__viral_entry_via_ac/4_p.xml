<p>Besides alveolar cells, ACE2 is widely expressed also on endothelial cells, macrophages, heart, intestine, and kidney, and this may explain the involvement of these cells in severe cases of Covid-19 [

Furthermore, it has been suggested that SARS-CoV2 may persist longer in the digestive system, and this may be a cause of protracted form of disease requiring readmission to hospital in some patients due to gastroenteritis symptoms with persistence of viral RNA in stools after resolution of respiratory symptoms [
