<p>Overall, the occurrence of pulmonary vascular (micro)thrombosis and of vascular dysregulation due to angiotensin system abnormalities may account for the observation of severe hypoxemia despite high compliance of the lung, differently to what occurs in most other types of interstitial pneumonia. These findings are likely associated with an increase of dead space ventilation (ventilation of poorly perfused lung), a defective hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction with areas not ventilated but perfused (shunt), and may also partly explain the efficacy of proning in patients with respiratory failure [
