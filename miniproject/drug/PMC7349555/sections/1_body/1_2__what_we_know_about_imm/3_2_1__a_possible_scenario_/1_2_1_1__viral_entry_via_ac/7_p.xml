<p>Recent findings demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 also infect immune cells, causing activation and secretion of inflammatory cytokines [

SARS-CoV-2 seems unable to replicate in lymphocytes, and it is uncertain whether direct lymphocyte infection can contribute to the lymphopenia associated with severe Covid-19. Indeed, lymphopenia may just be due to apoptosis as a part of a multilinear cytopenia induced by hypercytokinemia or by overt hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [
