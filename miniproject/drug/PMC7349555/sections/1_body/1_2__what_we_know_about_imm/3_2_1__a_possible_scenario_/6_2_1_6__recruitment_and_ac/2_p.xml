<p>Recruitment of antiviral T cells is thought to occur mainly in draining peribronchial lymph nodes, where DCs bring viral antigens. The process of recruitment and expansion of lymphocytes is likely to start some days after virus infection and to take about a week in normal conditions. A crucial aspect to contrast the spreading of the infection is the availability of a large T cell repertoire, with several distinct precursors that can be clonally expanded. Indeed, rapid expansion of sufficient T cells to contrast the virus spreading is particularly important, as during the kinetics of the infection the coronaviruses tend to dampen T-cell response by several distinct mechanisms, including inhibition of DCs functions [
