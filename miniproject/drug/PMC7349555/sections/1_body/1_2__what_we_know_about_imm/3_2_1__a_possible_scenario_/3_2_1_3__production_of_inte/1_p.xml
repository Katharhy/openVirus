<p>Several evidences have shown that IFN-I production in the very early phase of the infection is a crucial step affecting the course of the disease. In an animal model of MERS-CoV infection, the timing of the IFN-I response directly influences the disease outcome, as early administration of IFN-I protects mice from lethal infection, while delayed treatment does not prevent the development of fatal pneumonia and cytokine storm [

Thus, it is logical to assume that a properly functioning pathway from the sensing of viral nucleic acids to IFN production is a prerequisite for an effective antiviral response. The importance of this pathway is also reinforced by the observation that germline defects in proteins involved in the IFN cascade are associated with mendelian susceptibility to severe viral infections [

The paracrine effect of IFNs involves an antiproliferative activity, mediated by the induction of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) and the activation of several immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) that mature, migrate, and increase antigen presentation, natural killer cells (NK) that increase their cytotoxic activity and IFN-Î³ secretion and T and B lymphocytes inducing Th1 polarization and immunoglobulin-secreting cells differentiation. Notably, interferon response has been found defective in 19% of severely ill subjects, thus supporting a possible pharmacological administration of the cytokine in this subset [
