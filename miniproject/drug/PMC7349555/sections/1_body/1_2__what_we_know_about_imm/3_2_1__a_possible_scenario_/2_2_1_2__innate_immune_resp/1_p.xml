<p>The initial response to coronaviruses infection by the innate immune system plays a pivotal role in determining the outcome of the infection. The sensing of foreign nucleic acids is the first step in the pathway to an effective immune response leading to viral clearance. Eukaryotic cells have several sensors, so-called pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that are activated by foreign pathogen-derived material. In the endosomal compartment, Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) recognizes double-stranded RNA derived by viral replication, while TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 recognize respectively single-stranded RNA (TLR7/8) and DNA (TLR9) sequences typical of virus and containing uCpG motifs. In the cytoplasm the two RNA sensors Retinoic Acid-Inducible Gene I (RIG-I) and Melanoma Differentiation-Associated protein 5 (MDA5) recognize double-stranded RNA intermediates produced during viral replication. Activation of cellular sensors elicits the production of type I IFNs and other inflammatory cytokines, which act on the infected cells and on the neighboring cells making them more resistant to the entry of other virus particles and act on resident dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages to promote the activation and organization of the antiviral response [
