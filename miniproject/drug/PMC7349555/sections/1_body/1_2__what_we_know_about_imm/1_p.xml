<p>Knowledge about host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is mostly derived from previous studies of other coronaviruses of the same family (betacoronavirus), namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Betacoronavirus are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of zoonotic origin [
 <xref rid="B11-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 genes share approximately 80% homology with SARS-CoV, suggesting that the two viruses belong to the same species. However, it is more likely that SARS-CoV-2 has developed from the bat coronavirus RaTG13, with which it has an even higher degree of homology, close to 96% [
