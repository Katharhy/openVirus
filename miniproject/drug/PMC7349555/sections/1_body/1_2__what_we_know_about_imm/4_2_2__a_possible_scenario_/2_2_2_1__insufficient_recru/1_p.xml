<p>For reasons that are not fully understood, some people fail to carry out the immune response properly. Since old age is the main risk factor for a severe course of the infection, we hypothesized that the reduced T cell repertoire associated with immune senescence accounts for a delayed adaptive immune response in elderly subjects, similarly to what has been reported for pandemic influenza or other viruses. Indeed, elderly subjects may fail recruiting enough virus-reactive lymphocytes to contrast infections from viruses for which they do not have immunological memory. This may be only one of the reasons why some patients develop severe courses of disease. Other factors affecting the course of the infection may include the production of non-neutralizing antibodies enhancing viral spreading and entry into cells (by ADE mechanism), or the worsening of vascular damage by autoantibodies. Impaired innate immunity, either due to ageing, virus-induced mechanisms of immune evasion, and possibly individual genetic differences, also contributes to inadequate adaptive immune response. It has been demonstrated, in fact, that blocking IFN-I signaling in MERS-CoV infection impairs virus-specific T-cell responses, leading to increased inflammation and altered cytokine response [
