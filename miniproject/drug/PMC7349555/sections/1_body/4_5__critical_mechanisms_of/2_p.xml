<p>All the components of immunity may act as friend or foe: IFNs are necessary in the first phase of the infection but may become harmful afterwards; tissue macrophages and DCs are important players in creating the correct local environment to defeat the virus, but they can be replaced by monocyte-derived macrophages with a stronger inflammatory activity and with the risk of bringing the virus to other organs; neutrophils are needed for viral clearance in animal models of infection with influenza virus, but are primary players of tissue damage in Covid-19; antibodies may be protective or harmful by enhancing viral entry or by targeting vascular structures. Healthy people may cope with an imbalance in these mechanisms until proper anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, and supportive treatments are given. On the contrary, people with older age and comorbidities may pay the higher fatality rate because of the establishment of vicious circles between inflammatory, respiratory and vascular processes. A possible list of critical mechanisms affecting the fate of Covid-19 is proposed in
