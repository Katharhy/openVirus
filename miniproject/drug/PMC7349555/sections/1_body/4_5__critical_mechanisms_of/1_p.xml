<p>A good balance between protective immunity and inflammation is crucial to overcome the infection. Prompt recruitment and expansion of virus-specific lymphocytes can lead to early viral clearance, preventing the development of significant organ damage. Conversely, slower activation of specific immunity may result in undisturbed viral replication, with widespread cell damage and secondary inflammatory amplification. Notably, SARS-CoV2 is a fast-replicating virus, reaching viral load peak in the upper airways within 5â€“6 days from symptoms onset, thus significantly earlier than SARS-CoV, which peaked at about 10 days, therefore a prompt and adequate immune response is crucial to avoid infection progression [
