<p>According to some authors, T-cell response may be more important than the humoral response, both for recovering from primary infection and to prevent reinfections. Unlike antibodies, SARS-CoV-specific memory, CD8 T cells have been observed for up to 6 years post-infection [

 <xref rid="B204-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>]. Virus-specific CD8 T cells are required for pathogen clearance during acute infection. After that, memory CD8 T cells persist at anatomical front-line sites of specific microbial exposure [
 <xref rid="B205-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>] and, upon re-stimulation, are capable of proliferating and secreting effector cytokines (IFN, TNF, and IL-2) and cytotoxic molecules (granzyme B and perforin), and to recruiting other immune cells [
 <xref rid="B206-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. So far, most of our understanding is derived from experimental studies in animal models. In mouse models, enhancement of SARS-CoV specific CD8 T cells by immunization with viral peptide-pulsed DCs results in a robust T-cell response, earlier virus clearance, and increased mouse survival [
