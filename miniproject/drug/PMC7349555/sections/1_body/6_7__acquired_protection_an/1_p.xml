<p>It is too early to be able to determine whether people can be re-infected by SARS-CoV-2 after recovery from Covid-19. Re-detection of viral RNA on nasopharyngeal swabs after two consecutive negative results was reported in asymptomatic patients during the convalescent phase [
 <xref rid="B191-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. However, since viral RNA shedding has been observed for days to weeks after resolution of symptoms [
 <xref rid="B140-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>,
 <xref rid="B192-vaccines-08-00224" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>], one possible explanation is that patients in whom SARS-CoV-2 RNA was re-detected had a false negative result due to an insufficient viral load of the specimen, or persistence of viral nucleic acids in the airways in the absence of the full, potentially infectious virus.
