<p>Much of our understanding of the immune response to coronavirus in humans comes from observations in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In longitudinal studies investigating the humoral immune response in patients who recovered from SARS and MERS, neutralizing antibodies against virus S protein were detectable for up to two years [
