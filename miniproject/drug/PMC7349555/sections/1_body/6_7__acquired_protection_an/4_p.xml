<p>These observations cast doubts on whether the antibody response can be used as a correlate or surrogate of protection following wild infection. Also, it is likely that vaccines combining both humoral and cellular responses might be necessary for coronavirus prevention [

Furthermore, the efficacy of the above-mentioned convalescent plasma therapy suggests the potential role of humoral response elicited by a vaccine. More information on the protective role of both humoral and cellular compartments will probably be obtained from observation of the vaccine-induced immune response.
