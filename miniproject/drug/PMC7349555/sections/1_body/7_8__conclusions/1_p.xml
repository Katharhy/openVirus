<p>Despite huge amounts of data from thousands of research articles published each month, most knowledge on Covid-19 is derived from descriptive works. To date a possible therapeutic approach could involve an antiviral and a cell-entry inhibitor for the first phase and an immunomodulant such as a IL6 or IL1 blocker for the second phase if inflammation persists, with special treatment such as convalescent plasma, hyperimmune globulins or SARS-CoV-2-specific monoclonal antibodies reserved to selected patients. Even if a fairly defined picture is being formed that summarizes the importance of virologic, vascular, and inflammatory factors, much remains to be understood regarding the relationship of dependence between distinct pathological events during the course of infection. Consequently, the proposal of therapeutic interventions which may seem rational in the various pathological phases is still today largely based on hypotheses.</p>
