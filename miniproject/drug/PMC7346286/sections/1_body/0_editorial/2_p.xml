<p>In case of structural changes, which may become necessary in teaching during epidemics, adaptation processes are not quite so easily implemented. During the EHEC epidemic in 2011, our nephrological-internal ward and several other wards of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf accommodated almost exclusively patients suffering from EHEC-induced haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) [

In the National Competence Based Catalogue of Learning Objectives (NKLM) of 2015, HUS is still listed as a rare disease under point 21.1.58 [
