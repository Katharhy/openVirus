<p>But other teaching techniques also help to improvise appropriate medical lessons in times of a lockdown, especially e-learning, of course [
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], because it is particularly easy to keep one’s distance. This issue also contains some interesting approaches in scientific work and projects which encourage creative thinking for medical teaching and testing in the current situation, although at the time of their creation there was no mention of SARS-CoV-2 at all. Rauch et al. report on the development of an instructional video for dental students to examine patients with suspected craniomandibular dysfunction [
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Perhaps a way can be found to allow dental students to practice clinical examination techniques with people in their own homes during a lockdown, guided by such videos. The project could perhaps also be adapted to a 4-step video format based on the so-called Peyton method, as is already used at the Ludwigs-Maximilians-University (LMU) in Munich [

Möltner et al. were able to show that the assessments of student raters in a formative OSCE in general medicine correlated highly with the assessments of medical experts [
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This scientific finding may also lead to the development of further training and assessment options for medical students as peers for practical and communicative skills. Findyartini et al. were able to show in their study that the motivation profile of medical students is associated with the empathy they express [
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, this project also offers interesting starting points for teaching and learning empathy. Zimmermann and Kadmon used standardized examinees who had received training for different levels of proficiency in OSCE stations that were filmed and can be used both for quality assurance of OSCE stations and for rater training [
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This concept can probably be easily and contactlessly used for rater training at other universities. These examples show the essential contribution that projects in medical education research make to enabling teachers to draw on evidence even in times when they have to improvise. So let’s stay tuned to improvised teaching – scientifically sound and creative.
