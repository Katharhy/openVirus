<p>The acquisition of improvisation skills is, for example, explicitly required for students of teacher training and is already being practiced in class in some cases [

This is already being implemented didactically in problem-based learning and leads to a better handling of uncertainty in everyday medical practice [
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Furthermore, there are frameworks that use techniques of improvisational theatre to enable medical students to learn how to deal with unknown medical situations [
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These techniques of improvisation could also be appropriate to enable teachers to teach adequately in uncertain times [
