  <title>Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree for HIV-1 
   <italic>pol s</italic>equences (n = 561).
  </title>
  <p>A) Viral strain sequences from people who inject drugs in Pakistan are annotated according to city of origin: Karachi (blue, n = 109 [19.4%]), Peshawar (orange, n = 94 [16.7%]), Hyderabad (purple, n = 42 [7.5%]), Larkana (green, n = 25 [4.5%]) and Quetta (red, n = 20 [3.6%]) while branches representing background sequences (n = 271 [48.3%]) were left black. Monophyletic clusters identified by Cluster Picker are highlighted by light grey bars. B) Sub-tree from principal maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree from HIV-1 
   <italic>pol</italic> sequences used for cluster analysis presenting HIV-1 subtype CRF35_AD sequences from people who inject drugs in Pakistan. The numbers on the branches represent the percentage of maximum likelihood ultra-fast bootstrap samples (100,000 replicates) where the node is supported by a value of â‰¥ 90%. Branches are annotated according to city or country of origin: Karachi (blue, n = 7 [20.0%]), Peshawar (orange, n = 1 [2.9%]), Hyderabad (purple, n = 1 [2.9%]), Quetta (red, n = 1 [2.9%]), Afghanistan (black, n = 10 [28.6%]), and grey (Iran, n = 15 [42.8%]).
