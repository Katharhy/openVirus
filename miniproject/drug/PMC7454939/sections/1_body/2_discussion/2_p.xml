<p>Drug injecting behaviours vary between cities, however unsafe injection practices, large injection networks and the use of professional injectors are common among PWID in Pakistan [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, it is not surprising that nearly three quarters of the HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences from this study are incorporated into HIV-1 phylogenetic transmission clusters. Seeking help injecting drugs from professional injectors has previously been identified as a strong correlate of HIV-1 infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. At the time of DBS collection, professional injectors were being employed as peer support workers in a number of the cities involved in this study (personal communications with the National AIDS Control Program). Our observation that the odds of clustering was 10.1% less among individuals who regularly sought assistance in injecting drugs supports the utility of this intervention at limiting onward HIV-1 transmission among PWID (manuscript in preparation). Consistent with this observation, one of the largest clusters we identified (n = 52) mainly consisted of individuals sampled in Peshawar (51 of 52) who did not seek help injecting drugs from professional injectors. At present, it is unclear if professional injectors have been employed as peer support workers in Peshawar, but our results would suggest that there may be other unidentified epidemic drivers in this particular city. Alternatively, it may indicate that some study participants did not understand the concept of sharing, did not understand questions pertaining to high risk injecting behaviors, or were unwilling to admit participation in such behaviors.
