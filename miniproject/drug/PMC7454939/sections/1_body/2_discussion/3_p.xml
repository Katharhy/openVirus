<p>Currently, Afghanistan produces approximately 80% of the world’s heroin supply [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Most of the heroin is trafficked through Pakistan before reaching its final destination in Europe, the Russian Federation and Asia [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As such, local consumption markets have been established mainly positioned along important regional trafficking routes. Once inside Pakistan, a significant amount of heroin is trafficked south along main roads and railways southward to Karachi [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Concurrently, acetic anhydride–a crucial precursor chemical for the synthesis of opium into heroin–is trafficked into Afghanistan allegedly along the same trafficking routes, albeit in the northward direction [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Acetic anhydride importation is prohibited in Afghanistan therefore the precursor needs to be smuggled into the country–primarily via Pakistan. Even though the earliest documented cases of HIV-1 infection were reported in Karachi [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the first outbreak reported among PWID was observed approximately 500 km to the North in Larkana [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. At the time, Shah 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2004) noted an increase in injection drug use and indicated that Larkana had become a “hub” of drug use activities, attracting users from all parts of the country. Shortly thereafter, (≤ 2 years) the epidemic spread to multiple cities, solidifying Pakistan’s concentrated epidemic among PWID (

 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The relatively short time to the most common recent ancestor observed in our analysis is consistent with rapid rises in HIV-1 infection among PWID in Pakistan. Taken altogether, the flow of opioid trafficking and epidemiological data are consistent with the observed HIV-1 migration patterns based on our molecular findings that place Larkana at the center of the PWID HIV-1 epidemic in Pakistan. Yet, we interpret these results with caution since most ancestral nodes had low posterior probability values. Several cities facing a concentrated HIV-1 epidemic [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] were not sampled during this study, so HIV-1 migration patterns could change with the addition of new/different sampling locations. Furthermore, it would also be important to consider internal population displacement (IDP) due to economic hardship, natural disasters and conflict (
