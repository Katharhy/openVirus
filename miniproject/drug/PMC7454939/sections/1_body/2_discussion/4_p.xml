<p>Initially, high quality powder heroin was abundant in Pakistan with smoking being the primary means of consumption [

 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] in Pakistan by causing fluctuations in prices, purity and availability of heroin. It is widely known that the Taliban relies on heroin production and trafficking to fund operations. Consistent with this, trends in opium cultivation over the last decade have generally reflected conflict intensity in the area [

 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. More specifically, both spikes in estimates of HIV-1 effective population sizes coincided with increases in opium poppy cultivation. This observation suggests that the transmission of HIV-1 among PWID in Pakistan is associated with local trends in opium trafficking–influenced by conflict–and exacerbated by unsafe injection practices. Nevertheless, our analysis was limited to sequences from samples collected in 2005, 2007 and 2014 so we cannot rule out other possibilities that could explain instances of HIV-1 effective population growth like contractions of HIV/AIDS programs caused by the reallocation of funds to disaster relief efforts (i.e. major flooding) over the last decade [
