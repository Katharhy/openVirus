<p>Pakistan is currently facing a concentrated HIV-1 epidemic among PWID in multiple cities including Karachi, Hyderabad, Larkana, Quetta and Peshawar despite interventions, such as syringe and needle exchange programs [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Earlier phylogenetic studies reported that the HIV-1 epidemic may have been the result of the transmission of a founding subtype A1 virus originating in the 1990s [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Our study indicates that this is no longer the case since we observed greater subtype heterogeneity among HIV-1 positive PWID especially in cities such as Karachi. Although subtype A1 is still the dominant circulating strain in Pakistan, greater subtype heterogeneity may be indicative of overlapping sexual and/or drug injecting networks between PWID and other high-risk populations. Existing behavioural data [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] suggest significant sexual and/or drug injection networking between PWID and female sex workers (FSW), hijra sex workers (HSW), and male sex workers (MSW) as well as Afghan refugees residing in Pakistan [

 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 
 <italic>gag</italic> gene sequences [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] showed that the HIV-1 epidemic in Pakistani MSM is represented by HIV-1 subtypes A, G, CRF01_AE and CRF02_AG while these subtypes in addition to CRF35_AD can be found circulating among HIV-1 positive Afghan refugees living in Karachi [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It would not be unexpected that extremely high risk injecting reported earlier [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], in an environment of increasing HIV-1 prevalence, could contribute to frequent infection of a single individual with multiple subtypes of HIV-1 leading to the generation of unique recombinant forms. A unique method of assisted injection, locally referred to as “scale”, was first reported among PWID in the city of Sargodha in 2009 [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This practice involves collecting blood-drug mixtures (“scale”) as payment for professional injection services by double-pumping syringes. The “scale” is then either sold to another client or used by the injector. Recently, Chen 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported on unique CRF02_AG/A1 recombinants, indicating ongoing recombination between locally transmitted CRF02_AG and A1 strains, suggesting that these unique recombinants may become major epidemic strains in Pakistan. It is likely that we underestimated the proportion of recombinant HIV-1 sequences in our population given we only sequenced a portion of the HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene. More extensive, whole genome-based sequence analysis would be required to resolve the potential HIV-1 recombination events among Pakistani PWID.
