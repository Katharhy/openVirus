<p>The ML analysis of PWID sequences was done with background sequences consisting of all available HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences from Pakistan in the Los Alamos HIV database as well as closely related sequences determined by BLASTn [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] searches. Details regarding these sequences can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237560.s003">S2 Table</xref>. The phylogenetic tree inferred by ML analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237560.g002">Fig 2a</xref>) reveals close relationship between PWID infections, most notably in Peshawar. Of particular interest, several HIV-1 subtype CRF35_AD PWID sequences from our study were nested among sequences from Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237560.g002">Fig 2b</xref>), supported by a high bootstrap value, suggesting a close genetic relationship.
