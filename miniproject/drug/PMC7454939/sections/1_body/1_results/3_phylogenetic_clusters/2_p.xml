<p>Out of the 290 HIV-1 sequences collected from PWIDs, 213 (73.5%) were associated with one of several phylogenetic clusters. In total, 5 distinct clusters ranging from 8 to 118 sequences in size were identified using tip-to-tip (patristic) distances (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237560.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Altogether, the odds of clustering among sequences from PWID who sought help injecting drugs was 10.1% (OR 0.899; 95% CI, 0.523â€“1.533) less compared to sequences from PWID who did not seek help injecting but this was found to be non-significant (X
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.064, df = 1, p&gt;0.05).
