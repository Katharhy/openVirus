<p>Each viral sequence from our study was assigned a subtype based on an analysis performed with automated HIV-1 subtyping tools (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237560.s002">S1 Table</xref>). The geographic distribution of HIV-1 subtypes among PWID is depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237560.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Overall, subtype A1 strains were dominant (75.2%) followed by CRF02_AG (14.1%), recombinants/unassigned (7.2%), CRF35_AD (2.1%), G (1.0%) and C (0.3%).
