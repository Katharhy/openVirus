<p>Bayesian skyline plot analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237560.g004">Fig 4</xref>) for the period of 1994 to 2013 suggests that HIV-1 among PWID in Pakistan experienced an initial phase of exponential growth sometime around 2004 and peaked in 2006. Over the next two years, only minor changes to the median effective population size were observed until a second instance of exponential growth occurred around 2008 reaching a peak in 2012. Both spikes in HIV-1 median effective population size overlapped with increases in opium cultivation (
