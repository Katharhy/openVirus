<p>PWID HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences were aligned, visually inspected and manually edited in MEGA v7 [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] as required. Codons associated with major drug-resistance mutations were not removed from sequence alignments because participants were most likely antiretroviral treatment (ART)-na√Øve due to poor coverage of HIV/AIDS treatment programs. [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Each PWID specimen was subtyped with the REGA HIV-1 automated subtyping tool v3 [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and COMET [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In the event of discordant results, SCUEAL [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] was used as a tiebreaker.
