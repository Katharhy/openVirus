<p>For phylogenetic cluster analysis, reference and background sequences were obtained from the Los Alamos HIV database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/</ext-link>). Furthermore, the top 10 BLASTn hits for each PWID HIV-1 sequence were also included as background sequences. Duplicate sequences were removed from the alignment. Maximum likelihood (ML) trees were reconstructed with IQ-TREE v1.4.4 [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], using the best-fitting substitution model selected automatically by IQ-TREE. Reliability of the tree topologies was assessed by ultra-fast bootstrap [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] re-sampling (100,000 replicates). Monophyletic clades were identified with ClusterPicker v1.2.3 using 90% bootstrap support, a genetic distance cutoff of 4.5% and a large cluster threshold of 5 [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Trees were visualized and annotated in FigTree v1.4.3 (
