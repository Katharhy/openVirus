<p>Effective population size estimates (Bayesian skyline plot analysis) were inferred using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis of time-stamped taxa using BEAST v1.10.4 [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] under a general time reversible (GTR) substitution model (4 gamma categories), a strict molecular clock model set to a rate of 2.5 x 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site/year (1.1, 4.0; 95% confidence interval) [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], a coalescent Bayesian Skyline tree prior [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and chain lengths of 1–9 x 10
 <sup>8</sup> sampled to generate 10,000 trees. Different demographic models were compared by marginal likelihood estimation (i.e. path sampling/stepping-stone sampling) as implemented in BEAST v1.10.4 [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The coalescent Bayesian Skyline tree prior had the highest log marginal likelihood (-13,303.7) compared to the coalescent constant size (-13,500.2), coalescent exponential size (-13,360.6), coalescent logistic growth (-13,351.6), and coalescent Bayesian SkyGrid (-13,386.0) tree priors. Convergence of each run was assessed using Tracer v1.7.1 to ensure that effective sample sizes (ESS) &gt;200 were obtained for all statistics and that acceptable mixing was achieved [

Effective population size estimates of HIV-1 were limited to subtype A1 sequences from this study and databases sequences (listed above) with injection drug use as a known risk behavior. HIV-1 subtype A1 sequences were chosen according to the subtyping approach described above. Any potential recombinant HIV-1 subtype A1 sequences were identified with Recombination Detection Program (RDP) v4.97 [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and omitted from HIV-1 effective population size estimates (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237560.s011">S10 Table</xref>). The relationship between effective HIV-1 population size estimates and opium cultivation was modeled by linear regression in SPSS (IBM, Armonk, NY).
