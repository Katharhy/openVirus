<p>A routine, in-house HIV-1 drug resistance mutation genotyping assay was used to sequence a portion of the 
 <italic>pol</italic> open reading frame (nt 2,074–3,334 on HXB2, K03455). Internal validation (results not shown) determined that the lower limit of detection of the assay on DBS is approximately ≥1,000 HIV-1 copies/mL. Briefly, total nucleic acid was isolated from a single DBS (approximately 75 μL of whole blood) using an automated, magnetic silica-based, NucliSENS easyMAG instrument (bioMérieux, St-Laurent, QC) according to the manufacturer’s specific B protocol (version 2.0.1). Each DBS were lysed for 1 hour at room temperature with gentle agitation in 2 mL of NucliSENS lysis buffer (bioMérieux). Purified nucleic acid was eluted in 50 μL of NucliSENS extraction buffer 3 (bioMérieux) and stored immediately at -80°C. The 
 <italic>protease</italic> (PROT) and partial 
 <italic>reverse transcriptase</italic> (RT) genes were amplified in two separate fragments by reverse transcriptase PCR (

Sanger sequencing was performed using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) with nested PCR and sequencing primers (

 <italic>pol</italic> sequences from Karachi (accession no. JQ011747, JQ011748, and JQ011750—JQ011780) and Sargodha (accession no.
