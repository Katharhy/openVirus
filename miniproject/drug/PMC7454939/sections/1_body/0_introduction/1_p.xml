<p>Pakistan is considered to have transitioned from a “low prevalence, high risk” to a “concentrated” epidemic stage owing primarily to a rapid rise in infections among people who inject drugs (PWID,

Concern remains that the HIV-1 epidemic within the country’s PWID population could spread to other at-risk populations such as male, transgender and female sex workers, thereby intensifying epidemics in high risk sexual networks in Pakistan.
