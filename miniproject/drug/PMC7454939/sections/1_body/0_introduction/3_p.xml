<p>It has been reported that HIV-1 clade A1 infections in the Pakistani port city of Karachi may be the result of onward transmission among PWID of a highly similar founder virus [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 
 <italic>gag</italic> sequences derived from 26 HIV-1 positive PWID generated a single monophyletic clade A1 cluster with an inter-sequence identity of greater than 98%. In addition, Rai 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2010) deduced that the Karachi A1 HIV-1 epidemic was likely seeded by migrant contract workers who had been deported to Pakistan in the early 1990s after supposedly contracting HIV-1 through contact with sex workers in the Middle East. In this study, using HIV-1 sequence data from HIV-1 positive dried blood spot (DBS) specimens collected as part of a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2014, we sought to use phylodynamic methods to better understand the dynamics of HIV-1 transmission within Pakistanâ€™s at risk populations. Specifically, to examine HIV-1 transmission clusters within and among cities in Pakistan and test hypotheses concerning the association between rates of HIV-1 transmission and regional trends in opioid trafficking.
