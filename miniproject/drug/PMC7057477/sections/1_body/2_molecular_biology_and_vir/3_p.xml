<p id="Par6">All identified structures of flaviviruses vary on the basis of amino acids that are framing a glycosylation spot in the shell of virus that is composed of two dissimilar proteins having 180 copies. ZIKV varies from other flaviviruses bulges by glycosylation spot on the surface of the virus. A carbohydrate molecule holds numerous sugars tied to the surface of viral protein at this spot. Surrounding residues and glycosylation site on ZIKV may be responsible for attachment of virus to human cells. The amino acids variations among different flaviviruses could suggest the differences in the varieties of human cells where it can attach and infect. If the function of glycosylation spot is analogous to DENV (attachment to the cells receptor of human body) it might be a worthy spot to be targeted by an antiviral compound [
