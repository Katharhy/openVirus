<p id="Par5">The length of ZIKV genome is 10,794 kb, comprising a positive sense single-stranded RNA molecule having two noncoding regions (NCR); 39 and 59 NCR and a long open reading frame that encode a polyprotein: 59-C-prM-E-NS1-NS2A-NS2BNS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5-39. The protein is cleaved into capsid (C), envelope (E), precursor of membrane (prM) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1-NS2A-NS2BNS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The major virion surface protein is E protein. This protein is involved in various features of the viral cycle, membrane fusion and mediating binding. The largest viral protein whose C-terminal portion has RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) is NS5 protein activity and its N-terminus is responsible for RNA capping because of its processing due to methyl transferase activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. 428 nucleotides and 27 folding patterns are present in the 39 NCR of the ZIKV genome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. These nucleotides and folding patterns may involve in the cyclization, translation, recognition by cellular factors, RNA packaging, recognition by viral factors and genome stabilization [
