 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> are the potential vectors responsible for the transmission of ZIKV infection by biting. 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is the foremost vector of DENV and CHIKV. 
 <italic>Aedes polynesiensis</italic> is the main vector responsible for dissemination of lymphatic filariasis in French Polynesia. After the epidemic in French Polynesia these species of mosquitoes were collected and tested for ZIKV infection by RT-PCR and only one
