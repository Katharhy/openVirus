<p id="Par21">Suggested workflow for prompt discovery of drug counter to ZIKV is presented in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>; whole process is proposed to initiate from screening moderate or high-throughput in vitro analysis development following with testing of approved drugs or other antiviral agents. Virtual screening based on docking could be selected for testing further compounds by means of advanced model of homology or phenotypic and genotypic analyses if drug repurposing will be unsuccessful. Priority can be given to the compounds resulting from docking for in vitro analysis in parallel. Consequent steps are typical as a pipeline in the discovery of any drug including developing the models of animals, clinical trial and if getting optimistic results, manufacturing the drug against ZIKV by scale up process, advertising and dissemination of drug [
