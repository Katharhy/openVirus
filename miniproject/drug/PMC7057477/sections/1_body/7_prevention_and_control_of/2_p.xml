<p id="Par23">Besides, different vector control strategies for averting Zika virus spread can be employed. Subjugation of mosquito population can be accomplished by a bacterium that can infect mosquitoes. Other strategies include the use of intracellular bacteria 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, which acts as a biopesticide to control mosquito population. Larvae of 
 <italic>Toxorhynchites splendens</italic> mosquito species does not feed on blood. They feed on the larvae of other mosquito species, while the adults feed on honeydew, fruit, and nectar [

 <italic>Aedes</italic> species mosquitoes populations can also be suppressed by the strategy of using sterile males to induce sterility in wild fertile females [
