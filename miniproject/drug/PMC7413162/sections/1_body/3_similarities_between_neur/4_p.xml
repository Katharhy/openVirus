<p id="p0295">In this review, we tried to gather and summarize the results of all the studies reporting neurological disorders observed in patients with CoV infections. However, in some of the reported patients, the neurological manifestations might not be associated with the CoV infections and just coincidentally occurred due to the patientâ€™s underlying comorbidities. Moreover, in patients with severe CoV infections, the associated sepsis and organs failure my lead to different neurological presentations which can be seen in any of critical conditions. In addition, in several studies, particularly in the case of COVID-19, sufficient investigations have not been performed and hard to believe that the neurological manifestation was related to CoV infection. Finally, yet importantly, the neurological symptoms in some of these patients might be medications side effects given CoV infected patients have been treated with different classes of medications, which have side effects, not necessarily reported in the studies.</p>
