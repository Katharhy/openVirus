<p id="p0065">Articles written in English were included. The authors evaluated the titles and abstracts of each article for screening and inclusion. Articles evaluating CoV infections with respect to the neurological complications in human (original articles and reports of the cases (case series, case reports, letters, correspondence, or short communications which presented at least 1 case)) were reviewed in full text by the authors and included. (In COVID-19 we just included the studies which described neurological symptoms in adults) Studies not related to the CoV infections or their neurological manifestations were excluded from the review. Duplicated results were removed. We also reviewed relevant references in each article. Data from each article was extracted into the Microsoft Excel software.</p>
