 <bold>Leukoencephalopathy</bold> after COVID-19 was reported in 18 patients out of 3 studies. Radmanesh A et al. [
 <xref rid="bb0725" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>] reported diffuse white matter T2 hyperintensity plus restricted diffusion in 11 critically ill COVID-19 patients. Despite the fact that these findings are nonspecific and that their exact etiology is not certain; they attributed such findings to delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy. This pattern has been described in patients approximately 10-14 days after a hypoxic insult such as carbon monoxide poisoning, drug overdose, and cardiopulmonary arrests [
 <xref rid="bb0725" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>] and It is believed to relate to oligodendroglial cell death and subsequently demyelination. Other potential etiologies can be direct cerebral infection, sepsis-associated encephalopathy, post-infectious demyelination, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). [
