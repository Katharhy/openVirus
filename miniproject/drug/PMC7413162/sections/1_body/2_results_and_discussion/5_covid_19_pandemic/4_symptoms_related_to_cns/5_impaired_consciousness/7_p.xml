 <bold>Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)</bold> usually presents with acute impairment in level of consciousness, headache, visual disturbance and seizures. It is usually associated with cortical or subcortical vasogenic edema, involving predominantly the parietal and occipital regions bilaterally. [
 <xref rid="bb0815" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>] This condition is commonly associated with fluctuation in blood pressure, renal failure, autoimmune conditions, infections and sepsis, preeclampsia or eclampsia and certain type of immunosuppressive-cytotoxic drugs. [

 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) Definitive etiology is not fully understood but there are various proposed underlying mechanisms. In COVID-19, endothelial dysfunction related to SARS-CoV-2 in combination with hemodynamic instability and immunological activation with release of cytokines may increase the vascular permeability in the brain tissue. Furthermore, disruption of BBB in these cases may cause vasogenic edema and PRES. [

 <xref rid="bb0825" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>] suggested that COVID-19 patients may be at higher risk of consequences of uncontrolled hypertension such as hypertensive encephalopathy and PRES due to endothelial dysfunction. For this reason, tight blood pressure control was suggested, particularly in ventilated COVID-19 patients.
