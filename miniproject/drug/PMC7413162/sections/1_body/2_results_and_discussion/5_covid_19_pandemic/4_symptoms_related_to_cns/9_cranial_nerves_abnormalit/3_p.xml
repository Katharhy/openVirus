<p id="p0255">MRI abnormalities of the olfactory bulb of COVID-19 patients have been reported in several studies. [
 <xref rid="bb1035" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>] Politi SL et al. [
 <xref rid="bb1045" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>], reported a 25-year-old female with anosmia and subtle hyper-intensity signal in the olfactory bulbs and also cortical hyper-intensity in the right gyrus rectus. In follow/up MRI after 28 days, the olfactory bulbs were thinner and slightly less hyper-intense and the signal alteration in the cortex had completely disappeared. (
