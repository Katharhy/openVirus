<p id="p0245">Hanafi R, et al. [
 <xref rid="bb0925" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>] reported a 65-year-old man with COVID-19 who had extensive diffuse subcortical ischemic lesions in the brain resembling cerebral vasculitis. (
 <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> ) He also developed a characteristic lower extremity skin rash. SARS-CoV-2 infects the host through its CoV spike glycoprotein, which binds to the ACE2 receptor. ACE2 receptor has higher expression in neurons and cerebral vessel endothelial cells which can cause high level of CNS invasion. [

 <xref rid="bb0930" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>] Histologic evidence of COVID-19â€“induced vasculitis has been reported in several other organs including lung, kidney, liver and skin. [
