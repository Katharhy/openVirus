Coagulation abnormalities have been shown in critically ill COVID 19 patients. This was characterized by rise in procoagulant factors, including serum levels of fibrinogen (94%), platelet (62%), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and D-dimer (100%) which subsequently may contribute to elevated rate of thromboembolic events and higher rate of mortality and morbidity.

It was shown that SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to ACE2 which is located in the lung, small intestinal and brain vessel endothelial cells. Depletion of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 virus may cause imbalance of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) which might result in endothelial dysfunction and subsequently ischemic events. [
