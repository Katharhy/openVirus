 <xref rid="t0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) In the severe COVID-19 patients, critical illness myopathy has been reported. Major proposed risk factors for this type of myopathy are severe respiratory distress, systemic inflammatory response and sepsis. [

 <xref rid="bb1255" ref-type="bibr">251</xref>] Moreover direct invasion of the muscle by the virus is the other potential mechanism for myopathy. Similar to SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 have the ability to penetrate the cells that express ACE2 receptors. As ACE2 is expressed in the muscle cells, the possibility of invasion of the muscles by the virus entering the cells via the ACE2 receptors should also be considered. In addition, hyper-inflammation and cytokine storms in the advanced phase of COVID-19 could cause immune-mediated muscle damage. [
 <xref rid="bb1250" ref-type="bibr">250</xref>] Considering the growing number of patients with COVID-19, myopathy should be considered as a major cause of long-term physical disability [
