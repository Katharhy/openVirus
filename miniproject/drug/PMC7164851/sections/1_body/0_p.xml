<p id="para0001">In this special collection, we present a series of papers which highlight the varied ways mathematical and economic models are being applied to inform drug policymaking, with specific focus on prevention of hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV, and overdose among people who use or inject drugs. The variety of modeling approaches discussed in this issue (deterministic compartmental modeling, individual-based network modeling, economic and cost-effectiveness modeling), as well as the breadth of applications (HIV, HCV, overdose) and settings (U.S., Canada, Mexico, Tanzania), highlights different examples of how modeling evidence is being used to improve the health of people who use drugs. From quantifying structural drivers of epidemics (such as criminalization and incarceration) to decisions about who pays for what, modeling continues to play an important role in informing and guiding evidence-based drug policy.</p>
