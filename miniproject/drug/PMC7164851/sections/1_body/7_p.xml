 <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">Rhodes &amp; Lancaster, 2020</xref>). They use ideas from science and technology studies (STS) to trace how modeling projections act as 'performative actors' in evidence-making for HCV elimination. This helps to notice how modeled projections are having social and material impacts, including in policy, and through the numerical targets they generate. We agree with their call that closer collaboration between social scientists and modelers will allow for a deeper and more nuanced understanding of how modeling influences policymaking, and our role as modelers in this process.
