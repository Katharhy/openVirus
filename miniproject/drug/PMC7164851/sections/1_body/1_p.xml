<p id="para0002">The emerging opioid overdose crisis in North America is addressed in two articles. Irvine and colleagues provide an important case study as to how modelers and policymakers collaborated to generate useful simulations of public health strategies to support the response to the opioid overdose crisis in British Columbia, Vancouver (

Colleagues from the Opioid Use Disorder Modeling writing group provide a commentary detailing the variety of uses for simulation models for considering the epidemic of opioid use disorder in the US, and interventions to tackle the epidemic (
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Group, 2020</xref>). Together, these pieces highlight the challenges this rapidly emerging situation poses to modeling, but the important role that modelers can play in informing public health strategies and policy. We hope that a coordinated effort amongst modeling teams occurs, each of whom can provide different methodological approaches and viewpoints on the problem, as well as facilitate data sharing. Indeed, these coordinated modeling and data sharing efforts have helped inform the public health understanding and response to HIV as well as, more recently, coronavirus (
