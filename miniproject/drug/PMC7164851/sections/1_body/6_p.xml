<p id="para0007">We now know that HCV elimination can theoretically be achieved in many different settings, as shown by an array of models using different model structures and assumptions. Empirical studies are now needed to show it can become a reality, such as the Surveillance and Treatment of Prisoners with Hepatitis C (SToP-C) project, a study evaluating the scale-up of HCV treatment on HCV incidence within prisons in Australia. This will help validate these models and confirm that treatment of individuals can prevent transmission at a population level. In situations where HCV treatment and prevention programs are implemented, modeling is also still important for evaluating the impact achieved and to help direct those programs (
