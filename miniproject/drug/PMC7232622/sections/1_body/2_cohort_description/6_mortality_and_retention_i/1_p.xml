<p>In cohorts of PLWHIV who initiated ART in consecutive 2-year periods from 2001 to 2016, mortality at 3 years declined substantially in all African IeDEA regions (

Loss to follow-up has been an important issue for IeDEA, and activities to trace PLWHIV not returning to the clinic have increased in recent years. At present, tracing of PLWHIV on ART who were lost to follow-up is in place in 89% of the active facilities; 75% have implemented it routinely (
