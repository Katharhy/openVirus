<p>Since its inception, IeDEA has collected routine clinical data of PLWHIV followed under treatment, which includes sociodemographic characteristics, clinical outcomes, opportunistic events, treatment regimens, clinic visits and laboratory measurements. More recently, the IeDEA network has developed a Data Exchange Standard protocol (see 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.iedeades.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.iedeades.org</ext-link>) with 25 data tables, which include a total of 228 unique variables (36 compulsory and 192 additional variables) and within-region unique patient research identifiers. Standardised data collection is supported by eight codebooks, including the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification for drugs and lists with codes for reasons for stopping treatment, for dropping out of the cohort, for mode of HIV infection, country, type and site of comorbidities, laboratory measurements and units of measurements and type of viral load assay. The collection, management and sharing of data is facilitated by the Harmonist toolkit, a software and standards package that supports research projects through the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system.
