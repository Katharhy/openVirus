<p>Nearly all countries in sub-Saharan Africa have now adopted national polices to offer ART to all PLWHIV regardless of CD4 cell count or clinical stage (‘Treat All’), in order to meet the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets. In 2011, Malawi was one of the first countries to implement such a strategy for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission, recommending ART for pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV, regardless of CD4 cell count or WHO clinical stage (‘Option B+’). An IeDEA analysis of the Malawian experience showed that poor retention in care was a problem in many facilities, with early loss to follow-up particularly high in facilities with a high patient volume and in patients who start ART during pregnancy on the day of HIV diagnosis.
