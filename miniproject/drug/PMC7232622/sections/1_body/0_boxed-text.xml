   <p>An important strength of the International epidemiology databases to evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) cohort collaboration in sub-Saharan Africa is its large size, which allows analyses of outcomes of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in children, adolescents and pregnant and postpartum women, across diverse settings.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>The data reflect routine care across a wide range of real-world settings during the scale up of ART in sub-Saharan Africa and thus provide a valuable platform to conduct operational and clinical research and to study temporal trends and the impact of changes in guidelines and other interventions.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>The development of a standardised Data Exchange Standard protocol has contributed to increase data quality, and data have been enriched by linkage to cancer registries, vital registries and administrative databases.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Collaborations with the WHO, United Nations Programme on AIDS, the mathematical modelling community and other consortia have ensured that the analyses of the African IeDEA regions contributed to global health policy and decision-making.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Weaknesses include the limitations inherent in secondary use of routine clinical care data, with missing data, the lack of standardised follow-up visits and substantial loss to follow-up resulting in unknown outcome.</p>
