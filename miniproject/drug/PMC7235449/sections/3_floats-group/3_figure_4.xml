  <p>Adoptive transfer of CD4+ T cells into ONNV-infected TCR
   <sup>−/−</sup> mice re-establishes virus-induced joint swelling. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> CD4+ T cells were negatively isolated from spleens of ONNV-infected or mock-infected WT C57BL/6 donors. Isolated CD4+ T cells were then transferred into respective groups of recipient TCR
   <sup>−/−</sup> mice (1 spleen to 1 recipient). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Joint swelling and 
   <bold>(C)</bold> viremia of ONNV-infected recipient TCR
   <sup>−/−</sup> mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5 per group) were monitored over 2-weeks. Data are presented as mean ± SD. Statistical analyses were performed using two-tailed Mann Whitney 
   <italic>U</italic>-test (
