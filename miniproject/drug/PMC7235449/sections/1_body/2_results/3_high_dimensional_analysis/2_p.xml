<p>To quantify the number of cells infiltrating into the joints upon ONNV infection, cells acquired from the flow cytometry were sorted into the major leukocyte subsets based on the surface expression of lineage markers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>). Several immune cell subsets were present in the infected joints at 6 dpi, notably CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, NK cells, neutrophils, monocytes and activated CD64+ MHC-II+ monocytes (
