<p>To validate the absence of vascular leakage in ONNV-infected joints, tracer assay and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging were performed. At the peak of joint swelling, a marginal and non-significant increase of tracer dye could be detected in ONNV-infected joints as compared to mock-infected controls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Together, these results show that ONNV infection does not cause a detectable edema and vascular leakage in the joints.
