<p>To optimize an 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> pre-clinical model for ONNV, one million infectious ONNV particles were subcutaneously inoculated into the right-hind joints of 3-week-old (WO) or 6WO C57BL/6J mice, and the progression of viremia and joint inflammation were monitored for 14 days. Both 3WO and 6WO mice developed self-limiting viremia and arthralgia, which recapitulated the clinical symptoms observed in patients (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Notably, 3-week-old mice suffered from significantly higher levels of viral load in the peripheral blood compared to 6WO mice. At 6 days post-infection (dpi), viremia from both groups start to drop below detection limit of 10 genome copies per Î¼l (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, while viremia in 6WO mice plateaued from 1 to 4 dpi, the levels were highly variable within the group, with 20 to 40% of mice having viremia below detection limit during this period suggesting that 3WO mice are a more consistent model for investigating 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> viral resolution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). To confirm that viremia in the early acute phase was representative of viral replication instead of inoculum decay, we constructed a ONNV reporter infectious clone carrying a Firefly luciferase gene expressed only during replication (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). This confirms that viral replication can be observed as early as 6 h post-infection (hpi), and peaks at 12 hpi in 3WO mice (
