<p>PET-CT scanning was performed on 0, 4, and 6 days after ONNV infection using a Siemens Inveon PET-CT. Briefly, animals were sedated using 1.5% inhaled isoflurane and injected with [
 <sup>18</sup>F]FB-IL-2 (~10 MBq per animal) via the lateral tail vein. A 10 min static PET acquisition was performed 60 min post tracer-injection. CT scans were performed for anatomical co-registration and attenuation correction. During the scanning, animals were monitored for body temperature and respiration rate using a Biovet physiological monitoring system. Post image-analysis of reconstructed calibrated images were performed with FIJI and Amide software (version 10.3 Sourceforge). Uptake of radioactivity in the paw region was determined by the placement of a region of interest (ROI) over the paw delineated by CT images. The [
 <sup>18</sup>F]FB-IL-2 uptake was expressed as percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g).
