<p>Firefly luciferase (Fluc)-tagged ONNV infectious clone (ONNV-Fluc), with the Fluc gene inserted between the two open reading frames was produced using a similar methodology as previously described (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Expression of Fluc gene is regulated by a second sub-genomic promoter. ONNV-Fluc was propagated in C6/36 and virus titers were determined by standard plaque assay using Vero E6 cells.
