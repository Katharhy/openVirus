<p>Ten microliters of blood were obtained from the tail vein, and re-suspended in 120 μl of PBS supplemented with 10 μl of citrate-phosphate-dextrose solution (Sigma-Aldrich). The viral RNA in the blood samples were purified by QIAamp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Viral RNA is eluted in 60 μl of elution buffer. Viral load in 1 μl of the elution buffer was subsequently quantified by qRT-PCR using QuantiTect Probe RT PCR kit (Qiagen). For ONNV viral genome quantification, the following primers were designed to amplify negative nsP1 viral RNA: forward primer (AATTACGCGAGAAAACTTGCG), reverse primer (TTTTTCCAGAGATGTTTTTATCTGT) and TaqMan Probe (CCGCTGGAAAGGT), as described previously (
