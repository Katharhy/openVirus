<p>ONNV-infected mice were euthanized at 6 dpi. Joints were harvested at the ankles, deskinned, and placed in 4 ml of digestion medium containing dispase I (2 U/ml; Invitrogen), collagenase IV (20 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), and DNase I mix (50 μg/ml; Roche Applied Science) in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Joints were incubated in digestion medium for 4 h at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> on a shaker. Digested tissues were then placed and grounded in 40 μm cell strainer with 1 ml syringe plunger. Red blood cells were lysed using ammonium chloride solution. Samples were then washed and resuspended in 2 ml complete RPMI medium, and overlaid onto 1 ml 35% v/v Percoll/ RPMI medium (Sigma-Aldrich) for gradient centrifugation at 2,400 rpm for 20 min. Cells were washed and resuspended in complete RPMI before counting with hemocytometer (
