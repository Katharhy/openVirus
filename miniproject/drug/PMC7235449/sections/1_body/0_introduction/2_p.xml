<p>ONNV has been the cause of few, but major epidemics confined to Africa. It was first discovered in 1959, during a large outbreak in northern Uganda that affected more that 2 million people (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). After a 35-year hiatus, ONNV re-emerged with two outbreaks in 1996 and 2003 in southern-central Uganda and Ivory Coast, respectively, affecting thousands of people (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), hindering proper detection and diagnosis. Concordantly, recent serological studies revealed high proportions of previously unreported alphavirus-seropositive coastal Kenya and Uganda populations, particularly to ONNV and closely-related CHIKV (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The absence of epidemiological data on transmission levels in Africa and other regions highlight ONNV as an arbovirus with high potential of global spread. Currently, the components of host immunity mediating ONNV disease are poorly understood. Establishing a mouse model which recapitulates ONNV clinical symptoms is thus an essential step for the characterization of ONNV pathogenesis and the development of anti-viral therapeutic strategies.
