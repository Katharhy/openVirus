<p id="p0045">Among natural products, stilbenoids represent a class of non-flavonoid polyphenolic compounds largely studied in the last decades because of their many bioactivities. Stilbenoids are phytoalexins, secondary metabolites produced by the plant as means of defence against pathogens or stress factors [

 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>] and their presence in plants as both constitutive and inducible secondary metabolites suggest that these compounds may play an important role in the resistance to diseases [
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Stilbenoids can exist as both monomers and oligomers. Monomers such as resveratrol, pterostilbene, piceatannol and oxyresveratrol (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 1</xref> ), are characterized by the presence of two aromatic rings linked by an olefin, and the 
 <italic>trans</italic> isomer (
 <italic>E</italic>) is usually the most stable and the most common in nature. Besides the diverse number and different position of the hydroxy groups, the aromatic rings can bear prenyl, geranyl or farnesyl chains. Oligomers derive from the oxidative coupling of monomers. All the stilbenoids can be found as aglycones or as glycosylated forms [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The major dietary source of stilbenoids comes from grapes and wine from Vitaceae family (
 <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> L.) but they are also present in peanuts, cocoa, blueberry, bilberry, cowberry, red currant, cranberry, strawberries [
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Resveratrol has been largely studied in the last decades for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antidiabetic, antimicrobial activities [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Its antiviral activity has been also widely investigated and it has been exhaustively highlighted in the recent literature [
