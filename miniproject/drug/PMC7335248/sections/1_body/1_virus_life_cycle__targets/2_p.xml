<p id="p0060">Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, needing a host cell to exploit cellular biochemical pathways and factors to replicate. Their genome, single or double stranded DNA or RNA, encodes for various structural and regulatory proteins, and it is contained in the protein capsid, forming the nucleocapsid. Some viral species acquire a phospholipid-containing envelope from the host cell membrane during viral budding (

The viral life cycle begins when the virus binds to a host cell through electrostatic adsorption to specific host cell receptors (i.e. CXCR4 and CD4 on immune system cells), structurally complementary to exterior structures of the viral particle (i.e. the HIV envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41). After penetration into the host cell, viral uncoating and release of viral nucleic acids occur. Using host resources, virus starts transcription and synthesis of early viral proteins, like polymerase enzymes, followed by nucleic acids replication, and, in the case of retrovirus, the viral integrase (IN) incorporates viral nucleic acids into the host DNA. Eventually, also late viral proteins undergo transcription and translation, and their assembly leads to new viral particles, named “virions”, which can be released to infect other cells (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In the case of influenza virus, the viral enzyme neuraminidase (NA) is required to cleave residues on virions, allowing their release from the infected host cell. Antiviral agents block one of these steps, or may interfere with host cell functions, which facilitate viral replication [

Indeed, since viral genome encodes just for a few structural and regulatory proteins, viruses need to exploit host cell metabolism and biochemical signalling pathways to survive. In particular, NF-κB (nuclear factor- κB) pathway, regulating the expression of several proteins acting in the immune response, has been demonstrated to be an attractive target for viral pathogens because it is rapidly activated during infections and is involved in critical steps of the host cell cycle. Modulating the NF-κB pathway, viruses such as HIV, herpesviruses, and HCV, have been shown to block host cell apoptosis, thus prolonging the host cell survival and gaining time for viral replication and progeny production. Viruses such as HIV and HSV harbour NF-κB binding sites in their promoters, whose activation results in enhanced viral transcription. In these cases, molecules interfering with NF-κB pathway have been shown to have antiviral activity against both HIV-1 and HSV-1 [
