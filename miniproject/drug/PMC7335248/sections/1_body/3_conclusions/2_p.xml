<p id="p0240">Nowadays, huge efforts are required to face emerging and re-emerging viruses that constantly infect human population, threating global public health and economy. Viruses easily undergo mutations, leading to drug resistance and increasing the need of new antiviral compounds with new mechanisms of action. In this scenario, targeting viruses with compounds from natural sources represents a promising strategy. Stilbenoids are a class of natural products endowed with several biological activities. Stilbenoids are synthesized by plants as means of protection against pathogens, whereby the potential antiviral properties of this class of natural compounds have attracted interest in the last years. Resveratrol has received massive attention for its potential health benefits, including anticarcinogenesis, anti-aging, antimicrobial and also antiviral properties. In this review we focused on the studies concerning other natural stilbene monomers and oligomers, which in most cases demonstrated to be more active than resveratrol itself. Notably, many compounds were discovered to exploit new mechanisms of action, interacting directly with the virus or modulating different pathways involved in the immune response, which may overcome virus drug resistance. However, though many
