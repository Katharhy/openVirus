<p id="p0235">After the reported studies on the beneficial effects of Thai traditional plants for the treatment herpes simplex virus, Chuanasa et al. investigated the antiviral activity of oxyresveratrol (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), the major constituent of the heartwood of 
 <italic>Artocarpus lakoocha</italic> (Moraceae), and its mechanism of action. The activity was determined against HSV-1 (7401H and KOS) and HSV-2 (Baylor 186) on infected Vero cells, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 19.8 μg/mL, 24.0 μg/mL and 18.7 μg/mL, respectively. In particular, oxyresveratrol showed a better anti-HSV activity than ACV in the plaque reduction assay against thymidine kinase (TK)-deficient (ACV-resistant) strain. Indeed, ACV is a nucleoside analogue, which exerts its antiviral action after TK phosphorylation [

 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies the authors demonstrated that HSV-1-infected mice orally treated with oxyresveratrol (125 mg/kg/dose), showed a significant delay in herpetic skin lesions development, while the topical administration of 30% oxyresveratrol ointment five times per day significantly retarded skin lesions, preventing mice death. Therefore, oxyresveratrol may be a suitable anti-HSV agent in topical treatment [
