<p id="p0150">Pflieger et al. confirmed this observation in another study. In 2013, they isolated a collection of stilbenoids, consisting of monomers and oligomers (

 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>) from stalks of 
 <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> and from stem bark of 
 <italic>Millicia excelsa</italic>, and the compounds were tested on two different models of polynucleotidyl transferases, HIV-1 integrase (IN) and eukaryote MOS-1 transposase, for further modelling of new agents against IN Ref. [

Seven out of the 17 compounds resulted completely inactive, while pterostilbene, piceid, leachianol F and leachianol G exhibited a good inhibitory efficiency comparable to that of raltegravir, an anti-integrase compound. These data highlighted that glycosylation or methylation in resveratrol monomers increased the ability to inhibit HIV-1 integrase [
