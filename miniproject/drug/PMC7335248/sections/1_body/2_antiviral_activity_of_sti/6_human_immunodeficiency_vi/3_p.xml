<p id="p0145">Although resveratrol showed various antiviral activity for several viruses, it did not exhibit any inhibition against wild-type HIV-1 replication in activated T cells or in transformed T cell lines [
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. On the contrary, together with nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) such as tenofovir, didanosine and zidovudine, resveratrol seemed to improve the inhibition of cellular ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) [

 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), were tested for anti-HIV-1 activity on resting CD 4 T cells. Pterostilbene was active at all concentrations tested, piceid and isorhapontigenin inhibited productive infection at a concentration 30 μM, while piceatannol was less potent at the same concentrations [
