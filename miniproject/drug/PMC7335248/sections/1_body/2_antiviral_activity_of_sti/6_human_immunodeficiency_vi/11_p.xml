<p id="p0185">In 2015, Han et al. reported the anti-HIV-1 properties of a synthetic resveratrol analogue termed 3,3′,4,4′,5,5′-hexahydroxy-

 <xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15</xref>). The compound showed a dose-dependent inhibition of cytopathic effect (CPE) in MT-4 and TZM-bl cells, infected with HIV-1 NL 4–3 or BaL variants, with an EC

Indeed, firstly in TOA assays, M8 did not show any activity when added 2h after the infection, suggesting that M8 targets an early step in HIV-1 replication. Secondly, quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed a decrease level of early viral reverse transcription products in a dose-dependent manner. Lastly, in a post-attachment assay, authors demonstrated that compound M8 was able to block virus attachment to cells before the fusion step [
