<p id="p0105">MERS-CoV (Middle East Syndrome Coronavirus) is a viral pathogen causing respiratory illnesses, with a 34% mortality, firstly identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Up to date, there are still no effective anti-MERS drugs or vaccines approved on the market [
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies Lin et al. [
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] investigated the effect of resveratrol on MERS-CoV infection and showed that the cytotoxicity of MERS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells (CRL-1586) was reduced by resveratrol treatment (250 μM) to 25%. To determine where the resveratrol action occurred, they found that MERS-CoV RNA replication was suppressed and MERS titers were significantly reduced. Moreover, they showed that resveratrol significantly inhibited MERS nucleocapsid (N) protein translation, fundamental for MERS-CoV replication, in a dose dependent manner, in the concentrations ranging from 125 to 250 μM. Since MERS-CoV is well known to induce cell apoptosis [
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and high levels of cleaved Caspase 3 were reported after MERS-CoV infection as apoptosis indicator [
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], Lin et al. found that resveratrol decreased Caspase 3 cleavage dose-dependently, suggesting that resveratrol reduced the MERS-CoV mediated cells apoptosis [
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The exact mechanism needs further investigations, but it is known that resveratrol may reduce inflammation by interfering with the NF-κB (Nuclear Factor-Kappa B) pathway [
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and it could down-regulate fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) signalling [
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], involved in MERS-CoV-induced apoptosis [
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].
