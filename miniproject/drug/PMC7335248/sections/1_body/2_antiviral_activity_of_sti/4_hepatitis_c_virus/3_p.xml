<p id="p0115">The effect and the mechanism of action of resveratrol as anti-HCV agent was reported in the review by Abba et al. [

 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] studied the anti-HCV and antitumoral activities of the natural compound Z-3,5,4′-trimethoxystilbene (Z-TMS,

 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The compound was tested on hepatoma cell lines (GS5 and FCA4) expressing HCV-1b subgenomic replicons. Z-TMS was 100 times more potent than resveratrol in downregulating the levels of HCV NS5B polymerase in a dose-dependent manner, without displaying cytotoxicity to human hepatocytes 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> or in mice liver. The authors demonstrated that Z-TMS interfered with the cancer stem cell (CSC) marker DCLK1, microtubule dynamics and induced autophagy, G
