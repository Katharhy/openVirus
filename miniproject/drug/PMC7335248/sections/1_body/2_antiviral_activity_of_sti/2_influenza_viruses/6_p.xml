<p id="p0090">Li et al. evaluated a series of differently substituted resveratrol derivatives as NA inhibitors on the influenza virus strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) by a NA inhibition assay (Compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>4</bold>, 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> ). Thirty-five compounds were found to be active with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 4.95 to 186 μM [
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The active derivatives were used to develop 3D quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D QSAR) models and molecular docking in order to elucidate the molecular interaction with the target NA (X-ray structure taken from the RSCB Protein Data Bank, ID 1A4G). In the 3D QSAR studies, CoMFA (comparative molecular field analysis) and CoMSIA (comparative molecular similarity indices analysis) were applied. CoMSIA calculated the hydrophobic, H-bond donor and H-bond acceptor fields, in addition to the steric and electrostatic fields calculated also by CoMFA model. The results showed that the azo group replacing the olefin and the presence of –OH at the 
 <italic>para</italic>-position, capable of donating hydrogen bonds (
 <bold>2a</bold>), increased the inhibitory activity. Moreover, a –COOH group at the 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-position of the benzene ring (
 <bold>2b</bold>) seemed to be responsible for a strong hydrogen bond-reinforced ionic interaction with three residues (i.e. ARG115, TYR408, ARG373) present in the active site of NA. The results from QSAR studies were in good agreement with docking studies. The authors compared the binding mode of compound 
 <bold>2b</bold> with that of the NA inhibitor zanamavir (ZNM), which formed seven hydrogen bonds in the active site. Moreover, both ZNM and compound 
 <bold>2b</bold> formed hydrogen bonds with the residues GLU225, ASP128, and ARG373. To confirm the antiviral activity, the resulting active compounds were tested on A/PR/8/34 (H1N1)-infected MDCK cells. Compound 
 <bold>2b</bold> showed a good anti-influenza activity (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 7.28 ± 0.84 μg/mL, CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 μg/mL) in the pretreatment assay. This finding suggested that the derivatives may interact with NA, blocking the cleavage of the linkage between HA and sialic acid receptors on the host cells surface, whereby avoiding the virions release from infected cells [
