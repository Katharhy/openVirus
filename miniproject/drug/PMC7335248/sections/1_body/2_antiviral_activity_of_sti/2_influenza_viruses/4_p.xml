<p id="p0080">In 2010, five stilbenoids were isolated together with resveratrol from the lianas of 
 <italic>Gnetum pendulum</italic> (Gnetaceae) by Liu and colleagues and were evaluated by neuraminidase (NA) activity assay and CPE reduction assay [
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> ). In the NA activity assay, all the six molecules exhibited inhibitory effects on three influenza virus NAs [A/PR/8/34 (H1N1); A/Guangdong/243/72 (H3N2); B/Jiangsu/10/2003] with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 5.0 (Gnetupendin B for H1N1) to 26.3 μg/mL (Gnetin D for B/Jiangsu/10/2003). The drug oseltamivir acid, a NA inhibitor, was used as positive control. In the CPE reduction assay, the anti-influenza virus activities of the six NA inhibitors against influenza virus A/Guangdong/243/72 (H3N2) in MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells were also determined. Gnetupendin B (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6.17 μg/mL, SI = 32.40) and shegansu B (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 11.99 μg/mL, SI = 9.60) showed anti-influenza activities, even if with higher IC
 <sub>50</sub> than ribavirin and oseltamivir acid, used as positive controls for the antiviral activity. Notably, gnetin D (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.67 μg/mL, SI = 57.44) was the most active oligomer with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value eightfold lower than that of ribavirin (IC
 <sub>50=</sub>5.54 μg/mL). Notably, the methoxy group in isorhapontigenin (IC50 = 4.28 μg/mL, SI = 8.99, 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) increased the antiviral activity with respect to resveratrol (IC5
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 22.22, SI = not determined). The obtained results showed that the tested stilbenoids exerted antiviral effects inhibiting NA [
