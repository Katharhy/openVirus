<p id="p0070">Influenza viruses are responsible for acute respiratory infections in two billions of people, which may result in hundred thousands of deaths every year worldwide, according to WHO estimations [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Influenza viruses belong to the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family. There are four types of seasonal influenza viruses (A-D), but only type A and B are the main responsible for human infections and may cause seasonal epidemics. Influenza A virus is a single-stranded, segmented RNA virus that presents different subtypes based on haemagglutin (HA1-18) and neuraminidase (NA1-11) transmembrane glycoproteins [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The infection occurs when the viral HA binds to the host sialic acid receptors, which mediate the virus entry by endocytosis. The moderately acidic pH of the endosome triggers the fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes and opens up the viral M2 ion channel, leading to viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) release in the host cytoplasm and their transfer to the cell nucleus. After transcription and replication, mediated by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (vRdRp), the vRNPs enter the host cytoplasm to constitute new virions, which can be released to infect other cells when NA cleaves the sialic residues on the budding newly formed virions [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. To date, there are three main families of anti-influenza A virus drugs. The first family (adamantanes) inhibits the virus uncoating and subsequent release of viral RNA in the host cells, by blocking M2. The second class (neuraminidase inhibitors) targets NA preventing the release of viral particles from infected cells. Compounds targeting NA have aroused great interest because this glycoprotein plays a fundamental role in the movement of the virus to and from sites of infection in the respiratory tract [
