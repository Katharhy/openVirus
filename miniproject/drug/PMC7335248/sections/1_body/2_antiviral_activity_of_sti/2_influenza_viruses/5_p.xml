<p id="p0085">Influenza A may induce the inflammation of infected airway epithelial cells, which produce several chemotactic cytokines, in particular RANTES (Regulated upon Activation, Normal T Cells Expressed and Secreted), a potent chemoattractant for monocytes and macrophages [
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. RANTES belongs to CC chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), whose expression is affected by viral infections since its gene promoter regions contain recognition sites for many virus-activated transcription factors. Moreover, influenza A virus activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signal pathway, which is involved in CCL5 retinal expression in human pigment epithelial cells after viral infection [

 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In 2008, Huang et al. isolated five oligostilbenes from the roots of 
 <italic>Vitis thumbergii</italic> and evaluated their activity on influenza A virus (H1N1)-stimulated RANTES production in human alveolar epithelial cell line A549 [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Compounds (+)-ε-viniferin, (−)-viniferal, ampelopsin C, miyabenol A and (+)-vitisin A (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> ) exhibited significant inhibitory effects of RANTES production at noncytotoxic concentration (0.1–1.0 μM) with EC
 <sub>50</sub> (half maximal effective concentration) values lower than that of resveratrol (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). Notably, the tested tetramers and trimers resulted more active than dimers. In particular, (+)-vitisin A was the most active compound with EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.27 μM and low cytotoxicity (CC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 22.4 μM). Furthermore, the authors showed that influenza A (H1N1)-induced RANTES secretion was correlated with the activation of the PI3K/Akt and the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT1) signaling cascades in the A549 lung epithelial cells. Western blot analysis revealed that (+)-vitisin A reduced H1N1-induced Akt phosphorylation and subsequently STAT1 activation, suggesting a potential use of (+)-vitisin A in inflammatory disorders after virus infection [
