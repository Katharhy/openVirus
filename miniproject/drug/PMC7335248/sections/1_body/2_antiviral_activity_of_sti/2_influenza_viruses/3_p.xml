<p id="p0075">A certain number of natural stilbenoids have been studied for their potential activity against influenza virus. Ito et al. tested the oligostilbenoids reported in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> , together with other representative stilbenoid compounds isolated from some species of Dipterocarpaceaeous plants, against Influenza A virus (IAV) (A/NWS/33 strain, H1N1 subtype). Hopeaphenol and shoreaketone exhibited antiviral activity, while vaticanol B, vaticanol G and α-viniferin did not show any inhibitory action against IAV. The exact mechanism of action has not been elucidated yet. However, time-of-addition (TOA) assay showed no significant difference in the SI values for any of the tested compounds between addition to the medium at the same time of viral infection and addition immediately after viral infection, suggesting that the active compounds did non inhibit the early stages of viral replication (adsorption and penetration) [
