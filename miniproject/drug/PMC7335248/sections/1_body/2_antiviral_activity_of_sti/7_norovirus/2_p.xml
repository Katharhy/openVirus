<p id="p0190">Norovirus (NV) is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus within the family of 
 <italic>Caliciviridae</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], and human NV (HNV) is considered the major cause of epidemic acute gastroenteritis worldwide, leading to 685 million cases per year. To date, there are no vaccines or specific drugs in NV-infection treatment [
 <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. The noroviruses are subdivided into six different genotypes (GI-VI), and GI, II and GIV are responsible for human infections. Virions, consisting of an icosahedral nucleocapsid and RNA, enter the target cells and release their genomes, which bind to the cell ribosomes and proteins, and are transcribed by the viral RNA-polymerase [
