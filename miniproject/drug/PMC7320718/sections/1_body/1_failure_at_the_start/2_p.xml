<p>Tragically population solutions came late and inadequate, not because of people (actually public health front-line professionals fought hard the epidemic as their clinical colleagues did) but because of a health system without a powerful prevention pillar: in Italy as in most countries. The emergency population solution to relieve the hospital critical care services, swamped by patients inflow, has been to impose mass quarantine measures (‘lockdowns’) of variable stringency across countries. In areas where numbers of new cases and, consequently, patients in need of critical care have progressively dropped to one-digit to two-digit figures, a gradual lockdown relaxation is taking place (irresponsibly this is also implemented in places, particularly in the American continent, where the epidemic is still flaring

 </sup>). In many countries, particularly in Europe, the epidemic control rests at the time of writing (May 27) and for months ahead on interpersonal physical distancing and barrier measures, testing for virus presence to detect and isolate new cases and their traced contacts and extensive testing of selected groups at increased risk of being infected and of infecting, such as health professionals and nursing home or prison residents and staff.
