<p>The high likelihood of an epidemic disaster has been repeatedly emphasised in the last two decades, most recently in the 2019 WHO-World Bank document

 </sup> on global (un) preparedness for health emergencies: the fact that it has occurred as a surprise (including to epidemiologists mostly looking in other directions) cannot be understood other than as the product of a way of thinking in which anticipation and prevention are important options but not constant guiding principles of choice and action. Yet, the objective of whole population health, the ‘health for all’ message, can only be attained and maintained by applying the ‘prevention first’ principle to place in perspective, order, prioritise and organise the multitude of components of a health system and direct its inter-sectorial relations with other society activities relevant to health (typically education, work, housing, environment). The COVID-19 provides a negative and clear demonstration: once prevention has failed the whole population health is affected, not only the health of those hit by the disease. The excess mortality certified as due to COVID-19 has in fact been found accompanied by substantial excess mortality for non-COVID-19 causes, for reasons under investigation

 </sup> Over and above local variations, the failure to block the virus spread has been generalised across the world, with very few ‘felicitous’ exceptions like South Korea or Taiwan: short of becoming the forerunner of major health emergencies this calls for reconsidering and repositioning prevention at the core of health systems. This is a tall order as that core has been increasingly filled by PPPP medicine: which unfortunately stands less for ‘Predictive, Preventive, Personalised, Participative’ than for ‘Privatise and Push Productivity for Profit’. In the neo-liberal economic environment prevailing since the 1980s, public hospitals and other healthcare facilities, strained by public funding, have either delegated some tasks to the private sector or adopted management modes akin those of private enterprises, pushing productivity by increasing supply of services while containing costs, mainly for staff. This operating mode promotes competition and the short(er)-term over co-operation, integration and long(er)-term, basic to prevention strategies and practices. Changes are indispensable if prevention is to become central within the health system. Several factors play now in favour of this evolution.
