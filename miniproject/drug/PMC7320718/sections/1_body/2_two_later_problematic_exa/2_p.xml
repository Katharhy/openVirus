<p>Herd immunity is another example worth commenting. For the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the average number of secondary infected cases that an infected person generates (‘basic reproduction number’ or R0) in a population composed only of susceptible people has been estimated, for example, in Italy, at around 3.

 </sup> If part of the population becomes non-susceptible (immune), the virus has less opportunities for human-to-human transfers and when the proportion of immune persons in a population is roughly equal to (1−1/R0) the virus propagation stops.

 </sup> With a R0≈3, it means ≈66% of the population, a proportion reachable either by vaccination (not available) or by people getting the disease and becoming naturally infected. Letting the latter course to develop was the policy initially and openly envisaged by the UK government as the way out of the epidemic,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
 </sup> a policy soon abandoned in favour of containment measures (such as physical distancing) when the government was confronted with the projected number of COVID-19 deaths implied by this ‘natural experiment’. Yet, short of having reached the 60–70% figure, the epidemic is bound to reappear when all containment measures are removed: the key prevention issue becomes how to keep low the incidence rate of new cases, reaching at slow pace over maybe years, the 60–70% target by control measures socially acceptable over an extended time. Sceptics argue
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
 </sup> that attempting such a prolonged balance between the forces of the virus and the forces of socially sustainable control measures is doomed and ‘futile’, as the 60–70% must be reached anyway, and our task is ‘to concentrate on giving the unfortunate victims optimal care’: but it makes a big difference whether there are a lot of victims today or spread over a long period (even setting to zero the probability that time makes available a vaccine or new drugs). Hence, I regard as scientifically sound to acknowledge our ignorance about this new virus and to advance learning week after week, or, as Peter Piot said,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
 </sup> ‘learning while we are sailing’, from the individual and comparative experience of countries implementing the post-lockdown measures of control, aimed at keeping the rate of incidence at the lowest feasible level.
