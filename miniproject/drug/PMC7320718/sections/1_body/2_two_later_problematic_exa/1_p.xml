<p>Prevention is, however, often at bay even in post-lockdown time. Consider as an example the numerous models

 <sup>

 </sup> forecasting scenarios of the epidemic evolution under different control measures: they mostly use hard endpoints such as deaths or patients in critical care, expressing the heaviest disease load on the population. Often, however, saturation of critical care beds, obviously to be avoided, is suggested as key reference to assess whether the epidemic is under control. This misunderstands and misses the objective of preventive measures, to minimise the incidence of new cases, and misconstrues the pertinent alert criterion for triggering preventive action changes when the objective is insufficiently attained: a threshold number of new cases and/or clusters and not of occupied beds (as a counterexample the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin reports daily

 </sup> a series of summary statistics and indicators, focusing on the time trend of incident cases via the Rt statistic).
