<p>While the precise mechanism for susceptibility to secondary infections is poorly understood, it is likely that virus-mediated immunosuppression of the host innate immune enables opportunistic bacteria to colonize the host as it was shown for 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Most studies on host-pathogen interactions focus on a single-pathogen, one-host model although mammalian hosts are simultaneously exposed to multiple (opportunistic) pathogens (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The immune response to one pathogen may alter the immunity to other infectious agent(s), resulting in increased prevalence of viral-induced secondary bacterial infections (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Mammalian cells are more susceptible to bacterial attachment and colonization when infected by a virus (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>); infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus and influenza virus (all of which damage the mucosal layer), lead to bacterial adherence of 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, and biofilm formation on the linings of the airways (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).
