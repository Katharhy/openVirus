<p>Secondary infections can also be acquired from the patient's environment i.e., hospital-acquired or nosocomial infections. Nosocomial pathogens are often resistant to a wide range of antibiotics; a result of increased use of antibiotics and decades of over- and misuse resulting in selection for multi-drug resistant pathogens (MDR pathogens) (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) as many major pharmaceutical stakeholders have discontinued their search for new chemical antimicrobials (

 <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, Vancomycin-resistant 
 <italic>Enterococci</italic> (VRE), drug-resistant 
 <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>, Carbapenem-resistant 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> (CRE), Colistin-resistant 
 <italic>Klebsiella</italic>, Carbapenem-resistant 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and Carbapenem-resistant 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> (

In one COVID-19 cohort study, described in more detail below; almost 50% (10 of 21) patients developed secondary bacterial infections in the lung caused by 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, ultimately leading to their death, despite receiving prophylactic antibiotic therapy (
