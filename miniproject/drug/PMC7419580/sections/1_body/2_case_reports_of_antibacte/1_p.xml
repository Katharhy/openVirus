<p>Fifteen clinical reports, for which data for secondary infections were available, mainly from hospitals in China, were examined to provide information of the occurrence, treatment of or prophylactic measures for bacterial secondary infections during the course of COVID-19 infections (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">Supplementary File</xref>). A total of 3,133 COVID-19 patient cases were detailed in the 15 reports (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Prophylactic antibiotic therapy was given to 1,901 of the 2,983 patients (63.7%). We excluded one study (patient 
 <italic>n</italic> = 150), as they did not report details on the antibiotic therapy (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and 5/14 studies did not report the type of antibiotics used. The most commonly used antibiotics were moxifloxacin (
 <italic>n</italic> = 452, 39.2%) and azithromycin (
 <italic>n</italic> = 294, 30.7%). Others include ceftriaxone, vancomycin, cefepime, cephalosporins, quinolones, carbapenems, tigecycline, doxycycline, and cefoperazone. In total, 10 studies reported secondary bacterial infections, with 273 of the 997 patients (27.3%) being infected. Again, we excluded 5 studies (patients 
 <italic>n</italic> = 2,136), which did not report any information on any clinical complications other than caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The most common bacterial infections were caused by the Gram-positive pathogen 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> or by strains of the Gram-negative bacterium 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>. Five studies reported infections that were confirmed by tests in a microbiology laboratory, which identified MRSA, MSSA, 
 <italic>Serratia, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, E. coli, H. influenza</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. cloacae</italic> (patients 
 <italic>n</italic> = 16) (

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Three studies reported therapeutic antibiotic treatment in 92 of 146 patients (63%), which were administered as secondary bacterial infections were observed (

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Four studies reported complications with fatal outcome due to bacterial infections that included 41 of 268 patients (15.2%) (

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). An overview of the studies can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>, which also provides the information on percentages of antibiotic use and types of antibiotic compounds, among others.
