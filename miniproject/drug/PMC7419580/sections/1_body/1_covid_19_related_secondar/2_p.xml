<p>Early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection typically include symptoms of mild fever and shortness of breath (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). As the virus replicates in the respiratory tract, the symptoms worsen and once the virus reaches and begins infecting the alveoli, the host responds by generating inflammatory factors in alveolar tissues that may result in pneumonia. In almost all severe cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection results in pneumonia and the inflamed fluid-filled alveolar tissue now is an ideal habitat for bacterial growth for pathogens including 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The causative agent resulting in a severe disease progression may be bacteria, virus or fungi (
