<p>Influenza viruses are known to cause seasonal flu every year and of the four influenza types, type A and B are known to cause seasonal epidemics (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). The influenza A (H1N1) outbreak in 2009 had even developed into a global pandemic while causing seasonal flu epidemics each year. In spite of the availability of vaccines, the global death during the flu season was estimated to be between 0.25 and 0.5 million people according to the WHO (

 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic between 29 and 55% of mortalities were due to secondary bacterial infections (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). The lethal synergism between influenza virus and 
 <italic>Pneumococcus</italic> strains accounts for the majority of diseases as well as mortality during influenza epidemics (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">Supplementary File</xref>). Details on treatment and disease progression of a total of 910 patients that were infected with influenza were reported in eight case studies (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>–
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). Five studies reported the deployment of prophylactic antibiotic therapy in 718 of 743 patients (96.6%) (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>–
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). The most commonly used antibiotics were vancomycin (
 <italic>n</italic> = 317, 46.2%) and imipenem/meropenem (
 <italic>n</italic> = 243, 54.7%). Others were azithromycin, ceftriaxone, cephalosporin, piperacillin-tazobactam, linezolid, vancomycin plus cefepime, vancomycin plus meropenem, clarithromycin, levofloxacin and dicloxacillin. In total, 223 patients of 910 (24.5%) developed secondary bacterial infections. The infective agents were 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, MRSA, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa, S. viridians, S. hominis, Enterococci, H. influenza, S. pyogenes, S. mitis, S. agalactiae, Acinetobacter baumannii, E. coli, Chlamydophila pneumoniae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic>. To treat the infections, one of the studies reported the use of azithromycin, vancomycin, ceftriaxone and cephalosporin (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). In general, all eight case studies reported the treatment complications due to secondary bacterial infections.
