  <title>ACE2 as a part of the RAAS.</title>
  <p>Angiotensin II, the main effector molecule in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), is upregulated in many pathological conditions, for which inhibition of angiotensin II by RAAS inhibitors is a common therapeutic strategy.Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) produces angiotensin II from angiotensin I, whereas ACE2 inactivates angiotensin II by converting it to angiotensin (1–7). Therefore, ACE2 has a protective effect against cardiovascular disease and lung injury. In the setting of coronavirus disease 2019, downregulation of ACE2 by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection might be involved in mediating cardiovascular damage. ARB, angiotensin II receptor blocker.</p>
