<p id="Par56">Given that numerous studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 shares many biological features with SARS-CoV, our knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying SARS can be used to understand the disease processes involved in COVID-19. Mechanistically, the interaction between the S protein and ACE2 is likely to have a central role in disease pathogenesis, especially in cardiovascular manifestations of this disease, and this interaction is a potential target for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.</p>
