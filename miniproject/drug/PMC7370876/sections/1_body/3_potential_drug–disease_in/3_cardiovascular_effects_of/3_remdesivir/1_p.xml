 </sup>. Remdesivir was originally developed for the treatment of Ebola virus disease. Prophylactic and therapeutic administration of remdesivir has been shown to improve pulmonary function and to decrease viral load in a mouse model of MERS

 </sup>. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 237 patients with COVID-19 in China, remdesivir was associated with a numerically (but not statistically significant) faster time to clinical improvement than was the placebo

 </sup>. Preliminary results from a double-blind, randomized, multicentre, placebo-controlled trial involving 1,063 patients with COVID-19 indicate that those who received remdesivir had a 31% faster time to recovery than those who received placebo (median time to recovery 11 days versus 15 days)

 </sup>. Of note, in light of these preliminary findings, the FDA granted emergency use of remdesivir for COVID-19 in May 2020 to meet the urgent demand for treatment of hospitalized patients

 </sup>. The optimal dosing and duration of treatment is still under investigation. Under the emergency use authorization, a 10-day treatment regimen (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg per day for 9 days) is suggested for patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and a 5-day treatment course is suggested for patients with milder symptoms. Although prominent cardiovascular adverse effects associated with remdesivir have not been reported so far, these might become apparent with more widespread use
