<p id="Par10">COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is a member of the genus 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> like the two other coronaviruses that have caused pandemic diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV))

 </sup>. As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes a respiratory infection, which leads to viral pneumonia and 
 <xref rid="Glos1" ref-type="list">acute respiratory distress syndrome</xref> (ARDS) in some patients
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup>. However, in addition to respiratory symptoms, uncontrolled SARS-CoV-2 infection can trigger a 
 <xref rid="Glos2" ref-type="list">cytokine storm</xref>, whereby pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as tumour necrosis factor-α, IL-1β and IL-6 are overproduced by the immune system, resulting in multiorgan damage

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>. Furthermore, COVID-19 causes coagulation abnormalities in a substantial proportion of patients, which can lead to thromboembolic events

 </sup> of SARS-CoV-2 have been studied intensively since its emergence. To date, research shows that SARS-CoV-2 shares many biological features with SARS-CoV owing to 79.6% genomic sequence identity

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>. In particular, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the same system of cell entry, which is triggered by binding of the viral spike (S) protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the surface of the host cell
