<p id="Par12">The fast-moving nature of this research field necessitates the integration of available biological data with clinical findings of COVID-19 to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and to contribute to the development of potential therapies. In this Review, we summarize our current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 from a biological viewpoint, with an emphasis on the interaction between the viral S protein and human ACE2. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the clinical findings related to the effects of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system. Finally, we discuss the possible link between common cardiovascular drugs and susceptibility to COVID-19 and the potential cardiovascular effects of drugs used to treat COVID-19.</p>
