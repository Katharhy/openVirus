<p id="Par39">These findings suggest that recipients of heart transplantation are at high risk of severe complications from COVID-19. Whether organ transplantation recipients are more susceptible to COVID-19 and whether immunosuppressive treatments have harmful (or protective) effects on disease progression needs to be assessed in large-scale studies. Another important point regarding heart transplantation is the need to screen for COVID-19. Given that individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection might be asymptomatic, routine screening of donor tissues is necessary during the pandemic. Screening of recipients before transplantation will also be required to avoid worsening of subclinical infection after starting immunosuppression.</p>
