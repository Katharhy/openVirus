 </sup>. This high risk of poor outcomes might be attributable to suppressed immunity by chemotherapy, the presence of cardiovascular risk factors (such as hypertension and diabetes), cardiotoxicity of cancer treatment and/or cardiovascular damage by COVID-19, combined with their impaired baseline condition

 </sup>. Therefore, a major consideration in the delivery of care to these patients during the pandemic is to balance the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection with the need to provide timely cancer treatment. Clinicians need to determine the optimal timing of treatment in patients with cancer and cardiovascular comorbidities, especially if they are infected with or exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Routine COVID-19 screening might be necessary before cancer treatment to avoid worsening of a subclinical infection.
