<p id="Par32">Arrhythmias and sudden cardiac arrest are common manifestations of COVID-19. Heart palpitations have been reported to be the main presenting symptom of COVID-19 in patients without a fever or cough

 </sup>). However, the exact contribution of COVID-19 to cardiac arrhythmias remains uncertain given that arrhythmias, such as atrial and ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, can be triggered by myocardial injury or other systemic causes such as fever, sepsis, hypoxia and electrolyte abnormalities
