<p id="Par23">Whether typical clinical features of myocarditis were present in patients who had elevated levels of cardiac troponins during the course of COVID-19 is unclear because most of the early studies did not include echocardiography or MRI data

 </sup>. In a cohort study involving 112 patients with COVID-19, the 14 patients with myocardial injury who had elevated high-sensitivity levels of cardiac troponin I (&gt;0.12 ng/ml) plus abnormalities on echocardiography and/or electrocardiogram did not have typical signs of myocarditis such as segmental wall motion abnormality or reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF), suggesting that myocardial injury was secondary to systemic causes rather than a result of direct viral infection of the heart

 </sup>. By contrast, several case reports have described typical signs of myocarditis in patients with COVID-19. A woman aged 53 years with myocardial injury, as evidenced by elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers and diffuse ST segment elevation on the electrocardiogram, had diffuse biventricular hypokinesis on cardiac MRI, especially in the apical segments, in addition to severe LV dysfunction (LVEF = 35%)

 </sup>. MRI data also revealed marked biventricular interstitial oedema, diffuse late gadolinium enhancement and circumferential pericardial effusion, features that are consistent with acute myocarditis. Furthermore, in a man aged 37 years with chest pain and ST segment elevation, echocardiography revealed an enlarged heart (LV diastolic dimension = 58 mm) and LV dysfunction (LVEF = 27%)

 </sup>. This patient was diagnosed with COVID-19-induced fulminant myocarditis and treated with methylprednisolone. Cardiac size and function recovered to normal after 1 week (LV diastolic dimension = 42 mm, LVEF = 66%).
