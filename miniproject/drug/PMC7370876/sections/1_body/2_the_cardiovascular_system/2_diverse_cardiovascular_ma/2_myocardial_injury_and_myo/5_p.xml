<p id="Par26">Taken together, these findings suggest that myocardial injury is not only a common manifestation of COVID-19, but also a risk factor for poor prognosis. At present, we do not understand the mechanisms underlying COVID-19-related myocardial injury. However, on the basis of the available clinical evidence, myocardial injury seems to be largely attributable to advanced systemic inflammation. SARS-CoV-2 might also infect the myocardium directly, resulting in viral myocarditis in a small proportion of patients with COVID-19.</p>
