<p id="Par36">A retrospective study in New York showed that systemic anticoagulation was associated with prolonged survival in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (ref.

 </sup>). Among 2,773 patients, 786 (28%) received systemic anticoagulation. The median survival time of patients who were treated with anticoagulation was longer than in those who were not treated (21 days versus 14 days), although overall mortality between the two groups remained similar (22.5% versus 22.8%)

 </sup>. Importantly, findings from these retrospective studies are limited by potential selection bias, the presence of confounding factors and the undefined indication of anticoagulation treatment. In addition, the optimal anticoagulation agent to prevent thromboembolic events in these patients is not known (for example, low-molecular-weight heparin, unfractionated heparin, direct oral anticoagulants or others). Prospective, randomized trials are needed to validate the protective effect of anticoagulation therapy in patients with COVID-19.
