 <sc>d</sc>-dimer, modestly reduced platelet counts and slightly prolonged prothrombin time. In an early study of 1,099 patients with COVID-19 from China, elevated levels of 
 <sc>d</sc>-dimer (&gt;0.5 mg/l) were observed in 46% of all patients (60% of those with severe illness)

 </sup>. Similarly, another study in patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan showed that 
 <sc>d</sc>-dimer levels were elevated (&gt;1 mg/l) in 42% of all patients (81% of those who died), which, if detected at admission to hospital, was associated with an 18-fold increased risk of death

 </sup>. By contrast, the changes in platelet counts and prothrombin time were modest. Among 41 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, only 5% had a low platelet count (&lt;100 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> cells per litre) and the prolongation of prothrombin time was mild even in patients admitted to the ICU (11.1 s versus 12.2 s)

 </sup>. These findings show that a substantial proportion of patients with COVID-19 have coagulation abnormalities that typically do not meet the criteria of disseminated intravascular coagulation established by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis
