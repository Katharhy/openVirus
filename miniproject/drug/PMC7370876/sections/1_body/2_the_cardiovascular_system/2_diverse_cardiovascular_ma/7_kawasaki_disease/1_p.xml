 </sup>. A case series from the UK reported an unprecedented cluster of eight children (aged 4â€“14 years) presenting with a hyperinflammatory syndrome with features of Kawasaki disease, five of whom tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or were potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2 from family members

 </sup>. Clinical presentations included fever, variable rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral oedema, extremity pain and severe gastrointestinal symptoms. A common finding on echocardiography was echo-bright coronary vessels, which progressed to a giant coronary aneurysm in one patient. Furthermore, researchers in Bergamo, Italy, found a 30-fold increase in the incidence of Kawasaki-like disease among children during the peak of the pandemic

 </sup>. These paediatric patients were older and had a higher rate of cardiac involvement than patients diagnosed with Kawasaki disease before the pandemic. Together, these early clinical findings are suggestive of a new phenomenon caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in children that can lead to a hyperinflammatory syndrome with features that are similar to those of Kawasaki disease, including coronary artery abnormalities.
