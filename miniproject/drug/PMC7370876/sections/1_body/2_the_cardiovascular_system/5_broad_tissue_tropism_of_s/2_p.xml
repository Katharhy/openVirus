<p id="Par46">In an autopsy case series involving 12 patients with COVID-19, in which SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by quantitative reverse transcription PCR in the lungs at high concentrations in all patients, 5 patients also had high viral RNA titres in the heart, liver or kidney

 </sup>), indicating a broad organotropism of SARS-CoV-2. Although the specific cell types infected by SARS-CoV-2 in each organ are unknown, these preliminary data support the possibility that the extrapulmonary manifestations and multiorgan failure observed in patients who died with COVID-19 are not just a consequence of systemic inflammation or cytokine storm, but might also be caused by direct infection of numerous organ systems by SARS-CoV-2. Mechanistically, the broad tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2 might be a result of the instability of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 related to the presence of the novel furin cleavage site, as mentioned above
