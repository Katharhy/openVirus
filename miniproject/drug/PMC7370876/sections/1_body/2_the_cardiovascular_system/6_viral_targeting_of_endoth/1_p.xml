<p id="Par47">Preliminary histological data from a case series of three patients with COVID-19 have shown that endothelial cells might be a direct target of SARS-CoV-2 infection
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>
 </sup>. In a patient with a history of renal transplantation who died from COVID-19-induced multiorgan failure, viral particles were detected by electron microscopy in endothelial cells in the kidney
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>
 </sup>. A prominent endotheliitis (inflammation within the endothelium) with recruitment of inflammatory cells was identified on histological assessment, as well as an unusually high concentration of apoptotic bodies in numerous organs including the lungs, small bowel and heart
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>
 </sup>. In another patient who died from COVID-19-related multiorgan failure and ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, lymphocytic endotheliitis was observed in the lungs, heart, liver and kidneys
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>
 </sup>. In the third patient who had mesenteric ischaemia and underwent resection of the small intestine, histological assessment of the small intestine revealed prominent endotheliitis of the submucosal vessels in addition to a large concentration of apoptotic bodies
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>
 </sup>. Findings from this case series suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can infect endothelial cells directly, which can lead to inflammation in the endothelium
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>
 </sup>. Given that endothelial cells are an important component of every organ and have a high level of 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> expression, inflammation in the endothelium caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 might underlie the diverse clinical manifestations of COVID-19.
