<p id="Par41">The mechanisms underlying the development of COVID-19-related cardiovascular injury are not known. ACE2 expression is thought to be one of the major factors involved in the biological mechanism underlying tissue-specific infection. As with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 infection is triggered by binding of viral S protein to human ACE2, whereas TMPRSS2 induces S protein priming

 </sup>. The interaction between S protein and ACE2 has gained much research interest given that ACE2 is known to have crucial roles in both the cardiovascular system and the immune system

 </sup>). However, both cell types have a high expression of cathepsin B and cathepsin L, which facilitate S protein priming and might promote entry of the virus into the cell via the endocytic pathway. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 might be capable of directly infecting multiple cardiovascular cell types, including cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and pericytes. Importantly, however, expression of ACE2 is not in itself sufficient for entry of the virus into a cell, and the efficiency of viral replication and release might also have a role in host cell infection. To date, clinical evidence of direct viral infection of cardiomyocytes has not been found. Given that myocarditis related to SARS-CoV-2 infection is rare
