<p id="Par18">Infection with either SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 involves binding of the viral S protein to ACE2 on the surface of the host cell. The receptor-binding domain on the surface subunit S1 of the S protein is responsible for attachment of the virus to ACE2. After binding, the S protein is cleaved at the S1/2 and S2′ regions (in a process known as S protein priming) by the transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2, which in turn facilitates the fusion of the viral membrane with the membrane of the host cell and direct entry of the virus into the cytoplasm

 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Respiratory tract epithelial cells express both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 on their surface, and this direct or ‘early’ entry pathway seems to be the predominant mode of in vivo entry by SARS-CoV and, probably, SARS-CoV-2 into the respiratory tissue

 </sup>. Alternatively, SARS-CoV-2 can also use an endosomal entry pathway, whereby the ACE2–virus complex is translocated to endosomes and S protein priming is performed by the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and cathepsin L, after which the virus is released from the endosome into the cytoplasm. This endosomal entry pathway, which can be blocked by either

 </sup>, but the importance of this pathway for infection in vivo remains unclear. After the release of the viral genomic RNA into the cytoplasm, the first ORF is translated into polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which are then cleaved by viral proteases into small non-structural proteins such as RdRP. The viral genomic RNA is then replicated using viral RdRP, and the four structural proteins (S, E, M and N) are translated through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex of the host cell. Finally, the genomic RNA and structural proteins are assembled into new viral particles, leading to their release through exocytosis

Each step of the viral life cycle described here is a potential therapeutic target, including S protein priming by TMPRSS2 (a target of the serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate), membrane fusion and endocytosis (a target of the antimalarial drug chloroquine and anti-influenza drug umifenovir) and RNA replication by RdRP (a target of the antiviral agents favipiravir, remdesivir and ribavirin)
