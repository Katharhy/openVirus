    "This Opinion Paper wishes to provide a summary of recent findings and solutions for a better understanding of the environmental and health problems associated with COVID-19. The list of topics covered is large: meteorology and air quality factors with correlation number of infections, sewage waters as a way to reveal the scale of COVID-19 outbreak, current hospital disinfection procedures and new eco-friendly technologies and list of drug therapies recommend waiting for the desired vaccine to come. During the last two months we did notice an increase in the scientific literature regarding COVID-19 with a partial vision of this problem. The current Opinion Paper is one of the first attempts, to my understanding, to summarize and integrate environmental and human health aspects related to the monitoring, fate and treatment solutions for COVID-19. That being said I believe that this Opinion Paper can serve as multipurpose document, not only for scientists of different disciplines but for social media and citizens in general."
