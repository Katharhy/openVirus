<p id="par0060">Another relevant paper reported how much reduction of virus is needed for recycled waste water recommending an additional 2- to 3-log reduction of viruses above current recommendations to ensure safe recycled water [
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The last paper selected concerning the presence of viruses in wastewaters is also about the survival of two surrogate coronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis in water [
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The authors did find out that these viruses remained infectious in water and sewage for days to weeks. At 25 _C, time required for 99 % reduction in reagent-grade water was 22 days for TGEV. At present we do not know if the same is applicable to COVID-19 and for how long it can remain in water. What we know from recent studies is that fecal transmission routes should be considered, as the COVID-19 virus has been positively detected in stool samples of infected patients. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV can survival in stool samples for 4 days [
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] or even up 22 days, much longer than in respiratory (18 days) and serum samples (16 days) collected from patients of Zheijiang province hospital [
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In short, infected stools in wastewater can generate further transmission routes through aerosols formation during wastewater treatment.
