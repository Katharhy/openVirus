<p id="par0065">Hospitals are key element to treat and recover patients infected with COVID-19. Disinfection techniques most appropriate for the rooms, personnel and medical equipment are required. An interesting study performed on indoor air quality at the largest hospital in Iran [
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The air of patient rooms with confirmed COVID-19 was investigated last March 2020. Viral RNA was extracted and analyzed by PCR (RT-PCR). Fortunately, in this study all air samples which were collected 2–5 m from the patients’ beds with confirmed COVID-19 were negative. The indoor air was not contaminated with the virus causing COVID-19. The authors suggested as well to perform 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments using actual patient cough, sneeze and breath aerosols in order to show the possibility of generation of the airborne size carrier aerosols and the viability fraction of the embedded virus in those carrier aerosols. Disinfection technologies at hospitals are certainly a key issue to avoid the large number of medical doctors and front-line healthcare workers (HCW)that is being continuously infected by COVID-19. Neil Rowan [

This is needed too because of the shortage in supply chain of critical one-time-use personal and protective equipment (PPE). PPE are heat sensitive and are not, by their manufacturer’s design, intended for reprocessing. Most conventional sterilization technologies used in hospitals, or in terminal medical device sterilization providers, cannot effectively reprocess PPE due to the nature and severity of sterilization modalities. Eco-friendly technologies are being recommend and used in Ireland, namely vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), such as for filtering face piece respirators and UV irradiation. To be added that UV irradiation was already recommend for other disinfection applications including toilet flushing [
