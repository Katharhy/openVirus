 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. After two weeks of lockdown, urban air pollution markedly decreased but with substantial differences among pollutants. The most significant reduction was estimated for Black Carbon and NO
 <sub>2</sub> (-45 to -51 %), pollutants mainly related to traffic emissions. A lower reduction was observed for PM10 (-28 to -31.0 %). By contrast, O
 <sub>3</sub> levels increased (+33 to +57 % of the 8 h daily maxima), probably due to lower titration of O
 <sub>3</sub> by NO and the decrease of NOx in a VOC-limited environment. In the same direction correlation between NO
 <sub>2</sub> levels with COVID-19 outbreak analysis has been conducted on a regional scale and combined with the number of death cases taken from 66 administrative regions in Italy, Spain, France and Germany [
