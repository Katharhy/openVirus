Summarizing the results indicates that more pollen in the air might make more difficult for flu-like virus to survive outside the host, acting the pollen as firewall. Pollen in the atmosphere increases general immune-responses and are a casual factor reducing the spread of flu-like viruses. To that end, the authors indicate that there is a possibility that COVID-19 will be seasonal “going away” in May.
