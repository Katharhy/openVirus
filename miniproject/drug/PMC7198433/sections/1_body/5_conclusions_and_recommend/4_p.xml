<p id="par0095">That being said, COVID-19 will stay with us for quite some time. Now we know much more than few months ago but still we need to do more to solve this global threat. Future measures should include more comprehensive surveillance of the environment through air and water, in addition to the availability of rapid ELISA/biosensors/Paper-based tests for screening the general population and the sewage against COVID-19. Paper-based devices would be certainly one of the best measurement solutions for the rapid and on-site detection of COVID-19 in sewage waters and humans as well. I am aware that different research groups are already working on this direction being a perfect example the recent paper on the development of optomechanical spectrometry detection showed a promising solution towards the fast detection of label-free diagnosis of infectious diseases [

In addition to the development of new detection methods, theoretical computational analysis has been recently reported as a way to identify active coronavirus infections locally and globally using WBE. It was applied to the COVID-19 virus monitoring in Tempe, AZ, US as case study. Assumptions made for modeling did consider daily excretion rates in human stool samples between 100âˆ’400 g of feces/person [
