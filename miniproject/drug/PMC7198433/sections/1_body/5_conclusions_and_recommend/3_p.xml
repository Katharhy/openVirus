<p id="par0090">In untreated wastewater we already know that SARS-Cov-2 is present, maybe even for several weeks. Gastrointestinal symptoms caused bySARS-CoV-2 infections as well as its presence in feces of COVID-19 patients and in wastewater was already shown. Still one of the major challenges in SARSCoV-2 detection/quantification in wastewater samples is the lack of an optimized and standardized protocol. WBE can help solving the pressing problem of insufficient diagnostic testing and it will provide a cheap and early warning method for COVID-19 outbreak. To make things crystal clear WBE will be complementary and not an alternative to the compulsory PCR detection of COVID-19 in humans. Papers reported up till now on other types of viruses indicate that different viruses remained infectious in water and sewage for 3–7 days to 2–3 weeks. Special attention needs to be paid to the aerosol formation during wastewater treatment. The key question would be to know for how long COVID-19 will survive in sewage remains open.</p>
