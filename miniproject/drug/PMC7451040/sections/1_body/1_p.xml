<p>We need now to take a step back and examine the logic underlying the use of our limited suite of COVID-19 countermeasures. In particular, to avoid media-led confusion, we should respect the boundaries between illness, objectively verified disease and laboratory-confirmed infection. We are now relying on nucleic acid amplification tests to confirm recent infection with exquisite sensitivity, while hoping that primer and probe-binding viral sequences do not mutate beyond recognition. This level of technical sensitivity may suit the demands of public health agencies grappling with disease control, but diagnostic specificity across the varied range of COVID-19 presentations, and different stages in their clinical evolution, is less clear. As a result, we are in the invidious position of having to chase a moving viral target in a rapidly escalating pandemic without the full set of test performance, clinical and epidemiological data that we normally rely on. And with our eyes on a single diagnostic target, there is a fair chance we may miss other treatable infectious diseases in plain sight. Hence, in addition to the nucleic acid detection assays, there is also great interest in the development and assessment of serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 to assess previous infection and possible immunity and for seroincidence surveys. Those involved with existing microbiological testing will appreciate that the characteristics of analytical and clinical sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative predictive values and correlates of protection will be challenging to determine.</p>
