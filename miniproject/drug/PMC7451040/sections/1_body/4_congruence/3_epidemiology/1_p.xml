<p>Given the wealth of epidemiological data emerging from multiple sources, a group at the Harvard Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics identified key unanswered questions [

 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref>]. Another key measure is the serial interval between consecutive cases, estimated as just under 5 days [
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The other measure of transmission closely watched is the reproduction number; the number of secondary cases arising after transmission from an index case. In the early stages of the pandemic this was estimated at 2.9 [
