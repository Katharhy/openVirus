<p>We are seeing measures against COVID-19 that hark back to the 1918–19 influenza pandemic and the great plague outbreaks. When armed troops are deployed on our streets, public health staff in protective suits and respirators spray the streets with disinfectant, and public meetings of more than two people are cancelled, the normal rhythms of life have been disturbed. As clinician–scientists, it is our responsibility to tackle the challenge with the skills and insights we know best, to obtain an accurate measure of the threat and shape an effective, data-driven response and to educate our colleagues accordingly. Before we resort to superstition-driven 14th century concepts of disease control, let us take a hard look at the data, mine them with the best machine learning tools at hand, and make pragmatic decisions about how COVID-19’s remorseless progress can be disrupted within existing resources.</p>
