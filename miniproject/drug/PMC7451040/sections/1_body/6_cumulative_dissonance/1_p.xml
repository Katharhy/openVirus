<p>The insights that connect the different levels of biological organization from the molecular level to organ systems, people and their communities are scarce as yet. They do not permit detailed understanding of how and why an initial encounter with SARS-CoV-2 produces its typical clinico-pathological effects. The processes that underlie escalation through multiple layers of increasing complexity remain opaque at this point, but glimpses of the molecular mechanisms of cell penetration and damage are beginning to emerge. There is a structural basis for cellular recognition of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], a potentially blockable cell entry pathway [
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and a mouse model of coronavirus infection that may be a small step towards establishing causality [
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. From what is already known about the severity stratification of COVID-19, it is possible to infer a clinico-pathological progression to more extensive cell, tissue and organ damage in a diminishing proportion of patients, but we are a long way short of a mechanistic construct of the process.
