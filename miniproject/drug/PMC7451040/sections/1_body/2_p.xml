<p>Emerging infectious diseases, by their very nature, pose new challenges to the diagnostic–treatment–control nexus, and push our concepts of causality to the limit. The conventional Koch–Henle approach to aetiology offers little help here. Instead, we need to use more contemporary methods of assessing causality to make sense of its inherent complexity [
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], so that clinical, laboratory and public health measures can draw on a rational, evidence-based approach to argumentation. There are enough data at this stage in the COVID-19 epidemic to start populating a cohesive cause and effect narrative: congruence (convergence of molecular biology, clinical features and epidemiology), consistency (reproducible features of this nexus, and its temporal–spatial clustering), cumulative dissonance (upscaling through multiple levels of biological organization) and curtailment (diagnosis, containment, control and preventive interventions). A formal review of the argument for causality goes much further than attribution of a pathogenic role for a named microbe. The original purpose of the priobe hypothesis was, and remains, the derivation of actionable insights into emerging infectious diseases. As the COVID-19 pandemic is the latest substantial emerging infectious disease challenge, the priobe hypothesis provides a prism through which to view this novel disease and its causal agent and to determine priorities for evidence-based action. This short review serves as an introduction to a conversation between medical microbiologists and their colleagues, to be supported by a moderated blog that will be updated with new insights as they appear in the scientific literature.
