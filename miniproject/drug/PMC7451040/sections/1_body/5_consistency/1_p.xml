<p>A report on the first case cluster of novel coronavirus infection implicated a seafood market in Wuhan, PR China [
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Subsequent spread out of Wuhan province was then associated with propagation of epidemic SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In other parts of China, a similar disease spectrum emerged, with a notable reduction in the estimated mortality rate [
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Once outside China, COVID-19 spread was rapid, leading to new national epidemics in distant locations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) European region [
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A consistent clinical picture emerged in which more severe infections affect older patients with cough, expectoration, chest pain, dyspnoea and a higher computed tomography (CT) score [
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Indeed, CT appearance appears to correlate with SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay results [
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We can expect further reports of the common features of COVID-19 case clusters, national outbreaks and their corresponding laboratory investigations in weeks to come.
