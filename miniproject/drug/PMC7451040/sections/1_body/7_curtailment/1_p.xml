<p>The logical conclusion of any analysis of an emerging infectious disease is actionable insights; a set of diagnostic, treatment, control, containment and preventive measures. At present, the available measures are principally containment and control by physical distancing and improved hygiene. Their efficacy has been the subject of intense debate in view of the disruption they caused in the main centres of infection, but evidence has been presented to justify the control measures taken in China [

 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Meanwhile, patients at the severe and critical end of the COVID-19 spectrum are being treated on a compassionate, experimental basis with the antiretrovial drugs lopinavir/ritonavir [
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4, 23</xref>]. An expert consensus from the epicentre of the original COVID-19 outbreak has recommended the use of chloroquine for treatment of mild, moderate and severe pneumonia during the current outbreak [
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. As these findings have been rebutted by other groups, there is obviously a need for careful assessment [
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Clearly, it will take too long to develop novel pharmaceutical products targeted at SARS-CoV-2, but repurposing existing products that are widely available is eminently feasible if clinical benefit can be demonstrated in suitable trials. Finally, work has commenced on vaccine development [
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Whilst welcome, these initiatives will likely take too long to be useful in the short term, but may have a use in the prevention of future epidemics, or in targeted prevention among highly vulnerable populations.
