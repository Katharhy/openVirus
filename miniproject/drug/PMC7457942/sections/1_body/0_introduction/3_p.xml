<p id="p0030">Recently, the ocean has arisen great attention from scholars and practitioners, as many marine derived secondary metabolites with evidently anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antimicrobial, antiviral, antimalarial, and antioxidant activities have been discovered [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. According to the MarinLit database, annually more than 1200 novel natural products were reported from a variety of marine sources, such as algae, corals, sponges, and especially microorganisms [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, these antivirus natural compounds even have entered the advanced stages of clinical trials, several of which are commercially available. For example, vidarabine is currently used for the treatment of HSV infection, whose lead structure, spongouridine, was originally isolated from the marine sponge [

 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. There are about 1 million microorganisms in 1Â mL of seawater, including some cyanobacteria, actinomyces, bacteria, and fungi, which have great potential in the pharmaceutical research [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In addition, some of marine microorganisms rely on the symbiosis with marine animals and plants to acquire nutrition, but due to fierce competition, they have metabolized some specific molecules to obtain extremely limited resources [
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These secondary metabolites can chemically be divided into alkaloids, peptides, polyketides, terpenoids, etc, which contained diverse biological functions such as antibacterial, antiviral and antitumor activities. Excitingly, cyanobacterial-derived cyanovirin N has been utilized as anti-HIV compound in preclinical development [
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, only limited natural compounds discovered from marine microbes have been used in clinical research, reflecting the lack of understanding and development of marine microbial resources [
