 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) were separated from the extract of marine-derived 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. FXJ7.328 collected from coastal sediment at Huanghai beach [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Compound 
 <bold>9</bold> showed anti-H
 <sub>1</sub>N
 <sub>1</sub> virus with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 41.5 ± 4.5 μM. In addition, compound 
 <bold>10</bold> and 
 <bold>11</bold> showed potent activity against influenza A (H
 <sub>1</sub>N

 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The strain identified as 
 <italic>Aspergillus terreus</italic> Gwq-48, which was isolated from a mangrove rhizosphere soil sample collected in the coast of Fujian province resulted in the discovery of a new butenolide isoaspulvinone E (

 <bold>14</bold>, 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These compounds displayed significant inhibitory activities against H

 <sub>1</sub> virus, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 32.3, 56.9, and 29.1 μg/mL, respectively (ribavirin as a positive control, IC

 <sub>50</sub> = 28.4 μg/mL) [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In addition, only compound 
 <bold>13</bold> showed effective inhibition against H
 <sub>1</sub>N
 <sub>1</sub> viral neuraminidase (NA), and docking of two isomers (
