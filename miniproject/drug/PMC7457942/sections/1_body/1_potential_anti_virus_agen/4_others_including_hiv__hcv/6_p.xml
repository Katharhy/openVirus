<p id="p0105">Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-tansmitted Alphavirus that has been spreading rapidly, causing more than one million people infected. Although over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs can alleviate the symptoms, currently, there is no therapy to cure this disease [

 <bold>78</bold> may represent a new class of antiviral drugs, and further studies of essential pharmacophores probably produce modified leads with improved pharmacological properties [
