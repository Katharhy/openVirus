<p id="p0065">HSV-1 is regularly correlative to oral-facial infections and encephalitis, whereas HSV-2 frequently causes genital ulcers worldwide [
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Herpes virus has a unique incubation period and physiological reactivation characteristics [
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The chronic incubation period makes the host susceptible to repeated attacks by virus activation and increases the possibility of virus transmission [
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. At present, clinically effective anti-herpes virus drugs such as acyclovir, valacyclovir and other nucleoside analogues are mainly used as nucleoside inhibitors of DNA polymerase [
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, due to antiherpetic drugs resistance and lack of validated vaccines for effective prevention, it is urgent to develop novel medicines against HSV virus [
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. A strain of marine-derived 
 <italic>Streptomyces koyangensis</italic> SCSIO 5802, which was isolated from the South China Sea at a depth of 3536 m, resulted in the discovery of a novel butenolide derivative, (4

 <bold>39</bold>, 
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> ) featuring octyl substitution at γ-position [
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The new compound 
 <bold>39</bold>, displayed anti-HSV-1 activity with EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 25.4 μM (Ganciclovir as positive control, EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.025 μM) [
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Xiao Liang et al. separated simplicilliumtide J (

 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>), and verlamelins A and B (
 <bold>41</bold>, 
 <bold>42</bold>, 
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>) from the deep-sea-derived fungal strain 
 <italic>Simplicillium obclavatum</italic> EIODSF 020 [
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. These compounds displayed significant anti-HSV-1 activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 14.0, 16.7, and 15.6 μM, respectively (acyclovir as positive control, EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.0 μM). This is the first time to report the antiviral activity of these cyclic peptides [
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Two new anthraquinones, aspergilols H, I (

 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>) and coccoquinone A (
 <bold>45</bold>, 
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>) were purified from the deep-sea-associated fungus 
 <italic>Aspergillus versicolor</italic> SCSIO 41502, collected from marine sediment sample at a depth of 2326 m from the South China Sea [
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. These compounds displayed significant antiviral activity towards HSV-1 with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 4.68, 6.25, and 3.12 μM, respectively (acyclovir as positive control, EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.0 μM) [
