<p id="p0080">Another study on the same fungal strain 222 resulted in the discovery of six novel naphthalenone derivatives, balticols A−F (

 <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref> ) [
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The balticols were tested at non-cytotoxic concentrations for their antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type I. These compounds were found to showed inhibitory effect with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1, 1, 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.1 μg/mL, respectively [
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Balticol E had the most remarkable result with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.01 μg/mL against HSV-1 [
