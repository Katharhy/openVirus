<p id="p0115">Many epidemics broke out over the centuries, which have killed millions of people. Nevertheless, few treatments are available for deadly virus infectious diseases till now. Additionally, a great large of antiviral drugs have been described with viral resistance, which remains an unsolved challenge for antivirus therapy [
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. With increasing numbers of discovering novel types of viruses and drug resistant strains, it is urgent to develop new antiviral lead agents continuously. During the last decade, 79 marine microbes-derived natural products with 9 types of antivirus activities (anti-influenza, anti-HSV, anti-HIV, anti-HCV, anti-RSV, anti-EV71, anti-DNEV, anti-CHIKV, and anti-WEEV) were reported (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), of which 40 compounds exhibited marked antiviral activities. Intriguingly, 18 compounds, rubrolide S (
 <bold>1</bold>), VLPs Q–T (
 <bold>2</bold>–
 <bold>5</bold>), (3Z,6S)-3-benzylidene-6-isobutylpiperazine-2,5-dione (
 <bold>10</bold>), albonoursin (
 <bold>11</bold>), truncateol O (
 <bold>16</bold>), 
 <italic>R</italic>-wailupemycin K (
 <bold>18</bold>), chrodrimanins K and N (
 <bold>20</bold>–
 <bold>21</bold>), 3-hydroxypentacecilide A (
 <bold>22</bold>), asteltoxins E and F (
 <bold>23</bold>–
 <bold>24</bold>), asperterrestide A (
 <bold>36</bold>), trichobotrysins A (
 <bold>46</bold>) and D (
 <bold>48</bold>), and balticol E (
 <bold>63</bold>) displayed antivirus activities even stronger than the corresponding positive drugs. However, even if many 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showed promising results on these compounds, a limited account of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies has been performed to date. Statistically, these marine microbial compounds with antiviral activities were collected from different marine sources, including sediments, seawaters, algae, sponges, corals, worms as well as gorgonians (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). It is notable that over half of these compounds were isolated from marine sediments (50.6%). Marine 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> (24.1%), 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> (21.5%) and 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> (16.5%) were recognized as the dominant genera to produce these antiviral natural products (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Collectively, reasonable pharmacological screening of these compounds will offer promising leads for the development of antiviral medicines or antiviral adjuvants. However, so far only Ara-A derived from marine with anti-HSV activity has entered the market and few marine-derived compounds have reached the clinical trials. In the context of the global spread of COVID-19, it is necessary to continue research on novel antiviral natural products in the ocean, especially marine microbes. The marine environment is recognized as a unique but currently under-exploited resource in regard to identifying new compounds as potential therapeutic drugs. These compounds derived from the ocean may possess antiviral activity with unique mechanisms of action. Using chemosynthesis and biosynthesis strategies, it is possible to bring these antiviral natural products into further clinical development. Additionally, a multidisciplinary method that comprised of genomics, metabolomics, microbiology, natural products chemistry, and pharmacology may enrich the pipeline of novel antiviral drugs development with potential lead compounds, which will conduce to a worldwide search for clinically antivirus molecules.
