 <p>Humans have been suffered from viral infections over the centuries, such as influenza, HSV, and HIV, which have killed millions of people worldwide. However, the availability of effective treatments for infectious diseases remains limited until now, as most of the viral pathogens resisted to many medical treatments. Marine microbes are currently one of the most copious sources of pharmacologically active natural products, which have constantly provided promising antivirus agents. To date, a large number of marine microbial secondary metabolites with antiviral activities have been widely reported. In this review, we have summarized the potential antivirus compounds from marine microorganisms over the last decade. In addition, the structures, bioactivities, and origins of these compounds were discussed as well.</p>
