 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR209">209</xref>]. The ChAdOx1-S vaccine has shown that this adenovirus-vectored vaccine is immunogenic in mice, eliciting a robust humoral and cell-mediated response. This response is predominantly Th1, as demonstrated by IgG subclass and cytokine expression profiling. Vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (prime-only and prime-boost regimen) induces a balanced Th1/Th2 humoral and cellular immune response in rhesus macaques. Data showed that a significantly reduced viral load in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lower respiratory tract tissue of vaccinated rhesus macaques challenged with SARS-CoV-2 compared with control animals, and no pneumonia was observed in vaccinated animals. However, there was no difference in nasal shedding between vaccinated and control animals. Importantly, no evidence of immune-enhanced disease following viral challenge in vaccinated animals was observed. Safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 against symptomatic PCR-positive COVID-19 illness will now be assessed in randomised controlled human clinical trials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR210">210</xref>]. A preliminary report of a phase 1/2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 have shown an acceptable safety profile, and homologous boosting increased antibody responses. These results, together with the induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses, support large-scale evaluation of this candidate vaccine in an ongoing phase 3 programme (ISRCTN89951424) [
