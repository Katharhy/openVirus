 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR214">214</xref>]. Targeting spike glycoprotein (S glycoprotein) in SARS-CoV-2 can be useful [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">192</xref>]. However, multiple efforts to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been made but not reach a commercial level and could excel only to the pre-clinical levels until the preparation of the manuscript. Recently, WHO released a list of 138 vaccine candidates under pre-clinical level grouped into five major groups like live attenuated virus vaccines, DNA vaccines, non-replicating viral vector vaccines, replicating viral vector vaccines, and subunit vaccines [
