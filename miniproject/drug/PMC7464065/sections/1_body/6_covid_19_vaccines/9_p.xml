<p id="Par53">The vaccine based on the S2 protein subunit of the spike glycoprotein (S) that helps in receptor binding and entry can have broad-spectrum antiviral effects as it is conserved in SARS-CoV-2 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">201</xref>]. Targeting S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 can prevent virus entry and hence a strategy for controlling viral infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">201</xref>]. Targeting S protein can both develop both cellular and humoral immunity by inducing neutralizing antibodies and by developing protective cellular immunity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR220">220</xref>], receptor-binding domain (RBD) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR221">221</xref>] of SARS-CoV have shown vaccine potential and can be explored in SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">201</xref>]. Similarly, the S1 subunit of spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 can be studied for antibody production hence prophylactic and therapeutic target [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Both aerosol or oral routes need to be explored as possible modes of administration [
