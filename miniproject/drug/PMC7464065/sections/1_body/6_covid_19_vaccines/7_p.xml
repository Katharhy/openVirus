<p id="Par51">Exploration of vaccine candidates of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for the development of specific vaccines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">192</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">201</xref>], and the research and development are already being initiated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR215">215</xref>]. A set of epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 have been screened, immune targeting of these epitopes can protect against this novel coronavirus and hence can provide experimental platforms for the development of vaccines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200">200</xref>]. Identification of putative protective antigen/peptide from SARS-CoV-2 is essential for the development of subunit vaccines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">201</xref>]. The timely revealing of genome sequences is proving beneficial for subunit vaccine development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">219</xref>]. Structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, including envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S), are being explored as antigens for subunit vaccine development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">201</xref>]. Ahmed et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200">200</xref>] have examined a set of T and B cell epitopes derived from Spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins mapping identically to SARS-CoV-2, and no mutations have been noted in these epitopes in 120 genome sequences hence can serve as vaccine candidates for the development of subunit vaccines.
