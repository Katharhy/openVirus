<p id="Par57">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> provides details about the various fields and research areas for which patents have been applied and granted. These areas include developing novel, rapid, and specific diagnostics that are cheap and readily available [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR227">227</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR229">229</xref>]. For this purpose, the exploration of novel methods or techniques is being elucidated that can be transformed into diagnostic technology. Further, identifying diagnostic markers are vital. Similarly, for the treatment purpose, novel drugs or therapeutic agents are being explored [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>]. These need to be effective against coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR230">230</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR231">231</xref>]. These can be viral protease inhibitors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR231">231</xref>], enzyme inhibitors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR232">232</xref>], antivirals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR228">228</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR233">233</xref>], immunomodulatory [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR234">234</xref>], and treatment adjuvants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR235">235</xref>]. That is the primary class that has attracted most of the patents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>]. Either a drug target is located, or a direct antiviral compound, molecule or agent is established, or an indirect immunomodulator that raises the immune response against the virus is identified as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. Vaccines, which are the main backbone for the prevention strategies and are mostly lacking, especially for novel coronaviruses, have shown immense research prospects and are attracting a sufficient number of patents as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>]. Exploring novel vaccine candidates, targeting appropriate antigens, evaluating immune responses, and transforming into a safe, effective, and potent vaccine are some of the areas on which patents have been published [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR236">236</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR238">238</xref>]. They can be univalent targeting a single pathogen (species/strain) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR238">238</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR239">239</xref>] or multivalent targeting many at a time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR237">237</xref>]. Presently no specific therapeutics or vaccines are available against SARS-CoV-2. Since there is some degree of genomic and structural identity hence therapeutics active against SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV or other broad-spectrum antivirals (e.g., remdesivir, chloroquine) are being explored for SARS-CoV-2. Identification of specific therapeutic targets and vaccines candidates will enable the developing of concrete and potential drugs or vaccines that can prove useful in the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 [
