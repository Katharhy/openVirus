<p id="Par19">A novel (new) coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, is posing a significant threat now by creating a pandemic situation of the COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. The first case was detected in December 2019, and presently above 22 million confirmed cases have been identified [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The disease terrorized over 210 countries/territories/areas with 785,000 deaths, which is probably not the last figure to be known [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In early March 2020, the pandemic started to subside in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] but began to haunt Europe and the United States, becoming Italy the epicentre of Europe and later New York city and state. In this context, other than China, the major blow was felt, in the first months of the pandemic, then with a significant impact at the UK, Italy, France, and Spain, in Europe. However, the increasing of cases and mortality was later higher in the US, where now there is the highest number of cases and deaths. Emerging situations, such as the significant increase in Russia, or the exponential growth in Brazil and other countries in Latin America, as well in India could not be overlooked [
