<p id="Par17">SARS-CoV emerged first in the Guangdong Province of China; and spread internationally to 37 different countries. Noteworthy outbreak sites included China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Vietnam. However, outside the Southeast Asia area, Canada was also significantly affected. The WHO reported 8,437 SARS cases and 813 deaths between the period of November 2002 to July 2003. Transmission is presumed to be from Chinese horseshoe bats harboring SARS-like viruses directly to humans or via intermediate hosts, i.e., palm civets or raccoon dogs in the live-animal markets of China.
