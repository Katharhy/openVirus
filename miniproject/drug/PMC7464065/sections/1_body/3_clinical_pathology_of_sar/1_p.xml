<p id="Par23">The coronavirus claimed the first life on January 10, 2020, and since then, the death toll has climbed at an alarming and accelerating rate. The virus seems lethal, causing severe acute respiratory symptoms, including fever, dyspnea, asthenia and pneumonia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels among people in Wuhan, China [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. As per reports, mild COVID-19 cases revealed higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines like IFN-α, IL-1β, MCP-1, and IP-10 whereas individuals with severe COVID-19 had upregulation of IP-10, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, G-CSF, MCP-1 and MIP-1A [

Additionally, all the blood cells except neutrophils were reported to be decreased with fall in lymphocytes subsets like T cells, B cells, and NK cells in severe COVID-19 cases [

Recently, myalgia and fatigue are found associated with rhabdomyolysis in a COVID-19 patient in Wuhan, China suggesting the need for rapid clinical diagnosis followed by favourable hydration treatment to reduce the risk of severe outcomes as a result of rhabdomyolysis [
