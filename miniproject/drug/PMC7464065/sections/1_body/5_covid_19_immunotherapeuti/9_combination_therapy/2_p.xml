<p id="Par44">Arbidol is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug and blocks the fusion of the virus with the host cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>], It is an effective antiviral against SARS-CoV in combination with antibiotics (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin, nemonoxacin, linezolid, azithromycin or amoxicillin), corticosteroids and oxygen therapy has been used in COVID-19 treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">189</xref>]. Corticosteroids have been routinely used for the treatment of Th1 and Th2 induced lung injury reported in COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Conventional Chinese drugs like ShuFengJieDu and Lianhuaqingwen were also used in the treatment of COVID-19, but their efficacy needs to be determined [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. In contrast to this, WHO has indicated that currently no effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 is known and use of different antibiotics, antiviral drugs, traditional Chinese drugs, corticosteroids like glucocorticoid and their combinations are not recommended before clinical trials as their efficacy is not known and might be detrimental to COVID-19 patients [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">194</xref>]. Besides, to manage the hypoxia in the COVID-19 patients’ ventilation and salvage therapy are reported beneficial. An α-glucan-based mushroom extract, i.e., AHCC has been reported to be used as an immunostimulant for animals and humans affected by viral infections like the influenza virus, West Nile virus, hepatitis virus, herpes virus, papillomavirus, and HIV. In this context, AHCC may be used in the prevention of COVID-19 after evaluation of its efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">195</xref>]. So far, until August 12, 2020, no effective therapy has been demonstrated in any study, including clinical trials. It seems that the most promising candidates, including as mentioned combination therapies, including remdesivir, and ivermectin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>]. Many newer drugs or candidates are being evaluated for application in COVID-19 patients. Teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic against staphylococci [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR196">196</xref>], has been recommended in complicated infections of COVID-19 and
