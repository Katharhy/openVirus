<p id="Par31">S protein was targeted for developing a neutralizing antibody therapy to combat the new coronavirus disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>]. Methods such as phage or yeast display libraries which express antibody fragments could be used efficiently to identify the candidate neutralizing antibody. Traditional methods of screening, such as mice or rabbits for neutralizing antibodies, would be too late during outbreaks. The only challenge is that neutralizing antibodies should be rigorously tested in animal and cell culture models to confirm that they can neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 disease infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>]. The alternate strategy of generating the neutralizing antibodies against S protein is to immunize large animals like sheep, goat, cow, and horse and purify the polyclonal antibodies from these animals. Monoclonal antibodies can be used as potent bio-therapeutics in the form of passive immunotherapy to neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 and to control the harmful outcomes of COVID-19 [

These strategies may prove to be beneficial in the condition of an outbreak since they have many advantages, such as simplifying production and manufacturing. For a shorter treatment strategy, this could quickly help in the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Though antibody-based therapy is effective and immediate in use, it is short-lived. It has limitations of infection transmission, abnormal reactions, and the possibility of other severe risks like induction of severe acute lung injury or antibody-dependent enhancement [
