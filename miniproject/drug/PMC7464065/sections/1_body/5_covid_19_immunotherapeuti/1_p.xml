The lessons learned from earlier SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV threats, recent and past epidemics and pandemics situations of Ebola, Zika, Nipah, swine flu, avian/bird flu led to make tremendous advances in science and research for developing suitable vaccines. Therapeutics/drugs, which along with the current research advances on COVID-19, are warranted to be explored optimally [
