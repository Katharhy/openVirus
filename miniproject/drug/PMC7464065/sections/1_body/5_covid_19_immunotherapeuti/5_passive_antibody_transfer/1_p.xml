<p id="Par36">One of the most effective and traditional tools used in most of the infectious outbreaks is the use of serum of patients who just recovered from the active viral infection to treat patients who contract in the future [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>]. Patients recovered from active viral infections develop a polyclonal immune response to different antigens of SARS-CoV-2 as they neutralize active viral infections. Hence, convalescent-phase plasma can be used as a therapeutic alternative [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">161</xref>]. Passive immunotherapy in the form of convalescent serum tested in MERS-CoV infected mice either as prophylactic or in the therapeutic way both showed good results and supported the use of dromedary immune serum in preventing MERS-CoV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>]. Patients who have 100% recovery from the novel coronavirus infection, can simply donate their plasma to treat the infected patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>]. The same strategy of convalescent serum was used during the Ebola virus outbreak in 2014–2015 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>]. Plasma-derived from the patients who recovered from the disease has also been used as therapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>]. It is the earliest and available means of treatment and provides antibodies that help in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 however in addition to scarcity; this therapy may be non-specific and short-lived [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref>] latter can be overcome by developing monoclonal antibodies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>]. α-interferon atomization inhalation has been weakly recommended at a dose of 5 million U per time for adults in sterile injection water, twice a day [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>]. Similarly, interferon therapy has also been used; however, it aggravated pathology [
