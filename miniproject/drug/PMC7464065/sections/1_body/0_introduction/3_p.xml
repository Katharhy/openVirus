<p id="Par4">Structures of many individual proteins of SARS, MERS, and related coronaviruses, as well as their biological interactions with other viral and host proteins, have been explored along with the experimental testing of anti-viral properties of small compounds [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. To date, there are no proclaimed clinically proven therapeutic antibodies, drugs, and vaccines specific for coronaviruses, which makes it tougher to tackle SARS-CoV-2. This article, in brief, describes the molecular organization and phylogenetic analysis of the coronaviruses, including the SARS-CoV-2 highlights few advances in diagnosis and vaccine development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. It elaborately emphasizes on the different potential therapeutic options that could be pursued for therapy despite limited knowledge of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 such as neutralizing antibodies, oligonucleotides, passive antibody transfer, and drug repurposing, anti-viral proteases, blocking Coronavirus receptors like an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), combination therapy, which can bring a revolutionary change to curb the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in the coming future [
