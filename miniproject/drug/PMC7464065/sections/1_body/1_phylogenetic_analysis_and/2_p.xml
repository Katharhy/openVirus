<p id="Par6">The genome of CoVs consists, a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of around 29.8 kb nucleotides in length with a 5′-cap structure and 3′-polyA tail. The polyprotein 1a/1ab (pp1a/pp1ab) is directly translated using genomic RNA as a template, which encodes nonstructural proteins (nsps) and forms the replication-transcription complex (RTC). Also, a nested set of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) are produced by the replication-transcription complex in a discontinuous manner of transcription. It has common 5′-leader sequences and 3′-terminal sequences. Transcription termination and acquisition of leader RNA happens at transcription regulatory sequences, which are located between open reading frames (ORFs). These sgRNAs (minus-strand) acts as the templates for the synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs[
