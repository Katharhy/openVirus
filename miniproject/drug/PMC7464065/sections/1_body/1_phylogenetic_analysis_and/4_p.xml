<p id="Par8">The S protein (~ 150 kDa) mediates attachment of the virus to the host cell surface receptors resulting in the fusion and subsequent viral entry. The S protein consists of two functional subunits; S
 <sub>1</sub> for binding with the receptor of the host cell and S
 <sub>2</sub> for the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Different coronaviruses use different domains present within the S
 <sub>1</sub> subunit helps the virus to recognize and bind to specific receptors [

In some CoVs, the S protein also mediates cell–cell fusion between infected and adjacent, uninfected cells resulting in the formation of multinucleated giant cells. This strategy allows direct viral spread between cells while avoiding virus-neutralizing antibodies. The S protein utilizes an N-terminal signal sequence to gain access to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is heavily N-linked glycosylated. Homotrimers of the virus-encoded S protein make up the distinctive spike-like structure [
