<p id="Par7">It has also been established that the genomes of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV strains are almost identical and possess only six nucleotide differences in the genome. A typical CoVâ€™s genome and subgenome contain at least six ORFs. The first ORF (ORF1a/b) contains two-third of the whole length genome and encodes 16 nsps (nsp1-16). A-1 frameshift between ORF1b and ORF1a, leads to the synthesis of two polypeptides: pp1ab and pp1a. These are processed by chymotrypsin-like protease or two papain-like protease or main protease and one into 16 nsps. The rest of the ORFs encode four major structural proteins: membrane (M), spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), and envelope (E) proteins. Other than these proteins, different CoVs encode specific accessory proteins and structural proteins, such as 3a/b protein, HE protein, and 4a/b protein [
