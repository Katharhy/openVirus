<p id="Par12">The genomic sequence alignment among different CoVs shows 58% identity on the non-structural protein-coding region, 43% identity on the structural protein-coding region, with 54% at the whole genome level which suggests the non-structural proteins are more conserved when compared to the structural proteins and structural proteins are more diverse when in need of adaptation for new hosts. However, the CoV genome is extensive, with ~ 30 kb in length, and is considered as the largest known RNA viruses (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Such a large genome of CoVs is maintained by the unique features of the CoV RTC, which encodes for many RNA processing enzymes. The 3′–5′ exoribonuclease is one such kind of RNA processing enzyme and is unique in CoVs among different RNA viruses, also believed in providing a proofreading function to the RTC. Sequence analysis depicts that the SARS-CoV-2 has a typical genome structure the same as of CoV and mainly belongs to the

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The glycoprotein spike surface plays an essential role in receptor binding and determines host tropism [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. These proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV bind via different receptor-binding domains (RBDs) to various host receptors. SARS-CoV utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the primary receptor, and MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) as the primary receptor. Initial analysis depicted that SARS-CoV-2 has a quite close phylogenetic association with SARS-like bat coronaviruses [
