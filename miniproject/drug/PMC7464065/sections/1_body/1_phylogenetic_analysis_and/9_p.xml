<p id="Par13">An observation of the amino acid substitutions in different proteins occurs among them, which sheds light on how SARS-CoV-2 differs from SARS-CoVs structurally and functionally. In total, 380 amino acid substitutions were there between the SARS-CoV-2 amino acid sequences and the SARS and SARS-like viruses. However, no amino acid substitutions were found in nonstructural protein 7 (nsp7), envelope, nsp13, matrix, or accessory proteins 8b and p6. Nevertheless, due to minimal knowledge about this novel virus, it is quite hard to give reasonable explanations for the amino acid substitutions between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS or SARS-like CoVs and also whether these differences could affect the host transmission property of the SARS-CoV-2 when compared to SARS-CoV needs future investigation [
