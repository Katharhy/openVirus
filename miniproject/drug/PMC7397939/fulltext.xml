In the early stages of the epidemic, healthcare professionals have been in the front-line to manage the infection. The current study aimed to analyse the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on healthcare professionals and to detect some risk and protective factors of their distress levels, with regard to socio-demographic variables, direct exposure to COVID-19 and the coping strategies used to deal with stress. The data were collected during the peak of the infection. A total of 595 healthcare professionals enrolled in the study and completed the measures of socio-demographical and professional data, perceived stress (PSS) and coping strategies (COPE- NVI-25). Overall, we found that a positive attitude towards the stressful situation was the main protective factor, while female gender, seeking social support, avoidance strategies and working with COVID-19 patients were risk factors. Economic status, problem solving ability and turning to religion were not associated with stress levels. This study, one of the first on this topic, highlighted the main coping strategies used by healthcare professionals in facing the highly stressful situation caused by the pandemic.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="keys0001"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Pandemic</kwd><kwd>Stress</kwd><kwd>Healthcare professional</kwd><kwd>Coping strategies</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec0001"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="para0004">In 2019 a new coronavirus affected China and spread all over the world in a short period.

At present there are approximately two hundred thousand of people infected in Italy (<xref rid="bib0034" ref-type="bibr">Protezione Civile, 2020</xref>). Facing this dramatic emergency, the Government implemented extraordinary measures to limit viral transmission (<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">Decreto del Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri 11 marzo 2020, 2020</xref>). In this critical situation everyone's life changed due to restrictions of movement and social contacts. In particular, healthcare professionals uninterruptedly continued to work in such a critical situation, taking the risk to be affected by COVID-19; therefore, they might be considered as one of the most vulnerable categories of professionals to develop psychological stress and other mental health symptoms (<xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">Lai&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0041" ref-type="bibr">Tian&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>).

Actually, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study has analysed stress and coping strategies in Italian healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, our main aim was to investigate the response of Italian healthcare professionals to the COVID-19 pandemic, in terms of perceived stress and coping strategies. At first, we explored the association of socio-demographic variables (namely, gender, marital status, having or not children and economic class) with levels of perceived stress. Besides, we analysed if working or not working with COVID-19 patients and coping strategies were predictive of healthcare workers&#x02019; stress levels. Following previous research on other pandemics, we expected that working with infected patients might predict higher levels of distress. As for coping stiles, we hypothesised that positive strategies (as problem solving, social support, turning to religion and positive attitude) were associated with lower levels of stress, and avoidance strategies were associated with higher levels of stress.</p></sec><sec id="sec0002"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec0003"><label>2.1</label><title>Sample</title><p id="para0012">The sample comprised 595 healthcare workers, with an overall mean age of 40.69 years (SD=11.48); their ages ranged from 21 to 72 years, the majority of the sample were females (80.3%).</p><p id="para0013">Most of the study participants were in a relationship (75.3%) and 51% had children.

Specifically, we investigated the role of some socio-demographic variables (gender, having or not children, marital and socio-economic status), direct exposure to COVID-19 (working or not working with patients affected by this disease) and coping strategies on stress levels. Due to the correlational nature of our study, no causal conclusions can be drawn among the considered variables; nevertheless, our findings may contribute to the understanding of stress reactions of healthcare workers involved in the COVID-19 outbreak.</p><p id="para0029">As for the socio-demographic variables, overall we found that differences on stress emerged only according to gender and having or not children. Indeed, females showed higher levels of distress than males. This result was in line with previous literature on the theme (<xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr">Matud,&#x000a0;2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">West,&#x000a0;Dyrbye, and Shanafelt, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">Hirsch&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>), with a recent study carried out on Italian general population during the current COVID-19 outbreak (<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">Flesia&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>) and also with the normative data collected in Italy (<xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">Mondo,&#x000a0;Sechi, and Cabras, 2019</xref>).</p><p id="para0030">Furthermore, healthcare workers with children reported lower levels of perceived stress than their colleagues without children. Another study during the COVID-19 pandemic found that healthcare workers with children at home, perceived less distress (<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Evanoff&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Having children could represent a protective factor from perceived stress, allowing healthcare workers to focus on positive aspects of their life (<xref rid="bib0044" ref-type="bibr">Walton&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). It may be argued that children could represent a &#x0201c;break&#x0201d; from exhausting working hours, working demands, subsequent frustration of dealing with patients and fatigue.</p><p id="para0031">We did not observe differences in stress levels according to the socio-economic status and this result was not consistent with a recent research (<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">Flesia&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>) that found a negative correlation between stress and income levels in the general population during the current outbreak caused by SAR-Cov-2. Flesia and colleagues (2020) explained this result stating that higher income could be associated with more comfortable housing solutions during the lockdown and may produce less concerns about the economic outcomes. We might hypothesise that this explanation was not adequate for the specific population we examined, as healthcare professionals were the category of people who worked hard and continuously during this outbreak, without benefiting from the concrete advantages given by having a high income (as, for example, comfortable housing solutions and smart-working). This could explain the absence of stress differences among the different socio-economic levels of our sample.</p><p id="para0032">With regard to marital status, we have not observed an association with perceived stress; in fact, there were no differences between those who were in a couple relationship and those who were not. This data is not in agreement with previous studies on epidemic which highlighted that being single was predictive of higher depressive symptoms and higher psychological distress among hospital staff (<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Liu&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib0043" ref-type="bibr">Vyas&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, previous studies on COVID-19 investigated this variable in association with mental health status during the outbreak. Specifically, <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">Li&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;(2020)</xref> found that marital status was a risk factor for insomnia in at home medical staff population, <xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">Tan&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;(2020)</xref> showed that marital status was associated with the severity of psychiatric symptoms in general population and <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">Doshi&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;(2020)</xref> found that married people had higher risk of having greater fear towards COVID-19 in Indian general population. As can be seen, the association between perceived stress and marital status has not yet examined in a population of healthcare workers during COVID-19 emergency, for this reason our data must be supported by other research.</p><p id="para0033">A further objective of our study was to explore if working or not with COVID-19 patients and coping strategies were predictive of stress levels. In line with our hypothesis, working with COVID-19 patients was associated with higher distress. This result is self-explanatory but what surprised us was that it explained only a small portion of the stress variance. In other words, if it was true that working with COVID-19 patients increased stress, it was equally true that this increase was small.</p><p id="para0034">With regard to coping styles, we found that a positive attitude was the strongest protective factors against distress. In fact, the higher the positive attitude, the lower distress levels. This finding was consistent with previous studies that found positive attitude in the workplace as the strategy with the biggest impact in reducing stress (<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Khalid&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">Cai&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). This factor refers to a functional coping strategy that allows individuals to positively reinterpret negative situations, as it is related with self-efficacy, greater psychological wellbeing and better quality of life (<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">Flesia&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="para0035">We also observed that two other coping strategies, namely social support and avoidance, constituted risk factors, since they predicted distress levels in our sample: higher levels of those strategies were associated with higher stress. The finding about avoidance strategies was in line with what we expected. This coping mechanism is grouped among dysfunctional reactions to stressful situations as it deals with the likelihood with which individuals adopt strategies based on avoidance (such as denial) when they face problematic situations. These results are in line with previous literature on the relation between coping and response to epidemics (<xref rid="bib0033" ref-type="bibr">Phua&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Teasdale,&#x000a0;Yardley, Schlotz, and Michie, 2012</xref>). Contrary to our expectations, higher social support predicted higher distress. Previous research on social support considered it as a functional strategy to cope with problematic situations (<xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">Litman,&#x000a0;2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">Mart&#x000ed;nez&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>), but a study on Italian general population during the COVID-19 pandemic found that social support was positively related to, but not predictive of perceived stress (<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">Flesia&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). This finding may be explained arguing that, according to <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">Litman&#x000a0;(2006)</xref>, the support factor of the COPE instrument comprises several items (as emotional social support, instrumental social support, venting emotions and focusing on emotions), which can be more or less adaptive. Besides, our result seems to underline the critical situation that the healthcare workers lived and should be interpreted within the specific situation of the current pandemic. Indeed, healthcare workers could be fatigued due to an increase of working hours, worried about the possibility to infect their families and colleagues; furthermore, in many cases healthcare workers chose to live far from their families to protect them from the risk of contagion (<xref rid="bib0048" ref-type="bibr">Wu&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al,&#x000a0;2020</xref>). Moreover, the Italian Government issued a decree that imposed social distancing measures for all people, particularly for those in contact with symptomatic patients. According to these premises, seeking social support could be frustrating for healthcare workers and could be more stressful than in other situations. However, this result has to be considered cautiously as further research is needed to explore it.</p><p id="para0036">Inconsistently with previous studies on the general population (<xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">Imperatori&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">Mart&#x000ed;nez&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>), we did not find associations of problem solving and turning to religion with perceived stress. Problem solving refers to an active strategy, aimed to focus on the resolution of an issue by suppressing competing activities and planning actions (<xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">Litman,&#x000a0;2006</xref>). A possible explanation of our result is linked with the dramatic situation associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, as an unknown and uncontrollable disease might have produced a sensation of inadequacy, affecting healthcare professional's coping abilities. In the current pandemic, at the time of the survey administration, no vaccines or drugs had been proven to be effective for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 and this might have influenced the healthcare professionals&#x02019; perception of their own problem solving ability. Hence, it could be hypothesised that this pandemic, at least in the first months of its spreading, represented a stressor that went beyond the use of problem-focused strategies.</p><p id="para0037">Also the lack of associations between religiousness and perceived stress was an unexpected result that may probably be linked to the exceptional and unprecedented nature of the event that healthcare professionals faced in the climax of this pandemic. Religious coping is a &#x0201c;multifaceted phenomenon&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">Perera&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>) and, according to <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">Ano&#x000a0;and Vasconcelles&#x000a0;(2005)</xref>, in order to better understand religion's role in the coping process, it is important to analyse the dynamic ways in which people use their religion in specific situations. We can argue that the extreme working conditions during the pandemic, such as the exhausting work shifts, left little time to professional healthcare workers to spend in prayer and religion. Besides, the items of the COPE scale turning to religion likely fail to grasp the aspect of spirituality, which may be quite different from that of religion, as it refers to the development of a personal value system and the search for a deeper meaning of life, that may go beyond religious boundaries (<xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">Perera et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). Hence, we may not exclude that the absence of associations between stress and religiousness was linked to this limitation of the tool we used. However, as for the previous findings inconsistent with the existing literature, this data has to be considered with caution and needs further exploration.</p><p id="para0038">Overall, our study highlighted the importance of coping strategies used by healthcare professionals in facing the highly stressful situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This category of Italian individuals was the most directly involved in managing the emergency produced by the very rapid spread of the Sars-Cov-2, that caused a high number of people infected in serious medical conditions and a high number of deaths. Our study found that being female and not having children were associated with higher levels of distress; furthermore, in the whole sample, a positive attitude towards the stressful situation was the main protective factor, while seeking social support, working with COVID-19 patients and avoidance strategies were risk factors.</p><p id="para0039">This study has a number of limitations, which need to be taken into account as the findings are not generalizable to other professional groups and situations different from the current COVID-19 pandemic. First, the cross-sectional design of the study precluded the evaluation of the effects of healthcare professionals&#x02019; characteristics on distress levels; therefore, longitudinal studies are recommended. Second, the sample was not equally distributed with respect to gender and this may have affected our results; third, the use of self-report questionnaires rather than a clinical assessment reduced the power of our findings.</p><p id="para0040">Notwithstanding these weaknesses, our findings suggest some general reflections about the management of distress in healthcare workers during an exceptional situation as the COVID-19 pandemic was. As already mentioned, this category of workers has been in the frontline during the outbreak, facing conditions that, at least in Italy, had never occurred before, with very hard working shifts, social distancing and isolation from family and friends. Besides, against this new Coronavirus no drugs or vaccines were ready and effective during the first wave of the pandemic. We can assume that these extreme conditions found medical staff unprepared to deal with them but, despite this, all the healthcare workers have faced this hard condition. This unprecedented situation could be the basis for explaining some of our results inconsistent with the existing literature. However, further research on the topic is needed, also considering that future pandemics may be more frequent than in the past. Also considering this perspective, it is necessary to think and plan support programs specifically dedicated to healthcare workers. Overall, our results highlighted that being female, not having children and working in the frontline were associated with higher distress levels. In the future, it could be useful to screen medical staff with those characteristics in order to offer them specific psychological support. This last should be delivered remotely (through social media) and scheduled in order to adapt to the work shifts of the professionals. Finally, psychological programs for healthcare workers could be realized with the purpose of increasing coping strategies, above all the positive attitude style (that resulted to be the most effective in our study) to face extremely stressful events and possible future epidemics.</p><p id="para0041">It could be useful to extend this research also to the healthcare workers&#x02019; main personal characteristics playing a role in the post-epidemic period, in order to compare these different situations.</p></sec><sec id="sec0012"><title>Author statement contributors</title><p id="para0042">The authors contributed equally and meaningfully to this study and the final manuscript.</p><p id="para0043">All authors approved the final manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="sec0013"><title>Funding</title><p id="para0044">This study did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="para0047">The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebibl1"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0001"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0001"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ano</surname><given-names>G.G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Vasconcelles</surname><given-names>E.B.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Religious coping and psychological adjustment to stress: a meta-analysis</article-title><source>J.
