<p id="para0025">With regard to gender differences, we found higher levels of perceived stress among females (mean = 19.56; SD = 7.06) than males (mean = 15.38; SD = 6.65) [F 
 <sub>(1,593)</sub> = 33.738, p &lt; .001]. No differences emerged on perceived stress according to marital status [F 
 <sub>(1,593)</sub> = .852; n.s.]; as for the economic status, the ANOVA showed a slight statistical significance [F 
 <sub>(4,590)</sub> = 2.905, p = .027], that disappeared with the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Having children was associated with lower levels of stress [F 
 <sub>(1,593)</sub> = 10.798; p = .001]. Overall, these findings mean that, among the considered sociodemographic variables, differences on stress levels emerged only according to gender and having or not children.
