 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Cohen and Williamson, 1988</xref>) is a widely used self-report tool to assess the perceived stress in terms of degree to which situations in one's life are evaluated as stressful (
 <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 1983</xref>). The original version of PSS includes 14 items, while the short form (PSS-10) is a 10-item questionnaire (six negatively stated and four positively stated). Each item, scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (very often), investigates stressful experiences and responses to stress over the previous 4 weeks (sample items: “In the last month, how often have you been upset because of something that happened unexpectedly?”, “In the last month, how often have you been angered because of things that were outside of your control?”). The global PSS-10 score ranges from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher levels of perceived stress. In this survey the Cronbach's alpha was .884.
