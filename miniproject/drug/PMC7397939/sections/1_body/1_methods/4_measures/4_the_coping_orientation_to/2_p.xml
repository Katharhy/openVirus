 <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">Foà et al., 2015</xref>) is the Italian validation of the short version of the COPE (
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">Carver, Scheier, and Weintraub, 1989</xref>) developed for measuring coping styles. The COPE-NVI-25 consists of 25 items evaluating how often the subject uses that particular coping process in difficult or stressful situations (the individuals should not refer to a specific stress but rather think about how they usually behave in stressful situations). Response choices varied from 1 (I usually don't do this at all) to 4 (I usually do this a lot). This instrument is based on five independent dimensions: social support (sample item: “I try to get advice from someone about what to do”), avoidance strategies (sample item: “I refuse to believe that it has happened”), positive attitude (sample item: “I look for something good in what is happening”), problem solving (sample item: “I focus on dealing with this problem, and if necessary let other things slide a little”) and turning to religion (sample item: “I pray more than usual”). The COPE-NVI-25 proved to be an instrument as valid as the original COPE, but easier to administer. In this study the value of Cronbach's alpha was .801.
