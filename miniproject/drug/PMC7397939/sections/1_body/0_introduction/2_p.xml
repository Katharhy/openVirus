In this critical situation everyone's life changed due to restrictions of movement and social contacts. In particular, healthcare professionals uninterruptedly continued to work in such a critical situation, taking the risk to be affected by COVID-19; therefore, they might be considered as one of the most vulnerable categories of professionals to develop psychological stress and other mental health symptoms (
