<p id="para0011">According to these theoretical premises, we conducted a study on a sample of healthcare workers in Italy. Actually, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study has analysed stress and coping strategies in Italian healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, our main aim was to investigate the response of Italian healthcare professionals to the COVID-19 pandemic, in terms of perceived stress and coping strategies. At first, we explored the association of socio-demographic variables (namely, gender, marital status, having or not children and economic class) with levels of perceived stress. Besides, we analysed if working or not working with COVID-19 patients and coping strategies were predictive of healthcare workersâ€™ stress levels. Following previous research on other pandemics, we expected that working with infected patients might predict higher levels of distress. As for coping stiles, we hypothesised that positive strategies (as problem solving, social support, turning to religion and positive attitude) were associated with lower levels of stress, and avoidance strategies were associated with higher levels of stress.</p>
