<p id="para0040">Notwithstanding these weaknesses, our findings suggest some general reflections about the management of distress in healthcare workers during an exceptional situation as the COVID-19 pandemic was. As already mentioned, this category of workers has been in the frontline during the outbreak, facing conditions that, at least in Italy, had never occurred before, with very hard working shifts, social distancing and isolation from family and friends. Besides, against this new Coronavirus no drugs or vaccines were ready and effective during the first wave of the pandemic. We can assume that these extreme conditions found medical staff unprepared to deal with them but, despite this, all the healthcare workers have faced this hard condition. This unprecedented situation could be the basis for explaining some of our results inconsistent with the existing literature. However, further research on the topic is needed, also considering that future pandemics may be more frequent than in the past. Also considering this perspective, it is necessary to think and plan support programs specifically dedicated to healthcare workers. Overall, our results highlighted that being female, not having children and working in the frontline were associated with higher distress levels. In the future, it could be useful to screen medical staff with those characteristics in order to offer them specific psychological support. This last should be delivered remotely (through social media) and scheduled in order to adapt to the work shifts of the professionals. Finally, psychological programs for healthcare workers could be realized with the purpose of increasing coping strategies, above all the positive attitude style (that resulted to be the most effective in our study) to face extremely stressful events and possible future epidemics.</p>
