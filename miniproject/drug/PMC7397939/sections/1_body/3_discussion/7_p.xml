<p id="para0033">A further objective of our study was to explore if working or not with COVID-19 patients and coping strategies were predictive of stress levels. In line with our hypothesis, working with COVID-19 patients was associated with higher distress. This result is self-explanatory but what surprised us was that it explained only a small portion of the stress variance. In other words, if it was true that working with COVID-19 patients increased stress, it was equally true that this increase was small.</p>
