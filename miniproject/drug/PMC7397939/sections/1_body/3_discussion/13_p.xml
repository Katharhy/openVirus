<p id="para0039">This study has a number of limitations, which need to be taken into account as the findings are not generalizable to other professional groups and situations different from the current COVID-19 pandemic. First, the cross-sectional design of the study precluded the evaluation of the effects of healthcare professionalsâ€™ characteristics on distress levels; therefore, longitudinal studies are recommended. Second, the sample was not equally distributed with respect to gender and this may have affected our results; third, the use of self-report questionnaires rather than a clinical assessment reduced the power of our findings.</p>
