<p id="para0037">Also the lack of associations between religiousness and perceived stress was an unexpected result that may probably be linked to the exceptional and unprecedented nature of the event that healthcare professionals faced in the climax of this pandemic. Religious coping is a “multifaceted phenomenon” (

 <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">Ano and Vasconcelles (2005)</xref>, in order to better understand religion's role in the coping process, it is important to analyse the dynamic ways in which people use their religion in specific situations. We can argue that the extreme working conditions during the pandemic, such as the exhausting work shifts, left little time to professional healthcare workers to spend in prayer and religion. Besides, the items of the COPE scale turning to religion likely fail to grasp the aspect of spirituality, which may be quite different from that of religion, as it refers to the development of a personal value system and the search for a deeper meaning of life, that may go beyond religious boundaries (
 <xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">Perera et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, we may not exclude that the absence of associations between stress and religiousness was linked to this limitation of the tool we used. However, as for the previous findings inconsistent with the existing literature, this data has to be considered with caution and needs further exploration.
