<p id="para0035">We also observed that two other coping strategies, namely social support and avoidance, constituted risk factors, since they predicted distress levels in our sample: higher levels of those strategies were associated with higher stress. The finding about avoidance strategies was in line with what we expected. This coping mechanism is grouped among dysfunctional reactions to stressful situations as it deals with the likelihood with which individuals adopt strategies based on avoidance (such as denial) when they face problematic situations. These results are in line with previous literature on the relation between coping and response to epidemics (

 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Teasdale, Yardley, Schlotz, and Michie, 2012</xref>). Contrary to our expectations, higher social support predicted higher distress. Previous research on social support considered it as a functional strategy to cope with problematic situations (

 <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">Martínez et al., 2020</xref>), but a study on Italian general population during the COVID-19 pandemic found that social support was positively related to, but not predictive of perceived stress (

 <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">Litman (2006)</xref>, the support factor of the COPE instrument comprises several items (as emotional social support, instrumental social support, venting emotions and focusing on emotions), which can be more or less adaptive. Besides, our result seems to underline the critical situation that the healthcare workers lived and should be interpreted within the specific situation of the current pandemic. Indeed, healthcare workers could be fatigued due to an increase of working hours, worried about the possibility to infect their families and colleagues; furthermore, in many cases healthcare workers chose to live far from their families to protect them from the risk of contagion (
 <xref rid="bib0048" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al, 2020</xref>). Moreover, the Italian Government issued a decree that imposed social distancing measures for all people, particularly for those in contact with symptomatic patients. According to these premises, seeking social support could be frustrating for healthcare workers and could be more stressful than in other situations. However, this result has to be considered cautiously as further research is needed to explore it.
