<p id="para0031">We did not observe differences in stress levels according to the socio-economic status and this result was not consistent with a recent research (
 <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">Flesia et al., 2020</xref>) that found a negative correlation between stress and income levels in the general population during the current outbreak caused by SAR-Cov-2. Flesia and colleagues (2020) explained this result stating that higher income could be associated with more comfortable housing solutions during the lockdown and may produce less concerns about the economic outcomes. We might hypothesise that this explanation was not adequate for the specific population we examined, as healthcare professionals were the category of people who worked hard and continuously during this outbreak, without benefiting from the concrete advantages given by having a high income (as, for example, comfortable housing solutions and smart-working). This could explain the absence of stress differences among the different socio-economic levels of our sample.
