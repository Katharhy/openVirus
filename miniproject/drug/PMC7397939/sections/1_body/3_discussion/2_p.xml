<p id="para0028">The current study aimed to analyse the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on healthcare professionals, analysing the relationship between some risk and protective factors and distress levels. Specifically, we investigated the role of some socio-demographic variables (gender, having or not children, marital and socio-economic status), direct exposure to COVID-19 (working or not working with patients affected by this disease) and coping strategies on stress levels. Due to the correlational nature of our study, no causal conclusions can be drawn among the considered variables; nevertheless, our findings may contribute to the understanding of stress reactions of healthcare workers involved in the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
