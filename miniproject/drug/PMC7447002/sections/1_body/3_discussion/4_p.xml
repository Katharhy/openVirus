<p>People living with HIV may be at increased risk for a more severe clinical course of COVID-19, and our sample demonstrated a history of multiple factors that would likely contribute further to their risks for greater severity of COVID-19. Of particular concern were high rates of HIV viremia, smoking,

 </sup> and depression symptoms.

 </sup> We found that at baseline 1-in-3 participants had evidence of a potential underlying renal condition. Of particular concern are 10% and 15% of participants testing positive for urinary glucose and protein, respectively, both of which are associated with COVID-19 severity.

 </sup> The accumulation of risk factors for severe COVID-19 among people living with HIV, who are already immune compromised, signals an urgent need to mitigate their exposure to SARS-CoV-2. We found that women engaged in more protective behaviors than men and that protective behaviors were associated with how concerned participants were about contracting COVID-19. However, there was no association between the number of underlying risks for severe COVID-19 and the number of protective actions taken. At the time of this study, public health messaging focused on increased COVID-19 risks for the elderly and people with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and immune suppression.

 </sup> Although people with HIV will recognize their increased risks due to an immune suppressive condition, the added burden of smoking and other substance use, as well as underlying conditions common to HIV infection, have not been included in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports of severe case outcomes and have not been included in public health messaging.

 </sup> Patients should be fully informed of their risks for severe COVID-19 to understand the importance of long-term mitigation.
