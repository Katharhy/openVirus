<p>Nearly 1 in 5 participants (n = 31, 19%) indicated that they had missed a scheduled HIV care appointment in the previous 30 days. When asked the reason for their missed appointment, 14 (45%) spontaneously stated the reason was directly related to COVID-19. In addition to their missing a scheduled medical appointment, 45% of participants reported that a medical provider canceled an appointment, and 40% reported a nonmedical service provider contacted them to cancel an appointment due to COVID-19.

However, adherence improved significantly in the month since the onset of COVID-19 protective actions, t (159) = 17.2,
