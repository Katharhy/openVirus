<p>The increased vulnerability for COVID-19 severity in people living with HIV shines a light on the necessity of adopting COVID-19 protective behaviors, avoiding public gatherings, reducing social contacts, and physical distancing. COVID-19 protective behaviors were recommended in early March 2020 as some states (eg, California, Washington, and New York) responded to the unfolding health crisis. By contrast and in the absence of a national COVID-19 strategy, the state of Georgia was late in response. On March 13, 2020, the US government declared a national state of emergency, and on March 15, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations to avoid social gatherings.
