 </sup> The items represent the number of days medications were taken over the previous 7 days, the frequency of taking medications as directed, and a self-perception rating of how well medications were taken over the previous week. We used methods suggested by Wilson et al to convert scores for each item on a scale of 0â€“100 using linear transformations and calculating the mean to a single adherence score with a range from 0 to 100, interpreted as percent adherence over the past week (alpha = 0.73). Wilson et al
