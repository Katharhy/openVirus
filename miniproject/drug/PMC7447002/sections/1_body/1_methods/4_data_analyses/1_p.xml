<p>We conducted descriptive analyses for participants identifying as male and female on demographic, health, and COVID-19 protective behaviors using contingency table χ
 <sup>2</sup> tests for categorical variables and independent t tests for continuous measures. We also formed 2 groups based on relatively fewer (≤2, N = 65) and relatively greater (≥3, N = 97) COVID-19 protective behaviors and examined differences between groups using contingency table χ
 <sup>2</sup> tests for categorical variables and independent t tests for continuous measures. Poisson regression was used to test a multivariable model predicting the number of COVID-19 protective behaviors from participant characteristics and the history of COVID-19 severity risks. ART adherence for the assessment period and the previous month was compared using a dependent (paired) t test. All statistical tests defined significance by
