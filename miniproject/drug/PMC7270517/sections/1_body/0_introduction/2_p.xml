<p id="Par3">SARS-CoV-2 has considerable genetic resemblance (around 80%) with SARS-CoV virus, which was the causative organism of the 2002 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 has spike proteins on its surface, and using these proteins, it binds to target human cells. The receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mainly expressed on epithelial cells, renal proximal tubular cells, enterocytes, and endothelial cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. After attachment to ACE2, the virus is endocytosed into the cell and interacts with tall-like receptors (TLRs) inside the endosome. This interaction promotes a type I interferon (IFN) response and increases the expression of other proinflammatory cytokines through nuclear factor ĸB (NF-ĸB) [
