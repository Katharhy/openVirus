<p id="Par4">There are two main reactions of the immune system to this virus: an initial innate immune response through type I IFNs (described above) and a secondary adaptive immune response, which may lead to cytokine storm. The initial IFN response aims to contain and clear the virus effectively, and an early peak seems crucial for this effective control [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The resolution of IFN activity generated during an innate immune response is required for recovery [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. After the initial IFN response, macrophages are activated through their IFN-α/β receptors and produce chemoattractants and proinflammatory cytokines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Another reaction to the virus is the presentation of spike protein antigens to T cells by antigen-presenting cells, which results in the activation of B cells and the production of anti-spike immunoglobulins. When these immunoglobulins bind to spike proteins of the viruses, coated viruses could be internalized into macrophages through Fc receptors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These macrophages release proinflammatory cytokines, which may contribute to the cytokine storm in the adaptive phase [

The cellular/tissue damage in COVID-19 probably occurs in two ways: (1) direct damage by the virus through viral replication and (2) the harmful effects of the exaggerated immune response resulting in a cytokine storm, which means the uncontrolled and excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Mice and non-human primate studies showed that a disproportionate immune response rather than the virus titer was related to death in SARS-CoV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The infection is mild in most of the affected individuals while it could cause a severe clinical situation, mainly characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm that can lead to mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Cytokine storm is the result of uncontrolled immune activation which leads to hyperinflammation and multi-organ disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Although everyone is susceptible to being infected by this novel virus, COVID-19 affects a specific group of individuals with more severe disease. The main risk groups are elderly patients, smokers, and individuals with chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension [
