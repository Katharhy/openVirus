 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. These articles were not included since there were no details about these reported patients. Garg et al. presented age-stratified COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates of U.S. patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. And in their report, there were three (out of 180) patients who were mentioned to have “rheumatic/autoimmune disease”. One of these patients was in the age range of 18–49 years, while two were ≥ 65 years of age. Xu et al. mentioned that there were gout patients in their COVID-19 cohort, including 187 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In their patient experience survey study, Sirotich et al. reported that 465 patients with rheumatic diseases had a diagnosis of COVID-19 based on symptoms or physician diagnosis with positive laboratory tests [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, no further details were provided about these patients, including their underlying rheumatic diseases. In the cohort of 1317 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, Gendelman et al. reported that three were on chronic hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and seven were on chronic colchicine treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. But they did not mention the underlying diseases in these patients.
