<p id="Par36">CAPS also raises interesting questions. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by SARS-CoV was observed previously [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. Another microorganism that activates NLRP3 is 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumonia</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Previously, Walker et al. observed that pneumococcal vaccines could trigger a severe local and systemic inflammatory reaction in CAPS patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. They hypothesized that further trigger by pneumococcal polysaccharides to an already over-activated NLRP3 inflammasome might have caused these reactions. This raised concern about the use of these vaccines in CAPS patients. Could the same concern be valid in case of COVID-19? Since CAPS is a rare disease, the current data do not let us answer this question either. Another confounding factor is that FMF and CAPS patients are mainly on colchicine and anti-IL-1 therapies, which are currently being tested in COVID-19 treatment. To date, there is only one report of COVID-19 in a patient with CAPS (who was on anti-IL-1 treatment) who experienced a mild disease course and recovered in a couple of days without any treatment [
