<p id="Par37">Previous data suggest that mutations in the main causative genes of primary HLH (such as gene encoding for perforin) were also associated with secondary HLH/MAS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. There are also other mutations in other genes such as 
 <italic>NLRC4</italic> associated with rare monogenic autoinflammatory diseases causing a tendency to recurrent MAS. NLRC4-related disease is characterized by early-onset recurrent fever, enterocolitis, and repeated episodes of MAS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. Patients carrying variants of these genes may also be more prone to cytokine storm associated with COVID-19. Future data about the course of COVID-19 in the setting of rare monogenic autoinflammatory diseases will provide further insights about the disease pathogenesis.
