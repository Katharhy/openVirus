<p id="Par35">One group is autoinflammatory recurrent fever syndromes such as familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) or cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS). As we know, pyrin and NLRP3 inflammasomes are overactivated in FMF and CAPS, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. 
 <italic>MEFV</italic> mutations (associated with FMF) were thought to provide an advantage against some infections such as tuberculosis or plague in the Mediterranean basin in the past [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. The findings of the NIH (National Institute of Health) group suggested the idea that individuals carrying an 
 <italic>MEFV</italic> mutation might have a selective advantage against the plague [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. What will be the effect in COVID-19? Will these patients eliminate SARS-CoV-2 more efficiently? Or will the overactive inflammasome contribute further to the exaggerated immune response that complicate the disease? We do not know the answers at the moment.
