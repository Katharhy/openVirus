<p id="Par28">Pediatric rheumatologists are very familiar with this entity since a significant portion of some common rheumatic diseases such as systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), SLE, and Kawasaki disease present this complication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. This secondary hemophagocytosis is called macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) in pediatric rheumatology practice. Thus, the experience of rheumatologists was important when we realized that the severe end of the COVID-19 clinical spectrum was a multisystem hyperinflammatory syndrome progressing to a cytokine storm with shock. This situation resembles secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) or MAS. Having said that, we should be aware that COVID-19-associated cytokine storm is 
 <italic>not identical</italic> to MAS. It shares certain common features such as high ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), low platelet, and lymphocyte counts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. But they also differ in some aspects. For instance, a decrease in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is commonly observed in MAS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. However, this does not seem to be a mandatory feature of COVID-19-associated cytokine storm [
