Increasing reports about the laboratory values and histopathological features of critically ill COVID-19 patients will provide more clues about the similarities and differences between COVID-19-associated cytokine storm and secondary HLH/MAS. However, we believe that the experience of pediatric rheumatologists contributed to the management of these severe COVID-19 patients: anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 strategies have been employed in the cytokine storm of COVID-19 patients in most intensive care units [
