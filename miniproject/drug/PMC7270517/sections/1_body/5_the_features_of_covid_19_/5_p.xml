<p id="Par31">Skin lesions are increasingly reported features of COVID-19, and some of these are very similar to the findings of rheumatic diseases. Bouaziz et al. reported violaceous macules, livedoid rash, purpura (necrotic and non-necrotic), which are similar to skin manifestations of systemic vasculitis such as severe IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura) and PAN [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Interestingly, chill-blain-like lesions were also found in children and adolescents who were otherwise asymptomatic with regard to COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. This may well be because of the high IFN levels induced by the virus. On the other hand, one wonders whether background levels of high IFN would protect against COVID-19 in the children with autoinflammatory interferonopathies such as SAVI or Aicardi Goutières syndrome. Acro-ischemia was reported in COVID-19 patients, as well [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. These vascular lesions could be due to immune complex vasculitis or disseminated intravascular coagulation. Positive antiphospholipid antibodies may also contribute to the pathogenesis as recently reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. We need more histopathologic data to understand the exact pathogenesis of these features.
