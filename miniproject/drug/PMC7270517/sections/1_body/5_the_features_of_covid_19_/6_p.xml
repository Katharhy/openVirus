<p id="Par32">Another surprising feature of COVID-19 was the development of a Kawasaki-like disease in children. Very recently, Riphagen et al. have reported hyperinflammatory shock in eight children with similar features to atypical Kawasaki disease, Kawasaki disease shock syndrome, or toxic shock syndrome [

The initial tests for COVID-19 were negative in all. One of these children died after 6 days, and SARS-CoV-2 was detected postmortem. Another child was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after discharge. And, the authors mentioned that positive antibodies were detected afterward in seven children. The coronary arteries were severely dilated in one. C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, triglycerides, and D-dimers were elevated in all. Of note, the ferritin level was highest in the child who died (4220 ϻg/L while the range was 277–1023 ϻg/L in the rest of the series). The laboratory features observed in this clinical situation are very similar to those seen in Kawasaki disease shock syndrome. Li et al. previously demonstrated higher levels of CRP, procalcitonin, triglycerides, and D-dimers in patients with Kawasaki disease shock syndrome compared to patients with only Kawasaki disease [
