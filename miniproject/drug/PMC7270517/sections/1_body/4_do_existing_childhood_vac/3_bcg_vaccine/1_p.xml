<p id="Par24">Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is a live attenuated vaccine. It is derived from an isolate of 
 <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> and used as a vaccine for tuberculosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. The epidemiologic analyzes showed that the incidence of COVID-19 and the death rate were significantly lower in countries with BCG vaccination programs compared to those without such a program [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. It is not possible to draw reliable conclusions as of yet. However, previous studies, including randomized controlled trials, have suggested a “nonspecific protection against infections” induced by the BCG vaccine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Since Mycobacterium is a bacterium while SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, it is unlikely that a protective effect comes from cross-protection based on similar molecular structures. Previous studies have shown two possible mechanisms that explain the nonspecific protection provided by the BCG vaccine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]: heterologous immunity and trained immunity. Heterologous immunity means that CD4 and CD8 memory cells (produced by the BCG vaccine in this situation) could be activated in an antigen-independent manner [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. This activation could be caused by cytokine stimulation by a secondary infection. It is known that the BCG vaccine induces histone modifications and epigenetic changes in human monocytes at the promoter sites of genes encoding for proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. This causes a more active innate immune response after re-stimulation (trained immunity) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], which may contribute to the effective clearance of the virus in case of COVID-19. Arts et al. have recently shown that BCG vaccination reduced the level of viremia after yellow fever vaccination, and this effect was correlated with the induction of cytokine response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Another possible pathway may be through the activation of the IFN-gamma pathway. Two studies (NCT04328441, NCT04327206) are underway to test the nonspecific protective effect of BCG vaccine in COVID-19.
