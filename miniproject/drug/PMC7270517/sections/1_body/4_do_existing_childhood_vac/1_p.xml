<p id="Par22">COVID-19 seems to affect different countries with varying severity. Several epidemiological and observational studies are performed, and the results show that differences in childhood vaccination policies may partially describe the difference in COVID-19 severity. However, nearly all of these articles are non-peer reviewed, and the results were derived from indirect analyzes of epidemiologic data. Thus, these studies are vulnerable to selection bias, and uncontrolled confounding factors might have significantly deviated the results. Some of these confounding factors are population age, ethnicity, testing rates for COVID-19 infection, the stage of the pandemic in each country, income levels, and major policy decisions (such as quarantine and providing self-protecting equipment like masks). Another limiting factor is that it is not possible to dissect the effect of one specific vaccine such as BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) with these kinds of studies since the associations may also be caused by another vaccine mediating the protective effect. Thus, the results of these observational and epidemiologic studies should be evaluated with caution considering all the mentioned points.</p>
