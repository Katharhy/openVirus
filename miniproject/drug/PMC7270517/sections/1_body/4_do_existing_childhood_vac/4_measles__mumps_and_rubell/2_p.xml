<p id="Par26">It will take time for researchers to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19. Thus, it is wise to analyze the cross-resistance from other vaccines that are already being used. However, these studies should be designed carefully to control confounding factors. Considering all available data, it is too early to conclude on a protective effect from any vaccine at the moment. Another point is that it is not possible to predict how fast the immune system will develop a response that will protect against COVID-19 (if this exists) after another vaccine such as BCG or MMR vaccines. At the moment, childhood vaccinations should be applied according to the routine vaccination schedules of each country. The recommendations about new vaccination plans could arise with accumulating evidence on cross-protectiveness of other vaccines for COVID-19.</p>
