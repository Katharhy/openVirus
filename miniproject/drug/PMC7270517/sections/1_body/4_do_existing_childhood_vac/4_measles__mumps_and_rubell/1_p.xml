<p id="Par25">Indirect epidemiologic analyses also suggest a protective role for the MMR vaccine against COVID-19 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Shanker et al. hypothesized that age-related decline in immunogenicity of the measles vaccine could be an explanation for COVID-19 being mainly an adult disease if the measles vaccine provides cross-resistance to COVID-19 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. They reported that there was 29% amino acid sequence homology existing between macro-domains of SARS-CoV-2 and rubella virus and 20% homology between fusion protein of measles virus and spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. This report is the only evidence supporting these data; however, this is a not-peer reviewed article, and it remains unknown whether this resemblance is enough to cause a cross-reactive immune defense.
