<p id="Par71">COVID-19 pandemic has a high mortality rate and a poorer outcome, particularly in elderly patients and individuals with comorbidities. There are very limited data about the infection rate and disease course in patients with rheumatic diseases and almost no data regarding pediatric rheumatology patients. We should continue the medicines that control the disease activity in pediatric rheumatology patients since uncontrolled disease and high disease activity place patients to a higher risk group with regard to infections. Having said that one needs to decide on treatment on an individual basis, considering personal risk factors. It is critical not to reach early conclusions about the prophylactic effects of the drugs we currently use in pediatric rheumatology practice. And although the disease mostly has a mild course in children, children are not immune to COVID-19, and different clinical manifestations such as Kawasaki-like disease are being related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We should use the accumulating current scientific evidence and common sense while making decisions about the treatment of our patients and follow the primary prevention principles such as hand hygiene and social distancing.</p>
