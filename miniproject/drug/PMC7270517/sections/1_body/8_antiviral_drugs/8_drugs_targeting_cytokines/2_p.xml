<p id="Par55">Zhou et al. observed that IL-6 levels were higher in deceased COVID-19 patients than the survivors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Other studies also reported elevation of IL-6 levels in patients with severe COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">139</xref>]. Tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody) use was associated with significant clinical improvement in several observational studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">140</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">142</xref>]; however, there were no matched controls treated without tocilizumab in these studies. In their retrospective case–control study (20 patients treated with tocilizumab versus 25 patients treated without tocilizumab), Klopfenstein et al. reported that death and/or intensive care unit admissions were higher among patients treated without tocilizumab than those treated with tocilizumab (72% versus 25%, respectively) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">143</xref>]. Sciascia et al. performed a pilot, prospective single-arm study (
 <italic>n</italic> = 100), and they reported an improvement in respiratory and laboratory parameters with tocilizumab treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>]. Moreover, there are a few case reports on the successful use of tocilizumab in the treatment of severe childhood COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">145</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">146</xref>]. Based on these data, anti-IL-6 treatment is currently the most studied drug in the treatment of COVID-19-associated cytokine storm (NCT04322773, NCT04317092, NCT04320615, NCT04306705, NCT04324073, NCT04315298, ChiCTR2000029765, ChiCTR2000030796).
