They compared the outcome between 16 patients who were on only standard treatment (HCQ and lopinavir/ritonavir) in addition to mechanic ventilation and 29 patients who were taking high-dose intravenous (IV) anakinra in addition to the standard treatment and mechanic ventilation. Both overall survival and mechanic ventilation-free survival were more frequent in the high-dose anakinra group than the standard treatment group (90% versus 56% and 72% versus 56%, respectively). There are ongoing trials of anakinra in COVID-19 that will probably provide a higher level of evidence for the efficacy of this treatment (NCT04324021, NCT04330638). Anti-IL-1 treatment has indeed been suggested by some pediatric rheumatologists to be the first-line treatment [
