<p id="Par51">HCQ is also associated with certain side-effects. Retinal toxicity is not a significant concern since it is mainly associated with its long-term use [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>]. However, HCQ use has previously been associated with QT interval prolongation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>]. Besides, azithromycin, which has been used in combination with HCQ in COVID-19 treatment, is also a drug that can cause QT prolongation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>]. Thus, these drugs should be used with caution in the treatment of COVID-19. Of note, Saleh et al. reported that they did not observe 
 <italic>torsade de pointes</italic> or arrhythmogenic death in their large cohort of COVID-19 patients treated with CQ (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10) or HCQ (
 <italic>n</italic> = 191) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>]. But they mentioned that QTc interval was significantly longer in the combination group (CQ/HCQ + azithromycin) compared to the monotherapy group (CQ/HCQ only).
