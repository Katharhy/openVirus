<p id="Par48">Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an antimalarial agent, is the mainstay of treatment, especially in SLE [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>]. Being a weak base, HCQ accumulates in acidic environments such as lysosomes and endosomes. And, by increasing the pH in endosomes, HCQ interferes with TLRâ€“virus interaction [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>]. As a result, it may prevent viral entry and subsequent stimulation of proinflammatory pathways. Considering these mechanisms, it appeared as a candidate for both prophylaxis and treatment in COVID-19. To assess its prophylactic use, Shah et al. systematically reviewed the literature and determined five studies (three in-vitro studies and two clinical opinions) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>]. Unfortunately, it is not possible to conclude on a prophylactic effect of HCQ based on these data. In the same lines, Gendelman et al. did not observe a protective effect of chronic HCQ use in their retrospective study, including 1317 COVID-19 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Thus, there is no enough evidence supporting prophylactic use of HCQ, and further studies with a randomized controlled design are required.
