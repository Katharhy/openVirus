 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>]. In their retrospective cohort study including 46 COVID-19 patients, Wang et al. observed that early, low-dose, and short-term application of methylprednisolone was associated with better clinical outcomes while they did not show any significant difference with regard to mortality rate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>]. However, it is not possible to conclude on a positive effect since the data are scarce. At the moment, WHO recommends against routine glucocorticoid use in COVID-19 treatment. Randomized controlled trials planned to analyze the effectiveness/safety of glucocorticoid therapy in COVID-19 patients (ChiCTR2000029386, NCT042273321, NCT042244591) will provide better evidence and may enlighten the role of glucocorticoids in COVID-19.
