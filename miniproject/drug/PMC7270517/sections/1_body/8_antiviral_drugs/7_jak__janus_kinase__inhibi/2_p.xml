<p id="Par53">IFNs act through JAK/STAT pathway to increase the expression of IFN response genes, and type I IFNs are the primary defense against viral infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>]. JAK inhibitors interfere with antiviral immune response, and increased risk of herpes zoster and simplex infections were previously reported with JAK inhibitor use [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>]. Since the effective containment and clearance of the virus depends on an effective and abrupt type I IFN response, initiation of JAK inhibitors at the early phase of COVID-19 could interfere with the immune defense. Thus, the jury is out for the benefit of these drugs in COVID-19.
