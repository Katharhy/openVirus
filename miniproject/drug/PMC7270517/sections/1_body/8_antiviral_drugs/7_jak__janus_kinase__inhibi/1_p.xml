<p id="Par52">JAK (janus kinase) inhibitors are not used in pediatric rheumatology patients as extensively as they are used in adult rheumatology. But these drugs are currently used in the treatment of JIA and autoinflammatory interferonopathies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>]. JAK inhibitors have been suggested to interfere with viral entry by inhibiting AAK1, which is a key regulator of SARS-CoV-2 endocytosis (detailed above) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. They may also be beneficial by inhibiting the proinflammatory effects of IFNs in the exaggerated immune response phase. Baricitinib is a selective JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>], emerging as a potential treatment option in COVID-19. JAK inhibitors may be beneficial at the severe end of the spectrum, where IFN response contributes to the cytokine storm. Cameron et al. demonstrated a prominent IFN-α and IFN-γ signaling in deceased SARS patients compared to a low IFN-α/γ signaling in patients discharged from hospital [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the window of opportunity at the early phase is very narrow and difficult to determine since the patient will be asymptomatic at this phase, and the viral entry will be shortly followed with a strong IFN response which is critical for viral clearance.
