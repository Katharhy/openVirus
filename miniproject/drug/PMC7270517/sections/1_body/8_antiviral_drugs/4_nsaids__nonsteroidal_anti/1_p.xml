 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. Previous studies have also suggested an association between NSAID use and higher rates of complications after respiratory tract infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>]. Currently it is not possible to draw solid, evidence-based conclusion on NSAID use over all.
