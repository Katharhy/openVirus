  <p>Schematic representation of the entry of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into host cell, its viral lifecycle and potential drug targets. The above-mentioned figure depicts the viral processing of SARS-CoV-2 within host cells. S protein has a major role in binding of the virus to the host receptor cells. It attaches itself to the ACE2 receptor of the human host cell, leading to the release of the viral RNA into the host cell which triggers a cascade that ultimately results in respiratory infection. Select repurposed drugs and their target sites of action are also represented in this schematic. ACE2: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; S protein: spike protein; TMPRSS2: type 2 
   <italic>trans</italic>-membrane serine protease and IL-6: interleukin 6.
