<p id="p0140">Vaccination is the best bet for COVID-19 control. DNA plasmids, epitopes, mRNA, and artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) are some of the biotechnological platforms on which the hunt for a global vaccine is based 
 <xref rid="b0415" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>. Currently, there are no FDA-approved vaccines for COVID-19. There is limited information on the specific antigens used in the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Most candidate vaccines are aimed at inducing neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike (S) protein, which prevents its uptake via the ACE2 receptor. 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> provides an overview of the global landscape of COVID-19 vaccine development activity for active clinical trials 
 <xref rid="b0420" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>. The chain of events from conception to market availability of a vaccine usually takes over ten years, and has a mere 6% probability of successful market entry 
 <xref rid="b0425" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>. If a commercially-available SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were to be made available for use in 12–18 months, assuming its path from the lab to the market is unhindered, it would represent a seismic change from the traditional vaccine development pathway. This would require a multipronged strategy involving novel vaccine development paradigms, flexible development phases, ramping up existing manufacturing capacity, unprecedented scale and speed of global R&amp;D, and radical changes in regulatory processes. It will also require careful evaluation of safety and efficacy every step of the way.
