<p id="p0030">Despite being relatively more benign than its two ancestors, SARS-CoV-2 has crossed the 15 million cases mark worldwide, aided in part by inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation. However, the overriding reasons for its exponential growth are the high reproductive ratio (R
 <sub>0</sub>) – ranging from 2 to 6.47 
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, the long incubation period of 2 to 14 days (median 5 days) and a Serial Interval (SI) of 5–7.5 days 
 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, which are indicative of an infectious disease that has the potential of rapidly turning into a pandemic. Sanche et al. recently suggested that the disease had a median R
 <sub>0</sub> of 5.7 (95% CI of 3.8–8.9) and SI of 6–9 days in China during the initial period of the outbreak

 <sub>0</sub> of SARS was 2 and 1.3 for the 2009 H1N1 Influenza
