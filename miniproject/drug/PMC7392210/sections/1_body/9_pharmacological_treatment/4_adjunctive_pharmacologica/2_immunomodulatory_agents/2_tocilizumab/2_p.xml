<p id="p0090">Tocilizumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that inhibits IL-6 receptors and is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and the “cytokine storm” immune overresponse in cancer patients. IL-6 is implicated in immunologic response in patients with Cytokine-release syndromes (CRS). Elevated levels of IL-6 have been associated with hyperinflammatory states and CRS in severe COVID-19 cases and can potentially lead to increased rates of mortality

Sixety two registered trials are currently testing the safety and efficacy of Tocilizumab on COVID-19 patients. A recent study reported that Tocilizumab improved survival, as well as clinical markers in patients with CRS
