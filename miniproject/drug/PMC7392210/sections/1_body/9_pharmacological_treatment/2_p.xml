<p id="p0050">In the months since the novel coronavirus burst onto the scene, drug makers small and large have scrambled to put their best foot forward in an attempt to thwart the pandemic. Some are taking cues from older antivirals, while others are aiming to develop novel therapeutic agents to treat COVID-19. Vaccine development, convalescent plasma therapy, cell-based therapies and monoclonal antibodies are some of the potential approaches being targeted by researchers worldwide. However, drug development is an expensive and time-consuming endeavor with a high attrition rate 
 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The enormity of the current global health emergency means that time is of the essence. Thus, there has been considerable interest in repurposing existing drugs and expediting the development of vaccines, to allow rapid identification of suitable drug candidates. The dearth of proven clinical data on therapeutic agents for COVID-19 has led to a reliance on existing therapies for other viruses such as SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and HIV etc. It is unclear whether the data from repurposed antiviral drugs can be extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2, as unlike antibiotics, antivirals are specific for a particular virus in most cases. 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> lists some of the potential therapeutic agents that have been used as repurposed drugs for COVID-19 treatment. Their sites and mechanisms of action against SARS-CoV-2 are illustrated in
