<p id="p0045">SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells through its Spike (S) protein- a type I surface glycoprotein, and binds to the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor 
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. ACE2 is a type 1 transmembrane aminopeptidase expressed in the heart and lungs. It negatively regulates the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) and plays a significant role in neurohumoral regulation of the cardiovascular system. When SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, it alters the ACE2 signaling pathways, potentially causing acute myocardial and lung injury 
 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. ACE2 receptors are abundantly distributed in the epithelia of the lung- especially the alveolar Type II (ATII) cells. Once the virus binds to the receptor, it spreads widely on entering the blood circulation. 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> shows a schematic representation of the viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 inside a host ATII cell. ACE2 receptors are also said to be present in the liver, digestive organs and kidneys. These tissues and organs could thus be potential targets for SARS-CoV-2 invasion 
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. This explains why many patients with COVID-19 present with extra-pulmonary symptoms 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. When the over activated immune system is engaged in killing the virus, there is a sharp spike in the production of inflammatory factors, such as IL-2, IL-6, GCSF, MCP-1, TNFÎ±, etc. This, in turn, may pave the way for a cytokine storm 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and eventually lead to ARDS, secondary infections and multi-organ damage, resulting in death.
