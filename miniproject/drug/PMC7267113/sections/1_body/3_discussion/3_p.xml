 </xref> In this systematic review of CPT to the COVID‐19 patients, we identified and critically evaluated five studies that described about 27 patients. All studies reported good outcomes after CPT performance, but all were considered to have risk of bias owing to a combination of non‐randomized evaluations, confounding, predictor description and poor methodological conduct for participant selection, dosage of CPT, and duration of therapy. This heterogeneity did not permit us to perform a meta‐analysis. However, the important strength of this study is a comprehensive search of published clinical study data abstraction. Our review is the first to summarize all such literature in humans with COVID‐19.
