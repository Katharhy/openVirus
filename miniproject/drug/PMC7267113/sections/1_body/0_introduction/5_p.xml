<p>Passive immunization therapy has been successfully used to treat infectious diseases back to the 1890s. An individual who is sick with infectious diseases and recovers has blood drawn and screened for particular microorganism neutralizing antibodies. Following identification of those with high titers of neutralizing antibody, convalescent plasma containing these neutralizing antibodies can be administered in individuals with specified clinical disease to reduce symptoms and mortality. Hence, convalescent plasma transfusion (CPT) has been the subject of increasing attention, especially in the wake of large‐scale epidemics.
