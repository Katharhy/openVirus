<p>A pre‐conceived data extraction sheet was used to extract data from selected eligible studies. Any consensus in case of disagreement was resolved by opinion of a third reviewer. The extracted information included mortality, viral load, viral antibody titers, clinical benefits, and adverse events. Outcomes were extracted in all data forms (eg, dichotomous and continuous) as reported in the included studies. The results of our databases search were documented and described in a PRISMA flow diagram (Figure
