<p>Given the fragile health systems in most sub‐Saharan African countries, new and re‐emerging disease outbreaks such as the current COVID‐19 epidemic can potentially paralyse health systems at the expense of primary healthcare requirements. The impact of the Ebola epidemic on the economy and healthcare structures is still felt five years later in those countries which were affected. Effective outbreak responses and preparedness during emergencies of such magnitude are challenging across African and other lower‐middle‐income countries. Such situations can partly only be mitigated by supporting existing regional and sub‐Saharan African health structures.</p>
