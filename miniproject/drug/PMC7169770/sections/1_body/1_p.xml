<p>Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive single‐stranded large RNA viruses that infect humans, but also a wide range of animals. Coronaviruses were first described in 1966 by Tyrell and Bynoe, who cultivated the viruses from patients with common colds 
 <xref rid="tmi13383-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>. Based on their morphology as spherical virions with a core shell and surface projections resembling a solar corona, they were termed coronaviruses (Latin: corona = crown). Four subfamilies, namely alpha‐, beta‐, gamma‐ and delta‐coronaviruses exist. While alpha‐ and beta‐coronaviruses apparently originate from mammals, in particular from bats, gamma‐ and delta‐viruses originate from pigs and birds. The genome size varies between 26 kb and 32 kb. Among the seven subtypes of coronaviruses that can infect humans, the beta‐coronaviruses may cause severe disease and fatalities, whereas alpha‐coronaviruses cause asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections. SARS‐CoV‐2 belongs to the B lineage of the beta‐coronaviruses and is closely related to the SARS‐CoV virus

The major four structural genes encode the nucleocapsid protein (N), the spike protein (S), a small membrane protein (SM) and the membrane glycoprotein (M) with an additional membrane glycoprotein (HE) occurring in the HCoV‐OC43 and HKU1 beta‐coronaviruses
