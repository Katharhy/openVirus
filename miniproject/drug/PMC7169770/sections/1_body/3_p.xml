<p>The initial clinical sign of the SARS‐CoV‐2‐related disease COVID‐19 which allowed case detection was pneumonia. More recent reports also describe gastrointestinal symptoms and asymptomatic infections, especially among young children 
 <xref rid="tmi13383-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>. Observations so far suggest a mean incubation period of five days 
 <xref rid="tmi13383-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> and a median incubation period of 3 days (range: 0–24 days) 
 <xref rid="tmi13383-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>. The proportion of individuals infected by SARS‐CoV‐2 who remain asymptomatic throughout the course of infection has not yet been definitely assessed. In symptomatic patients, the clinical manifestations of the disease usually start after less than a week, consisting of fever, cough, nasal congestion, fatigue and other signs of upper respiratory tract infections. The infection can progress to severe disease with dyspnoea and severe chest symptoms corresponding to pneumonia in approximately 75% of patients, as seen by computed tomography on admission 
 <xref rid="tmi13383-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>. Pneumonia mostly occurs in the second or third week of a symptomatic infection. Prominent signs of viral pneumonia include decreased oxygen saturation, blood gas deviations, changes visible through chest X‐rays and other imaging techniques, with ground glass abnormalities, patchy consolidation, alveolar exudates and interlobular involvement, eventually indicating deterioration. Lymphopenia appears to be common, and inflammatory markers (C‐reactive protein and proinflammatory cytokines) are elevated.
