<p>Like other viruses, SARS‐CoV‐2 infects lung alveolar epithelial cells using receptor‐mediated endocytosis via the angiotensin‐converting enzyme II (ACE2) as an entry receptor

Further possibilities include leronlimab, a humanised monoclonal antibody (CCR5 antagonist), and galidesivir, a nucleoside RNA polymerase inhibitor, both of which have shown survival benefits in several deadly virus infections and are being considered as potential treatment candidates 
 <xref rid="tmi13383-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>. Repurposing these available drugs for immediate use in treatment in SARS‐CoV‐2 infections could improve the currently available clinical management. Clinical trials presently registered at ClinicalTrials.gov focus on the efficacy of remdesivir, immunoglobulins, arbidol hydrochloride combined with interferon atomisation, ASC09F+Oseltamivir, ritonavir plus oseltamivir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, mesenchymal stem cell treatment, darunavir plus cobicistat, hydroxychloroquine, methylprednisolone and washed microbiota transplantation
