 <italic>Servizio Sanitario Nazionale</italic> ) to counteract COVID-19 crisis will have to become largely ordinary after the emergency if a new, future situation of health crisis is to be tackled with greater serenity and appropriate tools.

 <italic>etc</italic> ), to create new health models and to implement health-related policies.
