 </sup> Hospital teams, local and national authorities are constantly working to face the dramatic consequences of COVID-19 outbreak and to fix specific issues about Emergency Department overcrowding, bed resources and available health care professionals, and the need for patient transfer to other specialized facilities. Recent literature, statistical data and rates of the disease morbidity and mortality suggest that the viral spread is still expected to grow and many new cases would occur, possibly in the hundreds of thousands of people; the preparedness of public health systems will be challenged worldwide.

 </sup> As the outbreak of COVID-19 progresses, epidemiological data are needed to guide situational awareness and intervention strategies. Current goals are to ensure that adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) will be available, not only to health personnel but also to the whole population at risk of contagion, to minimize the risk of further infections and deaths; and to understand more clearly how this novel coronavirus can be controlled by drugs and an effective vaccine. However, this is not only a health issue, but it also gives rise to a lot of socio-economic consequences, widely modifying our lifestyles and policy, with long-term consequences; at the end of this period the whole world will probably be very different.
