<p id="par0065">Respiratory support includes oxygen therapy; high-flow nasal catheter oxygen therapy or noninvasive mechanical ventilation; invasive mechanical ventilation; and salvage therapy. Salvage therapy is recommended for patients with severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Prone position ventilation should be performed for more than 12 h per day if there are adequate human resources. If conditions permit, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) should be considered as soon as possible.</p>
