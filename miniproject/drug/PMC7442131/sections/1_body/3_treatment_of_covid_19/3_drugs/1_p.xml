<p id="par0080">Recently, based on the experiences of China and other countries worldwide in the fight against COVID-19, the WHO summarized and launched the four most promising COVID-19 treatment regimens: (1) remdesivir (2) chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine (3) lopinavir + ritonavir (4) lopinavir + ritonavir + interferon. The four treatment regimens will be widely and randomly tested in a number of countries and regions, and we hope to find an effective and safe treatment for COVID-19 as soon as possible.</p>
