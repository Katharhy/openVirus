<p>Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a severe, often fatal, illness in humans and non-human primates caused by a highly virulent RNA virus. It is transmitted mainly through contact with blood or body fluids of a person/animal that has contracted or died from the disease. Transmission through contaminated objects such as needles and with infected animals or bushmeat has been reported.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> EVD was first recognised when two large outbreaks occurred in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 1976.
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Thereafter, EVD outbreaks have been reported in 1994 and 1995 in Uganda and the DRC, respectively.
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Frequent large outbreaks have since been reported from Gabon, DRC, Uganda, Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 5â€“7</xref> Isolated EVD outbreaks have been reported in South Africa, USA, UK and Italy.
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> There has been an increase in EVD outbreaks in Africa, probably because of increased contact of humans with wildlife due to extensive deforestation, hunting and mining,
