<p>EVD is caused by an RNA 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> of the family Filoviridae. So far, five species of the genus 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> have been identified. They include 
 <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic> (ZEBOV), 
 <italic>Bundibugyo ebolavirus</italic> (BEBOV), 
 <italic>Sudan ebolavirus</italic> (SEBOV), 
 <italic>Reston ebolavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Côte d'Ivoire ebolavirus</italic>. Most of the outbreaks in Africa were associated with ZEBOV, SEBOV and BEBOV.
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Ebolaviruses are found in central and western African rainforests, approximately within 10° north and south of the equator.
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> African tropical rainforests, for example, the Western Congo swamp forests and the Minkebé forest in Gabon, have been reported to constitute a common ecosystem for the emergence of 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic>, providing rich animal biodiversity.
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> EVD outbreaks are seasonal, occurring mainly during wet seasons, marked by fruit abundance.
