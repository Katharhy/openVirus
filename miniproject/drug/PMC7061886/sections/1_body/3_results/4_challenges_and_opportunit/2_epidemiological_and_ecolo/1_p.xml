<p>While the specific source of EVD in most outbreaks is not known, the pathogen is thought to be harboured in some species of bats, with initial transmission to humans via butchering or consumption of bats or other infected animal species, and then spread through human-to-human transmission.
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Ebola viruses are endemic in central and western African rainforests, approximately within 10° north and south of the equator.
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 31</xref> Consequently, the sporadic emergency and spillover of the Ebola virus are supported by and likely to be associated with some intrinsic factors related to these forest systems.
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Outbreaks of Ebola virus since 1976 have been occurring in what is described as the ‘Ebola Forest Belt’. The forest ecotypes provide habitats for diverse fauna.
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Alterations of the natural ecosystem as a result of human influences and natural ecological processes, such as land use for agricultural intensification and livestock grazing purposes or rural urbanisation, have increased proximity between human population and wildlife, leading to enhanced contacts with Ebola virus-carrying natural hosts.
