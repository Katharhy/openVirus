<p>Since no specific therapy for 2019-nCOV is at-hand and considering public health priority, an immediate and effectual vaccine/drug is a crucial requisite. Gilead Sciences, Inc., United States (US), has started the first clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of Remdesivir, an adenosine analog which can cause pre-mature RNA termination of the nascent viral RNA.

However, Remdesivir has been accounted for to treat the first case of 2019-nCOV in the US effectively (Holshue et al.,
