<p>Multiple sequence alignment of the retrieved M
 <sup>pro</sup> sequences was performed, and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using Mega-X (Felsenstein, 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>). The evolutionary history was inferred by applying the Maximum Likelihood method and the JTT matrix-based model. It is found that the tree is having the highest log-likelihood of 3.186 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure. 1</xref>) with selected seven M
 <sup>pro</sup> sequences. The construction of initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by enforcing with Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms, and JTT model used for estimating matrix of pairwise distances to select the topology with superior log likelihood value. The constructed phylogeny tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site of sequence. The proportion of each sites in which at least one unambiguous base was present, in at least one sequence for each descendent clade, was shown next to each internal node in the tree. For interim datasets preparation, a total of 7444 pair-wise positions were constituted with seven M
 <sup>pro</sup> sequences for phylogeny analysis. The resultant trees were evaluated by 500 bootstrap replicates (Felsenstein, 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>).
