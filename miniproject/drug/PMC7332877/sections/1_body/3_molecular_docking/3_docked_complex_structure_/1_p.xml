<p>The conformational stability nature of docked (M
 <sup>pro</sup> – Remdesivir) and native (M
 <sup>pro</sup> – N3 peptide) complex system was entrenched with HoH, volume (V), temperature (T) and pressure (P) observed by MD simulation of 100
 <bold> </bold>ns (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref>). The docked and native complexes are depicted the average of total energy (−132446.36 and −99501.23
 <bold> </bold>kcal/mol), potential energy (−162734.98 and −121628.90
 <bold> </bold>kcal/mol) of the system was relatively stable with the average temperature (298.65
 <bold> </bold>kelvin), pressure (1.88
 <bold> </bold>bar), and volume (502884.87 and 362278.77
 <bold> </bold>Å³) throughout the simulations run (

 <sup>pro</sup> Cα – Remdesivir complex had an average of 1.48
 <bold> </bold>Å and 1.86
 <bold> </bold>Å respectively. The average RMSD for native M
 <sup>pro</sup> Cα – N3 peptide complex was 1.65
 <bold> </bold>Å and 19.09
 <bold> </bold>Å respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6A</xref>). By contrast, native N3 peptide had largest average RMSD score with native M
 <sup>pro</sup> and docked complex was not stable significantly throughout the MD simulation run (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6A</xref>). The RMSF plot for the M
 <sup>pro</sup> docked and native Cα and side-chain showed an average of 0.88
 <bold> </bold>Å, 1.39
 <bold> </bold>Å, 0.94
 <bold> </bold>Å and 1.44
 <bold> </bold>Å respectively, which denotes the lower atomic fluctuations in binding residues indicating smaller conformational changes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6B</xref>). The total energy, potential energy, RMSD and RMSF analysis revealed that the 2019-nCoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> – Remdesivir docking complex was highly stable during the entire 100
 <bold> </bold>ns MD simulations.
