<p>Third, superimposition has 0.095Å RMSD with ∼100% of conserved binding site residues of docked complex of 6LU7–N3 and co-crystal stricture of 2A5K–AZA was observed each other (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3B</xref>). Further, validation of M
 <sup>pro</sup> binding pocket, we obtained 84 co-crystal protein sequence of 2019-nCoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> from the PDB (till 4 May

The results revealed that, binding site residues are 100% conserved amongst the geographically distributed M
 <sup>pro</sup> protein sequences of 2019-nCoV.
