<p>For the sequence YP_009725295, BLASTp analysis was performed to find the 3
 <bold> </bold>D structure of the reference 2019-nCoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> against the protein data bank (PDB). The co-crystal structure of 2019-nCoV (PDB ID: 6LU7) with an N3 peptide inhibitor (n-[(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl) carbonyl] alanyl-l-valyl-

 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>) by performing pairwise sequence alignment with a 6LU7 amino acid sequence. The active-site residues of the 6LU7 M
 <sup>pro</sup> complex with N3 were visualized by using PyMOL.
