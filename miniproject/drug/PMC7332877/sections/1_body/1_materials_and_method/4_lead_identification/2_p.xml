<p>In this scenario, sequence and structure analysis was performed for 2019-nCoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> through BLAST, results revealed that M
 <sup>pro</sup> nucleotide sequence has ∼99% identity and ∼40% of query coverage with SARS-CoV. As mentioned in the introduction section, Remdesivir, Chloroquine, Favipiravir, Baloxavir Marboxil, Ribavirin, Penciclovir, Nafamostat, Nitazoxanide, Oseltamivir and Zanamivir ae chosen for the molecular docking analysis and the same inhibitors retrieved from the PubChem database.
