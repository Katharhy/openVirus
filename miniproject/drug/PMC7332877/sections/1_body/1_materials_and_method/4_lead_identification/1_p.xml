<p>So far, there is no particular antibody and medications against 2019-nCoV. Specialists are presently taking a shot at various antiviral drugs, immunotherapies, and immunizations that are being researched to discover the potential treatment for 2019-nCoV. As of now, countless FDA approved antiviral agents are in use for the treatment of 2019-nCoV viral infection. However, numerous examples exist in which the utilization of a second antiviral agent would be advantageous because it would permit the choice of either option or a combination therapeutic approach. As 2019-nCoV infections have risen, the focus on encoded proteases to discover potent antiviral medications are in progress. Recent molecular studies have demonstrated that viral proteaseâ€™s existence pattern depends upon numerous infections by affecting the cleavage/catalyzing process of viral polyprotein antecedents (which are high molecular weight)/essential proteins important for assembly and morphogenesis of virus particles. Most of the chosen protease inhibitors are utilized principally for the treatment of Herpesvirus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Respiratory Syncytial Infection and flu A viruses, and can also be used for the treatment of 2019-nCoV.</p>
