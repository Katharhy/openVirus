<p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out using the Desmond 2018-4 simulations module of Schrödinger LLC. To simulate the outmost docked complex and native co-crystal with N3 peptide, a simple point charge (SPC) of the HOH molecule model was accounted. Alongside, orthorhombic periodic boundary box (X, Y, and Z-axis) conditions were set up to specify the shape and size of the complex unit buffered at 10
 <bold> </bold>Å distances. The docked complex was neutralized with the system electrically, by adding appropriate counter NA
 <sup>+</sup>/Cl
 <sup>−</sup> ions to balance the system charge and were placed randomly in the solvated system. After building the solvated system, protein-ligand complex minimization and relaxation were performed under the constant Number of atoms, Pressure, Temperature (NPT) ensemble using Desmond’s minimization &amp; relaxation protocol that consists of nine stages (Vilar et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The Stage 1: Perceive the initial simulation setup parameters, Stage 2: Minimization with restraints on the solute, Stage 3: Minimization without any restraints, Stage 4: Simulate with Berendsen NVT,
