<p>Genome sequence comparison is essential to analyses the evolutionary relationship of viral genomes. With the swift growth of sequence and structure databanks, 
 <italic>in silico</italic> approaches usually enforced to ascertain the functions and structures of unannotated sequences, and to explore the relationships between sequences. In this study, we retrieved seven M
 <sup>pro</sup> FASTA sequence of coronaviruses (1) 229E: AGW80947 (2) NL63: AGT51371 (3) OC43: ATP16753 (4) HKU1: P0C6U4 (5) MERS-CoV: AUM60013 (6) SARS-CoV: AAY88865 and (7) 2019-nCoV: YP_009725295 from NCBI Viral genome database to discover the evolutionary relationship by phylogenetic tree construction was using MEGA X tool (Felsenstein,
