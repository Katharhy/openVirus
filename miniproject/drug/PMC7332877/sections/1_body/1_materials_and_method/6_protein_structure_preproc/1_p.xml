<p>Three-dimensional structure of 2019-nCoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> with N3 peptide (PDB ID: 6LU7) was obtained from the protein data bank (PDB) (Jin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) for molecular docking analysis. A fully automated docking software tool, AutoDock 4.2, which is most widely used to study the receptor-ligand binding and interactions, was used for the docking of selected inhibitors with 2019-nCoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> structure. The receptor and ligand files were denoted in PDBQT file format, a modified PDB format containing atomic charges, atom type definitions for ligands, and topological information (rotatable bonds). Receptor molecule was initially fixed by adding polar hydrogen, Kollman charges (Azam &amp; Abbasi, 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Morris et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Selected inhibitor molecules were added with Gasteiger charges (Sliwoski et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Autodock 4.2 allows setting a specific target site with the help of a grid box. The X, Y, and Z dimensions were set to 40*40*40, the X center, Y center, and Z center with a grid spacing of 1
 <bold> </bold>Å, keeping the receptor rigid and the ligand as a flexible molecule was adjusted by N3 peptide-binding site of the 6LU7 (Jin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The output for each inhibitor’s conformations was analyzed using a stochastic Lamarckian genetic algorithm (Morris et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). After characterizing the coupling site and receptor-ligand readiness, docking runs were propelled from the command prompt. The molecular interactions, the energy between every ligand and the receptor, was determined for the binding site, which expressed as affinity (kcal/mol) and favourable conformations. The 3
 <bold> </bold>D visualization of docked structures was performed using a graphical user interface, Maestro Schrodinger

 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Munikumar et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Umamaheswari et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Further, molecular dynamics simulations were performed with outmost docked complex and co-crystal structure (native) for the stability was close to biologically relevant characteristics.
