<p>Because SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell bound to ACE2, which induces ACE2 deficiency at the cell membrane, AngII is persistently activated. Increased AngII induces activation of AT1R, causing more uptake of SARS-CoV-2 and increasing ACE2 deficiency, thus maintaining and exacerbating a non-specific immune response, consisting of cytokine-induced inflammation. This non-specific immune response is an attempt to reduce the viral load, while the specific immune response is mounted. Unrestrained AngII eventually causes death by respiratory distress induced by excessive inflammation and its deleterious effects on other organs. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2-induced mortality is promoted by three mechanisms: (i) increased AngII induces endocytosis of ACE2-bound SARS-CoV-2, leading to ACE2 deficiency and viral replication; (ii) ACE2 deficiency prevents the priming of an adaptive immune response by lack of NO; and (iii) Ang II induces an increase in viral load leading to an increased innate immune response and a further increase in AngII levels. Therefore, treatments should aim at preventing the AngII ‘storm’ in an early phase of the infection, restoring the modulation of NO, and preventing the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell. All these mechanisms are targeted by AT1R antagonists. They may reduce morbid inflammatory distress and provide an environment to facilitate an effective, virus-specific adaptive immune response.</p>
