<p>AngII, as part of the RAS system, plays an important role in body fluid homeostasis and inflammatory responses. AngII has proinflammatory, proliferative, and profibrotic functions that are beneficial during infection and hypoxia but are deleterious if present in a healthy person or in the case of prolonged activation during disease.

 </xref> During pulmonary infection, AngII induces pulmonary vasoconstriction and vascular permeability, which reduces hypoxia and facilitates extravasation of cytokines to the site of inflammation, respectively. This inflammatory response, if exacerbated, causes oedema and respiratory distress.
