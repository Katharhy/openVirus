 </xref> ACE2 thus regulates and antagonizes AngII actions, while AngII simultaneously decreases the expression of membrane-bound ACE2. Although much is known about this homeostatic-type interaction, steering towards a healthy equilibrium, rather than an exacerbation of inflammation, a complete description of the regulatory mechanisms is still lacking.
