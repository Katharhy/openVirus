<p>Research on the hypothesis that AT1R antagonists are suitable treatment options for COVID-19 should consist of randomized controlled clinical trials, investigating the effect of an AT1R antagonist compared with usual care or placebo. Considering the proposed disease mechanism in which increasing AngII levels induce increased viral uptake, we believe that the treatment will be most effective when started within 5 days of infection. Treatment with AT1R antagonists can be easily implemented in the elderly, since they are a cheap and safe option, because of their widespread use. Once the decision is made not to admit a patient to hospital or to give treatment with mechanical ventilation, there are no other treatment options for this group of patients. Secondly, clinical data specifically concerning AT1R antagonists compared with other antihypertensive medication should be investigated with regard to their relationship with the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. A recent article by Zhang 
 <italic>et al</italic>. showed that among 1128 hypertensive individuals admitted to hospital because of SARS-CoV-2 infection, individuals using either ACEIs or an AT1R antagonist were less prone to have severe disease.

 </xref> Currently 11 randomized controlled trials with AT1R antagonists are registered. Most studies will include hospitalized patients and only two studies will include non-hospitalized patients. Most studies use modest to low dose short-acting AT1R antagonists and only three studies use higher doses of AT1R antagonists. One study is paerticularly designed for the elderly, ≥65 years of age (
