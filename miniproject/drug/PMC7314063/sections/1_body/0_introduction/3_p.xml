<p>There is much discussion about the role of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some authors claim that the use of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) is detrimental to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

 </xref> This is due to the observation that among the more severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a larger number of individuals had hypertension and diabetes.

 </xref> A recent report in the 
 <italic>Journal of Travel Medicine</italic> suggests the same, namely that ACEIs and ARBs might actually both increase the risk of a COVID infection, since they both increase ACE2 levels.

 </xref> This is based on the descriptive analysis of 1099 patients, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections, from Wuhan China, that found more severe disease outcomes in patients with hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and chronic renal disease. This suggested that, since all the patients with such a diagnosis have an indication for treatment with ACEIs or ARBs, the increased risk of these groups is due to these treatments. This, however, assumes that increased levels of ACE2 are associated with increased viral uptake. Considering the fact that ACE2 acts outside the cell and was found only to enter the cell via AT1R-induced endocytosis, after which ACE2 is destroyed,

 </xref> the extracellular expression of ACE2 may very well be inversely related to viral uptake. Also, Danser 
 <italic>et al</italic>. explain that there are no data to support the notion that ACEIs or ARBs facilitate coronavirus entry by increasing ACE2 expression, either in animal experimental or in human research.

 </xref> On the contrary, animal data even support that elevated ACE2 expression, as observed in patients treated with an ARB, might confer potential protective pulmonary and cardiovascular effects.
