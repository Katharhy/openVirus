  <p>Translational perspective</p>
  <p>We hypothesize that the immune system facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell, while the virus is bound to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This causes extracellular ACE2 deficiency, which disrupts immune regulatory mechanisms. Since angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) appears to facilitate entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell and also aggravates the disrupting mechanism of angiotensin II (AngII), AT1R antagonists seem to be the ideal candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. AT1R antagonists counterbalance the negative consequences of AngII and may prevent cellular uptake of the virus without interfering with ACE2 function. AT1R antagonists are widely available, cheap, and safe. Therefore, we propose to consider using AT1R antagonists in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
