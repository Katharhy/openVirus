<p>AngII is endogenously produced in T cells, where it plays an important role in T-cell activation and migration to the site of action.

 </xref> In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, priming of virus-specific T cells was found to be reduced, restricting the number of T cells that recognize the coronaviruses.

 </xref> Lower T-cell priming causes a delayed virus-specific immune response. In such a situation, AngII activation maintains the non-specific, innate immune reaction, prolonging the period during which the virus can enter the cell and replicate and during which ACE2 is destroyed.
