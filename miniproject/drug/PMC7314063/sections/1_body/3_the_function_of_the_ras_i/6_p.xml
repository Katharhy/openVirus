<p>Unfortunately, SARS-CoV, and most probably also SARS-CoV-2, induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), in particular superoxide, which serves a function in cellular stress signalling.

 </xref> which in turn induces the endocytosis of membrane-bound ACE2, aggravating the inflammatory response. Therefore, it is suggested that, during active SARS-CoV-2 infection, AT1R-mediated ACE2 destruction plays a deleterious role, promoting both viral uptake and AngII-induced inflammation. Destruction of NO by superoxide radicals further induces the AngII-mediated deterioration, leading to lung injury and lung oedema.
