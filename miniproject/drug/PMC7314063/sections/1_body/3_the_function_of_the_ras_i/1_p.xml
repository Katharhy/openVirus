<p>Upon infection by a previously unencountered virus, the initial immune response from the host is innate and non-specific. The adaptive, virus-specific response occurs much later. This non-specific response includes AngII activation.

 </xref> Active AngII inhibits the production of nitric oxide (NO), which results in a marked inflammatory reaction.
