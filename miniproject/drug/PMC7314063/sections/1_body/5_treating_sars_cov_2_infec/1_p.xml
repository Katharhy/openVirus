<p>Following the above, SARS-CoV-2 infection by binding to ACE2 disrupts the normal AngII:ACE2 balance, leading to an excessive inflammatory reaction, which may ultimately lead to the ‘cytokine storm’ seen in some patients. It has indeed been reported that AT1R antagonists inhibit the activation of NF-κB and AP-1 in the lung, which mediate the release of cytokines and contribute to acute lung injury.

 </xref> Since the most important mechanism leading to pathology is the uncontrolled AngII activity, leading to increased activation of AT1R which appears to be involved in viral uptake, treatment actions should be aimed at preventing or inhibiting this. AT1R antagonists are therefore the ideal candidates.

 </xref> AT1R antagonists are expected to decrease AngII activity and reduce AT1R-induced uptake of ACE2-bound SARS-CoV-2 while preserving ACE2 functions.
