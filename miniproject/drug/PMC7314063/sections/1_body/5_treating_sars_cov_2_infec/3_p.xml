<p>Postulating that the above hypothesis is correct, it may be expected that treatment with AT1R inhibitors (ARBs) might limit viral uptake and preserve ACE2 functions. On the other hand, the expected treatment effect will probably depend on the phase of the disease in which the treatment is initiated. In the early phase, it might be expected that treatment with an AT1R antagonist may completely prevent the excessive inflammation related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, by restoring ACE2 function and thereby preventing viral load accumulation. On the other hand, when the disease reaches the ‘point of no return’, when viral replication has exhausted cellular metabolites and the inflammatory response has caused too much damage, AT1R antagonists may not be able to prevent further deterioration.</p>
