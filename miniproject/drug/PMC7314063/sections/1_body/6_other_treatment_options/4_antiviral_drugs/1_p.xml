<p>Antiviral drugs may disrupt the viral life cycle at different stages. Some disrupt the synthesis of viral proteins and nucleic acids. Other antiviral drugs inhibit virus assembly, budding, or maturation. A separate class prevents entry into the cell.

 </xref> In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the only antiviral drugs that are being used in the treatment of the infection are the class that prevents viral replication inside the cell after the SARS-CoV-2â€“ACE2 complex has been endocytosed. To our knowledge, no antiviral drugs exist that decrease viral load without interfering with ACE2.
