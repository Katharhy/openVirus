<p>The antiviral mechanism by which chloroquine exerts its action is by disruption of the glycosylation of ACE2 and by disruption of endosome recycling by increasing the pH of the cell.

 </xref> Due to disruption of ACE2 glycosylation, the binding of the virus to ACE2 will be impeded. Vincent 
 <italic>et al</italic>. found that chloroquine was effective in preventing or diminishing viral uptake shortly after infection, by preventing SARS-CoV-2 from binding to ACE2.

 </xref> However, because glycosylation of enzymes is generally essential for their functions, we may fear that ACE2 is no longer functional after treatment with chloroquine. As soon as the host is infected, chloroquine might prevent replication. Wang 
 <italic>et al</italic>. showed that SARS-CoV remained in the endosome, bound to its receptor, for at least 14 h, where the virus is unable to replicate.

 </xref> This raises the possibility that the virus can escape from the endosome at a later stage, starting its delayed replication after the patient is assumed to be cured.

 </xref> Therefore, it might be postulated that chloroquine appears to be unsuitable for the treatment of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas it could play a modest role in its prevention. However, concerns arise regarding the possible disruption of the AngIIâ€“ACE2 equilibrium, due to the gycosylation on ACE2. Therefore, research on chloroquine as a preventive treatment option should be inititated before it can be introduced and indeed several chloroquine prevention trials in healthcare personnel have already been started.
