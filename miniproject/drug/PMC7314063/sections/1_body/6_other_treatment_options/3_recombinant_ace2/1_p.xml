<p>Since ACE2 exerts such beneficial actions, it is tempting to assume that SARS-CoV-2 can bind to the excess of exogenous ACE2, thereby preventing it from entering the cell. Recombinant ACE2 has been developed and tested in phase I and phase II trials, and was found to be safe.

 </xref> Recombinant ACE2 has the capacity to convert AngII into Ang(1-7). It remains to be seen if overexpression of ACE2 disrupts the tissue-specific AngII:Ang(1-7) equilibrium, which would impair tissues in responding to hypoxia, damage, or infection by increasing AngII.
