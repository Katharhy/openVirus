  <p>Hypothesis of the mechanism of replication of SARS-CoV-2 and treatment aims to prevent virus replication and initiating activation of the adaptive immune response. During inflammation and in the absence of NO, AngII activates the AT1R. AT1R induces cellular uptake of ACE2-bound SARS-CoV-2. Inhibition of AT1R inhibits viral uptake and facilitates AT2R-induced ACE2 expression and subsequent activation of the adaptive immune response.</p>
