<p>For acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, the recommended goal is to provide supplemental oxygen aiming for oxygen saturation (SpO
 <sub>2</sub>) 90-96% [
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Oxygen supplementation could be increased to considerably safer limits of 6 L/min through a nasal cannula and 10 L/min through a non-rebreathing mask. If conventional oxygen therapy fails, high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is preferable to non-invasive ventilation (NIV) due to an increased risk of aerosolization with NIV. Early intubation is preferred, but the approach is controversial. During intubation, bag-valve-mask ventilation should be avoided, and the two-person technique is preferred [
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Overall, the decision to initiate NIV, HFNC or intubation, should be made by balancing the risks and benefits to the patient, the risk of exposure to healthcare workers, and best use of local resources; this approach should be reassessed as new research data and resources become available. In a systematic review of 10 retrospective cohort studies which evaluated transmission of SARS-CoV to healthcare workers, endotracheal intubation had the highest risk (odds ratio (OR): 6.6; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.3 - 18.9), followed by non-invasive ventilation (OR: 3.1; 95% CI: 1.4 - 6.8), tracheostomy (OR: 4.2; 95% CI: 1.5 - 11.5), and bag-mask ventilation [
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In general, indications for intubation include clinically worsening respiratory distress, rapidly progressive disease, SpO
 <sub>2</sub> less than 90% despite maximal supplemental oxygen, acidosis with pH less than 7.3, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO
 <sub>2</sub>) more than 50 mm Hg, multi-organ failure and hemodynamic instability.
