<p>Viral infection causes inflammatory cytokine release and thereby edema in various vascular beds, usually subpleural in the early stages and alveolar edema in later stages [
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Vascular endothelial damage in COVID-19 disrupts pulmonary vascular autoregulation in response to hypoxia and contributes to ventilation-perfusion (VQ) mismatch [
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, inflammation of the alveolar lining, as well as decreased fluid clearance, leads to alveolar collapse and edema. The respiratory mechanics, pathology, and clinical features change with disease progression in COVID-19. With the worsening of the disease process, alveolar edema leads to increased right heart pressure, which in turn causes more tissue hypoxia and multi-organ failure [
