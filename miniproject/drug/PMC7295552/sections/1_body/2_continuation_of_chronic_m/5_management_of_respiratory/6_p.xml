<p>In general, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used in patients with refractory cardiac and respiratory failure in whom usually the venous blood is removed from the body and pumped through an artificial membrane lung, and is essentially a modified cardiopulmonary bypass. This oxygenation is needed for circulatory support and organ function. The role of ECMO in COVID-19 is unclear but may be used in patients with refractory hypoxemic respiratory failure. Venovenous ECMO has been used as a last resort for patients that have failed all other means; however, the mortality of COVID-19 patients who lands up on ECMO is extremely high and &gt; 90% in one analysis [
