<p>Concern has been raised regarding potential hepatotoxicity from statins in COVID-19 patients who commonly demonstrate elevated transaminase levels. However, most evidence indicates that liver injury from statins is uncommon. On the other hand, statins are known inhibitors of the myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) pathway, which results in marked inflammation, and have been reported to stabilize MYD88 levels in the setting of external stress
