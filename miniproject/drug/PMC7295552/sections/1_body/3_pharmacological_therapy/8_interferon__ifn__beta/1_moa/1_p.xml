<p>IFN-beta is a subtype of type I IFN secreted by many cell types, mostly by plasmacytoid dendritic cells upon recognition of viral components by pattern recognition receptors (PRR). IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) are involved in inflammation and immunomodulation. ISGs interfere with viral replication and viral spread through different pathways like cytokine secretion or slowdown of cell metabolism [
