<p>Multiple pharmacotherapies have been tried on an experimental basis on COVID-19 patients across the globe. Some studies claimed faster clearance of virus from the patient, and some demonstrated decreased mortality. No large randomized scale-controlled trial has settled the argument of the true effectiveness of any medicine against COVID-19. In this section, we will briefly present the proposed mechanism of action of individual medications that have been most commonly tried and trialed in recent times against COVID-19, and also discuss possible 
 <italic>pros and cons</italic> of experimental use of such medications in these vulnerable patients. We have also provided an updated list of ongoing trials of most major medications that are being investigated as a possible effective pharmacological therapy against COVID-19 as a supplement to this article (
