<p>Elevated levels of the inflammatory marker, including IL-6, were found in the blood of COVID-19 patients, and were reported to have a bad prognosis in patients. IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine and binds to both soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and membrane-bound IL-6R (mIL-6R). The resulting complex activates an inflammatory response through interaction with transducing component glycoprotein 130 (gp130), which can result in a cytokine storm [
