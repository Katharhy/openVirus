<p>The utilization of blood purification therapy in the form of plasma adsorption or therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has been proven in the setting of sepsis [

 <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], but the same has not been adequately proven in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Knowledge of optimum management of critically ill COVID-19 patients in the late phase is quite limited. The presence of cytokine storm or pathogenic antibodies in critically ill COVID-19 patients has a strong correlation with the disease severities. Monitoring inflammation and antibodies is significant, especially in patients infected by the virus with persistent fever or abnormal coagulopathy. Expeditious control of the cytokine storm utilizing plasma adsorption or TPE might be beneficial to selective patients with COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. These therapies are well tolerated if performed with the close guidance of specialists, and risks of infection or bleeding are minimized. So far, randomized trial data are not available regarding this in COVID-19, but such clinical trials should be done to utilize blood purification therapy to appropriate patients.
