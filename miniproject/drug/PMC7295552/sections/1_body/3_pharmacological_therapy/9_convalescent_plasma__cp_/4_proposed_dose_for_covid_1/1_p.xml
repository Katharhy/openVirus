<p>Even though there is no compelling evidence from large scale randomized trials, the FDA has begun allowing CP to be used in patients with severe or immediately life-threatening COVID-19 infections starting March 24, 2020. The treatment with CP is considered experimental. It is important to note that effective formulations such as a convalescent plasma or H-Ig or immunoglobulins, is still unknown. A person who has tested positive for COVID-19 and recovered with no symptoms for 14 days could be a potential donor in the presence of high enough antibody levels in the plasma and negative for possible infections such as HIV, hepatitis C, etc. The donor and the recipient should have compatible blood groups.</p>
