<p>The lopinavir component binds to the site of viral protease activity and inhibits the cleavage of viral Gag-Pol polyprotein precursors into individual functional proteins required for infectious human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This results in the formation of immature, noninfectious viral particles. The ritonavir component inhibits the cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) metabolism of lopinavir, allowing increased plasma levels of lopinavir.</p>
