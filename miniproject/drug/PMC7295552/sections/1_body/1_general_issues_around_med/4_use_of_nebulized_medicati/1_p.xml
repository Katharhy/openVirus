<p>Inhaled medications should be administered by metered-dose inhaler and not through a nebulizer. This is to avoid the risk of aerosolization and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. If nebulized therapy must be used, patients should be in an airborne infection isolation room (preferably negative pressure room), and any healthcare worker who needs to be in that room should use the contact and airborne precautions with appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) including N95 mask with goggles and face shield or equivalent. It is also recommended not to re-enter the room for 2 -3 h following nebulizer treatment for risk of aerosolized transmission of the virus.</p>
