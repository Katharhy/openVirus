<p>Some anecdotal reports suggested association of NSAID use early during COVID-19 and progression to severe disease in young adults [
 <xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, there has been no population-based research showing the direct relationship of NSAID use and severe COVID-19. WHO and the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel do not recommend NSAIDs being avoided when clinically indicated [
 <xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Acetaminophen should be used as the preferred antipyretic agent for fever associated with COVID-19; NSAID, if used, should be administered in the lowest effective dose; this approach is consistent with an established general approach to fever reduction in adults. It is also not recommended to discontinue NSAIDs in patients who are on them chronically for other conditions, unless there are clinical rationale to stop them (e.g., acute renal injury, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding).
