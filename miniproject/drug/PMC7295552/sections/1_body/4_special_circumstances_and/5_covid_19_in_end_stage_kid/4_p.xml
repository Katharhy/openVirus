<p>The AKI incidence in COVID-19 ranged from 3-15% on literature review, and the incidence has significantly increased from 15% to 50% in severe infection, often needing intensive care unit (ICU) admission and renal replacement therapy (RRT). AKI is an independent risk factor for mortality in COVID-19 patients. AKI is a prominent complication in critically ill COVID-19 patients. It may warrant specific strategic management plans, including the variation of RRT modalities (e.g., continuous RRT, prolonged intermittent RRT, conventional HD) to optimize the appropriate use of limited dialysis resources [

The pandemic is still evolving, and we expect that the morbidity and mortality may be much different in different geographical areas, which will partly depend on the patient population, health care availability, and protocols followed in those places. Much larger studies with robust data will help us understand the impact of COVID-19 on ESKD patients receiving dialysis and help reduce mortality.
