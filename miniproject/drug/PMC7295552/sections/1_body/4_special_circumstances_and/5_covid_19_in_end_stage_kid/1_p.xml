<p>ESKD patients likely are at significant risk of COVID-19 infection due to suppression of the immune system, and may have poorer outcomes from COVID-19 for the conglomeration of risk factors in individual patients. Patients treated in outpatient dialysis centers present a challenge as the risks of transmission to the medical staff, and other patients are high due to treatment in the same confined space. If infected, the intensity of dialysis requiring specialized resources poses a significant burden to the patients and the medical community. Hence, preventive measures are most critical to reduce the incidence of infection in this vulnerable population. Strict protocols have been placed to minimize the spread of this highly contagious COVID-19 as it is well-known from previous epidemics that the mortality is much higher in dialysis patients compared with the general population.</p>
