<p>As we await more clinical studies and concrete data, immunosuppressed patients should continue to follow basic personal prevention procedures (e.g., social distancing, hand hygiene, and face mask use). At the same time, the clinicians should advocate against the discontinuation of chronic immunosuppressive agents by patients. Such disruption of therapy could lead to an increased risk of relapses and morbidity from chronic rheumatological conditions.</p>
