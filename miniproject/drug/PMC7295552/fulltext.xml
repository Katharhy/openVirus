The disease was first officially reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread globally since then, leading to the current COVID-19 pandemic. As of June 1, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that a total of 1,787,680 people were COVID-19 positive in the USA, and there were totally 104,396 individuals lost their lives to COVID-19 so far [<xref rid="R01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. On a global scale, as of the same date, the World Health Organization (WHO) published statistics of 6,057,853 infected patients and 371,166 deaths [<xref rid="R02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The symptoms of infected people with this novel coronavirus can range from being asymptomatic or minimal respiratory symptoms to febrile illness, as well as severe respiratory failure needing ventilator support. Despite reported observational data about the experimental use of certain drugs, there is no proven curative therapy for COVID-19 as of now; however, remdesivir received emergency use authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently for use in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Most interventions and guidelines for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic are related to prevention, isolation, and supportive treatment strategies. There are several ongoing clinical trials related to the pharmacological choices of therapy for COVID-19 patients; however, drug trials related to observational studies so far have yielded mixed results and therefore have created a sense of confusion among healthcare professionals (HCPs). In this review article, we seek to collate and provide a summary of treatment strategies for COVID-19 patients with a variable degree of illness, and discuss pharmacologic and other therapies intended to be used either as experimental medicine/therapy or as part of supportive care in complicated cases of COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>General Issues Around Medical Management of COVID-19</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)</title><p>Some anecdotal reports suggested association of NSAID use early during COVID-19 and progression to severe disease in young adults [<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, there has been no population-based research showing the direct relationship of NSAID use and severe COVID-19. WHO and the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel do not recommend NSAIDs being avoided when clinically indicated [<xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Acetaminophen should be used as the preferred antipyretic agent for fever associated with COVID-19; NSAID, if used, should be administered in the lowest effective dose; this approach is consistent with an established general approach to fever reduction in adults. It is also not recommended to discontinue NSAIDs in patients who are on them chronically for other conditions, unless there are clinical rationale to stop them (e.g., acute renal injury, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Role of glucocorticoids</title><p>In the past, glucocorticoids have been associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with influenza and delayed viral clearance in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Although they were widely used in the management of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was no good evidence for benefit, and there was persuasive evidence of adverse short- and long-term harm [<xref rid="R05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, CDC recommended against the use of systemic glucocorticoids in patients with COVID-19, unless there are other indications such as asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease exacerbation, refractory septic shock, and adrenal insufficiency. However, their administration in critically ill patients with COVID-19-related adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is controversial. Based on data suggesting the potential benefit of glucocorticoids in patients with all-cause ARDS, the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) provided a conditional, weak recommendation in favor of glucocorticoids in patients with COVID-19 who have severe ARDS. If clinicians choose to administer glucocorticoids, the SCCM suggests that they should begin within the first 14 days, doses should be low, and courses should be short (e.g., intravenous (IV) dexamethasone 20 mg once daily for 5 days, then 10 mg once daily for 5 days). Data from retrospective Chinese cohort [<xref rid="R06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] regarding this topic were not without flaws, and hence large-scale prospective data will be required to settle this dilemma.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis</title><p>Patients with COVID-19 may carry an increased risk for systemic thrombosis. This is suggested by published case reports of pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19, and several cohorts reported to have elevated D-dimer levels and other markers of dysregulated coagulation [<xref rid="R07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Moreover, many patients hospitalized with COVID-19 have a higher risk of thromboembolism anyways because of advanced age and existing comorbidities. Additionally, markers of dysregulated coagulation and evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) have been seen to be associated with more severe disease and death in patients with COVID-19 [<xref rid="R07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, the impact of anticoagulation (prophylactic or therapeutic) on the outcome of COVID-19 remains unknown. As with all hospitalized patients, pharmacologic prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism is recommended even in COVID-19 patients, typically using low-molecular-weight heparin, unless there are clinical contraindications such as active bleeding or severe thrombocytopenia.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Use of nebulized medications</title><p>Inhaled medications should be administered by metered-dose inhaler and not through a nebulizer. This is to avoid the risk of aerosolization and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. If nebulized therapy must be used, patients should be in an airborne infection isolation room (preferably negative pressure room), and any healthcare worker who needs to be in that room should use the contact and airborne precautions with appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) including N95 mask with goggles and face shield or equivalent. It is also recommended not to re-enter the room for 2 -3 h following nebulizer treatment for risk of aerosolized transmission of the virus.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Empiric use of antibiotics for superimposed bacterial pneumonia</title><p>Clinical features of COVID-19 are challenging to distinguish from bacterial pneumonia. Empiric treatment for bacterial pneumonia may also be reasonable in patients with documented COVID-19 if there is clinical suspicion. Empiric antibiotic therapy, if initiated, should be guided by microbial diagnosis (e.g., sputum Gram stain and culture) and reevaluate the need to continue antibiotic therapy daily. A low procalcitonin level usually is helpful to suggest against bacterial pneumonia; however, elevated procalcitonin has been described in the late stage of COVID-19 and does not necessarily indicate bacterial pneumonia [<xref rid="R08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Continuation of Chronic Medical Therapy: Some Special Circumstances</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)</title><p>It was suspected that COVID-19 patients who are receiving these agents might be at increased risk for adverse outcomes, but there is no clinical evidence that supports such speculation. Conversely, ARBs were proposed to have potential protective effects based on their mechanism of action [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but there is no conclusive evidence to support this hypothesis. Multiple experts and guidelines recommended that patients who are already on ACEI or ARB should continue treatment with these agents if there is no other reason for discontinuation (e.g., hypotension, acute kidney injury (AKI)) [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Statins</title><p>Concern has been raised regarding potential hepatotoxicity from statins in COVID-19 patients who commonly demonstrate elevated transaminase levels. However, most evidence indicates that liver injury from statins is uncommon. On the other hand, statins are known inhibitors of the myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) pathway, which results in marked inflammation, and have been reported to stabilize MYD88 levels in the setting of external stress <italic>in vitro</italic> and animal studies. Dysregulation of MYD88 has been noted and associated with poor outcomes in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, but this has not been described with SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Immunomodulatory agents</title><p>Initiation of immunosuppressive agents has been associated with increased risk for severe disease with respiratory viruses. However, no evidence routinely discontinuing treatment is of any benefit. Therefore, the plan to discontinue prednisone, biologics, or other immunosuppressive drugs in the setting of COVID-19 must be determined on a case-by-case basis. COVID-19-negative patients with underlying conditions requiring treatment with these agents should not be taken off suddenly, as discontinuing of these medications may result in loss of response when the agent is reintroduced. Statements from different medical societies support the approach of continuing immunomodulatory therapy in patients without infection [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Symptomatic management</title><p>Fever is the most common symptom and was noted in 88.7% of the COVID-19 patients in a study in China [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Acetaminophen is the recommended antipyretic in COVID-19. It can also be used in headache and myalgias. NSAIDs could be used, at the lowest effective dose, as an alternative antipyretic or pain reliever despite some report of NSAID use and worsening of COVID-19 severity [<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Aspirin causes Reye syndrome, and should be avoided in children. Cough (often dry cough) is another prominent and common symptom of COVID-19. Cough medications may contain antihistamines and decongestants, and so must be used with caution. It is recommended that metered-dose inhalers are used, and nebulizers are avoided as much as possible due to the increased risk of aerosolization and the spread of the virus [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Hypotension and shock are potential complications of COVID-19. Vasopressors are preferred to aggressive fluid resuscitation in patients with shock to avoid volume overload due to concern for the development of ARDS in these patients [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The use of empiric antibiotics and glucocorticoid therapy is controversial and has been discussed earlier in this article.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Management of respiratory failure</title><p>Viral infection causes inflammatory cytokine release and thereby edema in various vascular beds, usually subpleural in the early stages and alveolar edema in later stages [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Vascular endothelial damage in COVID-19 disrupts pulmonary vascular autoregulation in response to hypoxia and contributes to ventilation-perfusion (VQ) mismatch [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, inflammation of the alveolar lining, as well as decreased fluid clearance, leads to alveolar collapse and edema. The respiratory mechanics, pathology, and clinical features change with disease progression in COVID-19. With the worsening of the disease process, alveolar edema leads to increased right heart pressure, which in turn causes more tissue hypoxia and multi-organ failure [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Gattinoni et al conceptualized two distinct phenotypes: the &#x0201c;L&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;H&#x0201d; types (later stages/ARDS) at the ends of the clinical spectrum with possible intermediate cases with overlapping features [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The &#x0201c;L&#x0201d; type is seen early on with low elastance/high compliance, low lung weight, low VQ mismatch, and low recruitability. The lungs at this stage are compliant, can hold a good amount of air, are not affected by much edema; VQ ratio is due to defects in vasoregulation and perfusion, and since most of the lung is already aerated, there is not much scope for recruitability [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These patients have mild dyspnea, limited ground glass infiltrates on computed tomography (CT) scans, and they can withstand the distress. The &#x0201c;H&#x0201d; type is found later in the COVID-19 disease process with more resemblance to ARDS. It is the exact opposite of the &#x0201c;L&#x0201d; type with high elastance/low compliance, high lung weight, high VQ mismatch, and high recruitability [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These explain the resemblance to ARDS (non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, shunting, and decreased lung size for gas exchange). These patients are symptomatic and with extensive infiltrates on CT suggestive of alveolar edema, and increased risk of ending up on the ventilator support device. Based on these concepts, respiratory support in COVID-19 should focus on optimizing oxygenation, reducing pulmonary and vascular stress, preventing edema and lung injury, and recruitment of functional lung units [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>For acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, the recommended goal is to provide supplemental oxygen aiming for oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) 90-96% [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Oxygen supplementation could be increased to considerably safer limits of 6 L/min through a nasal cannula and 10 L/min through a non-rebreathing mask. If conventional oxygen therapy fails, high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is preferable to non-invasive ventilation (NIV) due to an increased risk of aerosolization with NIV. Early intubation is preferred, but the approach is controversial. During intubation, bag-valve-mask ventilation should be avoided, and the two-person technique is preferred [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Overall, the decision to initiate NIV, HFNC or intubation, should be made by balancing the risks and benefits to the patient, the risk of exposure to healthcare workers, and best use of local resources; this approach should be reassessed as new research data and resources become available. In a systematic review of 10 retrospective cohort studies which evaluated transmission of SARS-CoV to healthcare workers, endotracheal intubation had the highest risk (odds ratio (OR): 6.6; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.3 - 18.9), followed by non-invasive ventilation (OR: 3.1; 95% CI: 1.4 - 6.8), tracheostomy (OR: 4.2; 95% CI: 1.5 - 11.5), and bag-mask ventilation [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In general, indications for intubation include clinically worsening respiratory distress, rapidly progressive disease, SpO<sub>2</sub> less than 90% despite maximal supplemental oxygen, acidosis with pH less than 7.3, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) more than 50 mm Hg, multi-organ failure and hemodynamic instability.</p><p>The general guideline to initial ventilator settings includes the assist control (AC) mode with a tidal volume 4 - 8 mL/kg ideal predicted body weight; respiratory rate 25 - 30 breaths/min; positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) 10 - 15 cm H<sub>2</sub>O; target SpO<sub>2</sub> 90-96%; plateau pressure less than 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. The L type patients tolerate lower PEEP (&#x0003c; 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) and higher tidal volume (7 - 9 mL/kg). In these patients, higher PEEP redirects blood flow and creates dead space, while higher tidal volumes for hypercapnia are well tolerated due to high compliance. The H type patients, with low lung compliance, need higher PEEP (&#x0003c; 15 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) and lower tidal volumes (5 - 7 mL/kg) [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Prone positioning is an option when patients on ventilators have worsening oxygenation with mechanical ventilation (e.g., PaO<sub>2</sub>/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) less than 150 mm Hg for 12 h). Patients must be maintained in a prone position for 12 - 16 h a day [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Contraindications to prone positioning include shock, active bleeding, recent tracheal surgery, multiple fractures, and spine instability [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Recruitment maneuvers, high PEEP strategies, and trial of inhaled pulmonary vasodilators are probable options for patients that failed prone positioning [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Neuromuscular blockade can be employed for patients with refractory hypoxemia on ventilator dyssynchrony (intermittent boluses are preferred unless persistent dyssynchrony) [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>In general, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used in patients with refractory cardiac and respiratory failure in whom usually the venous blood is removed from the body and pumped through an artificial membrane lung, and is essentially a modified cardiopulmonary bypass. This oxygenation is needed for circulatory support and organ function. The role of ECMO in COVID-19 is unclear but may be used in patients with refractory hypoxemic respiratory failure. Venovenous ECMO has been used as a last resort for patients that have failed all other means; however, the mortality of COVID-19 patients who lands up on ECMO is extremely high and &#x0003e; 90% in one analysis [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Pharmacological Therapy</title><p>Multiple pharmacotherapies have been tried on an experimental basis on COVID-19 patients across the globe. Some studies claimed faster clearance of virus from the patient, and some demonstrated decreased mortality. No large randomized scale-controlled trial has settled the argument of the true effectiveness of any medicine against COVID-19. In this section, we will briefly present the proposed mechanism of action of individual medications that have been most commonly tried and trialed in recent times against COVID-19, and also discuss possible <italic>pros and cons</italic> of experimental use of such medications in these vulnerable patients. We have also provided an updated list of ongoing trials of most major medications that are being investigated as a possible effective pharmacological therapy against COVID-19 as a supplement to this article (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Material 1</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jocmr.org">www.jocmr.org</ext-link>).</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine and azithromycin</title><sec id="s4a1"><title>Mechanism of action (MOA)</title><p>Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine block entry of the virus into human cells by proteolytic processing, inhibiting glycosylation of host receptors, and acidification inside endosomes. These agents may have immunomodulatory effects through blockage of autophagy and lysosomal activity in host cells, along with dissipating cytokine production and inhibition.</p><p>Azithromycin is an antibacterial macrolide and works through binding to 50s ribosomal subunit and inhibition of messenger RNA directed polypeptide synthesis. Antiviral mechanism of macrolides is scarce and was hypothesized to inhibit respiratory syncytial virus through the reduced expression of fusion protein receptor, activated isoform A of the Ras homologous (Rho) family, and the inhibition of subsequent Rho-kinase activation in human airway epithelial cells [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Azithromycin was shown to inhibit replication in Zika and Ebola viruses [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4a2"><title>Pros and cons</title><p>Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are relatively well tolerated and has been used for ages in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and malaria. However, both agents can cause serious adverse effects (&#x0003c; 10%), like hypoglycemia, retinopathy, psychiatric effects, QTc prolongation. Azithromycin is a commonly used macrolide for respiratory bacterial infections. Gautret et al concluded that combination therapy with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine cured 100% of patients virologically on day 6 compared to 57.1% in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine only, and 12.5% in the control group (P = 0.001) [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, the risk of QT prolongation from these two drugs should be considered, and caution should be taken, especially in cardiac patients, while administering this combination [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Moreover, a study among 368 USA veterans found no benefit, rather touted hydroxychloroquine to be more harmful due to its side effect profile [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4a3"><title>Proposed dose for COVID-19</title><p>Hydroxychloroquine dose most used is 400 mg twice daily orally for two doses, then 400 mg daily orally for a total of 5 days.

These patients had very low CD3, CD4, and CD8 cell counts indirectly support the need to decrease doses of immunosuppressive agents in patients with COVID-19, especially in those who have recently received antithymocyte globulin, which decreases all T-cell subsets for many weeks. The study reported extremely high early mortality, 28% at 3 weeks as compared with the usual 2-5% mortality in the general population.

The patient is in the active intervention group, and the control group had viral clearance at an average of 7 days and 12 days, respectively. The combination of medications was well tolerated, with no severe side effects [<xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>].</p><p>An effective vaccine is the only true remedy for this pandemic, but the manufacturing of such a vaccine may well take at least 12 to 18 months to develop. In the meantime, there is always the concern that the virus may mutate. This means we must prepare ourselves to sustain without a vaccine or effective treatment for months.</p><p>It is hard to estimate the costs of management and pharmacotherapy for COVID-19 as the cost significantly varies from country to country, including hospital management as well as the cost of the drugs. As per the article from Forbes, the recently approved remdesivir, it could cost up to $4,500 for a course of treatment, which could still be cost-effective as per the institute of clinical and economic review. The manufacturers of therapeutics of COVID-19 might adopt a different pricing model, including some companies on a not-for-profit basis [<xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. A review by Hill et al [<xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] estimated minimum costs of production from the active pharmaceutical ingredient&#x02019;s costs. Remdesivir, which is approved for EUA by FDA costs $0.93/day. Other drugs under a further investigation like favipiravir costs $1.45/day, hydroxychloroquine $0.08/day, azithromycin $0.10/day, lopinavir/ritonavir $0.39/day. If the repurposed drugs demonstrate efficacy agonist COVID-19, as per the above, they could be manufactured at lower costs [<xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>].</p><p>The authors of this article have decided to dedicate this section to delve into ways how we can safely go back to so-called normal life, which may look vastly different from pre-COVID times. WHO has proposed a Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP) on the phased transition from widespread transmission to a low level or no transmission and practical guidance on how to effectively manage broader social, humanitarian, and economic impacts of COVID-19 [<xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>].</p><p>These measures can be divided into the following broad categories:</p><sec id="s6a"><title>Slowing down the transmission of disease and providing care for severely sick ones</title><p>This is to ensure the appropriate utilization of limited healthcare resources and to avoid overwhelming the global healthcare infrastructures.</p></sec><sec id="s6b"><title>Ramping up testing for infection and antibody testing to assess the level of viral prevalence and immunity</title><p>So, resources can be allocated to high-risk areas. Availability of fast, reliable point of care testing capability would be able to identify and avoid transmission of this virus even by asymptomatic carriers. For example, currently, all routine surgical procedures are postponed across the US healthcare systems. However, the availability of such testing capacity may be implemented to screen the patients and surgical team preoperative to ascertain their infection status and go ahead with even routine surgical procedures, which make the bulk of the revenues for hospitals and it is extremely important for the sustainability of any healthcare system.</p></sec><sec id="s6c"><title>Individual, community level, governmental, and private sector engagement</title><p>A massive coordination is necessary for the successful &#x0201c;reopening&#x0201d; of businesses in a way so that the public health is not put at high risk and economic activities can be improved. Prolonged inactivity of business sectors and industries will have catastrophic effects on the economy in general and will have far-reaching consequences on the earning, health, and life of people.</p><p>Many proposals have been put forth by organizations such as the American Enterprise Institute, the Center for American Progress, and Harvard University&#x02019;s Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics [<xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>, <xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The recommendations have a common theme and can be summarized as follows.</p><p>The first step is to keep the infection rates low by imposing strict social distancing measures. Meanwhile, we need to significantly ramp up testing capabilities so that when we are ready to ease restrictions, anyone who needs a test can be tested for infection as well as antibodies that would identify who are immune. Second, when it is time to relax the social distancing, people with immunity could be provided with &#x0201c;immunity passports&#x0201d; utilizing digital approval pass, and could be allowed to move freely and get back in the active workforce. People who test negative for immunity may be allowed to move freely and work; however, they will need to be tracked to make sure they are not in close contact with people with suspected or active infection. The tracking has been done by some countries using peer-to-peer tracking apps such as trace together and covidnearyou.org so that we eliminate the need for centralized data-keeping and protect privacy and civil liberties of the public.</p><p>There remain significant hurdles to the above strategy. After several weeks of strict lockdown, many states in the USA no longer has stay-at-home orders, testing capacity improved significantly but antibody testing remained scarce and its interpretation - uncertain. Negative economic, psychological and civil impacts on the population in general due to lock-down of several weeks became evident despite federal financial aid for the public and businesses in USA. There is speculation of &#x0201c;second wave&#x0201d; of pandemic with the lockdown being lifted off, as has been suggested possible from preliminary data available from South Korea and Japan with similar approach. Unfortunately, the influence of &#x0201c;lock-down fatigue&#x0201d; is undeniable and desperation of communities to get back to normal routine is palpable. There was decrease in the daily death rates due to COVID-19 in USA by end of May 2020. However, in order to continue to curb down the toll of the pandemic, we need to continue active contact tracing, isolation of positive patients, judicious use of emerging medical therapy, as appropriate. A seamless coordination of data gathering, strategy making and execution of plan is essential and teamwork between all relevant governmental agencies is of paramount importance in this testing times. Clear, consistent and unbiased guidance from trusted authorities to keep the general public well-informed and compliant is crucial, too. Ultimately, it will certainly take the effort of the people of this world to overcome the sinister grip of this pandemic on our lives, health and wellbeing.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><label>Suppl 1</label><caption><p>Summary of Multiple Clinical Trials Available All Over the World on COVID-19.</p></caption><media xlink:href="jocmr-12-329-s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>None to declare.</p></ack><sec id="s6c1a"><title>Financial Disclosure</title><p>None to declare.</p></sec><sec id="s6c1b" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>None to declare.</p></sec><sec id="s6c1c"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>SB is the first and principal author of this article.
