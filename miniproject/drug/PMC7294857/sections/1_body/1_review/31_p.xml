<p>Most of the clinical trials are currently ongoing. Most of them involved fewer patients, which makes it difficult to make valid conclusions. Only the papers that were published in the English language were selected for our review. Most of the interventions are under trial; therefore, not much data was available about their safety in this population, and thus conclusions were hard to draw and are not valid. A detailed quality appraisal of the papers was not done.</p>
