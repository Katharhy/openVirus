<p>Based on the studies reviewed, the findings on the CT scan of COVID-19 patients are ground-glass opacities, consolidation, crazy paving pattern, and air bronchogram sign. These findings are consistent with the majority of the patients, and these are the characteristic findings of COVID-19. In some patients, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion, pulmonary emphysema, and pericardial effusion are seen and are mostly in older patients and the high-risk groups. CT scan findings of COVID-19 patients are also helpful in determining the severity of disease and the stage of the disease. Also, in the areas where they have limited testing services, CT scan findings can be used as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19. There is a specific pattern in which these findings present at the initial stages of the infection, ground-glass opacities are frequently bilateral and present in the lower lobes and the periphery. They may then progress to develop consolidation and crazy paving patterns.Â Consolidation will start becoming denser, and parenchymal bands will appear, followed by a peak. In most cases, consolidation starts resolving, and the CT scan becomes normal again within two weeks. Therefore, a CT scan can be used to monitor the progression of the disease.</p>
