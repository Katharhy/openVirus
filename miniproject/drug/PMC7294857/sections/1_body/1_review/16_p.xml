<p>Radiological findings: A case review series by Lin X et al. showed that both patients had ground-glass opacities on CT scans, which later progressed to patchy consolidation of lungs. The lesions were mostly distributed along the subpleural regions in both lungs. No pleural effusion or lymphadenopathy was observed in subjects included in this study [

Another case report by Shi F et al. showed that in this subject initially, ground-glass opacities were seen on CT scan, which later on progressed to consolidation. On the 18th day, the patient had increased consolidation, and the patient showed diffuse haziness in both lungs. Other findings were bat wing appearance, crazy paving pattern, and air-bronchogram sign. The lesions involved the peripheral regions of both the lungs [

The median age of the patients was 50 years. More than 50% of the patients had bilateral multifocal lesions in their lungs distributed along the periphery. Pneumonia in these patients presented with ground-glass opacities in 72%, consolidations in 13%, crazy paving pattern in 12%, interlobular thickening in 56% and adjacent pleural thickening in 56% of patients. Twenty-three percent of the patients did not show any of these findings [
