<p>Antivirals: One of the mainstays of treatment remains antivirals in any viral infection. Among antivirals are the neuraminidase inhibitors which worked in SARS and MERS, Oseltamivir is one of those and is a widely used anti-viral. Arabi et al. found zanamivir and Panamivir to be as effective as oseltamivir in patients with influenza and H1N1 infections [

Although there is not enough evidence to support their effectiveness in this latest outbreak, the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir is found to be effective in some patients. A case report by Lim et al. showed that the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir significantly reduced the viral load in a 54-year-old patient [
