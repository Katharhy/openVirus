<p>Convalescent plasma and passive immunization: Convalescent plasma has already been in use for some diseases; it was also effective in MERS-CoV infection. Its safety and efficacy were tested by Arabi et al. and showed that it could be used as a potential treatment option in COVID-19 [

 <xref rid="REF27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].The plasma of recovered patients was used in different patients and had shown positive effects. A case review series by Shen et al. discussed five critically ill patients having COVID-19 with ARDS who were given antibody-rich convalescent plasma. They showed significant improvement in clinical status, their SOFA score improved, temperature improved, and they also were weaned off from a ventilator [

Another case study showed significant improvement in symptoms and a decrease in viremia and viral load in seven out of 10 patients without any serious side effects [
 <xref rid="REF29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Despite the positive results and considering that most of the studies had weak evidence, it can help manage patients. Still, more studies are needed to assess its potential serious side-effects like transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI).
