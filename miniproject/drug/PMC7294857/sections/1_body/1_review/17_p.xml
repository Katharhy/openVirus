<p>Uncommon findings were pleural effusion, thoracic lymphadenopathy, pulmonary emphysema, and pericardial effusion. CT scan of 52 patients was redone after six days, 19% of them showed no changes in CT scan while 4% had resolution of the disease, and 73% showed progression. 6% of the patients who didnâ€™t have any characteristic findings on a previous CT scan developed bilateral ground-glass opacities [

The chest X-ray of the two patients showed interstitial involvement, lung opacities, pleural effusion and calcification, hilar enlargement, and cardiac silhouette. Their CT findings were typical ones like ground-glass opacities with consolidation. Some uncommon findings like pleural effusion, calcifications, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and pericardial effusions were also seen [

The study included a total of 21 patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. The study showed there are four stages in the disease progression based on CT findings. Early-stage (0-4 days after the onset of initial symptoms) of the disease showed unilateral or bilateral ground-glass opacities, mostly in the lower lobes of lungs. Progressive stage (5-8 days after the onset of initial symptoms) in this stage ground-glass opacities progressed to crazy paving patterns and consolidation. Peak stage (9-13 days after the onset of initial symptoms) consolidations became denser and more prevalent, and there were residual parenchymal bands. Absorption Stage (14 or more days after the onset of initial symptoms) consolidation gradually absorbed, there was no crazy paving pattern observed, but extensive ground-glass opacities were still observed [
