<p>Immune modulator drugs: Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, the immune modulator drugs used as antimalarials, and as a DMARD in Rheumatoid Arthritis and also in autoimmune diseases like Lupus were found effective in SARS infection and so were tried in COVID-19 patients as well. They also act as a broad-spectrum antiviral drug. Several clinical trials are in progress throughout the world to assess its efficacy and safety in these patients. An in-vitro study testing the efficacy of broad-spectrum anti-virals like remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin penciclovir, and chloroquine showed that chloroquine and remdesivir were effective against COVID-19 virus in-vitro [

Another study involving 100 patients by Gao et al. also showed similar results; it showed an increased efficacy of chloroquine in preventing symptom exacerbation, preventing progression to severe pneumonia, and improving radiological findings without any serious side effects [

Chloroquine, however, is associated with some uncommon but serious side-effects like QT interval prolongation, which may be severely harmful in cardiac patients. Therefore, more clinical trials are needed to assess its safety profile in this group of patients.
