<p>The exact pathogenesis is currently unknown; however, it is suggested that it is most likely to be similar to that of SARS CoV and MERS CoV, which attach to ACE 2 enzyme on the cell surface with the help of their glycoprotein spikes. After the entry of the virus, its antigens are presented to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) via the antigen-presenting cells (APC). Then these antigens are recognized by specific cytotoxic lymphocytes that destroy the infected cells [
