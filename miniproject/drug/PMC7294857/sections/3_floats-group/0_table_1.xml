    <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A combination of anti-virals Lopinavir/Ritonavir is useful in some cases and can be used as needed. When a patient develops ARDS, A protective ventilation strategy should be used, and when it is severe, the authors recommended extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.</td>

    <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">There are no specific antiviral drugs available and no vaccines for novel coronavirus. Based on previous experience with SARS and MERS, some antivirals are being used. However, their safety is yet to be established. The mainstay of treatment still is symptomatic support.</td>

    <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">COVID-19 symptoms can be mild, and the patient may recover when the symptoms are mild but can transmit the disease. Lopinavir/Ritonavir combination reduced viral load and improved symptoms, so this combination can be used in high-risk patients. However, more clinical evidence is needed to establish its safety and efficacy.</td>
