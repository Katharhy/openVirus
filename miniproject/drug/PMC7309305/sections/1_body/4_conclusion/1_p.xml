<p>3C-like protease (3CLpro), also called the main protease, is an attractive target for the treatment of SARS-COV-2 because of its role in the viral replication cycle. The current study focused on structure based approaches repurposed anti-HIV drugs and Screened Traditional Chinese Medicines databases against the active site residues of 3CLPro. Initial analysis such as molecular docking scores and interactions with important residues shortlisted one drug (Saquinavir) from anti-HIV drugs while five compounds from TCM database.These compounds were then subjected to molecular dynamics simulation and post-simulation analysis. Among the six complexes subjected to molecular dynamics simulation Saquinavir, TCM5280805 showed the highest hydrogen bond occupancy. The rest were also found to have good activity against the 3CLPro. In addition, the bioactivity of these compounds were predicted which reported Saquinavir as strong potential inhibitor followed by the others.Binding Free energy calculations of all the complexes suggested that these compounds significantly interacting and binds with the receptor. Thus, here from all the analyses, we suggest that Saquinavir and TCM5280805 should be tested experimentally for possible treatment of SARS-COV-2.</p>
