<p>In this study, based on the results of bioinformatics analysis, we targeted 3CLpro from SARS-COV-2 using drugs repurposing (anti-HIV drugs) virtual drugs screening (TCM) approaches to shortlist the most potent compounds for the possible treatment. The results of the entire article stressed the potential inhibitory role of Saquinavir and TCM5280805, which are based on computer-based virtual drug screening. We have not conducted further in vivo and in vitro antiviral experiments yet, because we want to share our results with scientists in anti-SARS-CoV-2 research as soon as possible. This study will help to repurpose drug design, perform in vivo and in vitro evaluations for candidate drugs obtained in this study, and prepare for clinical trial applications.</p>
