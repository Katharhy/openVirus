<p>The Coronaviruses (CoVs) are placed within four Genera, Alpha-coronavirus, Beta-coronavirus, Gamma-coronavirus and Delta-coronavirus (
 <italic>α</italic>, 
 <italic>β</italic>, 
 <italic>γ</italic>, and 
 <italic>δ</italic>) of subfamily Orthocoronavirinae. However, the members of Beta-coronavirus such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV1 and SARS-CoV2) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been involved in pneumonia epidemics in the 21st century. SARS-CoV1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 outbreaks caused by zoonotic viruses (Lau et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Reusken et al., 2013); in 2003, 2012 and 2019–20 with the case fatality ratio of 10% (Cheng et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Zaki et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), 35% (de Groot et al., 2013; Zaki et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>); and 5%, respectively. The recent outbreak and phenomenal spread of SARS-COV-2 to every nook and cranny of the world (3.66 million infections and 309774 deaths) compelled World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it pandemic on March 20, 2020. The virus causing covid-19 was named 2019-nCoV (2019 novel coronavirus) on January 12, 2020 by WHO (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Zhu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), however the International Virus Classification Commission (ICTV) on February 11, 2020, named this virus as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This threat of global concern to humanity, mainly due to the unavailability of proper treatment (Huang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) pushed the investigators to discover and design therapeutic drugs and vaccines to combat the coronavirus. Infection symptoms include fever, dyspnea, shortness of breath, and cough, whereas severe cases lead to kidney failure and death (Rothan &amp; Byrareddy, 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
