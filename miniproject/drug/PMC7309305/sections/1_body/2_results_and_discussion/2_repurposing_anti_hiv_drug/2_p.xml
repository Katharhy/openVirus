<p>These drugs were prepared for molecular docking against the proteinase enzymes of coronavirus (SARS-COV-2). The docking scores were ranged from −9.09 kcal/mol to −4.16 kcal/mol. All the conformations were analyzed for the best interactions with the key residues. Initial criteria were set to shortlist the drugs based on binding affinity and interactions with the dyad residues (His41 and Cys145). The docking score −9.09 kcal/mol was reported for the HIV protease inhibitor drug Saquinavir (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>). This drug has been reported to inhibit the HIV proteinase enzymes too. In this case, (SARS-COV-2), the Saquinavir formed six hydrogen bonds, including two with the central dyad residues (His41 and Cya145). Previous reports on different SARS, such as the octa-peptide, also stressed the blocking of these two residues. Other interactions include four hydrogen bonds with Glu166, Gln189, Met49, and Gly143, while some pi-alkyl interactions, including one with Cys145 and other residues, are also formed. Thus, we speculate that the clinical testing of Saquinavir should be done at the earliest. It is also reported by different scientists that HIV drugs could be potentially used against the recent coronavirus.
