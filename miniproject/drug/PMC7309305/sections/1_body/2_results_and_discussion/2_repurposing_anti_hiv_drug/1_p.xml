<p>In the current study, the repurposing of anti-HIV drugs against the SARS-COV-2 main protease was carried out using structure-based screening methods. Anti-HIV drugs such as Lopinavirâ€“Ritonavir are reported to be active against the SARS-CoV-2. Clinical trials of these drugs on different groups of patients showed significant improvement. Thus, anti-HIV drugs possess the potential to work against SRS-CoV-2 targets. Therefore, immediate testing of anti-HIV drugs may lead to a discovery of potent inhibitor against the SARS-CoV-2. A list of 31 anti-HIV drugs (
