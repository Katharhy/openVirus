<p>The stability of all the six systems was calculated by using Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD). We tested the stability of the docked drugs in the active pocket and its effects on the stability of the whole system. The results suggest that all the six systems were stable with acceptable deviation (as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>). The average RMSD for all the systems was found to be between 1 and 4Å. Saquinavir-3CLpro exhibited an average RMSD of 2.5 Å soon after reaching 35 ns; the system attained stability remains uniform for the rest of the time. It can be seen that the complex 3CLpro-5280805 remained stable, but after 60 ns, the system showed an acceptable deviation for a little time. After that, the system gained stability and entered the production stage. For a complex 3CLpro-5280445, the system showed a slight deviation between 40 and 45ns but remained stable during the course of the simulation.
