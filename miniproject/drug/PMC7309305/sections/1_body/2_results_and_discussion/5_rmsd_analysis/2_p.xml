<p>On the other hand, 3CLpro-5280343 and 3CLpro-5280863 reported divergence between 40 and 60ns, but the system soon gained stability. Similarly, in the case of 3CLpro-5458190, the examination of RMSD of the Cα backbone has an average RMSD of 2.3 Å. The system shows a deviation in the RMSD for the first 15 ns while remained uniformed for the rest of the simulation time. Thus, these results revealed the stable internal motions and negligible fluctuations during the course of the simulation. The differences in the RMSD of each system is due to the binding and unbinding of the ligand at different time intervals. Also, the systems with more stable behaviour show that the ligand remained intact, and the system entered the production phase soon when compared to the others. Aside, the binding of small molecules affects the system differently as the ligand-binding orientation changes over the simulation time.</p>
