<p>Furthermore, we also performed virtual screening of the Traditional Chinese medicines database (TCM). A total of 37,800 compounds were screened after excluding the drugs violating the Lipinski rules of five. Important residues in the active site (His41 and Cys145) were targeted. The top five compounds based on the docking scores were selected. The best docking score, −11.183 kcal/mol, was reported for the compound (5280805). More than ten bonds, including hydrogen bonds, van der Waals, electrostatics, and pi-alkyl interactions, were formed. Among the seven hydrogen bonds, two hydrogen bonds with the residue His41 were also formed, which is a key residue in the active site dyad. Among the other Phe140, Leu141, Asn142, His164, Glu166, and Thr190 also formed hydrogen bonds with the ligand (5280805).</p>
