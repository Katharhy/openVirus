<p>On the other hand, compound 5280863, with the docking score −7.688 kcal/mol formed a strong hydrogen bond with the key residue His41. The compound 5280863 also formed five hydrogen bonds with the other active site residues (Glu166, Arg188, Gln189, and Thr190). The other three compounds (5280445, 5280343, and 5458190) were also analyzed for the interaction with the key residues. It can be seen from
