<p>The RMSF depicts the flexibility at residues level. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref>, the pattern of flexibility is almost similar and was recorded around 1–4Å in all secondary components except loop regions with slightly fluctuated residues. However, active site residues seem stable in the course of the simulation, which is due to the ligand recognition by the ligand-binding regions. It can be seen that 3CLpro-Squanavir and 3CLpro-5458190 showed an average RMSF of 2.5 Å with significant fluctuations in the regions 40–45, 90–110, 150–165, and 245–260. A similar pattern of fluctuation was also observed for systems including 3CLpro-5280805, 3CLpro-5280445, and 3CLpro-5280863. However, the average RMSF remained below the 2 Å. Only the system 3CLpro-5280343 wed higher fluctuation than the rest, but the residual flexibility pattern was similar. The average RMSF for all the five systems was around 1–4Å, as clearly seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref> (Left Panel). These findings here show that the target protein is stabilized by binding of all five chosen drugs docked against it. Thus the binding of ligand has significantly affected the residue fluctuation, which is due to the internal residues disturbed by the binding of different ligands, and this both correlated and non-correlated motions are affected. The secondary structure components are also given in
