<p>The crystallographic structure (306 amino acids long) of the 3CLpro (SARS-COV-2) was retrieved from the RCSB database using accession ID: 6LU7. The structure of 3CLpro was analyzed for missing residues and refinement. The structure was subjected to energy minimization and structure preparation using Maestro. The structure of 3CLpro has three domains, as given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1(A)</xref>. These domains I-III correspond to position 8–101, 102–184, and 201–303, respectively. While there is a connecting loop corresponds to position 185–200, which connects domains II and III. All these domains are coloured differently. The ligand in the active site (Yellow colour (sphere)) has also been shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1(A)</xref>. The electrostatic potential of the 3CLPro shows that the active site region possesses a strong electronegative potential, while weak electronegative potential around the active site can also be observed. However, the weak electropositive and neutral potential is distributed too. The active site grid (X= −10.71, 
 <italic>Y</italic> = 12.41, 
 <italic>Z</italic> = 68.83) was generated, and important residues were identified. Important active site residues His41, Met49, Tyr54, Phe140, Leu141, Asn142, Cys145, His163, Met165, Glu166, Leu167, Phe185, Asn187, and Gln192 were identified and shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1(B)</xref>. The binding cleft is at the same place as in the previously reported SARS with the two critical residues HIS41 and CYS145 forms a catalytic dyad.
