 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) was used for retrieval of 3CLpro (6LU7) crystal structure. Using the protein preparation implemented in Schrödinger software (Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY), the structure was prepared and optimized. The OPLS_2005 force field was used for protein-energy minimization. For ligands preparation such as assigning appropriate ionization, stereochemistry, ring conformations, and tautomer (Release,
