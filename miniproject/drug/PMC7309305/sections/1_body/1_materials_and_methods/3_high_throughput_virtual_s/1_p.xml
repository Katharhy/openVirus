<p>Schrödinger binding site was used for finding the binding site of proteins using the default parameters, and the generated maps show the binding cavity. The identified binding sites have the descriptions regarding hydrogen bonding, a degree of exposure and enclosure, size, linking site points, tightness, hydrophobic and hydrophilic nature. The grid with dimensions 12 Å × 12 Å × 12 Å was generated. The final active site grid identified was based on the experimentally reported residues by a recent crystallographic study (Jin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) and the maps generated by Schrödinger Maestro. Three steps of virtual screening (HTVS, SP, and XP) were used to screen the anti-HIV and TCM compounds databases. Furthermore, the bioactivity of these compounds was predicted by using molinspiration cheminformatics tool. Molinspiration is an efficient tool that has been used by several studies (∼4500) to predict bioactivity results.
