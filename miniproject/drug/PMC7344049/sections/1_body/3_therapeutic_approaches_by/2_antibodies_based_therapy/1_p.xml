<p id="Par21">Antibodies are the key biological molecules of the immune system, effective in minimizing viral pathogenesis because of their specificity to host protein. Monoclonal antibodies are much specific in their activities and have been tested against fatal pathogenic viruses like cytomegalovirus, Ebola, HIV-1, and influenza and approximately in the last two decades, 60 recombinant antibodies have been developed [

Similarly, monoclonal antibodies were characterized and produced against the spike protein of MERS-CoV. cELISA was developed using one of those monoclonal antibodies. cELISA was then used to detect the specific antibodies of MERS-CoV in the sera from infected rats and rabbits which were immunized with the spike protein of MERS-CoV [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. When the spike protein’s conserved region binds with the human monoclonal antibodies, it is very appropriate for generating therapeutic antibodies and also for the protection against a large number of SARS-CoV variants. Similar to Influenza, HIV, and RSV, SARS-CoV-2 also has trimeric spikes protein (TSP) on the envelope. SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spikes protein tends to bind ACE2 of the host cell receptor and facilitate viral entry. By targeting TSP effective neutralizing antibodies could be effective to inhibit viral attachment to host cells. CR3022 is a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody and its epitope does not overlap with ACE2 binding site within SARS-CoV-2 RBD and could have the potential to bind with SARS-CoV-2 RBD as illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, therefore this alone or with the combination of other neutralizing antibodies could be a therapeutic candidate for SARS-CoV-2. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are all strains of coronaviruses so following the same pattern with some required modification could be helpful in antibodies development for complete neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 in human. There are some limitations based on the function of the therapeutic antibodies including the tissue accessibility, insufficient pharmacokinetics, and also the reduced interactions with the immune system. Because of these limitations there is a need of more research on these antibodies [
