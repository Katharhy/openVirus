<p id="Par22">Antiviral peptides have a strong potential as a therapeutic drug for infection prevention. A single peptide can be verified for broad-spectrum antiviral activity. The first known example of a cationic peptide is α-defensin having antiviral activity against cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus, while human neutrophil peptide 1 (HNP1) with the in vitro significant effects against vesicular stomatitis virus. Due to high viral mutation probability traditional vaccines are limited in certain epidemics, in such scenario vaccination strategies based on antibody-mediated protection can stop virus infection, but high mutation rates make escape virus for host infection, Therefore classical antibody-based vaccines are proven weak in inducing T cell response. The inclusion of small peptides that could be presented by MHC molecules to T cells can produce antigen-specific responses [

 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell immune response [

Peptides based antiviral strategies may work in different aspects like entry blocker peptide helps in the prevention of viral fusion to host cells, virucidal peptides act upon virus envelope, and disrupt the structure and viral replication inhibitors can block further division [

On the other hand SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD is different from SARS-CoV spike RBD which supports the use of existing therapeutic peptides for the SARS-CoV spike RBD against SARS-CoV-2 [

But peptides based therapy has some limitations like low oral bioavailability and shorter half-life, Peptide hydrophilicity has poor permeability through physiological barriers and biological membranes, rapid digestion by proteolytic enzymes of the digestive system and blood plasma as well as rapid clearance from the circulation within few minutes by the liver and kidneys, Poor specific bio-distribution due to high conformational flexibility, High production costs of synthetic peptides, Therapeutic peptides and proteins also tend to undergo denaturation, aggregation, and adsorption which limit their active concentration and proper function in vivo [
