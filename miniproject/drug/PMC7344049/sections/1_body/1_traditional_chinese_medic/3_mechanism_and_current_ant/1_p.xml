<p id="Par16">The positive role of TCM has been emphasized in the “Diagnosis and treatment of novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trail Version 6)”, and some Chinese patent medicines are recommended to treat COVID-19. Xuebijing injection (XBJI) is a Chinese patent medicine that was approved for the treatment of sepsis in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. XBJI shows a protective effect in patients with severe pneumonia, which mainly inhibits the activation of the TLR4-NF-κB pathway and decreases the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-17, etc. [

XBJI significantly improves the primary endpoint of the pneumonia severity index in critically ill patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia [

Shenfu injection (SFI) reduces the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α, while increases the anti-inflammatory cytokine levels of IL-4 and IL-10. SFI reinforces immunity function by regulating the expression of complements and cytokines levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. A study has shown that SFI alleviates acute lung injury and improves the survival rate by suppressing the HMGB1-NF-B pathway in a rat model of endotoxin shock, thus preventing cytokine storm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Xingnaojing injection (XNJI), flavonoids are its main components, improves cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury through inhibiting the inflammatory response by the SIRT1 pathway and regulating oxidative stress [
