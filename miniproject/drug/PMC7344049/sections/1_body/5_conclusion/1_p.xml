<p id="Par24">Because of the recent epidemics of SARS-CoV-2 all over the world, it leads to a huge loss in health and economic sectors. In past, two such epidemics of respiratory complications were observed with the other two strains of coronavirus termed as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. In all such outbreaks initially, symptom treatment is focused to be clinically managed in existing ill patients as well as further spread of the fatal pathogen. Globally public health authorities are mainly focused on quarantine affected individuals; restrict travelers from epicenters, disease control measures, transmission, and prevention to overcome further mortality until the development of complete effective medications for COVID-19. No doubt these are effective ways in disease management, but this is not a long term possible way to control SARS-CoV-2 further spread due to everyday interactions in public especially china with a high population rate in the world. Recently along with many other ongoing clinical trials in the field of TCM, three Chinese patent drugs, Jinhua Qinggan granules (approval number of State Food and Drug Administration of China (SFDA) Z20160001), Lianhua Qingwen granules (SFDA approval number Z20100040), and Xuebijing injection (SFDA approval number Z20040033) have been approved by the National Medical Products Administration of China and have proved inclusion for the treatment of the novel coronavirus pneumonia, which has become the world’s first batch of drugs suitable for COVID-19 [

Similarly, another concluded that the treatment of COVID-19 patients with either arbidol (200 mg t.i.d.), nebulized IFN-α2b (5 mU b.i.d.), or a combination of arbidol plus IFN-α2b. IFN-α2b with or without arbidol can effectively decrease the duration of the virus in the upper respiratory tract and also decrease the duration of the high blood levels for the CRP and inflammatory markers IL6 [

In outbreaks of H5N1, Ebola, and SARS, effective neutralizing antibodies have been generated for passive immunotherapy with satisfactory results so this technique has importance in the treatment of COVID-19. A major role in the development of passive immunotherapy with plasma has been experienced with ensured hyperimmune immunoglobulins or monoclonal antibodies [

Based on the therapeutic options mentioned in this review several TCM containing bioactive compounds can target structural components and directly inhibit attachment, penetration, and replication as well as can counteract through stimulation of T cells, antiviral cytokines, and production of antigen-specific antibodies for the elimination of SARS-CoV-2. Already some other agents like fusion peptide (EK1) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>] are effective in vitro. Therefore more clinical investigation has to confirm its efficacy and safety against SARS-CoV-2 and meanwhile some drug options could be adopted from past treatment experience of SARS and MERS. However the application of TCM in COVID-19 needs to be studied both in vivo and in vitro to identify exact anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds, mechanism of action, antiviral efficacy, potential synergistic effects, and immune-stimulatory effects to prioritize and select a drug for a potential application in the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
