<p>The entrance of coronaviruses into the host cell is maintained by spike glycoprotein (encoded by S gene). The S1 subunit of SARS-CoV spike protein contains Receptor Binding Protein, which plays an essential role in the recognition of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus has a similar surface spike protein sharing 76% sequence identity with SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The binding affinity of spike protein to ACE2 is important for virulence, and it has been shown that spike protein of the novel SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 with a much higher affinity [
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It can be hypothesized that a particular mutation in the spike protein may lead to conformational variations affecting the virulence.
