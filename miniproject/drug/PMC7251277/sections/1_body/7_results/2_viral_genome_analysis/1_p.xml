<p>Raw sequencing data consist of 600676, 390806 and 283036 paired-end reads for samples isolated from patients COV-8, COV-12 and COV-13, respectively. Nearly all reads were mapped to the 29.903 bp reference genome with a mean ratio of 99.02% (±0.85), resulting in an average 2.616±1.011 depth of coverage. Identified variants of three SARS-CoV-2 isolates are given in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Since all three isolates have a D614G variant in spike glycoprotein, they belong to G clade based on GISAID classification. COV-8 and COV-12 had ten, and COV-13 had nine bp changes compared to the reference genome (NC_045512.2). Distinguishably, most of the single nucleotide variants were C to T conversion.
