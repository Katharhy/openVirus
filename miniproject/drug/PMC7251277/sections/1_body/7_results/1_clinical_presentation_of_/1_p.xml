 <bold>Patient COV-8:</bold> COV-8 was a 51-year-old man, and he presented to the emergency department clinic in our hospital with a 2-day history of cough. He did not mention fever or dyspnea. He had no known contact with a COVID-19 positive patient. He was an ex-smoker with a 50 packs-year history and had a medical history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The physical examination in the emergency department revealed a body temperature of 36.8°C, blood pressure of 120/70 mm Hg, the pulse of 100 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Lung auscultation was normal. The remaining physical examination findings were unremarkable or normal. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens were collected and sent for real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2. The patient complied with the possible case definition of COVID-19, which was stated in the COVID-19 Guide of the Ministry of Health of Turkey [
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, thorax computed tomography (CT), in line with COVID-19 Guide [
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], was performed and reported as containing typical findings of COVID pneumonia with mild involvement. Hospitalization was decided by considering the thorax CT result and the patient’s comorbid diseases. Azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine treatment combinations were started. On the first day of hospitalization, vital signs were in the normal range, and the general clinical condition was good. Viral RT-PCR analysis of the nasopharyngeal swab reported as positive. On the second and third day, subfebrile body temperature fluctuated between 37.7°C and 37.8°C were detected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Besides, there was an increase in the frequency of cough, and rales were detected during lung auscultation. An increase in infiltrations was also detected on the chest radiograph, as well as the increase in acute phase reactants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Close follow-up was continued by adding ceftriaxone to the treatment. On the 6th day, the subfebrile fever persisted, the patient reported fatigue. Oxygen saturation was &lt;90% while inhaling in the room air. We observed that the serum acute phase reactants increased and lymphopenia appeared in the complete blood count test. In the thorax CT on the 6th day, we also detected progression compared to the previous CT scan. Due to the above-mentioned findings in favor of progression, favipiravir treatment was started. Twenty-four hours after the start of favipiravir, the patient’s body temperature returned to normal range. Through 7 and 14 days of the hospitalization, the patient’s clinical findings and laboratory values gradually improved. The physical examination revealed a body temperature of 36.5°C, blood pressure of 125/70 mm Hg, the pulse of 98 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination was normal. Viral RT-PCR analysis of the control nasopharyngeal swab on the 14th day reported as negative. He was discharged from the hospital to revisit for control two weeks later.
