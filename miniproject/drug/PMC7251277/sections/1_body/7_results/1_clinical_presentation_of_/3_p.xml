The remaining physical examination findings were unremarkable or normal. Thorax CT revealed widespread patchy ground-glass opacities in both lungs. Complete blood count and serum acute phase reactants were in the normal range. She was hospitalized and started on azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine treatments. During the hospital stay, the patient did not have a fever and did not develop respiratory distress; oxygen saturation ranged between 96–97%. The treatment was completed in five days, and she was discharged to come for control one week later.
