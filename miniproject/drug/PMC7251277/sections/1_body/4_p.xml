<p>Due to the lack of polymerase proofreading activity, RNA viruses have a relatively high mutation rate and, thus capable to become resistant to drugs and escape from host immunity. As mutations accumulate, they may result in alterations in virulence, transmission capacity, infectivity, and pathogenicity of the viruses [

 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], real-time tracking of the virus isolates in populations may help epidemiological understanding of the disease and early detection of important mutational or recombination events.
