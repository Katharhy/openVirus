<p>GISAID classified three large clades, namely S, G and V. Clades were named based on variants L84S in ORF8 (S clade), D614G in S gene (G clade), and G251V in ORF3a (V clade). Three isolates in this analysis carried the D614G variant in the S gene, indicating they are all in G clade, which was mostly detected in European countries. An increased number of patients should be analyzed to enlighten the effects of viral genetic changes on clinical outcomes.</p>
