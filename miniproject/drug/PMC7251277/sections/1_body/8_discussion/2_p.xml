<p>Since the first and most of the current cases in Turkey are located in Istanbul, the characterization of virus samples may help to predict the origins of the initial entry to Istanbul. The Nextstrain website (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nextstrain.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.nextstrain.org</ext-link>) provides real-time monitoring of viral isolates around the world, mainly based on publicly accessible GISAID data [
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As of 1 May 2020, more than ten thousand genomes were uploaded to the GISAID database and nearly five thousand different genomes are available for analysis in Nextstrain online tool. Phylogenetic analysis in Nextstrain online tool showed that three isolates from Istanbul in this study were found to be closely clustered within samples isolated mostly in Belgium (
