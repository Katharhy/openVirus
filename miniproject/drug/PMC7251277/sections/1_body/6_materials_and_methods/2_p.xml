 <bold>Viral RNA Extraction:</bold> Viral RNA was extracted from 200 µl of nasopharyngeal swab samples with High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche Life Science) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Extracted RNA was eluted in 45 µl of DNase/RNase-free water. Total RNA concentration was determined with Qubit 4.0 Fluorometer using Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) and RNA quality was evaluated at 260/280 nm and 260/230 nm ratios using Nanodrop 2000. RNA samples were stored at −80 °C until further processing.
