 <bold>Viral Genome Sequencing and Data Analysis:</bold> Sequencing libraries were generated using the CleanPlex SARS-CoV-2 Library Preparation Kit (Paragon Genomics Inc.) following the manufacturer’s instructions. As input material, 50 ng of extracted RNA was used for each sample. Briefly, reverse transcription of RNA was performed; the viral genome was amplified with multiplex PCRs followed by indexing PCR to add adapters and sample-specific barcode sequences. DNA clean-up steps were performed with Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Inc.) when required to maximize the recovery of fragments. The quantity and quality of the final libraries were assessed using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit with Qubit 4.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) and an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 with High Sensitivity DNA Chips (Agilent Technologies Inc.) following manufacturers’ protocols before sequencing. Sequencing was performed in the joint Genomic Laboratory (GLAB) of UEAH and Istanbul Technical University [

Raw demultiplexed sequencing data were further processed to call variants and generate consensus genome sequences. First, the quality check of raw sequencing data was performed using the FASTQC program [

 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Further, primer sequences were trimmed from aligned bam files. Variant calling and generating consensus sequences were performed using Samtools [

 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Finally, all detected variants were checked manually to detect the presence of any sequencing errors, if any. Viral genome sequences were examined phylogenetically together with world-wide isolates using Nextstrain [
