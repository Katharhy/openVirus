<p>With the exponential increment in SARS-CoV-2 cases globally, the non-availability of effective and specific antiviral treatment, and the lack of specific vaccines, the primary focus has been on minimizing contact with infected persons, asymptomatic carriers, or contaminated surfaces to contain the spread of the virus. Given this, we reviewed the available literature on viral persistence on different contaminated surfaces that we commonly come into contact with daily. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to persist in aerosols for up to three hours, with a decline in the infectious virus titer from 10

Meanwhile, SARS-CoV-2 was found to be retained more stably on plastic and stainless steel and could retain infectivity for up to 72 h when present on these contaminated surfaces. However, the infective titer reduced significantly from 10

A limited number of low pathogenicity human CoVs, such as the HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, were found to be viable from 2â€“9 h up to six days on different surfaces, such as aluminum, glass, plastic, PVC, silicon rubber, latex gloves, ceramic, and Teflon [
