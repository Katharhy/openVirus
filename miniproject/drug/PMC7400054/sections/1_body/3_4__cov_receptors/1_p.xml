<p>Host cell receptors and viral surface glycoprotein/ligand binding serve as the most important determinants of host range, cross-species transmission, and antiviral targeting inventions [

 <xref rid="pathogens-09-00519-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, CoVs can infect a wide range of host species, including humans, animals, and birds. CoVs from four genera recognize at least five different receptors and, therefore, exhibit an intricate host receptor recognition pattern. The differential usage of host receptors by different CoVs indicates the structural diversity in the RBDs of the S glycoprotein. However, CoV infections in humans are primarily driven by interactions between the envelope-anchored spike glycoprotein (S protein) of CoV and the host cell receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [

 <xref rid="B45-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Viruses from the same genus can recognize different receptors (for example, SARS-ACE2 and MERS-DPP4), while CoVs from different genera can bind to the same receptor as well, such as ACE-2 (HCoV-NL63 and SARS). The key features of the external subdomain of RBDs need to be investigated further to elucidate their role in receptor usage, transmission, and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.
