<p>For patients under investigation, the collection of upper respiratory samples (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs) and lower respiratory samples (sputum, if possible) is recommended irrespective of the presentation. Nasopharyngeal swab, bronchoalveolar lavage, endotracheal aspirates or wash, oropharyngeal swab, and saliva are the preferred samples. Stool and urine samples can also be tested to exclude other unidentified modes of transmission [

Sample collection and packaging have to be conducted using proper personal protective equipment. The triple packaging of samples is necessary to prevent spillage and should be conducted in a negative pressure room with Class II Biosafety cabinets to contain transmission. However, depending upon the available resources, certain modifications can be incorporated in the Standard Operating Procedures to minimize the risk. Lately, saliva samples have been found to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 91.7% of the symptomatic cases, and a declining trend in viral load has also been reported. This finding is of immense importance as the collection of saliva is a non-invasive technique, requiring less stringent conditions, and this can also be used as a screening tool [
