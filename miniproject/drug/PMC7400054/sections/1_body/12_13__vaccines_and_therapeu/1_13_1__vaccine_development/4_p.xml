<p>A concept of protection through changing the viral genetic code was given by researchers from China in 2016 while working on influenza A virus. They generated premature termination codons (PTCs), and these PTC-containing viruses showed promising results in mice, guinea pigs, and ferrets against influenza challenge. However, such studies have not been replicated further, though in the hour of need during the COVID-19 crisis, must be evaluated for the beneficial and effective control of infections.</p>
