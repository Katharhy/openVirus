<p>The phase I clinical trials for two other vaccine candidates (BNT-162 and INO-4800) are due in April 2020 in China and the USA, respectively. The BNT-162, an mRNA vaccine candidate, expressing codon-optimized undisclosed SARS-CoV-2 protein(s) encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles, has been jointly developed by Biontech AG (Mainz, Germany), Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and Pfizer Inc. (New York, NY, USA) [

The globally coordinated efforts to combat SARS-CoV-2 have led to the development of potential vaccine candidates in the shortest possible time; however, these candidates need to be subjected to rigorous clinical trials to prove their efficacy and safety before being considered for global immunization. Therefore, in the current situation, therapeutic drugs are the most effective alternative for the containment of COVID-19 and restoration of public health. Recently, two more vaccine candidates also entered phase I clinical trials, the details of which are summarized in
