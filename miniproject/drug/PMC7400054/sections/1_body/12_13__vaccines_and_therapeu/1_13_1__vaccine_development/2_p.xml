<p>Notably, two vaccine candidates have reached phase II clinical trials. The first one, the mRNA-1273, a novel lipid nanoparticle encapsulated mRNA vaccine, which encodes a prefusion-stabilized form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, has been jointly developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), USA and Moderna, Cambridge, Massachusetts, as shown in

 <xref rid="B122-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. The potential advantage of such a vaccine is its ability to mimic natural infection to trigger a more potent immune response and rapid production. The phase I clinical trial has recently commenced at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle, USA. However, the availability of this vaccine for global immunization is likely to take more time as it faces numerous challenges associated with clinical development, since no previous mRNA vaccine has been approved. The second vaccine, the Ad5-nCov, a replication-defective adenovirus vector expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, has been developed jointly by Cansino Biologics Inc. (Tianjin, China) and the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology (Beijing, China). The Sartoriusâ€™ Biostat STR single-use bioreactor system was used for the upstream preparation of the recombinant vaccine. The phase I clinical trial of this vaccine candidate recently commenced at the Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China [
