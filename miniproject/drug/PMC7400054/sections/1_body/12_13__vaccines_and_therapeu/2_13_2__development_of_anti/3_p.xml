<p>Apart from these drugs, convalescent plasma therapy (plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients that contains antibodies against SARS-CoV-2) could also be used as an alternative treatment strategy to improve the survival rate of COVID-19 patients [

Recently, the FDA allowed the use of plasma therapy for critically ill patients under an emergency investigational new drug protocol (FDA, 2020). The treatment strategies must focus on curbing hyper inflammation, and the existing readily available therapies may prove beneficial in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. A humanized monoclonal antibody, viz. tocilizumab, competitively binds to the IL-6 receptors and subsequently prevents the binding of IL-6 to its receptor [

Notably, the blocking of the IL-6 receptor by tocilizumab may prove to be crucial and reduce the number of deaths associated with severe stage COVID-19. In this context, a clinical trial (ChiCTR2000029765) using tocilizumab reported its significant effectiveness in controlling fever and improving the respiratory function in individuals with severe COVID-19 [

Apart from the aforementioned drugs, there are several other drugs that are either under clinical trials or are being considered for a clinical trial for the treatment of COVID-19. Of note, the information provided in this study is neither exhaustive nor should be used for self-medication.
