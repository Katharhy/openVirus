<p>There is an ongoing search for a suitable animal model to study SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref rid="B104-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. After the SARS outbreak, numerous inbred mouse strains were evaluated as models for the SARS-CoV disease with varying levels of results [

 <xref rid="B106-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. The genetically engineered mouse model, known as the humanized ACE2, was developed in response to the SARS outbreak. This model could be infected by SARS-CoV-2 and develop mild pneumonia. The other promising animal models for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine research could include hamsters and monkeys [
