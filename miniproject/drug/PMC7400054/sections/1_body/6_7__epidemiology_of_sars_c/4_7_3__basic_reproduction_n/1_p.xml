<p>The basic reproduction number plays a pivotal role in infectious disease epidemiology and indicates the risk a pathogen carries with respect to its spread. In other words, R
 <sub>0</sub> provides information about the transmissibility of a virus and represents the number of new infections originating from an infected individual in a population. A recent comparison of different studies on the estimation of R
 <sub>0</sub> for COVID-19 revealed that the estimated mean R
 <sub>0</sub> for COVID-19 is 3.28, with a median of 2.79, which is higher than the WHO estimate of 1.95 [
