<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the imposition of international travel restrictions in several countries, the cancellation of major sporting events, and the lockdown of borders, and has had a major impact on the global economy. It has also resulted in the closure of schools and universities worldwide (10 March, UNESCO). The stock markets and crude oil prices have declined severely, possibly the most drastic occurrence in recent years. Industries related to entertainment, ceremonial activities, hotels, and tourism are also affected. It is estimated that the global GDP loss is within the range of 1.0 to 2.7 trillion US dollars. The lockdown and other associated restrictions have severely affected the economic status and the well-being of families and communities. The major sectors affected by this outbreak are health, education, manufacturing, transportation, and trade, among others.</p>
