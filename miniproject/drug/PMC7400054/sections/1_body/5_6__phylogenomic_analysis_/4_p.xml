<p>Based on the spike gene phylogenetic analysis, it was observed that SARS-CoV-2 originating from different countries formed a separate clade with other members of 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic>. It was found that the bat-CoV (RaTG13/MN996532), pangolin-CoV (MP789/MT084071), and two bat SARS-like-CoVs (bat-SL-CoVZC45/MG772933 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21/MG772934) closely clustered with SARS-CoV-2, while other bat-CoVs and SARS-CoVs clustered within the 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> subgenus clade, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00519-f004">Figure 4</xref>. Similarly, CoVs from different subgenera, which included bat-CoVs belonging to 
 <italic>Hibecovirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Nobecovirus,</italic> human and camel MERS-CoV belonging to 
 <italic>Merbecovirus,</italic> and human, canine, bovine, and equine CoVs belonging 
 <italic>Embecovirus</italic> subgenera, clustered separately, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00519-f004">Figure 4</xref>.
