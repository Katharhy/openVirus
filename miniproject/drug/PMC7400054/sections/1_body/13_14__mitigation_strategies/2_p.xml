<p>In contrast, medical masks are recommended while providing clinical care to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases [

The WHO has approved the use of N95 masks for patients at all times for source control and for healthcare providers only in certain situations, such as when they are in the close vicinity of a patient (within three feet) or are performing aerosol-generating procedures on symptomatic patients. These masks are not recommended for use by the general public. In situations of close contact (within three to six feet) with a suspected or confirmed case, a facemask ought to be used instead of an N95 or powered air-purifying respirator. If the patient is not using a facemask, the health care provider should wear an N95 mask, even when at a distance of three to six feet from the patient. In low-resource outbreak settings, the reuse of N95 masks after ethylene oxide sterilization may be considered. General public awareness should be increased by the display of posters with clear “DO’s” and “DON’Ts,” illustrating symptoms, routes of transmission, and preventive measures, with emphasis on personal hygiene to curtail transmission. Physical and social distancing campaigns should be promoted to lessen physical contact and to contain the spread. Fitbit devices and other smartphone fitness devices can be used during such outbreaks to monitor the symptoms [
