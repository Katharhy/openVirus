<p>Increasing evidence suggests that fatalities resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection could be primarily attributed to the ARDS [

 <xref rid="B91-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], which may be associated with comorbidities and followed by multiple organ failure, leading to death [
 <xref rid="B92-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. ARDS is an immunopathological feature common to SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and the more recent SARS-CoV-2 infections [

 <xref rid="B93-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. ARDS occurs primarily in response to the cytokine storm, the fatal uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response, resulting from the release of an excess quantity of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-8, IL-17, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1α, and TNF) from immune effector cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection [

 <xref rid="B98-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. In this context, the increased levels of IL-6 were considered a reliable indicator of poor prognosis in the severe stage of the disease [
 <xref rid="B98-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The cytokine storm triggers a severe attack by the immune system on the lung and the body, inducing ARDS and multiple organ failure, and finally leading to death in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections, similar to that in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections [

 <xref rid="B94-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. A recent study also supported the proposition that SARS-CoV-2 acts on lymphocytes and leads to a cytokine storm and a series of immune dysregulation events in the body [
