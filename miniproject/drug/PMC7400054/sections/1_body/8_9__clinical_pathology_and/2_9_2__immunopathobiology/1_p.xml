<p>Existing literature documents that patients suffering from severe SARS-CoV-2 infection might suffer from the cytokine storm syndrome that could eventually lead to death [

Evidently, respiratory failure due to the ARDS is the leading cause of mortality, and, apart from this, secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is also induced in a limited number of adult COVID-19 patients. Usually, it is one of the less-recognized syndromes characterized by hyperinflammatory, hyperferritinemia, fulminant and lethal hypercytokinemia, cytopenias, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia, along with multiple organ failure. The severely affected group of COVID-19 patients presented with a marked increase in the levels of plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1. Mortality in COVID-19 could be attributed to such hyperinflammatory reactions [
