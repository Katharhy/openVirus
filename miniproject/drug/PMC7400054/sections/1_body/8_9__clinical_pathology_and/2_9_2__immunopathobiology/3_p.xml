<p>Studies on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 have not been undertaken thus far; however, understanding the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV may help delineate key factors associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis. Once the virus enters the cells through a specific interaction between the S protein and ACE-2, the antigen-presenting cells are likely to process the viral proteins through the major histocompatibility complex (MHC or human leukocyte antigen in humans). Following the MHC antigen presentation of SARS-CoV-2, both humoral and cellular immunity are activated, mediated by the antibody-producing B cells and virus-specific T lymphocytes. The seroconversion in COVID-19 patients was observed to occur at a similar point or slightly earlier than in SARS-CoV infection [

 <xref rid="B87-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. A recently released antibody profile against SARS-CoV-2 has indicated that the seroconversion rates for antibodies, IgM, and IgG were 93.1% (161/173), 82.7% (143/173), and 64.7% (112/173), respectively [
