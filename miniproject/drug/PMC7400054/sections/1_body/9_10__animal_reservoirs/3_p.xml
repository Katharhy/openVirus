<p>Susceptibility in different animals has recently been evaluated through an experiment on SARS-CoV-2 infection, where SARS-CoV-2 was found to replicate efficiently in cats and ferrets, while it replicated poorly in pigs, dogs, chickens, and ducks [

The gene sequence analysis of the viral isolate from a dog indicates that the dog might have acquired the infection from infected individuals. These findings suggest low chances of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from pet animals to the human population; however, further investigation is warranted.
