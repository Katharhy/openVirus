<p id="Par8">Agroecology depicts a different way forward by providing the principles on how to design and manage agricultural systems best able to withstand future crises—whether pest outbreaks, pandemics, climate disruptions, or financial meltdowns. Agroecology offers the best agricultural system able to cope with future challenges by exhibiting high levels of diversity and resilience while delivering reasonable yields and ecosystem services. Agroecology promotes the restoration of the landscapes in which farming systems are embedded, which enriches the ecological matrix creating “ecological firebreaks” that may help contain pathogens from ecological release.</p>
