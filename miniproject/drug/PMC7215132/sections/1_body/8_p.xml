<p id="Par9">Evidence shows that agroecology restores the production capacities of small scale farmers, by suppressing pests and weeds and enhancing soil fertility in ecological ways. By producing stable crop yields with low external inputs, biodiverse farms generate income and dietary diversity thus improving smallholders livelihoods. The amplification of agroecology is key for the food sovereignty of most communities, as small farmers who control only 30% of the global arable land, produce between 50 and 70% of the food consumed in most countries.</p>
