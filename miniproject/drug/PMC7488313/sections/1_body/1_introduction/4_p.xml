<p id="Par37">Since the pathobiology of HPAIVs in chickens is multifactorial and numerous viral and host factors can largely influence the infection outcome, the aims of this study were to (1) evaluate the pathobiology of a recent H5N8 HPAIV isolated in Spain (Gs/GD lineage, clade 2.3.4.4, Group B) in comparison with a classical H7N1 HPAIV in different local, commercial and experimental chicken lines from Spain with diverse genetic backgrounds; and (2) determine the role of virus factors (differences in the sequence of amino acids in viral proteins between both HPAIVs) and host factors (allele at position 2032 of chicken Mx gene) in the infection outcome.</p>
