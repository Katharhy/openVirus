<p id="Par34">Chickens are highly susceptible to highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs); however, the severity of infection varies depending on the viral strain. The inoculation of most HPAIVs in chickens causes evident clinical signs (e.g. apathy, nervous signs) and gross lesions (e.g. cutaneous edema, cyanosis of the comb and wattles, haemorrhages in skin), and chickens usually die in a period ranging from 3 to 6Â days post-inoculation (dpi). However, some HPAIVs produce a peracute infection that kills birds in a shorter period of time (within 3 dpi) [

In 2016/2017, the H5N8 HPAIV belonging to clade 2.3.4.4 B of Goose/Guangdong (Gs/GD) H5 lineage was responsible for the fourth intercontinental wave of this lineage. Despite Europe has been affected by the four waves of Gs/GD H5 lineage, the one caused by H5N8 B HPAIV was the largest in magnitude (reported poultry outbreaks and deaths), geographic spread and rapidity of incidents [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Since Gs/GD H5N8 B HPAIVs may present altered biological properties in chickens, the pathobiological evaluation of this new viral strain is needed.
