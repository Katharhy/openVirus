<p id="Par35">The pathogenicity of HPAIVs is also influenced by numerous host factors, including species, age at infection and immune response. Several reports demonstrate that a wide range of susceptibility to HPAIV infection is present between chicken breeds/lines. Some breeds display a comparatively high resistance, whereas other breeds are particularly susceptible [

Local chicken breeds are generally raised in small-scale farms and in backyards that allow the direct contact with wild and synanthropic birds and their droppings. Consequently, these birds are likely more exposed to AIVs than commercial chicken breeds, which are raised under high biosecurity standards. However, there is a general belief that local chicken breeds are naturally resistant to disease, which is associated with the natural selection over the years by autochthonous pathogens, food availability and harmful climate [
