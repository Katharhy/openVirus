<p id="Par36">Despite the genetic background that confers higher resistance to HPAIVs in chickens remains unknown, it was reported that the G/A polymorphism at position 2032 in chicken Mx gene (substitution of serine to asparagine at position 631 in the protein) conferred an antiviral effect against AIV infection in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, several in vitro and in vivo experiments have failed to demonstrate a clear correlation between this polymorphism and inhibition of AIVs or survival after infection, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, the role of Mx in AIVs infections in chickens is still under debate.
