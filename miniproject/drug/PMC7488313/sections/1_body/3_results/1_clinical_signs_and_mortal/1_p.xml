<p id="Par50">The mortality and percentage of clinical signs after experimental infection with either H7N1 or H5N8 HPAIVs in the different chicken breeds are presented in Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Severe clinical signs were observed in H7N1 and H5N8 HPAIVs-inoculated chickens in all breeds, but the frequency varied depending on the viral isolate and the chicken breed. At 2 dpi, several chickens of different breeds inoculated with H7N1 HPAIV presented severe apathy, were prostrated or found dead without previous evident clinical signs. Few chickens inoculated with H5N8 HPAIV also presented severe apathy at 2 dpi and were consequently euthanized. From 2 dpi and lasting until 9 (H7N1) or 10 dpi (H5N8), severe clinical signs were detected in several chickens at different times post-inoculation. The main clinical signs observed in both HPAIV infections were moderate apathy that progressed to prostration, and less frequently subcutaneous oedema, cyanosis of the comb and wattles and nervous signs (ataxia, circling, tremor and head shaking). The percentage of animals presenting prostration and nervous signs was higher in chickens challenged with H7N1 HPAIV than in those inoculated with H5N8 HPAIV (55% and 8% for H7N1 versus 35% and 4% for H5N8). Similarly, the onset of nervous signs was earlier in H7N1 HPAIV-inoculated groups than in the inoculated with H5N8 HPAIV (3 dpi versus 5 dpi). Moreover, H7N1 HPAIV produced a higher mortality rate in chickens than H5N8 HPAIV (70 versus 47%, respectively), as well as a shorter MDT (3,3 versus 4,9 dpi, respectively).
