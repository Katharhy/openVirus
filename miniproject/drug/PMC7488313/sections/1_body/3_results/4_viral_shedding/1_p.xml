<p id="Par56">Differences in the viral shedding between H7N1 and H5N8 HPAIV-inoculated chickens were detected (Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>Aâ€“D, respectively). High viral excretion by both oropharyngeal and cloacal routes was detected in chickens inoculated with H7N1 HPAIV. At 1 dpi, viral RNA was detected in several OS but not in CS. The peak of shedding occurred at 3 dpi. By 6 dpi, few birds presented detectable levels of virus RNA in OS and CS, but the levels detected were similar with those collected at 3 dpi. No viral RNA was present in the OS and CS collected at 10 dpi. Regarding H5N8 HPAIV-inoculated groups, a low number of OS presented detectable levels of viral RNA at 1 dpi. The proportion of positive OS and levels of viral RNA peaked at 3 dpi. In contrast, a low number of birds inoculated with H5N8 HPAIV presented cloacal shedding at the different dpi tested. However, the levels of viral RNA in the positive CS at 3 dpi were similar to those present in OS. By 6 and 10 dpi, viral shedding was still detected in several birds by both the oral and cloacal routes and in some samples, the levels were high.
