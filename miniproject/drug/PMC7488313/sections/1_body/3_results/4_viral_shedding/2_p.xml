<p id="Par57">Both H7N1 and H5N8 HPAIV-inoculated chickens presented similar oral shedding, as demonstrated by a similar number of chickens shedding virus (70% and 58% by 3 dpi, respectively) and mean levels of viral RNA in OS (5.1 and 4.6 Log
 <sub>10</sub> GEC by 3 dpi, respectively). The mean levels of viral RNA in CS were also similar between H7N1 and H5N8-HPAIV inoculated groups (5.3 and 5.2 Log
 <sub>10</sub> GEC by 3 dpi, respectively). However, a higher number of chickens inoculated with H7N1 HPAIV presented cloacal excretion in comparison with those inoculated with H5N8 HPAIV (56% and 21% by 3 dpi, respectively).
