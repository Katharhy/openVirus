<p id="Par52">Macroscopic examination of the chickens inoculated with H7N1 or H5N8 HPAIVs revealed similar lesions with both viruses in all breeds. At 2 dpi, few chickens inoculated with H7N1 HPAIV exhibited multifocal haemorrhages in proventriculus and gizzard, whereas non-evident lesions were present in the chickens inoculated with H5N8 HPAIV. From 3 dpi to the end of the study, the most common findings in the chickens inoculated with H7N1 and H5N8 HPAIVs were multifocal petechiae and necrotic areas in pancreas, and/or multifocal petechiae in proventriculus, gizzard and in the proventriculus-gizzard junction. Congestion in central nervous system was also a common finding. Less frequently, several chickens exhibited hemorrhages of variable intensity in skin (e.g. legs), subcutaneous edema, lung consolidation and diffuse congestion in internal organs. At 10 dpi, one chicken inoculated with H5N8 HPAIV presented multifocal petechias in bursa of Fabricius. No macroscopic lesions were observed in negative control birds.</p>
