<p id="Par55">The chickens inoculated with H5N8 HPAIV presented the most severe lesions and intense viral replication in the lung and heart, but evident lesions and high viral replication were also detected in spleen, thymus, central nervous system, nasal cavity, gizzard, pancreas and liver. The lesions in the heart, central nervous system and pancreas were similar to those described in H7N1 HPAIV-inoculated chickens (Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>Kâ€“P, respectively). In the lung, interstitial pneumonia consisting on moderate to severe increase of the cellularity (macrophages and lymphoid cells) in air capillaries and focal areas of necrosis associated with intense viral replication was commonly observed (Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>Q, R). In lymphoid tissues, including spleen, thymus and bursa of Fabricius, multifocal areas of necrosis/apoptosis of variable intensity in mononuclear cells were present. Particularly, diffuse necrotic areas and widespread viral replication were present in the spleen of one chicken (Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>S, T). Several animals also presented multifocal areas of necrosis in respiratory and olfactory epithelial cells in the nasal cavity. Multifocal areas of necrosis in glandular cells with mixed inflammatory cell infiltration, muscular cell degeneration and necrosis of lymphoid tissue were detected in gizzard and proventriculus. In the liver, we detected focal areas of necrosis with mild distention of hepatic sinusoids. The remaining tissues (skin, pectoral muscle, kidney and intestines) presented mild multifocal necrotic and/or inflammatory lesions and few positive cells.
