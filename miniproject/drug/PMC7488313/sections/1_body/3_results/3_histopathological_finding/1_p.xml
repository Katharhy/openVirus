<p id="Par53">Microscopic examination of the tissues collected from dead or severely-affected chickens at 3 dpi revealed evident lesions of variable intensity in all breeds in mostly all the collected organs. However, we detected differences in the severity and viral replication in the different tissues between H7N1 and H5N8 HPAIV-inoculated chickens (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>, respectively). In both viral infections, the predominant microscopic lesions in the tissues were areas of necrosis and haemorrhages with mixed inflammatory infiltrate (macrophages, lymphoplasmacytic cells and heterophils). The extension and severity of microscopic lesions correlated well with the intensity of IAV antigen (IHC techniques) in the tissues. The main organs affected were similar in all the chicken breeds inoculated with the same virus.
