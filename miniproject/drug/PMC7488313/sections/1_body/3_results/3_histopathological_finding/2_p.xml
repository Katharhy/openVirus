<p id="Par54">In H7N1 HPAIV-inoculated chickens, the most relevant microscopic lesions and viral replication were observed in heart, followed by central nervous system and pancreas. Viral replication in the heart was associated with fiber degeneration/necrosis and hyalinization of myocardiocytes mixed with mild inflammatory cell infiltration (mainly macrophages) (Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, B). In the central nervous system, non-suppurative encephalitis consisting in multifocal areas of necrosis in cerebral hemispheres, intense spongiosis, neuronal chromatolysis and gliosis were commonly observed (Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C, D). In cerebellum, chromatolysis of Purkinje neurons was a common finding. The lesions observed in the pancreas were multifocal areas of lytic necrosis of exocrine gland cells (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E, F). The remaining tissues generally presented mild necrotic and/or inflammatory lesions and few positive cells, such as lung and spleen (Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>G–J, respectively).
