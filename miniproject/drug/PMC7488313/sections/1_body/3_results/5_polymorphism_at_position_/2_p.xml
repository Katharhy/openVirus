<p id="Par60">In order to study the association of Mx genotypes at position 2032 with percentage of survival at the end of the study and mean days of death in the birds that succumbed to infection, statistical analyses were performed. The differences in the proportion of dead birds (containing both HPAIVs) were not statistically significant among genotypes. However, the Kruskal–Wallis test indicated statistically significant differences in the MDTs among genotype groups (p value &lt; 0.0001). Post-hoc pairwise using the Dunn’s test with Bonferroni correction indicates differences were statistically significant between groups AA and GG (5 versus 3.6 dpi, respectively; p = 0.0015), and between groups AG and GG (4.7 versus 3.6 dpi, respectively; p = 0.0006).</p>
