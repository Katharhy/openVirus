<p id="Par59">We found marked differences regarding genotype and allele distribution at position 2032 of chicken Mx gene in the breeds included in this study (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The three genotypes AA, AG, GG were present in 
 <italic>Empordanesa, Penedesenca, Catalana del Prat and Castellana negra</italic> breeds with variable frequency. The heterozygous genotype (AG) was the predominant in 
 <italic>Empordanesa and Catalana del Prat</italic> breeds. 
 <italic>Penedesenca</italic> presented a higher frequency of the homozygous-resistant genotype (AA), whereas 
 <italic>Castellana negra</italic> had more frequently the homozygous-susceptible genotype (GG). Almost all 
 <italic>Flor d’Ametller</italic> and 
 <italic>Euskal Oiloa</italic> chickens presented the homozygous-susceptible genotype (0.939 and 0.923, respectively), and any the resistant genotype. SPF chickens presented predominantly the homozygous-resistant genotype (AA), and in a minor amount the heterozygous one, but not the homozygous-susceptible one. Broiler chickens were fixed for the homozygous-susceptible genotype (GG). Overall, the average genotype frequency of the susceptible genotype GG (0.50) was higher than AG (0.29) and AA (0.21) genotypes (data not shown). The A allele was present in all the chicken breeds except in Broilers, but the frequency varied from 0.030 and 0.038 in 
 <italic>Flor d’Ametller</italic> and 
 <italic>Euskal oiloa</italic> breeds, respectively, to 0.903 in SPF chickens. G allele was present in all the chicken breeds. In this case, the range of frequencies varied in the interval of 1.00 present in Broiler chickens to 0.097 in SPF chickens. G allele (0.65) was more predominant in the chicken population tested than A allele (0.36) (data not shown).
