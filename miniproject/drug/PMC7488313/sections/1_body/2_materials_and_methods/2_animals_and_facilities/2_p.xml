 <italic>Centre de Recerca en Sanitat Animal</italic> (
 <italic>Programa de Sanitat Animal</italic>, IRTA). During the 5Â days-acclimation period, serum samples were obtained from all birds to ensure that they were seronegative to AIV by an ELISA competition test (ID-VET, Montpellier, France). Furthermore, OS and CS were collected from 5 randomly selected chickens of each group and confirmed to be negative to AIV RNA by one-step qRT-PCR.
