 <italic>Gallus gallus domestica</italic>) of six different local breeds from Spain (
 <italic>Empordanesa, Penedesenca, Catalana del Prat, Flor dâ€™Ametller, Castellana negra, and Euskal oiloa),</italic> a commercial breed (Ross 308 Broiler) and a commercial-experimental line (SPF White Leghorns) were used. The breeds included in this study were not vaccinated. All local breeds were obtained from local breeders. The local breeds included in this study are common in non-commercial, small-scale flocks, usually in backyards alone or mixed with other species in different regions of Spain. For their characteristics, these breeds are common in chicken contests, and their meat and sub-products are used for self-consumption or sold in local markets because of their added value in the market chain. Specific programs have been established in all included breeds to ensure their conservation [
