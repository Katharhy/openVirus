<p id="Par46">Swabs were placed in 0.5 mL of sterile PBS enriched with Penicillin–Streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) and Nystatin (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) at a final concentration of 6%. Swabs were conserved at − 75 °C until further use. Viral RNA was extracted using Nucleospin RNA virus kit (Macherey–Nagel, Düren, Germany), following manufacturer’s instructions. A highly conserved region of 99 bp present in IAV M1 gene was amplified and detected by one-step Taqman RT-PCR technique in Fast7500 equipment (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), using the same primers and probe as well as conditions of amplification previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. To extrapolate the genome equivalent copies (GEC) present in the swabs, a standard curve obtained by amplification of the same region of M1 gene was used. Briefly, the amplified region was ligated in pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). The ligation product was purified using MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and transfected into electrocompetent 
 <italic>E.coli</italic> cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) by electroporation. The recombinant plasmid was purified from transformed colonies using NucleoSpin Plasmid (Macherey–Nagel, Düren, Germany) and quantified in Biodrop (Biodrop µLite, Cambridge, England). GEC were calculated using DNA Copy Number Calculation (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Serial ten-fold dilutions were used to obtain the standard curve. The limit of detection of the technique was 1.89Log
 <sub>10</sub> GEC in both OS and CS.
