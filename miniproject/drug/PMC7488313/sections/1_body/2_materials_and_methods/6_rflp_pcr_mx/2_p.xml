<p id="Par48">Five μL of PCR products were run in a 2% agarose gel in 1X TAE buffer with ethidium bromide to confirm the presence of a specific band at 299 pb. PCR products were incubated at 37 °C during 16 h with a restriction enzyme (Hpy8I-MjaIV, 10 U/µL, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA), following manufacturer’s instructions. The restriction enzyme (5′-GTN|NAC-3′) cleaves the sequence 2 pb downstream of the Mx polymorphism in presence of guanine (G), whereas the product is not cut in case of an adenine (A) at this position. Digestion products were visualized in a 2% agarose gel in 1X TAE buffer with EtBr. Animals were classified in homozygous-resistant genotype (AA), heterozygous-intermediate genotype (AG) and homozygous-susceptible genotype (GG).</p>
