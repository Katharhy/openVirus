<p id="Par49">The proportion of birds dead at the end of the study by genotype groups were compared using the Pearson’s Chi square test. Then, post hoc pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni corrections were carried out [

First, the normality of the data was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Then groups were compared using either the Anova test (in case of normally distributed data), or the Kruskal–Wallis test (in case of non-normally distributed data). Finally, post hoc comparisons were carried out using the Tukey test (for normally distributed data), or Dunn’s test with Bonferroni correction (in case of non-normally distributed data). All calculations were carried out using R statistical software (
