<p id="Par47">Prior to infection, total blood in a 1:1 ratio with anticoagulant (Alsever’s solution, Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) was obtained from all chickens belonging to H7N1 and H5N8 HPAIV-inoculated groups. Genomic DNA was isolated from 10 µL anticoagulated blood using a standard DNA purification kit (DNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), following manufacturer’s instructions. To avoid RNA contamination, samples were treated with RNase (RNase A, Qiagen, CA, USA). As described by Sironi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], the following primers were used to amplify a 299 pb region in exon 14 of chicken Mx gene: forward 5′-GCACTGTCACCTCTTAATAGA-3′ and reverse 5′-GTATTGGTAGGCTTTGTTGA-3′. PCR reaction mixture included 60 ng genomic DNA, 10 µmol of each primer, 10 × buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM of each dNTP and native Taq DNA polymerase (5 U/µL) (Taq DNA Polymerase, native, ThermoFisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) in a final volume of 25 µL. Mx region was amplified in GeneAmp PCR System 9700 equipment (Applied Byosistems, CA, USA) as follows: 95 °C for 10 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 53 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min.
