<p id="Par45">Microtome sections of 3 µm of thickness (Leica RM2255, Nussloch, Germany) from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues collected at 3 dpi were processed, stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H/E) and then examined under light microscopy. An immunohistochemical (IHC) technique was performed in the same tissues. Briefly, samples were pretreated with 0.1% protease at 37 °C during 8 min. A mouse-derived monoclonal commercial antibody against the nucleoprotein (NP) of IAVs (ATCC, HB-65, H16L-10-4R5) was used as a primary antibody. The slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The samples were then incubated with an anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to an HRP-Labelled Polymer (Dako, immunoglobulins As, Denmark). The antigen–antibody reaction was visualized using the chromogen 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. Sections were counterstained with Mayer’s haematoxylin and examined under light microscopy. The positivity in the tissues was semi-quantitatively assessed taking into consideration the percentage of NP-positive and negative cells in the tissue. The samples were classified as follows: no positive cells (−), &lt; 10% positive cells (+), 10–40% positive cells (++), &gt; 40% positive cells (+++) in a tissue section. Positive and negative controls were used. The positive control was a central nervous system from a chicken experimentally infected with H7N1 HPAIV [
