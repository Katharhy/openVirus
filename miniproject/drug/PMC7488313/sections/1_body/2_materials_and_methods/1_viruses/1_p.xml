<p id="Par38">The viruses used in this study were: A/Chicken/Italy/5093/1999 (H7N1), isolated in 1999–2000 during an Italian epidemic that mainly affected Veneto and Lombardia regions (kindly provided by Dr. Ana Moreno from the 
 <italic>Instituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell’Emilia Romagna</italic>), and A/Goose/Spain/IA17CR02699/2017 (H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4. group B), isolated in Catalonia (Northern Spain) during the 2016/2017 European epizootics. Both viruses are highly pathogenic based on the amino acid sequences at the HA0 cleavage site: PEIPKGSRVRR↓GLF (H7N1) and PLREKRRKR↓GLF (H5N8). Virus stocks were produced in 10 days-old specific-pathogen free (SPF) embryonated eggs. The allantoic fluid was obtained at 24–48 h post-inoculation (hpi), filtered and aliquoted at − 75 °C until use. Serial ten-fold dilutions of the filtered viruses in PBS were used for titration in 10 days-old SPF embryonated eggs. The mean embryo lethal doses (ELD
 <sub>50</sub>) were determined by Reed and Muench method [
