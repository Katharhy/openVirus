<p id="Par43">All birds presenting severe clinical signs or found dead were subjected to macroscopic examination. In addition, three chickens of each breed inoculated with H7N1 and H5N8 HPAIVs were killed at 3 dpi using the combination of drugs reported above to collect tissue samples for pathological studies. The selection of birds was biased towards those found dead or presenting evident clinical signs of disease. Two birds of each breed belonging to mock-infected groups were also necropsied at 3 dpi. In order to evaluate viral shedding, oral swabs (OS) and cloacal swabs (CS) were collected from 9 chickens of each breed (selected previously to the inoculation) challenged with H7N1 and H5N8 HPAIVs, and from negative control animals, at 1, 3, 6 and 10 dpi. The same birds were sampled through the experiment.</p>
