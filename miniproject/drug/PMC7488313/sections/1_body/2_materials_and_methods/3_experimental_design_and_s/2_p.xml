<p id="Par42">All birds were monitored daily for clinical signs until 10 dpi. A standardized World Organization for the Animal Health (OIE) clinical scoring system was used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Animals with absence of clinical signs were classified as 0. Birds presenting one of the following clinical signs were considered sick (1) and those showing more than one were considered severely sick (2): respiratory involvement, depression, diarrhea, cyanosis of the exposed skin or wattles, edema of the face and/or head and nervous signs. Birds found dead were scored as 3. For ethical reasons, moribund chickens were anesthetized using the combination of ketamine/xylazine (20 mg/kg body weight, Imalgene 100 and 5 mg/kg body weight, Rompun 20 mg/mL) via the intramuscular route, euthanized by intracardiac injection of pentobarbital overdose (140 mg/kg body weight, Euthasol 400 mg/mL) and scored as dead. The percentage of mortality and mean death time (MDT) were calculated for each virus in all the breeds.
