<p id="Par66">The outcome after infection with HPAIVs is also largely influenced by host factors. Several reports demonstrate a wide range of susceptibilities to AIVs among breeds and lines of chickens. Specifically, significant variations in mortalities after experimental inoculation with Gs/GD H5N1, H5N6, H5N8 HPAIVs [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and the Italian HPAIV H7N1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] have been reported. We then evaluated the existence of breed-related differences in the susceptibility to HPAIVs in a broad range of local chicken breeds, and in two commercial breeds. In the present study, four breeds (

 <italic>Euskal Oiloa</italic>) were highly susceptible to HPAIV infection, whereas three breeds (
 <italic>Castellana negra</italic>, Broiler and SPF chickens) were considerably more resistant. The breeds that were more resistant exhibited less frequency of severe clinical signs, lower mortality rates and lower number of animals shedding virus to both HPAIVs infections than susceptible breeds, demonstrating that the genetic background of particular chicken breeds confer a higher natural resistance to diverse HPAIVs subtypes. Moreover, two of the highly susceptible breeds presented a higher incidence of cutaneous edema and nervous signs, suggesting that the clinical presentation may vary to some extent dependent of the breed.
