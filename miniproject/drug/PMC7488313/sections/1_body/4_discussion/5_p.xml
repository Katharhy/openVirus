<p id="Par65">Particular amino acids in specific positions of PB2, PB1, PA, NP, MP, NS1 and NEP/NS2 proteins sequence have been associated with increased pathogenicity and transmissibility of HPAIVs in chickens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Even closely related HPAIV isolates differ in their virulence in chickens, indicating that few mutations in the viral genome may produce significant biological effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although there is no evidence of sustained circulation of Spanish H5N8 HPAIV in galliformes species, the Italian H7N1 HPAIV emerged from a LPAIV precursor that had been circulating in gallinaceous poultry for several months [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Therefore, H7N1 HPAIV may present markers of adaptation and/or virulence in internal and non-structural proteins that are lacking in H5N8 HPAIV. With the exception of NS protein, the amino acid identity in internal and non-structural proteins was high (˃98%). Several amino acid substitutions associated with increased virulence of HPAIVs in chickens or chicken-derived cells were present in PB2 (123E), PB1 (3 V, 38Y), PA (672L), NP (105 V, 184 K), M1 (43 M) and NS1 (106 M, 125D) proteins in both H7N1 and H5N8 HPAIVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Only two differing amino acids in the sequence of the proteins between H7N1 and H5N8 HPAIVs have been reported to have a biological effect in the chicken species: 103F and 114S that are present in NS1 protein of H5N8 HPAIV. These mutations are associated with inhibition of host gene expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, they were reported in a LPAIV strain and their effect in vivo was not evaluated. Therefore, the differences in infection outcome between the two HPAIVs may be due to a single or a combination of amino acid substitutions whose effects have not been yet characterized. Since they belong to different subtypes, the HA and NA surface glycoproteins are also expected to have played a critical role in the differential outcomes. Actually, we detected that H7N1 HPAIV presented an amino acid substitution in HA (388T, H5 numbering) which is associated with increased pathogenicity in chickens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, the biological implications of the amino acid substitutions reported here require further evaluation. H7N1 HPAIV presents a stalk deletion in the NA protein, commonly observed after a transmission of HPAIV from waterfowls to poultry and a known major virulence determinant of HPAIVs in chickens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].
