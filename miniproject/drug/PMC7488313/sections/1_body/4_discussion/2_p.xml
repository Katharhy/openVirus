<p id="Par62">Both HPAIVs used in this study were highly virulent to chickens, as expected based on the presence of a multi-basic cleavage site in the HA protein and demonstrated experimentally by the severe clinical signs and fatal outcomes observed through the experiment. However, H7N1 and H5N8 HPAIVs differed in the progression of the disease they caused in chickens. With the highest frequency of prostration and neurological signs, highest mortality rates and shortest MDT, H7N1 HPAIV is more virulent to chickens than H5N8 HPAIV. The viral shedding pattern also varied between H7N1 and H5N8 HPAIVs. The differences in oral excretion between H7N1 and H5N8-inoculated chickens were minor. However, a low number of chickens inoculated with H5N8 HPAIV presented cloacal excretion. Despite some birds were still shedding at the end of the study, our findings suggest the potential for decreased horizontal transmission efficiency of Gs/GD H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 B HPAIV among chickens. In concordance with our results, previous studies demonstrate that Italian H7N1 HPAIV exhibit high virulence and transmissibility in several galliformes species [
