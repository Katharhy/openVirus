<p id="Par68">The genetics of resistance to HPAIVs remains unknown. However, particular alleles present in immune response-related genes have shown a positive correlation with antiviral activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Mx proteins are induced by type 1 interferons and interfere with viral functions by inhibiting viral polymerases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The substitution of serine with asparagine at position 631 of Mx protein, which is produced by a particular non-synonymous G/A polymorphism in exon 14 of chicken Mx gene, was associated with higher antiviral activity in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In vitro and in vivo studies do not always show a clear correlation between this allele and inhibition of AIV replication and/or survival after HPAIV infection, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, the impact of this particular amino acid substitution is still unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the genotype frequencies of that particular polymorphism in the different chicken breeds and evaluated their association with infection outcome. Similar to in other studies reporting high diversity in genotype and allele frequency in that position between breeds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], we detected huge differences in the frequency of the three genotypes among the spectrum of local, commercial and experimental breeds included in our study. As reported previously, resistant and susceptible genotypes appear to be the predominant in White Leghorns and Broilers, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In contrast, the results in local breeds were more variable, which could be associated with the higher genetic diversity generally present in unselected breeds. Overall, the susceptible G allele prevails in the Spanish chickens tested, while the resistant A allele was the predominant in two Indian native chicken breeds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], a native chicken breed from Indonesia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and 2 chicken breeds and 7 strains from Egypt [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The statistical analyses showed that the different genotypes in the target Mx region were not associated with significant differences in mortality ratios. However, the birds carrying the AA and AG presented a statistically significant longer MDT than those carrying the GG genotype. In concordance with our results, the study carried out by Ewald et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] observed that chickens homozygous for AA allele presented a delayed MDT. These suggest that the presence of an asparagine at position 631 in Mx protein may result in a higher antiviral effect response of Mx protein against HPAIVs, but, as shown in our studies, the biological implications of this change in vivo are probably limited.
