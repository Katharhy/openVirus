<p id="Par64">Despite the different course of infection caused by H7N1 and H5N8 HPAIVs, the clinical signs and macroscopic lesions in the severely affected chickens were similar and consistent with HPAIV infection. The viral antigen detected in mostly all collected organs in H7N1 and H5N8 HPAIVs-inoculated chickens that succumbed to infection demonstrates the widespread dissemination of both HPAIVs. However, the intensity of replication and associated microscopic lesions in the different tissues were virus-dependent, indicating differences in their tissue tropism. Chickens inoculated with H7N1 presented severe lesions and high viral replication in heart, central nervous system and pancreas. In addition to those observed in H7N1-inoculated birds, inflammatory and necrotizing lesions associated to intense viral replication were detected in the lungs and primary lymphoid organs collected from chickens inoculated with H5N8 HPAIV. Widespread staining was generally detected in lymphocytes in these tissues, indicating a high avidity of H5N8 HPAIV for lymphoid cell populations. The cause of death in the chickens that succumbed to infection after H7N1 and H5N8 HPAIV inoculation appears to be the result of the multi-organ replication of these viruses. However, H5N8 HPAIV presents a reduced neurotropism, a hallmark of HPAIV pathogenesis, based on the comparatively lower amounts of viral antigen and lesions detected in the brain of H5N8 HPAIV-inoculated chickens in comparison with those inoculated with H7N1 HPAIV. The reduced neurotropism could be a reason of the lower mortalities caused by H5N8 HPAIV. Other mechanisms of pathogenicity not evaluated in the present study may also impact the differences in virulence between H7N1 and H5N8 HPAIVs in chickens, including an aberrant innate immune response in H7N1 HPAIV-inoculated chickens after infection [
