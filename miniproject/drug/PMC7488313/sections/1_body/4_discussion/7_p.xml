<p id="Par67">Local chicken breeds are believed to be more resistant to disease as a result of the natural selection by autochthonous pathogens and minor artificial selection towards productive-associated genes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], demonstrating that local breeds do not necessarily present an improved resistance to infectious diseases. Since these breeds are usually raised in backyards in the absence or few biosecurity measures and Spain is located within natural migratory routes between Eurasia and Africa, these particular breeds are expected to be highly vulnerable to infection with HPAIVs carried by migratory birds. Because of that, local chicken breeds could act as sentinels for HPAIV environmental contamination. Despite the susceptibility of local breeds to HPAIVs, their role in the global epidemiology of HPAIVs is much less evident. For instance, the role of backyard poultry on H5N8 epidemiology was suggested to be limited [
