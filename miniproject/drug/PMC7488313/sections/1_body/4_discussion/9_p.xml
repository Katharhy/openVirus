<p id="Par69">This study represents an exhaustive characterization of the pathobiology of two HPAIVs in a broad range of chicken breeds. Our results demonstrate that the outcome after infection with HPAIVs is influenced by numerous tightly interconnected factors, including the viral isolate, the genetic background of the breed and particular alleles in genes encoding antiviral proteins, underlining the complexity of HPAIV infections. A proper surveillance, education of caretakers and biosecurity measures in commercial but also in local chicken holdings are required to early detect the circulation of HPAIVs in the territory.</p>
