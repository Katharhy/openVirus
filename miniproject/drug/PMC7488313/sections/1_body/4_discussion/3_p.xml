<p id="Par63">The lower frequency of clinical signs and mortality, longer MDT and reduced excretion in H5N8 HPAIV-inoculated chickens in comparison with those inoculated with H7N1 HPAIV suggest a lower affinity and/or adaptation of H5N8 HPAIV to chickens. This could have partially contributed to the limited number of H5N8 HPAIV outbreaks in chicken holdings during the 2016â€“2017 epidemics in Europe (12% of the total reported outbreaks), in comparison with its detections in waterfowl holdings, including in Spain [

The production characteristics of this species could also be an important factor of the comparatively lower incidence of H5N8 outbreaks. Migratory wild birds are thought to have played a pivotal role in the worldwide dissemination of Gs/GD H5N8 HPAIVs [
