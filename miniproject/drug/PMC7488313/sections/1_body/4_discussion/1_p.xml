<p id="Par61">Available data demonstrates that the susceptibility to HPAIVs varies largely depending of the viral isolate and the genetic background of the host. In order to evaluate the existence of viral-and host-dependent differences in HPAIV infections in chickens, we selected a classical HPAIV (H7N1 isolated from a chicken in Italy) and a recent HPAIV of the Gs/GD H5 lineage (H5N8 Gs/GD clade 2.3.4.4 group B isolated from a domestic goose in Spain) and assessed their pathobiology in a broad spectrum of chicken breeds from Spain (local and commercial breeds).</p>
