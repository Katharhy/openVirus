<p id="Par3">As SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic) has swept across the globe, we have been reminded of what it is like to live with rampant infectious disease, without effective drugs or vaccines. Researchers have piled in to the quest to provide rational designs. The structural biology community are no exception, with structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins emerging at unprecedented speed. One of their main focuses has been the viral spike glycoprotein that binds to the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), allowing virus entry. Here, we discuss some of these recent papers on structural characterization of the spike and highlight how they might guide structure-based approaches to develop an effective spike-based vaccine.</p>
