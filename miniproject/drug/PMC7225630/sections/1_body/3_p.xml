<p id="Par6">So, what does this mean for design of a vaccine? Two spike-based vaccine-design strategies, developed for SARS-CoV, should be applicable. The first approach relies on stabilization of the spike. To generate the most effective neutralizing antibody responses, vaccinated individuals should generate antibodies to the pre-fusion spike, thus preventing ACE2 binding and cell entry. For this reason, structure-guided mutations have been designed that fix the SARS-CoV spike into this pre-fusion state

 </sup>. Stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spikes, designed using this method, are therefore promising for a vaccine. But do we need the whole spike? A second approach is to design a vaccine that just contains the RBD. A number of studies (reviewed in ref.

 </sup>) suggest that the most effective neutralizing responses are due to antibodies that target this small domain. Ensuring that we induce only the ‘best’ antibodies also reduces the risk of producing dangerous antibodies that help virus entry through antibody-dependent enhancement. Whether the future holds stabilized spikes or RBDs, the new spike structures, which revealed that our knowledge of SARS-CoV is also applicable to SARS-CoV-2, are good news. Now we must all hope that the quest to design rational vaccines based on this knowledge is as quickly realized as those structural studies, as the research community work together to fight this global pandemic.
