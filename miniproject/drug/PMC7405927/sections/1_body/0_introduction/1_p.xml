<p id="Par2">The recent outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is not an exclusively medical issue. The history of medicine and contemporary reflection clearly teach how an epidemic may have deep and sometimes radical social implications (Cohn 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2002</xref>). After all, it is sufficient to keep an eye on the news of the day to recognise the fact: in addition to information on the progress of the disease, on the efforts of the scientific community to find a cure, or on the conditions of cities under quarantine, since the beginning of the outbreak newspapers from all over the West reported unfriendly, suspicious and sometimes openly racist attitudes towards people of Asian origin (Hussain

The Twitter hashtag #JeNeSuisPasUnVirus, "I am not a virus" has become—the pun is not intentional, but hard to avoid—viral, used by thousands of users around the world to raise the level of public attention on the upsurge of xenophobia, "justified" (quotes are a must) by the fear of contagion. As the outbreak progresses and hits new countries, accompanied by its toll of panic, the same irrational dynamics could easily regard people with different origins. After the initial phase of virus entry into a new country, other divisions emerged, in this case not based on ethnicity but between different social groups, accompanied by the same load of suspicion and distrust. In the USA face masks have been resemantized from personal protective equipment to political symbols and statements, visually marking the division between “smug liberals” and “reckless republicans” (Lizza and Lippman

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). In Italy, during the hardest phase of the lockdown, categories allowed to leave their houses, like dog owners, have been heavily stigmatized by so-called “balcony watchdogs”, and multiple sources have reported dogs killed by poisoned bites (BresciaToday

It seems that, together with the death toll and the incredible strain on health care systems, this pandemic brought us a steady corrosion of our societies’ social fabric. Although reactive institutions and social order are helping to avoid radical episodes, it is inevitable to note sociological affinities with the generalized and execrable suspicion towards entire human categories—Jewish people—that characterized many Black Plague outbreaks since 1348 (Finley and Koyama 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2018</xref>). It is mandatory to point out that, in parallel with these divisive processes, many initiatives of diametrically opposite sign have punctuated lockdowns: togetherness has been expressed all over the world singing together from the balconies, applauding health care staff, volunteering for running errands for elders or other particularly vulnerable people, and so on. Nevertheless, social corrosion seems to be a stable companion of epidemics and quarantines, and as such an important side effect to consider, study and counteract.
