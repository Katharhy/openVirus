<p id="Par16">To date, the reflection on public ethics and ethical response in the context of epidemics and pandemics revolves mainly around four approaches: deontological (or Kantian), utilitarian, principlist and casuistry (Coughlin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2006</xref>). Ross Upshur proposed an interesting epidemiological adaptation of the standard principles of Beauchamp and Childress, introducing a framework specifically designed for situations where quarantine measures are necessary:

  <list-item>
   <p id="Par17">Harm: the restriction of the freedoms of individuals or groups can only be justified if it is indispensable to avoid causing harm to others;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par18">Least restrictive or coercive means: any action justified by the first principle should always use the mildest possible measures. In other words, education and discussion should precede prohibition or regulation;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par19">Reciprocity: societies within which public health measures are taken must be prepared to compensate for any inconvenience caused to individuals or groups subject to such measures;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par20">Transparency: all stakeholders affected by public health measures must be involved in the whole decision-making process, and the decision-making process must be as clear as possible (Upshur
