<p id="par0020">The ongoing re-emerging Nipah virus (NiV) outbreak also called “mystery disease” led to 12 deaths including 3 laboratory confirmed cases, and over 25 suspected cases in Kerala, India 
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Nipah virus causes severe disease in both humans and animals with reported the fatality rate up to 40–75% in previous outbreaks. Nipah virus (NiV) is a newly emerging virus caused a zoonotic virus of the henipavirus (HeV) genus that is normally hosted by fruit bats (natural hosts of the virus) to other species, which gets transferred from animals to humans, and it causes severe disease in both animals as well as humans 
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The natural host of the virus is fruit bats of the “Pteropodidae Family, Pteropus genus”. It is often carried by fruit bats to humans, infected bat secretions can also spread to domestic and wildlife animals notably pigs, human-to-human close contact with infected patients, blood or body fluid samples and contaminated raw food products and cause disease pathophysiology in vulnerable populations

 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. It was first identified during and reported a 1998 outbreak among pig farmers from Kampung Sungai Nipah in Malaysia and spread to Singapore with more than 100 deaths and nearly 300 human infected cases cumulatively

 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Previous two reported NiV outbreaks in 2001 and 2007 outbreaks claimed 50 lives in India alone, whereas Bangladesh has borne the brunt of Nipah viral disease in recent years, with more than 100 deaths out of over 600 reported human cases between 1998 and 2015 since its first outbreak reported in 2001

 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The identified virus source in 2004 was reported from humans became infected with Nipah after eating date palm sap contaminated by infected fruit bats
