ZIKV infection during pregnancy can cause a set of fetal developmental complications, known as the congenital Zika virus syndrome or complications particularly microcephaly in newborn babies with ZIKV infected pregnant mothers 
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Along with this syndrome, ZIKV is also associated with a higher rate of pregnancy loss and stillbirths among infected women. Congenital ZIKV syndrome may include microcephaly, ventriculomegaly, intracranial calcifications, extra-axial fluid, decreased brain parenchymal volume, lissencephaly, cerebellar hypoplasia, impairment of normal brain development in the fetus, delayed myelination and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum

Fetus to newborns of infected mothers can develop cardiac anomalies with septum defects, hearing loss, seizures due to the underlying brain malformations, neuromotor abnormalities such as spasticity and feeding difficulties and ocular abnormalities requires population-based screening and identification of asymptomatic infected or susceptible individuals
