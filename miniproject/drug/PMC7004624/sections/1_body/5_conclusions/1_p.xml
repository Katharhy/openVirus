<p>Sexual transmission of HIV accounts for 95% of infections in China, with the number of newly diagnosed cases continuing to increase year by year. Subsequently, controlling HIV sexual transmission faces great challenges. At the macro level, increased HIV sexual transmission is largely due to changing social norms and social environments. Social media, for example, connects people in an easier and faster manner, providing better opportunities for quickly finding a sexual partner. MSM in particular have become the most important mode of HIV sexual transmission in urban cities in China. As the population of China is quite large, a tiny change in HIV incidence or prevalence translates into a large number of HIV cases. Thus, controlling the HIV epidemic requires consideration of these macro level factors.</p>
