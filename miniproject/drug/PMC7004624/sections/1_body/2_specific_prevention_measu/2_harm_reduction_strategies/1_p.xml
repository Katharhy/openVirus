<p>With the first initial cases of HIV in China among injection drug users, strategies to control the spread of HIV amongst this group were at the forefront of prevention efforts. Harm reduction programs for preventing HIV transmission among people who inject drugs include opioid substitution therapy and needle and syringe exchange programs. Since 2004, about 200,000 clients have participated in such harm reduction strategies for people who use opiates and for people who inject drugs

 </sup> in China. Ten years after implementation, the HIV epidemic among drug users has considerably declined. The HIV incidence among clients enrolled in methadone maintenance treatment programs has decreased from 1% in 2006 to 0.03% in 2018, almost eliminating new HIV infections amongst this group. The proportion of HIV cases acquired via injecting drug use has also declined, from 44.2% in 2005 to less than 3% in 2018. While the number of newly diagnosed HIV cases via injection drug use peaked at almost 20,000 per year in 2005, it has since reduced to less than 4000 cases in 2018.

 </sup> Subsequently, due to the success of these harm reduction interventions, HIV transmission via injecting drug use is no longer a major route of HIV transmission in China. However, the lessons from the US and UK
