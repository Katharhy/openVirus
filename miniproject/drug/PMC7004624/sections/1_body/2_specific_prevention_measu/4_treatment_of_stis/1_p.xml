<p>STIs have been recognized as a major public health threat in China since they re-emerged in the early 1980s.

 </sup> Importantly, HIV and other STIs have been spreading from high-risk groups to the general population, leading to the high rates of sexual transmission of HIV in the country. People suffering from STIs can have ulcers in their genital areas, which cause tears in the surface of skin or mucosa, therefore increasing the risk of HIV transmission, infectiousness, and susceptibility. Thus, efforts to address the timely diagnosis and treatment of STIs helps lesson the impact of these ulcers and reduces potential HIV transmission. Health education messaging and structural interventions to increase condom use can help prevent STIs. Additionally, early detection and treatment of individuals infected with STIs via clinical and partner notification services and screening programs, can help reduce potential transmission.

 </sup> However, studies have shown that treatment of STIs may not reduce HIV at the community level.

 </sup> In areas with high rates of STIs and high prevalence of HIV sexual transmission, treatment of STIs reduces HIV transmission. However, in areas where rates of STIs are low, treatment of STIs will not have an impact nor slow down HIV sexual transmission. Therefore, treatment of STIs is an effective strategy to control HIV sexual transmission where STIs are common and HIV is primarily transmitted via sexual intercourse. Unfortunately, STI care services are not well managed in China, with no current national strategy for the management of STIs in the country. Strategies to reduce stigmatization of those with STIs and HIV, as well improving the linkage between outreach services and clinical care are needed to improve control and management of HIV/STIs.
