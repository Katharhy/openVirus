<p>HIV progression can be divided into the following stages: acute infection, asymptomatic phase, and clinical symptomatic phase. Individuals experience different levels of infectiousness depending on their stage of HIV progression. Mathematical modeling studies show that if individuals are diagnosed at later stages, it can be much harder to control HIV at the community level.

 </sup> Additionally, individuals at the early, acute stage of HIV tend to have high viral load and be very infectious. Acute infection can be defined as the period between HIV acquisition and emergence of specific antibodies,

 </sup> representing a period of increased transmission efficiency. Thus, immediate diagnosis and treatment of acute HIV infection can significantly reduce new cases of HIV. Optimal clinical and public health strategies for acute infection are lacking; however. There are currently not specific guidelines regarding diagnostic strategies or ART for persons with acute infection in China. This is particularly worrisome, as acute infection may compromise the effectiveness of PrEP.

 </sup> Early treatment initiation can avert damage to the immune system and shrink latent viral reservoirs.

 </sup> Kroon and colleagues, for example, found that diagnosis and treatment of acute HIV infection among the MSM community could reduce 88% of new HIV infections.

 </sup> The period of acute HIV infection, however, is very short and its role in HIV transmission is limited.

 </sup> In addition, diagnosis of acute HIV infection is very difficult and hard to implement in many developing countries. We do not believe it could be used as a national prevention strategy in China.
