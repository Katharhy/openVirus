 </sup> Evidence has suggested that medical male circumcision can reduce the risk of female to male sexual transmission by approximately 60%.

 </sup> A recent systematic review; however, did identify that male circumcision was associated with a 24% decreased odds of HIV infection among MSM in low and middle-income countries.

 </sup> With support from the Major Research Project on Prevention and Treatment of Major Infectious Diseases including AIDS and Viral Hepatitis, China has pilot-tested male circumcision among MSM. Unfortunately, the acceptability of this intervention was found to be very low.

 </sup> Given very low prevalence of HIV infection, about eight per ten thousand, we do not believe male circumcision is an effective strategy to reduce transmission of HIV in China.
