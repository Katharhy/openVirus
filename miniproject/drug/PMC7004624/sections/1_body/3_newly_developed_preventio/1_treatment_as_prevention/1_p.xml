<p>As early as the year 2000, researchers have found that when HIV viral load was lower than 400 copies per milliliters, the virus was not transmissible.

 </sup> However, this study was not immediately translated into prevention policy. It was not until a randomized trial demonstrated that treatment of PLWH whose CD4 cell count was above 500 could reduce 96% of HIV sexual transmission among sero-discordant couples that treatment as prevention began to gain notoriety.

 </sup> Additional trials have also reported that when viral load was reduced to undetectable levels, the HIV transmission diminished among sero-discordant couples in both heterosexual and homosexual relationships.

 </sup> In 2014, an ongoing trial of heterosexual and homosexual sero-discordant couples in which the HIV positive partner was taking ARVs, found no transmission of the virus. Additionally, in 2017, another trial among homosexual sero-discordant couples also reported zero cases of transmission in over 16,000 acts of condom-less anal sex.
