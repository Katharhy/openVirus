In MSM, studies have shown that PrEP can reduce 52.4% of HIV transmission, though this is highly dependent upon the compliance rate of those taking the therapy.

Campaigns that emphasize the impact of PrEP on HIV prevention, including promoting understanding of the intervention and its side effects, could help improve acceptability.
