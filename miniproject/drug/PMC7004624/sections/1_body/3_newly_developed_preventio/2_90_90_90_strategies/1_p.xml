<p>Theoretical, mathematical modeling studies have shown that once the proportion of HIV infections diagnosed, treated, and achieving viral suppression reaches a certain level, the HIV epidemic may be eliminated.

 </sup> Additionally, research has identified that when coverage of ART is high, the incidence of HIV infection is low.

 </sup> Therefore, in 2014, the UNAIDS announced a new global control strategy that 90% of people infected with HIV know their status, 90% of diagnosed PLWH receive ART, and 90% receiving ART achieve viral suppression.

 </sup> The 90-90-90 strategy has been adopted by many counties globally, with actions being taken to achieve such targets. As a result, great progress has been made across the world. As of 2016, 70% of PLWH know their status, 77% of those diagnosed are on treatment, and 82% on treatment were found to be virally suppressed.

 </sup> This progress is not constant across regions; however, particularly in Western and Central Africa and the Middle East and North Africa, where substantially far fewer people are aware of their status and initiated treatment.

 </sup> Many other countries have already achieved or nearly achieved these targets. In British Columbia, rapid scale-up of treatment has resulted in reduced new transmission of HIV infections.

  <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]
 </sup> China too has adopted these targets as a part of the 13th 5-year action plan, with improvements already being seen. A nationwide survey carried out in 2015 found that 68% of PLWH in China were diagnosed, 67% among those diagnosed were receiving ART, and 65% were virally suppressed.

 </sup> Improved linkage to care, including streamlining HIV screening and diagnosis, along with immediate initiation of ART, could help China achieve the 90-90-90 targets.
