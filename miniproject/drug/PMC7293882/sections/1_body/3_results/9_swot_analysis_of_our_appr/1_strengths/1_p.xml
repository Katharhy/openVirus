As a practice, we also did not have to furlough or lay-off any employees, as all team members were occupied in triaging, planning, and contacting our waitlisted patients. All our patients were updated weekly about the situation, and this communication made them many comfortable, which in turn made them more compliant and satisfied.</p>
