<p id="Par8">As the COVID-19 situation evolved, the hospital stockpile of personnel protective equipment (PPE) and the overall bed count was assessed. The results of the hospital PPE/bed assessment, the initial CHIME model results, and the fact that COVID-19 cases were increasing on a national and international level (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) led to our decision to suspend all surgical procedures. If we assume the need for 6 PPE units (each PPE unit would include headgear, masks, gowns, eye shields, a pair of gloves and foot covers) per prostatectomy, and knowing that we normally perform 8 prostatectomies a day, 4 days a week, our estimated PPE requirement would be 192 units a week and 768 units a month. Moreover, all of these patients would require a hospital bed for a minimum of 1 day, which would occupy eight beds for at least one night.
