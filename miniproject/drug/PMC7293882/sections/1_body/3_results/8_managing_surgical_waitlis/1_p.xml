<p id="Par15">As of April 1, 2020, we had 585 patients waitlisted for surgery, and these patients were categorized into groups based on the NCCN risk stratification. In the beginning, we had 45 VHR patients and 145Â HR as per NCCN risk categories. These patients were being prepared for surgery during the temporary shutdown. They were then assessed using COVID-19 risk scores to identify patients who were suitable for surgery (COVID-19 comorbidity risk less than 5), and these were selected to our first group of patients who would have surgery. This was a recommendation that was based on a multinational DELPHI consensus that combined the risk score by COVID-19 risk by MD Calc.com, Charlson co-morbidity index, and common sense (unpublished) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). All the VHR and HR patients were put on neoadjuvant ADT [

Also, the patients in the COVID-19 high-risk group had their surgery deferred due to the possible risk of increased mortality and complication rates in patients undergoing surgery in the middle of the pandemic.
