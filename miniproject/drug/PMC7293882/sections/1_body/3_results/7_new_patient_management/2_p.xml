<p id="Par14">These patients were added to the surgical list following their teleconsultation. Every week, we stratified new patients to our practice based on the NCCN risk stratification. For scheduling, the HR and the very high risk (VHR) were categorized in one group to be prioritized for surgery, and the other group would include intermediate, low, and very low-risk groups. The trends in the number of cases on the waitlist are depicted in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. Within a month, our surgical waitlist grew from 585 to over 723 patients, with an overall increase in every risk group. At the end of April, we had a total of 723 prostate cancer patients on our waitlist, with 216 of those being categorized as high and very high risk.
