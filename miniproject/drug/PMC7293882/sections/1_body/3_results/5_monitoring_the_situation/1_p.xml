<p id="Par10">Various models were frequently developed by our risk management team and these were all analyzed by our administration (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In the worst-case scenario, a viral surge was expected in mid-May (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Throughout April, based on COVID-19 caseload and hospital resources, several McKinsey models were developed and used as a part of our risk mitigation strategy. These models were used to estimate the probable ICU census, including ventilated patients, and the total admission census in our center. The modeling varied based on the level of incidence, which was categorized into three different categories: baseline, low incidence, and high incidence. Based on these models, on April 15, the expected May requirement of ICU beds at peak would be 68, with 61 patients needing ventilators. However, over time due to measures like “stay at home” orders by the governor and social distancing practices followed by the community, the estimated surge numbers improved throughout April, and on April 22 the expected ICU bed peak in May would be 11.7, and those requiring ventilator would be 10.5. The curves remained stable on April 28, suggesting that mitigation strategies followed in Florida were ultimately effective.
