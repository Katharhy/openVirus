<p id="Par21">Prostate cancer management is based on the prostate cancer risk category. Even as little as a 3-month delay in the treatment of prostate cancer, especially HR and VHR disease, has potential long-term implications [

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the management of prostate cancer was deferred in areas of the high incidence of COVID-19, especially in Italy and New York. For example, in Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Lombardy, where the COVID-19 incidence was high, all of the urologic procedures were suspended on the 19th of March due to the following reasons: (I) lack of anaesthesiologists, (II) use of beds and wards by COVID-19 patients, (III) diversion of urology staff to care for COVID-19 patients and (IV) risk of infecting non-COVID-19 patients with the virus [
