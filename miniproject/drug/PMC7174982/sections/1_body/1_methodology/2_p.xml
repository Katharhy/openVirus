<p id="p0055">The authors searched the Unani medicine books available in Jamia Hamdard library for information related to epidemic diseases. Five important textbooks of Unani medicine were reviewed. 
 <italic>Al-Qanoon fil Tib</italic> (The Law in Medicine) of Ibn Sina (980–1035 CE), 
 <italic>Kitab al-Hawi</italic> (The Comprehensive Book of Medicine) of Zakariya Razi (865–925 CE), 
 <italic>Kitab al-Kulliyat</italic> (The Complete Book on Medicine) by Ibn Rushd (1126–1198 CE), 
 <italic>Kitab al-Mansoori</italic> (Book dedicated to Caliph Mansoor) by 
 <italic>Zakariya Razi</italic> (865–925 CE), and 
 <italic>Kitab al-Mukhtarat fil-Tib</italic> (The Book on Choice of Medicine) by Ibn Hubal Baghdadi (1121–1213 CE). Other published books and journals were also consulted for further details. For information on SARS-CoV-2 and Covid-19, we searched major scientific databases namely Pubmed, Science Direct and Springer for the most recent information regarding the pandemic. The search words used were ‘SARS-CoV-2’, ‘Covid-19’, ‘history’, ‘prevalence’, ‘symptoms’, and ‘transmission’. Internet search on the same search engines and also Google Scholar was also done to search for scientific evidence regarding Unani drugs prescribed during epidemics. For this search, we used the terms ‘air purification’, ‘influenza’, ‘epidemic’, ‘immunomodulatory’, and ‘bioactive compounds’ along with the names of drugs, according to their use. Time restriction was not made to extract the most useful information. The articles published during 2005–2020 were hence included in the final manuscript.
