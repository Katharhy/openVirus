It is now understood that SARS-CoV-2 has a 96.2% structural similarity with a bat coronavirus (CoV RaTG13) and 79.5% similarity with SARS-CoV. However, its spike (S) glycoprotein has a 10â€“20 times higher affinity to human ACE2 receptors as compared to SARS-CoV, leading to more chances of human-to-human transmission; though having a lesser mortality rate (average 3.4%) than that of SARS (9.6%) and MERS (35%) respectively (
