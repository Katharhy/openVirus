<p id="p0230">Understandably, Unani medicine does not mention epidemics and pandemics as separate entities, and a common term ‘
 <italic>waba</italic>’ is used for those diseases which affect a large geographical area. This is probably for two reasons, first and foremost, global communication was not possible in medieval ages like today; and second, travel over very long distances would have rarely occurred, hence the occurrence of a pandemic would have been a remote possibility, practically unlikely.
