<p id="p0080">SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in broncho-alveolar secretions, sputum, saliva, throat and nasopharyngeal secretions of infected persons (
 <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">Phan, 2020b</xref>). About 50â€“80% transmission of the virus is from asymptomatic carriers, hence transmission through speech droplets is considered as a significant mode of transmission of the disease. The virus can be transmitted directly through speech droplets, or through fomites (
 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Anfinrud et al., 2020</xref>). Based on reports, it is estimated that 44% of the transmission can occur before the onset of symptoms (
 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2020</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptors, which are present in abundance in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Viral RNA has also been detected in feces. Hence, an oro-fecal route of transmission is also considered. Air-borne transmission is not completely ruled out (
 <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2020</xref>). There is also evidence that the virus can be transmitted through tears and body fluids if they come into contact with the mucosa of eyes, mouth or nose. Depending on the route of entry, the virus binds to ACE2 receptors and infects type-2 pneumocytes, ciliated bronchial epithelium of lungs (
 <xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2020</xref>), or enterocytes of the small intestine. The virus has also been isolated in blood, indicting more routes of transmission (
