<p id="p0060">SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus belonging to the genus β-coronaviruses, sub-genus botulinum (
 <xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). It is the seventh in the family of coronaviruses which is known to infect humans (
 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 2020</xref>). Coronaviruses are a group of enveloped viruses with a spherical shape, having a non-segmented, single-stranded RNA genome with club-like projecting spikes on their surface (

 <xref rid="bb0455" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>). Structurally, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to other β-coronaviruses. It has a long coding strand on which five ORFs are identified: including ORF1ab polyprotein, spike (S) glycoprotein, envelope protein, membrane protein, and nucleocapsid protein (
 <xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">Phan, 2020a</xref>). The S glycoprotein is the primary target of antibodies and vaccines as it is surface-exposed (
