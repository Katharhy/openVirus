<p id="p0065">Two distinct features have been identified in the genome sequence: (i) Structural and biochemical studies have identified that SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein has a high affinity to human or human-like angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors; and (ii) a second feature is a polybasic cleavage at the junction of sub-units S1 and S2 of the spike, which may determine the infectivity and host range of the virus (
