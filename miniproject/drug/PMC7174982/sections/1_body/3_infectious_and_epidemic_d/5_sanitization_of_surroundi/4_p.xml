<p id="p0155">It is pertinent mentioning here that in the contemporary world, herbal fumigants and sprays are rarely used for the purpose specified in traditional medicine. Sporadic researches have been published on the efficacy of herbal drugs as fumigants (
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Bhatwalkar et al., 2019</xref>), but much of the potential is yet to be discovered. Also, we could not find any clinical trials on the health effects of herbal fumigants. Probably, for this reason, the studies, if at all conducted, report the effect of these drugs as insecticidal, acaricidal, etc. For some drugs such as

 <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Ludwiczuk et al., 2017</xref>), etc. which may offer an anti-microbial effect on fumigation. However, the health effects of fumigation, along with quality control of drugs is needed before reaching a conclusion.
