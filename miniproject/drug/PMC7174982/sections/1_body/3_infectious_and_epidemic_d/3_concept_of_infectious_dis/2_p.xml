<p id="p0105">The ‘germ theory of disease’ was established as late as 1683 CE with the development of the first microscope (
 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Foster, 1970</xref>). For obvious reasons, the concept of microbes as disease-causing agents does not find a direct reference in Unani medicine. However, there is an adequate understanding that certain

 <italic>i</italic>
 <italic>-khabi</italic>
 <italic>th</italic>
 <italic>a</italic> (literally translated as ‘bad substances’) can migrate from the diseased to healthy persons, and may cause diseases (

 <italic>a physician should always keep an eye on changes of weather and air</italic>’ (
 <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Qadeer, 2001</xref>). A treatise of Zakariya Razi (865–925 CE), 
 <italic>Kitab fi al-jadari wa-al-hasbah</italic> (Book on Smallpox and Measles) describes the modes of spread of the two diseases and their differential diagnosis. In May 1970, it was regarded as “the first scientific treatise on the subject” by WHO (
 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Islam, 2018</xref>). According to Ibn Sina (980–1035 CE), ‘air and water are contaminated only after admixture of 
 <italic>ajsam-</italic>
 <italic>i-khabitha</italic>, which does not happen otherwise’. He further states, ‘such contamination can also be brought about if the dead bodies of people dying due to an epidemic are not disposed of properly’ (
 <xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Sina, 1878</xref>). Evidently, he had knowledge of microbes being present in the body even after death, which could potentially infect others.
