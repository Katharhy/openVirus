<p id="p0125">The 13th-century Persian scholar Najeebuddin Samarqandi (d. 1222Â CE) mentioned about a type of epidemic influenza in his treatise 
 <italic>Al-asbab wa-Alamat</italic> (the book of causes and symptoms). In the translated version of the book, published by the name of 
 <italic>Sharah Asbab</italic>, the disease is mentioned by the name of 
 <italic>Nazla-e-Wabaiya</italic> (epidemic influenza) in the chapter on 
 <italic>Anaf al-Anza</italic> (Influenza). About 
 <italic>Nazla-e-Wabaiya</italic>, Samarqandi states that it is associated with fever, sneezing, sore throat, nasal irritation and malaise. Specifically, weakness sets in early in the disease. He further states that a patient of 
 <italic>nazla-e-wabaiya</italic> may also suffer from cough, diarrhea, and delirium. Pleurisy and pneumonia, if present, worsens the prognosis (
