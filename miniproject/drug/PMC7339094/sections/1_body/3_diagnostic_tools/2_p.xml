<p id="Par80">For diagnostic purposes, culture tests, considered the gold standard, immunoassays (ELISA), direct immunofluorescence (IF) and molecular tests (PCR) are currently used. The sensitivity of any diagnostic test is strictly related to the type of sample and site of sampling. For upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngeal washes or aspirates or nasopharyngeal swabs, preferable to pharyngeal swabs only, are recommended [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. However, an observational retrospective study conducted in immunocompromised patients with viral lung disease showed that the results of PCR tests performed on nasopharyngeal samples are comparable to those performed on BAL [
