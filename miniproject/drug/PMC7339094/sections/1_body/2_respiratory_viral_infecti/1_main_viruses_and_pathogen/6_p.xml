<p id="Par13">Parainfluenza viruses (PiV) and metapneumovirus (hMPV) belong to the 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family and have a single-stranded RNA segment. The PiV genome encodes six proteins: among these, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion protein F allow the virus to bind to the host cell and to merge with it. To date, five serotypes are known, which differ from each other from an epidemiological and clinical point of view.
