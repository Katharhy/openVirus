<p id="Par61">A systematic review evaluating data from 17 studies on hematological patients, HSCT patients or a combination of both revealed a total incidence of hMPV infection to 5% (range 0–40%). The incidence observed in hematological patients (7%) does not differ from that found in patients receiving stem cell transplantation.
