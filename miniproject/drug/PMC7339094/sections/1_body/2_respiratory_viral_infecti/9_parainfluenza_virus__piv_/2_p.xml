<p id="Par67">According to Shah et al., the incidence in HSCT patients (4%) is significantly higher than in hematological patients (2%). Mortality is estimated between 10 and 50% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and can reach 17% in patients with pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, no statistically significant differences between HSCT and hematological patients in terms of mortality have been highlighted [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Common risk factors were found to be age (&lt; 2 years) and the development of LRTI.
