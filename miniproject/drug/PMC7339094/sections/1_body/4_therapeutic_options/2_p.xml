<p id="Par85">For influenza, its increased resistance to M2 inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine) has made the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir the most used anti-influenza therapeutic option in immunosuppressed patients [

According to the Public Health England guidance, the use of oral oseltamivir, 75 mg twice daily for 15 days, is recommended for patients &gt; 13 years of age as the first-line treatment, provided that the risk of drug resistance is low. An early start of treatment, 48 h after the onset of symptoms in uncomplicated cases and for a minimum of 5 days, is appropriate. As an alternative therapeutic regimen, or in forms complicated by involvement of the lower respiratory tract, the use of zanamivir, in intravenous or nebulized formulation, has been approved [
