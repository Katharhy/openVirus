 <italic>Reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR):</italic> RT-PCR, and genomic sequencing (wherever available) is the gold standard and confirmatory test for COVID-19. Overall, the sensitivity of RT-PCR is nearly 70% with a 30% false negative rate, and its sensitivity decreases from &gt;90% on day 1- to 3 post-symptoms, to nearly 80% on day 6 and &lt; 50% by day 14 [

It should be noted that RT-PCR may take few hours to 2 days for reporting and second sample with different viral gene may be needed if initial test is negative. Moreover, RT-PCR may be false negative at a times e.g. low viral load in very early phase or in late phase of disease, mutation of COVID-19 virus or other technical difficulties in collection of samples. Similarly, result may be false-positive in influenza or other respiratory pathogens. In either case it is important to remain vigilant. Other issues with RT-PCR is incorrect sample collection and processing, potential risk to health care workers due to aerosol transmission, beside delayed report delivery, requirement of expertise, setup of laboratory and the cost [
