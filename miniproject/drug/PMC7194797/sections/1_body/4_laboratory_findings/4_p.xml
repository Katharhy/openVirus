 <italic>Serology:</italic> Blood sampling is much easier than swab sampling from oropharynx or nasopharynx. Two kinds of serological test can detect COVID-19 - a. Enzyme linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA) and b. Immunochromatography (Card test). ELISA is considered better compared to card test due to higher sensitivity. While ELISA has sensitivity of 87.3%, Card test has a sensitivity of 82.4%, and both have specificity of 100%. However, card test is convenient, cheaper and offers a rapid turnover [
