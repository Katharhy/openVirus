<p id="p0130">Although both serology and RT-PCR are complimentary to each other, however since antibodies can appear as early as 1-day post-symptoms, it is estimated that IgM-ELISA can detect more cases than RT-PCR on day 5.5 of illness [

However, during second week, the serological test had higher sensitivity than RT-PCR. Collectively, this suggest ideally to combine both the modalities of test to increase the sensitivity for early detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 [

 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Indeed, the combined IgM-ELISA plus RT-PCR has been shown to detect 98.6% of cases versus 51.9% with a single RT-PCR [
