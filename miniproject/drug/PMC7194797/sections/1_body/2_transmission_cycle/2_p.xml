The specific route of transmission to human from natural reservoirs is still yet to be known, however, some of the studies suggests pangolin could be the intermediate mammalian hosts. Since spike protein of SAR-CoV-2 are nearly identical to one virus isolated from pangolin, it is believed that pangolins could have provided a partial spike gene to SARS-CoV-2, to infect mammals [

 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A recent study has also shown a development of new variations at the functional sites in the receptor-binding domain of the spike of SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from pangolin, likely caused due to either a natural selection or mutations or recombination or both [
