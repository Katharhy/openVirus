<p id="p0065">A recent study from a genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes (n = 103) found this virus to be evolving into two major types (designated as L and S) with two different SNPs. While the L type is more prevalent (∼70%), aggressive and spread more quickly, as seen in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, the S type (∼30%) is an ancestral version, evolutionarily older, and less aggressive. It appears that the frequency of the L type has decreased after early January 2020, and it is hypothesized that the change in selective pressure might change the behavior of this virus. It is thought that coercive human interventions may have placed a more severe selective pressure on the L type to mutate to S type. Conversely, the S type might have been increased also due to a relatively weaker selective pressure [
