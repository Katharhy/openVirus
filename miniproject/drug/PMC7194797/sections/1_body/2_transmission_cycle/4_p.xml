<p id="p0060">The incubation period of COVID-19 could vary from 3 days to 14 days, based on the data from Chinese CDC. The longest time from infection to symptoms was 12.5 days (95% CI, 9.2–18 days). The Chinese epidemic also doubled about every seven days and on average, each patient transmits the infection to an additional 2.2 individuals, suggesting the basic reproduction number (R0 or R naught) to be 2.2, which is a bit lesser compared to R0 of the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic of nearly 3.0, in 2002–2003 [
