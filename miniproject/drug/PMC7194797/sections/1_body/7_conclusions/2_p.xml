<p id="p0175">SARS-CoV-2 is more infectious than SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. Most infections with COVID-19 are generally mild and self-limiting. However, even asymptomatic carriers may spread infection. Newer possibilities of feco-oral transmission are also speculated. Rapid diagnostic tests will be helpful for screening and diagnosing COVID-19 patients. Trials for specific anti-viral drugs and vaccine are currently underway to curb the pandemic, meanwhile isolation and containment is only way of prevention from contracting COVID-19.</p>
