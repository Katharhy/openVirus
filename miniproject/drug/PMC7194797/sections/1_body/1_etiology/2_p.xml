<p id="p0035">Coronavirus (CoV) belongs to Coronaviridae family of order Nidovirale. CoV are single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) having a spike glycoprotein on the envelope, giving it a crown-like appearance, when seen on electron microscope. The subfamily Orthocoronavirinae has four genera of CoVs: Alpha-coronavirus, Beta-coronavirus, Delta-coronavirus and Gamma-coronavirus. Furthermore, the genus Beta-coronavirus divides into five sub-genera or lineages. While bats and rodents are considered to be the genetic sources of alpha and beta-coronavirus, avian species represents the genetic sources of delta and gamma-coronavirus [
