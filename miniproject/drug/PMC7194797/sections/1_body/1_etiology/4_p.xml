<p id="p0045">COVID-19 is a single-stranded, positive sense RNA virus, having a diameter of 60–140 nm with a round or elliptic shape, however, it often exists in pleomorphic form. Its RNA genome contains 29891 nucleotides, encoding for 9860 amino acids and shares 99.9% sequence identity, suggesting a very recent host shift into humans [

Besides, these viruses can be effectively inactivated by lipid solvents including chloroform, ether (75%), ethanol, peroxyacetic acid and chlorine-containing disinfectant. Chlorhexidine does not inactivate this virus
