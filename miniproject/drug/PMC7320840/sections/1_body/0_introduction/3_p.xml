<p id="Par4">Although so far there are controversies about the source of the COVID-19 and its intermediate host, the evolutionary analysis showed that the coronavirus was most similar to bat coronavirus isolate RaTG13 (GenBank No. MN996532). It has a linear single-stranded RNA genome ~ 30 kb [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] being 96.2% homologous to the nucleotides in the whole genome of the same. Also, it is interesting to note that sequences from the number of recent patients are strikingly identical and show 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Sequence alignment of 2019-nCoV, RaTG13, and SARS-CoV showed no proof of any kind of recombination in the genome of nCoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].
