<p id="Par7">The virus genome of nCoV consists of six major open reading frames (ORFs) like all other coronaviruses. The 3′-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b, and most of the spike regions of nCoV and RaTG13 were similar to a distant lineage within the 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> branch. In this region, nCoV and RaTG13 are distantly related to the bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences which were also confirmed by phylogenetic analyses, emphasizing that nCoV may have originated in bats [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. nCoV is distinct from SARS-CoV in terms of the phylogeny of the complete RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene, reiterating that it is a novel coronavirus from the subgenus 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic>. The 3-D structure of nCoV revealed that the nCoV receptor-binding domain, composed of a core and an external subdomain which is similar to that of SARS-CoV suggesting that nCoV might as well be thriving by using angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell receptor. Interestingly, several key residues responsible for the binding of the SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain to the ACE2 receptor were variable in the nCoV receptor-binding domain (Asn439, Asn501, Gln493, Gly485, and Phe486). Past reports confirm that coronavirus contains four key structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N). These are encoded in the 3′-end of the genome (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The S protein utilizes an N-terminal signal sequence to gain access to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The E protein is the least abundant one and is highly divergent. It is known for facilitating the assembly and release of the virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The N protein is the only protein found in the nucleocapsid of virus particles and binds the viral genome in a beads-on-a-string type conformation. N protein is also reported to bind to replicate complex and the M protein, and these protein interactions tether the viral genome to the replicase-transcriptase complex and package the encapsulated genome into viral particles [
