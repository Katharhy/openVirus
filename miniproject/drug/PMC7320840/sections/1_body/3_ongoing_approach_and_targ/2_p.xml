<p id="Par14">The major concern here is that after decades of research on coronaviruses, there is no first-line defined defense therapeutics or vaccines. This potentiates the utmost need for developing potent vaccines or prophylaxis drugs to put a full stop to the possibility of future outbreaks. Several clinical, genetic, and epidemiological features of nCoV resemble SARS-CoV infection. Hence, the research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help the scientific community in a quick understanding of this virus pathogenesis and develop effective prophylactic drugs to treat and prevent this infection.</p>
