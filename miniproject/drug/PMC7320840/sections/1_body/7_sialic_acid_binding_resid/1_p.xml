<p id="Par19">There are reports which show sialic acid serves as a ligand for the binding of a transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), which is an enteropathogenic porcine coronavirus to erythrocytes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Sialic acid-binding activity may increase the stability of the virions by the binding of the virus to sialoglycoconjugates. Increased stability would help virions to survive the passage through the gastrointestinal tract [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In nCoV, there are three novel insertions in the N-terminal domain unlike that of SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These insertions are thought to confer sialic acid-binding activity and could be very potent targets for future vaccines. Also, sialic acid-binding activity is sensitive to certain competitive inhibitors which could be a good start point for further research and therapeutic targeting [
