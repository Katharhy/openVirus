<p>In our work, mezlocillin was the best candidate for catalytic site inhibitor of M
 <sup>pro</sup>. The same result was also reported from another

 <sup>pro</sup>. It was proposed that ACE inhibitors could have both potentially harmful and beneficial effects on COVID-19. Membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) participates in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells, and animal studies show that ACE inhibitors could upregulate ACE2 expression; and on the other side, the beneficial effect can be expected with upregulated ACE2 converting angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1â€“7), with potentially advantageous vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory properties [

 <sup>pro</sup> inhibition, in addition to the already assumed theory of the advantageous effect of upregulated ACE2, could explain that treatment with ACE-inhibitors is associated with less severe disease in SARS-CoV-2 infection [
