<p>The same drugs already selected in other studies as SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors represent proof-of-concept for our novel 
 <italic>in silico</italic> method. In this manuscript, several new SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> candidate inhibitors were also proposed. One of the best ranked allosteric inhibitors from our computational study is ciclesonide. Another computational study also found ciclesonide as a potential inhibitor of M
 <sup>pro</sup> [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-03830" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> studies, ciclesonide showed good antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, however against a different target [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-03830" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The potential multitarget activity of ciclesonide may help to overcome drug resistance in COVID-19. Additional favorable results were reported from studies identifying that ciclesonide inhalant may improve the respiratory status in severe COVID-19-induced pneumonia [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-03830" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and in cases of mild- to mid-stage COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-03830" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Ciclesonide is a safe drug commonly used for inhalation in premature babies and newborns, as well as the elderly. It is effective in controlling chronic inflammation of the respiratory tract and the only steroid that showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-03830" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These studies gave rise to a recently initiated an open-labeled, randomized Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the antiviral effect of ciclesonide on the reduction of viral load in patients with mild COVID-19 [
