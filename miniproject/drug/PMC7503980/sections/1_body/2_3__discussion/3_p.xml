<p>In this work, we have used the ISM for the structure/function analysis of the highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 protein M
 <sup>pro</sup> and identified the key informational characteristic of the protein, which corresponds to the protein key biological function. The ISM was recently used for prediction of potential receptor, natural reservoir, tropism, and therapeutic/vaccine target of COVID-19 [

 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitor, further in this work, we used the VS protocol based on the application of successive filters. First, the ISM-SM was used for the fast screening of large compound libraries through candidate selection at a specific frequency value. Molecules were treated as quasi-linear entities, analogous to peptides, and ISM was applied to predict potential candidates for the SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup>. Previously this novel approach in bioinformatics treatment of small molecules was successfully used for analyzing GPCR drugs of the Golden dataset [
