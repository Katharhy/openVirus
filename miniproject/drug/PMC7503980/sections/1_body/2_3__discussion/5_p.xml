<p>Raltegravir, the first approved human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase inhibitor and the best M
 <sup>pro</sup> allosteric inhibitor according to our study, was among the 30 compounds, with potential SARS-CoV-2 activity shown by a joint research team of the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica and Shanghai Tech University against SARS-CoV-2 from

Another of the best ranked allosteric inhibitors from our computational study was rolitetracycline, the first of the semi-synthetic tetracyclines. In recent molecular docking study it also showed the best binding with the catalytic center of the SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> through binding with CYS 145 and HIS 41 [

 <sup>pro</sup> allosteric inhibitors. The efficacy and safety of tolvaptan therapy was reported in patients with the COVID-19-associated syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [
