<p>The benefit of the ISM-SM approach over other 
 <italic>in silico</italic> approaches lies in its crucial ability to determine the long-range molecular recognition between protein and ligand. Due to low demanding data preparation, requiring only protein sequence and SMILES molecules notation of drug candidates, it enables quick scanning of large molecular libraries.
