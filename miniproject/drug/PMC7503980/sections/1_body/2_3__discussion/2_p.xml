<p>The manuscriptâ€™s originality lies in applying an innovative concept in selecting candidate molecules for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which includes molecular characteristics responsible for long-range recognition and targeting between interacting biological molecules. The VS protocol applied in this study is based on combined 
 <italic>in silico</italic> approaches considering both short- and long-range interactions between interacting molecules.
