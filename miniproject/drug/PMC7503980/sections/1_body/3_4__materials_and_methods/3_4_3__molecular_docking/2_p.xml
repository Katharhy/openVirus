<p>For intermolecular interactions identification, the following criteria were used: For hydrogen bonds, as a maximum distance between the donor (D) and a hydrogen atom (H), D · · · H, 3.4 Å was used and angle D-H-A between 90° and 180°; for a salt bridge maximum distance, D · · ·A, 4 Å was used. For π–alkyl interactions, the maximum distance between the centroid of the aromatic ring and the C-atom of the alkyl group was 4 Å and angle 45°. Regarding S–π interactions, for edge-on type, the maximum distance was 6 Å and angle 70°; for face-on, 4.5 Å and 25°. For π–π interactions, the maximum distance between centroids was 6 Å, and values of theta and gamma angles were 50° and 35° for stacked and 30° and 55° for T-shaped conformation, respectively. For π–cation interactions, the maximum distance between cation and centroid was 4 Å and angle 40°.</p>
