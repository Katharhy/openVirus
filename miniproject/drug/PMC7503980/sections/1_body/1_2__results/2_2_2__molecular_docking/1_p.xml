<p>For further filtering of the selected compounds, we carried molecular docking into the catalytic and allosteric domains of SARS-CoV-2 (

 <xref rid="molecules-25-03830-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The cut-off binding energy value for the best candidates was set to âˆ’7.0 kcal/mol. From the initial docking, the best candidates were found to be mezlocillin, camazepam and spirapril, targeting the catalytic site. Raltegravir, rolitetracycline, tolvaptan, ciclesonide and rescinnamine were found targeting the allosteric domain. All compounds have a better docking score than ebselen, which suggests that they could be potentially promising inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup>. Because ebselen is an inhibitor of HIV-1 capsid C-terminal domain dimerization [

 <sup>pro</sup> dimerization.
