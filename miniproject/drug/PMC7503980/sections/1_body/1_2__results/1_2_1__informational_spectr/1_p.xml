<p>In the present study, we have used the Informational spectrum method (ISM) for the structure/function analysis of the highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 protein M
 <sup>pro</sup>. According to the previous studies, the informational characteristic of the protein, identified in the analysis, corresponds to the protein key biological function. The informational spectrum (IS) of M
 <sup>pro</sup> contains three characteristic peaks at the frequencies F(0.1923), F(0.3183) and F(0.4414), shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03830-f001">Figure 1</xref>. To find the domains of a protein crucial for the information related to the three frequencies, M
 <sup>pro</sup> was computationally scanned. As a result of scanning with the ISM algorithm, with overlapping windows of different lengths, we identified regions with the highest amplitudes at these frequencies. It was shown that the regions, including residues 131–195, 151–183 and 72–136, are essential for the information represented by the frequency F(0.1923), F(0.3183) and F(0.4414), respectively. Two dominant frequencies of M
 <sup>pro</sup>, F(0.1923) and F(0.3183), correspond to the catalytic domain of the enzyme, while F(0.4414) to the allosteric domain (

 <sup>pro</sup> inhibition activity [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-03830" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We calculated cross-spectrum (CS) for M
 <sup>pro</sup> and Ebselen and found a dominant peak at the F (0.1054) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03830-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Due to the importance, we additionally marked this frequency among three others (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03830-f001">Figure 1</xref>). This frequency was computationally mapped to domain 182–214, corresponding to the allosteric domain. We further searched CS of Drugbank [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-03830" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] candidates, with M
 <sup>pro</sup> at the F(0.1923), F(0.3183), F(0.4414) and F (0.1054), to find potential M
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitor candidates, with additional condition that candidates’ IS contained main peaks on those values. With this search, we selected 57 candidate drugs (
