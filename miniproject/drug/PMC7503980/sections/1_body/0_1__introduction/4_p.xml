<p>In this study, we used VS protocol with sequential filters, based on the both long-range and short-range interactions, to select candidate SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors. First, the Informational spectrum method applied for Small Molecules (ISM-SM) was used for searching Drugbank database [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-03830" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and further was followed by molecular docking. By applying a new combo filter, we select 57 compounds for further experimental testing. The use of such protocol is of great importance in case of drug repurposing, for it can precisely determine protein domains where the possible binding site is placed, and select small molecules that could specifically bind to those domains. In addition, due to the simplicity of ISM-SM, a large number of compounds can be rapidly screened with little effort in data preparation. In particular, due to COVID-19 fast expansion, a VS protocol that could bring promising new drug candidates is of great importance.
