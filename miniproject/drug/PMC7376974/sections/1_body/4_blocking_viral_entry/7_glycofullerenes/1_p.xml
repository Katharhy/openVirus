<p>The emerging of mortal viruses, like Ebola or Zika, and the lack of suitable treatments led the academic and the industrial communities to look for alternative therapeutic routes. Most of these pathogens are RNA enveloped viruses, and they share common infection mechanisms that can be targeted for the preparation of wide spectrum antivirals. The external surface of the envelope of these viruses is covered by glycans that tightly interact with lectin receptors on host cells.

 </sup> This strong interaction allows the attachment of the virions to the cells, followed by internalization and infection. Blocking lectin receptors is a general strategy used to stop viral infection at an early stage. Fullerenes have been widely investigated as antiviral molecules, drug carriers, or tissue scaffolds.

 </sup> Fullerene applications have been recently extended to the design of mannosylated derivatives to block the entry of viral particles into host cells. Mannose, due to the high affinity with lectin receptors, competes with the virus in the interaction with the host cells. For example, one of the targets is the inhibition of viral particles through the interaction of mannose with the dendritic cell-specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin (DC-sign). DC-sign receptors mediate the interactions between DCs and T cells.

 </sup> To exploit these characteristics, mannose was combined with fullerene in the design of the so-called glycofullerenes to study their capacity to inhibit Ebola, Dengue, and other pathogens.
