<p>Although the studies on naked AgNPs to reduce viral infectivity have shown their potential as broad-spectrum antiviral agents, the understanding of the specific antiviral action mechanism still needs to be elucidated in depth. Many studies have shown that the antiviral performance of naked AgNPs is related to their size, and smaller nanoparticles have better antiviral activities.

 </sup> In addition to particle size, the antiviral action of AgNP morphology has also attracted interest to fight against coronavirus. AgNPs and two types of silver nanowires were able to significantly cause an inhibitory effect on coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV)-induced host cell infection and TGEV replication. The mechanism is likely based on a direct interaction of AgNPs with TGEV surface proteins (
