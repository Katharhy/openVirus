<p>Overall different studies have reported the capacity of AgNPs to block viral entry. However, there is not a concerted antiviral mechanism, but their activity differs from case to case, based on viral particle adsorption, capsid structure alteration, or surface protein denaturation. For AgNPs, the antiviral activity can be associated with different parameters including size, shape, surface charge, and functionalization but also to the topical release of silver ions able to disturb the viral cycle replication. As described before, bare AgNPs can be used as disinfectant agents, however their use in biological media is limited by their low colloidal stability and potential cytotoxicity. Surface functionalization can alleviate cytotoxicity, but it can also mask the nanoparticle surface, reducing their affinity for viral particles, thus reducing AgNP antiviral activity. For these reasons, AgNPs at the moment could find application mainly for surface disinfection and for topical administration. Further studies are needed to prepare safer AgNP formulations for systemic administration. In particular, the clarification of the antiviral mechanisms and the use of surface functional groups able to stabilize AgNPs in biological fluids without affecting their prominent antiviral activity are probably the most important challenges to tackle.</p>
