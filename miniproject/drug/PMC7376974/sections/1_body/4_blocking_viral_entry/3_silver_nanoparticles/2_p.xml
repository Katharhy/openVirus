<p>Alternatively, nanosilver can be combined with viral nucleic acids to change the capsid structure, affect the replication of viral genetic material, and make the virus inactive. For example, TEM analyses have shown that NPs can cause a change of the structure of the Ad3 virus from a hexahedral shape to an irregular shape, destroying its fibers and capsid proteins, leading to inhibition of the virus from binding to the host cells and destroying the DNA structure, preventing adenoviral infection.

 </sup> Nanosilver can also bind directly to the double-stranded DNA of hepatitis B virus to inhibit its replication.
