<p>The development of viral proteomics has profoundly transformed the antiviral and disinfection strategies. In particular, small molecules and peptides able to target and block the viral biochemical machinery have been developed. However, despite these efforts into the drug design, many of these molecules suffer from poor biological effect, low concentration in the diseased areas, and undesired side effects. In this context, AuNPs have been coupled to biologically inactive small molecules to create biologically active multivalent AuNP therapeutics. A bright example has been reported by Bowman 
 <italic>et al</italic>., where the authors functionalized AuNPs with SDC-1721, a small membrane fusion inhibitor of HIV.

 </sup> The results demonstrated that, while pure SDC-1721 has low activity, functionalized AuNPs are able to inhibit HIV replication at Î¼M concentrations. Similar results have been reported using targeting peptides. In particular, it was evidenced that the functionalized AuNPs can sensibly reduce the IC
 <sub>50</sub> up to 2 orders of magnitude compared to pure peptides.
