<p>Covalent chemistry strategies offer a higher control on the antigen quantification with higher reproducibility and possibility to bind different groups onto the surface of HNMs. For example, calcium phosphate nanoparticles (CaPNPs) were successfully covalently functionalized with Hen Egg lysozyme as model antigen showing an immunization 100 times higher 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> compared to antigens alone using (one subdermal injection in mice).

 </sup> A similar approach was used with iron oxide NPs using mannose (to target DCs) and hepatitis B antigen showing good immunological activity

 </sup> More recently, other types of vaccination strategies have been applied using HNMs. A smart example has been reported using multifunctional CaPNPs on herpes virus. In this study, CaPNPs have been covalently functionalized with alum/MPL as the adjuvant and two peptides as antigens selected 
 <italic>via</italic> reverse vaccination. The NM stimulated the immune system generating highly efficient antibodies able to block cell-to-cell infection of herpes virus 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (three intramuscular injections in mice every 14 days), increasing the survival rate of immunized mice to 100% against the controls (20% survival,
