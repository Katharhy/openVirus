<p>Similarly, CDs used for the treatment of RSV and PRRSV were able to activate the innate immune response

 </sup> Interestingly, it was shown that these nanorods (when intranasally administered with RSV) were not only able to activate the ISGs but also to tune the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in the blocking of the infection with a reduced pulmonary inflammation.

 </sup> As drug carriers, HNMs can also affect the internalization pathways, modulate drug efficacy, and the immune cell responses. For instance, it was found that the isoprinosine immunomodulatory antiviral drug displays a much higher antiviral efficacy 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> when delivered with CNTs than as a pure drug (in zebrafish larvae food administration), probably due to a better cellular uptake and the anti-inflammatory properties of the nanotubes.
