<p>The vast majority of the studies show that human survival to viral attack is based on the stimulation and response of our immune system. When a virus enters and starts infecting tissues, the body reacts and triggers a strong immune response to overcome the pathogen invasion and spread. Normally, two different immunological reactions take place. The oxidative stress induced by infection causes the activation of the inflammasome through upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1Î², pro-IL-18, and NLRP3.

 </sup> Excessive upregulation of this mechanism leads to cell damage and eventually to pyroptosis activated by caspases.

 </sup> It was also shown that generation of radicals is able to depolarize mitochondria, hence affecting host cell respiration and inducing ROS-mediated apoptosis at the late stage of infection.

 </sup> Besides, activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines can alert the immune system blocking the infection (the innate immune response).

 </sup> The second immune response is specific (the adaptive immune response). Immune cells are trained to attack the virus (cellular response), while specific antibodies are produced by B cells (humoral response). In the last years, HNMs were proved to tune the immune responses, demonstrating to be a possible alternative against viral infection. In this section the most relevant strategies for the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses using NMs will be described (
