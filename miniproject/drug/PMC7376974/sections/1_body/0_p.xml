<p id="sec1">The current emergence caused by SARS-Cov-2 is dramatically changing the everyday life of all of us. Due to the high globalization, new viruses can spread all over the world much faster than ever, infecting the communities worldwide. The current technologies and measurements are able to sensibly slow down the infection spread. However, their cost is tremendously high, impacting the healthcare systems and causing the shutdown of industries and the lockdown of the population. The impact of SARS-Cov-2 on the worldwide economy is estimated to be a 2–3% decline, making this the biggest crisis since the world wars.

 </sup> A possible vaccine is hopefully expected to come in 1–2 years, originating a buffer period pretty much uncertain for many people. Vaccination is the only way known to accelerate the flock immunity without causing further death by this pandemic. Contemporary history has seen the spread of other viral pandemics such as H2N2 flu (1956–1958), H3N3 flu (1968), HIV (peak reached between 2005 and 2012), SARS (2009), while MERS (2012 to now) and Ebola (1975 to now) viruses are in a prepandemic phase. The continuous colonization of wild nature lands may touch unknown virus reservoirs causing the spread of contagious epidemics. Due to these facts, there is a clear urgency in the development of viral treatments to avoid the risk of new pandemics.

 </sup> In particular, the possibility to have smart antiviral tools able to efficiently disinfect surfaces, block the viral spreading, enhance the survival of infected people, and boost immunization are highly desirable. In particular, more investments in the next years are expected in the antiviral research.
