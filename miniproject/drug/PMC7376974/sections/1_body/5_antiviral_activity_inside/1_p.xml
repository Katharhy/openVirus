<p>Blocking the viral entry, 
 <italic>via</italic> liquid/surface disinfection or once in the body, is a powerful strategy to hamper early stage viral contagions. On the other hand, when infections have already spread and reached middle and late stages, alternative pharmacological strategies are required. The study of the viral pathogenesis and machinery inside host cells has allowed the preparation of different drugs. Due to the present pandemic, such antiviral drugs are now of top interest in the scientific and medical communities. So far, few antiviral drugs are clinically available, and their mechanisms of action consist on the inhibition of reverse transcriptase (HIV, hepatitis), DNA inhibition of polymerase (herpes, HIV), inhibition of protease (HIV), blockage of ion channels (influenza), and inhibition of neuramidase (HIV, influenza, hepatitis). However, these drugs suffer from moderate to severe side effects. Additionally, rapid mutations in the viral machinery make them resistant to the treatments, making the control and the stop of the infection challenging. The use of HNMs in drug delivery has shown several advantages. First, HNMs can increase drug solubility and its circulation time. Additionally, they can be functionalized with targeting molecules able to direct the drug to the desired organs and so avoiding side effects and reducing the dosage. More recently, new antiviral mechanisms were discovered. In particular, it was found that different types of HNMs are able to change the ROS homeostasis in infected host cells, stopping the viral replication and preserving the cell survival. In this section both drug delivery materials and HNMs with ROS modulation properties will be critically presented (
