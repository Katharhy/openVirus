<p>Due to their efficacy and low toxicity, SeNPs can be considered a useful material for the treatment of other viral diseases including SARS-Cov-2. As a matter of fact, oxidative stress as well as chronic inflammation may contribute to the aggravation of the Covid-19 symptoms and to the general spread of the infection.

 </sup> The use of SeNPs could eventually alleviate the toxicity of infected patients, giving time for the immune system to react against the contagion. However, the lack of preclinical studies on SeNPs, together the scarce knowledge of their biosafety and long-term toxicity, still remain the main challenges to tackle for clinical translation.
