 </sup> This essential enzyme for viral replication was inhibited in a submicromolar range, similarly to benzo-1,2,4-thiadiazine, a potent specific inhibitor of HCV-RP. Another publication highlighted the effect of a C

 </sup> The inhibition was comparable to Tamiflu, rimantadine, ribavirin, and amantadine, but the mechanism of action remains still unclear. These data emphasize that fullerenes C
 <sub>60</sub> or C
 <sub>70</sub> can be potent universal antiviral drugs for RNA enveloped viruses. However, clear elucidations of the mechanisms of action and
