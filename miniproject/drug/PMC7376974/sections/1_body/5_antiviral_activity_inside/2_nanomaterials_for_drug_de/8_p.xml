<p>Graphene-based materials have been limitedly studied as antiviral drug delivery carriers. Only a few examples can be found in the literature. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) were used for drug delivery of CHI360 and CHI415 and tested 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> against HIV similarly to CNTs.

 </sup> Both the prepared GQD-CHI360 and GQD-CHI415 showed a high antiviral activity once into host cells, with low toxicity. GO has been also used for the delivery of DNAzyme into hepatic cells allowing to block the hepatitis C infection. This specific DNA single strand is able to recognize the viral mRNA and to silence its expression.
