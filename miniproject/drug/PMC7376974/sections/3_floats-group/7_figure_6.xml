  <p>Chemical design and general scheme to block the viral entry by glycofullerenes. Three different shapes of glycofullerenes can act as inhibitor of viral infection: (A) shape composed of monodisperse fullerene bearing mannose, (B) assembly as “sugar balls” of tridecafullerenes exhibiting mannose on the edges, and (C) supramolecular micellar aggregates of fullerenes bearing mannose.</p>
