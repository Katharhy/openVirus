<p id="Par30">Besides overcoming the time frame in which a vaccine can enter the market, it is also important to note that results from animal studies may not translate to humans both in terms of toxicity and challenge studies. Isuprel, a treatment for asthma, was rendered safe in rats, guinea pigs, dogs, and monkeys, but still led to deaths in humans with far less dosages in Great Britain. In another instance, to treat human autoimmune disease, a monoclonal antibody TGN1412, after going through animal models, was processed for Phase I trials. The introduction of TGN1412 led to critical illness within minutes along with long-term complications in Phase I volunteers (Van Norman
