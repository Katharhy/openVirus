<p id="Par22">In order to establish an antigen as a vaccine candidate, animal models are of profound importance in various aspects of vaccinology, such as route and analyses of the mechanism, the transmission of the disease, duration of induced protection, the host immune response to infection and vaccination (Griffin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2002</xref>). Thus, testing in animals is considered to be an important and critical parameter to proceed with the clinical trials in humans. One of the major problems associated with vaccine efforts against COVID-19 is that the most of the animal disease models for SARS-CoV-2 are under testing and, in the absence of these models, it is difficult to predict the outcome of challenge studies in humans (Gralinski and Menachery 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>). For an animal to be a model for a disease, the pathogen should be able to infect the animal using the same receptor on cells used in humans and then multiply inside the host successfully. Additionally, it should provide either similar clinical symptoms as humans; sometimes mild symptoms also work as this would help in studying immune responses against the pathogen. In the following sections, we discuss various animal models that are being tested based on their pathogenesis after infection with SARS-CoV-2.
