<p id="Par25">Compared with the logistics, cost, and ethical regulations in using monkeys and ferrets, laboratory-bred mice always remain a convenient choice as a disease model. However, coronavirus do not infect mice and rats as 11 of the 29 amino acids in mice and 13 of 29 amino acids in rats differ in the binding region of ACE2 compared to humans (Chan

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2007</xref>). The humanized ACE2 mice are successfully infected by SARS and develop lethal brain disease, making it an obvious choice to test infection with SARS-CoV-2 as well. However, due to lack of funding and high cost of maintenance of this mice colony, they discontinued breeding of mice in their facility and submitted the sperms of hACE2 mice to Jackson Laboratory. But these mice are now high in demand and Jackson Laboratory is facing a huge pressure to meet these demands. However, recent results from China have shown that hACE2 mice do support SARS-CoV-2 infection where they reduce weight by 20% and virus replication occur in lungs. Moreover, infected hACE2 mice also suffer from interstitial pneumonia where bronchioles are filled with periodic acid Schiff (PAS), positive exudation or detached bronchial epithelium, but are unable to transmit the disease. Also, the infiltrates are enriched in macrophages, T-lymphocytes, and B-lymphocytes. The authors also confirmed that the mice use hACE2 for entry and fulfill Kochâ€™s postulates, indicating that these mice are successful disease model for SARS-CoV-2 (Bao
