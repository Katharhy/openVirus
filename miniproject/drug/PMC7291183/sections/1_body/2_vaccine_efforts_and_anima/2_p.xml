<p id="Par21">Different companies have already taken initiatives to develop a vaccine against COVID-19. It is important to note that the studies on SARS have provided important clues for vaccine against COVID-19 and has also fast-tracked the overall process of vaccine development. The vaccine initiatives by various companies against COVID-19 is broadly based on three strategies: (i) using DNA or RNA, (ii) weakened virus known as VLPs, and (iii) targeting viral proteins such as S protein (WHO

However, in practicality one is always constrained in terms of the antigen that can be used as vaccine candidates. Thus, to enhance immune responses, Kim 
 <italic>et al.</italic> developed a microneedle delivery method that induces an antigen-specific antibody response as early as week 2 after immunization. Microneedle injection causes brief mechanical stress that induces the local innate immune response and thus avoids the use of adjuvant. Also, the skin possesses a high amount of immune cells involved in innate immune response, so even injecting a small amount of antigen can lead to significant activation of innate immune responses against the antigen (Kim 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
