<p id="Par24">Ferrets are model organisms for influenza virus and have similar lung morphology as humans and can actually cough and sneeze, supporting their use as an animal model for SARS-CoV-2 (Cameron

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>), but the virus only causes an increase in body temperature and other symptoms that are the hallmark for SARS-CoV-2 do not develop and the virus cannot replicate to high levels. But, interestingly, the infected ferrets can spread the virus with high transmission rates even to adjacent cages through direct contact or aerosols (Kim 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2020</xref>). Since most of the countries are now under community transmission stage, ferrets will act as a valuable animal model to study the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2.
