<p id="Par27">Thus, there are many promising animal models for testing the vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2, but still extensive studies are required to confirm their efficiency as an appropriate model for COVID-19. In order to fight coronavirus infection and win the race against time, Moderna, a biotechnological company in collaboration with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), USA, has already begun Phase I clinical trial with experimental vaccine mRNA-1273 (‘RNA vaccine testing begins’

Their argument for directly going for Phase I clinical trial is that the mRNA-1273 raised a good antibody response after immunization in mice and a lack of disease model for coronavirus. CanSino Biologics from China has also developed a replication-defective adenovirus expressing Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 as a vaccine candidate for COVID-19 (WHO

Beijing Institute of Biological Products/Wuhan Institute of Biological Products and Sinovac are using inactivated method while Inovio Pharmaceuticals is using a DNA-based vaccine approach. Similarly, in order to fast-track vaccine development, all of them have skipped animal trials and are currently performing Phase I trials. The Phase I clinical trials will test the safety and toxicity of their vaccine target in humans and in a way help in protecting humans from SARS-CoV-2. Although this looks promising for fast-tracking vaccine development, there is division among the scientific community about bypassing animal models before Phase I clinical trials. In addition, agencies like PETA are against using animals for research purposes. The question remains: Can vaccine research do without an animal model?
