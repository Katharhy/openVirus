<p id="Par34">Another problem faced by vaccine efforts against viral diseases, especially viruses having RNA as the genetic material, is that repair mechanisms do not work on RNA and thus lot of mutations are accumulated in their RNA. This phenomenon is known as antigenic drift and is the reason that influenza shots are needed before every seasonal flu infection. Thus, SARS-CoV-2-possessing RNA genome is also prone to antigenic drift. Hence, animal models of coronavirus will help in understanding the selection pressure and antigenic drift and evolution of the virus once a vaccine is administered.</p>
