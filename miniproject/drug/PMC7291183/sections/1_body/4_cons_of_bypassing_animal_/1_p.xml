<p id="Par33">Although bypassing animal models can save time, effort, and money, but, it is not possible to perform safety and challenge studies for a disease in humans. Also, animal studies provide the foundation to study disease. Further, it is difficult to study the progression of disease in humans but it is easy in an animal model as they can be sacrificed for histopathology in order to follow the course of infection. Although cell lines can also be used to study the infection process, animal models provide the advantage of studying the viral multiplication with respect to symptoms and physiology of an organism. Thus, it becomes really important for a newly originated coronavirus to be studied in an animal model. Further, studying animal models will also provide detailed information about the potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 in an organism.</p>
