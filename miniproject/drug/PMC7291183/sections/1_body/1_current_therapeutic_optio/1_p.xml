<p id="Par18">Till date, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an antiviral drug, remsdesivir, developed by Gilead Inc. USA, and an antimalarial drug, chloroquine (CQ)/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), for the treatment of COVID-19. An array of drugs approved for other diseases are also considered potentially useful while several investigational drugs are under study in several clinical trials conducted across the globe (table

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In order to clinically manage coronavirus, researchers from China, France, and a team of doctors from Rajasthan, India, have started using antiviral drugs in combination with chloroquine (Colson

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>). Recently, WHO announced a global trial, called SOLIDARITY, to investigate whether this dangerous respiratory disease could be treated with the available therapeutic aids (

It is, however, an unprecedented effort that includes thousands of patients across many countries to volunteer for the clinical trials. The trials aim to test the effectiveness of the four potential candidates: (1) the antiviral drug remdesivir that is known to inhibit RNA dependent RNA polymerase, (2) a combination of two HIV drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir, (3) lopinavir and ritonavir plus interferon beta, and (4) the antimalarial drugs chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>B). Coronavirus being a RNA virus, retroviral drugs could possibly have an effect on treatment; however, CQ/HCQ, which was successful as an antimalarial, is currently being considered as a part of treatment strategy against COVID-19 (Colson 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>). CQ has also been shown to possess anti-HIV activity through post-transcriptional inhibition of gp120 present on the viral envelope or inhibition of Tat-mediated transactivation (Jiang 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1996</xref>; Savarino 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2001</xref>). Moreover, chloroquine can also increase the pH of endosomes (Mauthe 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2018</xref>). Since coronavirus do not encode for gp120 or Tat protein and low pH is essential for uncoating of the virus inside the host cell, it is more likely that chloroquine stops viral spread by blocking the process of uncoating and release of nucleic acid. However, the current data from various small and non-randomized trials show only limited effects of CQ/HCQ or HCQ-azithromycin combination on treatment for COVID-19. Since CQ/HCQ is known to cause toxic effects and unprescribed use has led to human deaths, large-scale randomized trials like the SOLIDARITY project will be able to convincingly prove the effectiveness of CQ/HCQ as a drug against COVID-19. Recently it has been shown that combination of lopinavir-ritonavir causes adverse effects on COVID-19-infected adults and no benefits are observed (Cao 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020</xref>). Therefore, drugs should be used with caution until their mechanisms are well understood and their efficacy is well established. It is also known with viruses that mutate at high frequencies give rise to different strains, thereby easily gaining resistance to drugs. Thus, in-depth analysis in animal models is required to study their mechanism of action and the ability of the virus to gain resistance against these drugs. Further animal testing will also be important to measure absorbance of the drug in the body, its dissociation chemistry, its metabolomics and the mechanism of drug clearance.
