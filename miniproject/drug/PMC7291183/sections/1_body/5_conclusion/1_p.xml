<p id="Par36">In this global emergency, the entire scientific community is attempting effective treatment and prevention of the disease. To shorten the time and for the larger interest of humanity, some routine yet essetial processes like animal trials are bypassed in the process of development of vaccine and drug development. While options like drug repurposing are already adapted, with varying degrees of success, effective and targeted drugs and vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 infection are still awaited. Moreover, agencies like WHO and FDA have already given a green signal for clinical trials of vaccines bypassing the regular process of animal trials. Hence, it is important to access the positive and negative effects of the same. Choosing a suitable animal model is one of the main concerns for animal testing as the animal should mimic the response and effects to be generated after introduction of the drug/vaccine to humans. Importantly, some animal models such as the rhesus macaque, ferrets, mice, and Syrian hamster are proving to be successful for challenge by the SARS-CoV-2 with one or other similar symptoms as humans. However, a successful animal trial is not the only indicator of the success of any drug/vaccine due to physiological barriers; hence, the decision of bypassing the animal model needs to be taken with utmost caution. Further, saving time should not cost a large number of human lives as a failure of the drug/vaccine could have devastating consequences.</p>
