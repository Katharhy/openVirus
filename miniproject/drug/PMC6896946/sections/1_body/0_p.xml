<p>Influenza viruses pose a substantial threat to human health. Recent epidemics of seasonal influenza, poor vaccine efficacy, and the presence of zoonotic strains necessitate the need for disease intervention strategies to address transmission and infection. The development and implementation of novel intervention strategies to improve viral immunity and reduce the overall burden of disease are needed. Both the innate and adaptive immune systems contribute to influenza virus control and the virus itself employs various mechanisms to subvert effective innate and adaptive immune responses. As such, there is a need to address all aspects of viral immunology. This Research Topic highlights studies by experts in the field outlining current advances. A series of original research articles and a review article add to our understanding of limitations of current influenza vaccine and disease intervention strategies.</p>
