  <p>Partial alignments of oligonucleotide binding regions. Panels show six available sequences of the Wuhan-CoV, aligned to the corresponding partial sequences of SARS-CoV strain Frankfurt 1, which can be used as a positive control for all three RT-PCR assays. The alignment also contains the most closely-related bat virus (Bat SARS-related CoV isolate, bat-SL-CoVZC45, GenBank Acc.No. MG772933.1) as well as the most distant member within the SARS-related bat CoV clade, detected in Bulgaria (GenBank Acc. No. NC_014470). Dots represent identical nucleotides compared to Wuhan-Hu 1. Substitutions are specified. More comprehensive alignments in the Appendix. Reprinted with permission from ref. [
