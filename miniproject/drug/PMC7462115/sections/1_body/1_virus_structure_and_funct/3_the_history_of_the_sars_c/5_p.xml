<p id="Par44">Genetic-wise, the SARS-CoV-2 strains are less similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (about 79 and 52%, respectively). Sequencing of samples from China especially Wuhan indicated that this virus comes from the subgenus 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic>. Also, it shows that it is more analogous to the bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 viruses, both of which are bat-derived coronavirus strains, than to other recognized human-infecting coronaviruses, which caused the SARS outbreak of 2003 [

 <sup>− 4</sup> nucleotide substitutions per site per year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Their genetic sequence endures mutations at every replication cycle. The facts and information available so far indicate that SARS-CoV-2 emerged from one source instantaneously. However, as the virus is transmitted to more individuals, arising mutations should be investigated. All the evidence indicates that there is a relationship between bats and the novel coronaviruses, but other observations also show that another animal may act as an intermediate.
