<p id="Par40">The 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic> order, includes 
 <italic>Coronaviridae, Roniviridae,</italic> families and Coronaviruses (CoVs) are the greatest groups of viruses that relate to this order and the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Coronaviruses have a single-stranded RNA genome, 26 to 32 kilobases in length [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. They usually have a wide range of hosts to infect, such as amphibians and mammals, but their main hosts for infection are avian [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Mammalian hosts include mice, bats, masked palm civets, camels, cats, and dogs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], but lately, the number of new mammalian hosts infected by coronaviruses is growing at an alarming rate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. For example, fatal severe diarrhea syndrome in pigs, associated with an HKU2-related coronavirus of bat origin was reported in 2018 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. There are different coronaviruses, but the majority of them are associated with mild clinical symptoms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 is a virus belonging to the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family, which causes infection in humans; SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 can cause acute disease, while NL63, HKU1, OC43, and 229E cause mild symptoms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The first time that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) appeared, was during November 2002 in Guangdong, southern China, and the first time the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged, was in 2012 in Saudi Arabia [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. During 2002â€“03, more than 8000 infected cases by SARS-CoV with more than 774 deaths in 37 countries were confirmed. The MERS-CoV outbreak in September 2012, caused 2494 confirmed cases of infection and 858 mortalities, including 38 fatalities in South Korea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In late December 2019, many infected patients with viral pneumonia were reported, but notably, all of them were associated with the Huanan seafood wholesale market [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Next-generation sequencing confirmed the presence of a new virus which infected humans, and was provisionally named the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
