<p id="Par45">First, primary reported cases of coronavirus were in late December 2019, but at this time most of the bats in Wuhan were in hibernation. Second, as mentioned before, the first reported cases were from the Huanan seafood market, but facts show that there are not any bats at this market. However, other non-aquatic animals (like mammals) were accessible for sale. Third, genetic-wise, the detected sequence of 2019-nCoV has less than 90% similarity to the bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC45 viruses. This data indicates that 2019-nCoVâ€™s direct progenitor is not bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 [

Fourth, other animals such as the masked palm civet for SARS-CoV and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV were an intermediate host for both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, bats were acting as natural source and humans were final hosts [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] So, with these facts and information, it shows that the SARS-CoV-2 virus causing the Wuhan outbreak might have also started by bats, and it might have been transmitted to humans through another unfamiliar animal(s) which was accessible and available for sale at the Huanan seafood wholesale market.
