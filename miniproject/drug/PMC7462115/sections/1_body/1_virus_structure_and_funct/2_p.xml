<p id="Par39">Viruses have different types of structures that include genomes comprised of single or double-stranded DNA or RNA. The genome is encircled by a protective cover made of a protein known as the capsid, which is encoded by the viral genome. Such proteins that are structurally associated with the nucleic acid are referred to as nucleoproteins [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and can use viral digestive enzymes to dissolve the host cell membrane, thereby gaining entry into the cell. However, they do not contain various enzymatic systems apart from digestive enzymes which are used to enter the cell. So, because of their structure and their enzyme system as mentioned above, antibiotics are not effective for viral infections [

The first type of virus that was discovered in 1901 was the yellow fever virus. Every year new types are found, showing a rise in the number of known viruses that cause various diseases [
