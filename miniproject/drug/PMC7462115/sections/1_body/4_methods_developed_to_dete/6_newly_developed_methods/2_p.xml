<p id="Par142">Zhang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>], indicated that Cas13 can be used to target and destroy the different mammalian single-stranded RNA viruses. They produced a platform named SHERLOCK, which uses isothermal pre-amplification along with Cas13 to detect DNA or RNA. Their new protocol for SARS-COV-2, named “A protocol for detection of SARS-COV-2 using CRISPR diagnostics”, has been introduced on the website (
