<p id="Par107">With the improvement in molecular biological techniques, nucleic acid detection methods have developed at a fast rate and are now considered as one of the best methods for virus detection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>]. At present, a suitable method for the diagnosis of new pneumonia in clinics and laboratories is chest radiographic findings, but the most accurate approach depends on nucleic acid-based assays [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>]. However, the sample for nucleic acid assays from suspected patients of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly throat swabs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. This sample is not standardized and easily fails the detection process. The collection process of such samples is hazardous for medical personnel. The other method is RT-PCR, which is used for detecting and analyzing SARS-CoV-2 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. The number of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients is increasing quickly, however, laboratory and clinical detection methods are limited [
