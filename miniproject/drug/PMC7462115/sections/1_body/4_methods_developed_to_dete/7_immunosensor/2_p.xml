<p id="Par144">The principle of the method is that if an antibody is present in the sample, it binds to the antigens immobilized on the surface of the electrodes. When power current is running through the sample, if an antibody is bound on the electrodes, the current will decrease. This is because the antibody is bulky and will prevent electrons from moving further. A fixed concentration of antibody was applied, so as to be compared to the results of the specimens. This device showed high sensitivity, as the detection range for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were 0.001–100 and 0.01–10,000 ng/ml
 <sup>− 1</sup>, respectively. Also, it showed to be highly selective to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among others such as Flu A and Flu B. The applications of gold nanoparticles for virus detection have been discussed fully in a review by Draz et al. [
