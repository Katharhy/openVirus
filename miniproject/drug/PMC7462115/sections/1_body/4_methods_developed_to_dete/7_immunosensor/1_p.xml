<p id="Par143">Layqah and Eissa managed to fabricate an Immunosensor for detecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus, based on the array of gold nanoparticle-modified carbon electrodes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>]. The carbon electrode chip endured surface modification using AuNPs, so that the electron transfer rate and surface area would increase. In this work, AuNPs were electrodeposited on carbon disposable array electrodes; this was then used for electrode preparation. Such an immunosensor can be used for spiked nasal samples to simultaneously detect different types of CoV virus. This device was made out of eight electrodes, attached to the same chip. These electrodes were covered with human SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV antigens. Two of the electrodes were bound to BSA instead of antigens for comparative purposes and to be used as controls. Also for each antigen, two electrodes were modified so the results could be more reliable.
