<p id="Par119">They achieved some interesting data, which showed that, when RNA from infected cells is used as a positive control, assays indicate a range of seven orders of (2*10
 <sup>− 4</sup>-2000 TCID50/reaction), and when DNA plasmid was used as a positive control, then the diagnoses of the assays were below 10 copies for each reaction. The specimen from the infected cases were positive in the test.
