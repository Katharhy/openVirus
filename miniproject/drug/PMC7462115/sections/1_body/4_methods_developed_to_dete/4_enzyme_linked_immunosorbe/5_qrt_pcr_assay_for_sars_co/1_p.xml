<p id="Par126">Three different samples including a sputum specimen, throat swab specimen, and alveolar lavage fluid samples were obtained from suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The goal was to extract the RNA from these samples using the nucleic acid extraction kit (QIAamp viral RNA mini kit). The qRT-PCR was carried out using the ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR system. Two target genes, including the open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N), were setup together and tested during the qRT-PCR assay. This procedure used a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection kit, as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Shanghai ZJ Bio-Tech Co., Ltd). The result of the qRT-PCR test for 81 samples of SARS-COV-2-infected cases indicated that 42 cases were positive and the sensitivity was 51.9% (42/81). They compared the sensitivity of the ELISA IgM+ IgG, GICA IgM + IgG, and qRT-PCR methods and found significant variances between these methods (
