<p id="Par127">In another study, Amanat et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] found a new way of detecting SARS-COV-2 by using recombinant antigens extracted from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The method depends on reactivity to the immunogenic S protein of the virus. These assays were formed with a negative control specimen showing pre-SARS-CoV-2 background immunity in the general population and samples obtained from the SARS-COV-2 infected cases.
