<p id="Par136">The microarray-based method is a quick diagnostic procedure. In this method, at first RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus produces cDNA which is labeled with special probes during the reverse transcription stage. Afterward, these labeled cDNAs will be loaded onto the solid phase microarrays. Oligonucleotides are fixed on it, which will then go through a series of washing steps, and the free DNAs will be subsequently deleted.</p>
