<p id="Par35">After entrance to the body, the virus finds its target cells through its receptor, namely angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is mainly expressed on the epithelial cells of healthy lung tissue. But, it is reported that other types of cells may also present ACE2 thus making them vulnerable to the virus [

In this regard, there are some COVID-19 immunopathogenesis factors including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), macrophage inflammatory protein, (MIP-1A), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interferon gamma-induced protein-10 (IP-10), interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, and IL-10 that can be used as detection markers in COVID-19 patients [
