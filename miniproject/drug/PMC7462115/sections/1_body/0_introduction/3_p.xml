Generally, for the detection of viral diseases like COVID-19, different kinds of diagnostic strategies will be purposed including: inspection of physical symptoms, clinical evidence, radiological images and para-clinical findings. Para-clinical detection methods are also categorized as nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), viral sequencing, serological assays, and viral culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays.
