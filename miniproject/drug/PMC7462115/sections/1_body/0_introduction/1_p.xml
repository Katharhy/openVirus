<p id="Par34">On 30th January 2020 the WHO declared a global “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC) regarding the epidemic caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which started in a Wuhan seafood market, Hubei province [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This virus is genetically very similar to the bat SARS-CoV in the subgenus 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The WHO has currently named the disease, which has spread so rapidly throughout the world, as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has also been renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Coronaviruses got their name from their morphology when observed under a microscope. The virus consists of a core of genetic material surrounded by an envelope with protein spikes. This gives it the appearance of a crown. The word Corona means “crown” in Latin. Coronaviruses are zoonotic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] meaning that the viruses are transmitted between animals and humans. Coronaviruses can be classified into four genera (α, β, γ, and δ), and these viruses are detected in a very wide selection of animal species, including humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The virus that causes the COVID-19 disease belongs to the β-coronavirus genus. Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, three kinds of coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier, causing deadly pneumonia in humans. These include the severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] coronaviruses. Unlike previous coronaviruses that caused large-scale epidemics such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the transmission rate for SARS-CoV-2 is much higher, with an average of two to three people becoming infected for every already infected person [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted to healthy persons by exposure to the respiratory droplets of one infected person through close interactions. After entering the body, this virus is first observed in the nasal mucosa and mouth, and is then transferred to the lungs of the exposed individuals. People infected with SARS-CoV2 will experience weak symptoms, but in susceptible persons with certain underlying diseases like diabetes, hypertension, heart and autoimmune diseases, severe respiratory and lethal sickness or damage to some other vital organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney or the central nervous systems will take place [
