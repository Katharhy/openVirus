<p id="Par174">As for SARS-CoV-2, WHO advises laboratories that while encountering a suspected case, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), such as RT-PCR, should be carried out for virus detection. The world health Organization (WHO) has also presented several instructions regarding specimen collection. In fact in a recent investigation by Gu et al. [

Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), are the only methods confirmed by WHO for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections, so any proposed method should show sensitivity as high as that of the RT-PCR method. Furthermore, it also be more affordable and faster than the current available molecular methods.
