<p id="Par172">A systematic review carried out by Pang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">140</xref>] indicated that molecular tests such as RT-PCR show higher sensitivity and specificity than serological ones, such as ELISA. However, Xiang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">141</xref>] in a recent study on COVID-19 patients showed that while using ELISA and GICA kits designed for IgG/IgM antibodies and serum samples, sensitivity was high enough to compete with the qRT-PCR method. This can be promising with regard to modifying serological methods for viral infection diagnosis, as they can get sensitive enough to replace PCR-based methods. Moreover, they are less time-consuming than PCR and donâ€™t have the risk of showing false results, because of being contaminated [
