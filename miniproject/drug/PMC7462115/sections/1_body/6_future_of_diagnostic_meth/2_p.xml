<p id="Par171">Recently, Kaya et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>] reviewed the progress in electrochemical methods for the diagnosis of viral infections. These methods can be designed and specified for different viruses. They are fast, not expensive, and user-friendly. However, they must be modified to be suitable for a medical diagnostic laboratory, so as to compete with the currently most used methods, like RT-PCR. Most importantly, they should be as sensitive as molecular methods, such as RT-PCR.
