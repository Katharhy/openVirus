Moreover, nowadays, several other virus detection methods are available for viral diseases, the use of which depend on specific properties of each virus or virus family, however, they are not routine and specific for COVID-19 detection, which requires further research for the development of more accurate tests. Besides the type of sample and sampling procedures, clinical specimens are also of critical importance in acquiring the most reliable test results for COVID-19. In conclusion, the understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of various virus detection techniques and their proper implementation could prevent further virus outbreaks, provide efficient control of the current pandemic situation, and prevent medical staff fatigue, all of which will ultimately help in the promotion of public health and safety.</p>
