   <p id="Par157">the tip of the swab reaches the posterior wall of the nasopharyngeal cavity, rotate gently once, then slowly remove the swab and dip the swab tip into a tube containing 2-3 ml virus preservation solution (or isotonic saline solution, tissue culture solution or phosphate buffer), discard the tail, and tighten the cap.</p>

   <p id="Par158">Pharyngeal swab: The sampled person first gargles with normal saline, the sampler immerses the swabs in sterile saline (virus preservation solution is not allowed to avoid antibiotic allergies), holds the head of the sampled person up slightly, with one’ s mouth wide open, making a sound “ah” to expose the lateral pharyngeal tonsils, insert the swabs, stick across the tongue roots, and wipe both sides of the pharyngeal tonsils with pressure at least 3 times, then wipe on the upper and lower walls of the pharynx for at least 3 times, and dip the swabs in a tube containing 2–3 ml storage solution (or isotonic saline solution, tissue culture solution or phosphate buffer solution), discard the tail and tighten the cap. The pharyngeal swabs can also be placed in the same tube together with the nasopharyngeal swab.</p>

   <p id="Par160">respiratory secretions from the trachea with a collector connected to a negative-pressure pump;</p>
   <p id="Par161">insert the head of the collector into the nasal cavity or trachea, turn on the negative pressure, rotate and slowly withdraw the head of the collector, collect the extracted mucus, and rinse the collector once with 3 ml of sampling solution.</p>

   <p id="Par162">Deep cough sputum: Ask the patient to cough deeply, and collect the sputum coughed up in a 50 ml screw-capped plastic tube containing 3 ml of sampling solution. If the sputum is not collected in the sampling solution, 2–3 ml of the sampling solution can be added into the tube before testing, or add sputum digestive reagents of an equal volume of sputum.</p>

   <p id="Par163">Bronchial lavage fluid: Insert the head of the collector into the trachea (about 30 cm deep) from the nostril or the tracheal insertion part, inject 5 ml of physiological saline, turn on the negative pressure, rotate the head of the collector and slowly withdraw it. Collect the extracted mucus and rinse the collector once with the sampling solution (a pediatric catheter connected to a 50-ml syringe may be used as an alternative to the collector).</p>

   <p id="Par164">Alveolar lavage fluid: After local anesthesia, insert a bronchoscope through the mouth or nose, pass through the pharynx into the branch of the right middle lobe or the lingular segment of the left lung, and insert the tip into the bronchial branch opening; slowly add sterilized physiological saline through the biopsy hole of the bronchoscope, with 30–50 ml of saline each time, 100–250 ml in total, 300 ml at most.</p>

   <p id="Par165">Fecal specimen: Take 1 ml sample treatment solution, pick up a little sample about the size of soybean and add it into the tube, gently blow for 3–5 times, set aside at room temperature for 10 min, centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min, absorb the supernatant for detection. Fecal specimen treatment solution can be prepared in-house by the laboratory: 1.211 g tris, 8.5 g sodium chloride, 1.1 g calcium chloride anhydrous or 1.47 g calcium chloride-containing crystalline water, dissolved into 800 ml of deionized water, with the pH adjusted to 7.5 with concentrated hydrochloric acid and replenishing with deionized water to 1000 ml. Stool suspensions can also be prepared using HANK’s solution or other isotonic saline solution, tissue culture solution, or phosphate buffer solution. If the patient has diarrhea symptoms, collect 3–5 ml of stool specimen, gently blow and mix, centrifuge it at 8000 rpm for 5 min, absorb the supernatant to reserve for use.</p>

   <p id="Par166">Anal swab: Gently insert the disinfectant cotton swab into the anus for 3-5 cm in-depth, then gently rotate and pull out, immediately put the swab into a 15-ml screw-capped sampling tube containing 3–5 ml of virus preservation solution, discard the tail and tighten the tube cover.</p>

   <p id="Par167">Blood samples: It is recommended to use vacuum blood vessels containing the EDTA anticoagulant to collect 5 ml of blood samples. Nucleic acid extraction should be performed on whole blood or plasma according to the type of nucleic acid extraction reagent selected. For plasma separation, the whole blood should be centrifuged at 1500 to 2000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant will be collected in sterile plastic tubes with a screw cap.</p>

   <p id="Par168">Serum specimen: Collect a 5-ml blood specimen with a vacuum negative-pressure blood collection tube. Keep the specimen at room temperature for 30 min, centrifuge it at 1500–2000 rpm for 10 min, and collect the serum in a sterile plastic tube with a screw cap (
