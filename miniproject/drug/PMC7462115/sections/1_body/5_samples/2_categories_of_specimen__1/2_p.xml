   <p id="Par152">Serum specimens: Both acute-phase and convalescent serum specimens should be collected as much as possible. The first serum specimen should be collected as soon as possible (preferably within 7 days after the onset of illness), and the second specimen should be collected during 3–4 weeks after the onset of illness. A 5 ml sample of blood is required for each specimen. Serum specimens are mainly used for measuring antibodies, rather than nucleic acid testing.</p>
