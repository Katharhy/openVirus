<p id="Par65">Electron microscopy (EM) is one of the primary virus detection methods, especially in unsuspected and unknown agents. This tool can capture live images of cells and tissues with high-resolution. In most cases, the observed morphology can lead to immediate detection at the family level based on particle size, shape, and stability. Human viruses include two major morphological categories, naked or enveloped. Naked viruses are icosahedral; with rigid capsids that can endure drying processes and keep their spherical structure in negative stains. Enveloped viruses have an extra outer cover that is usually derived from host membranes. These viruses (except for poxviruses) may show various shapes [
