<p id="Par64">NCBI BLAST and PLAN are the most popular Blast tools but they have a limitation, and that is the acceptance of a limited number of sequences in the flat fasta format. On the other hand, Galaxy is more flexible with NGS data but not for novel virus discovery purposes. In general, map NGS reads the human genome and eliminates host reads after the Blast steps. The remaining data are analyzed to classify into non-human, microbial, or viral integrated sequences. This approach can make a difference in costs, ease of sequence assembly, and identification, the key distinctions lie in the nucleic acid purification techniques employed [
