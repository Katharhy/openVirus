<p id="Par55">Real-time PCR methods have been established for three important targets. 1. Real-time PCR is quicker than ELISA to establish, considering the development of antibodies for new viruses, 2. This method is more functional, especially in routine laboratories, 3. Real-time PCR is more cost-effective due as compared to the expensive antibody production for immunosorbent assays. Thus, it seems that real-time PCR enables high-throughput testing at a relatively low per-sample cost and great speed to set up a new assay [
