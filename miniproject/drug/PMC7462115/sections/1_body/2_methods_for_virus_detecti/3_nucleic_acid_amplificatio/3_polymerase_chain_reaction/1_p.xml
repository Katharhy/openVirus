<p id="Par54">The diagnosis of viruses through PCR methods was established in the early 1990s [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In this technique, many copies of one DNA template are made using primers, enzymes, and variable temperatures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Unfortunately, the small amounts of DNA liberated into the laboratory environment through the opening of the tubes after thermal cycling could eventually be detected by the PCR method, resulting in reporting false-positive results. To solve these problems, closed-tube and homogeneous PCR assays-commonly known as real-time PCR or quantitative PCR (q-PCR) are used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. This technique is quickly performed for diagnostic applications due to the generated fluorescent signal, which could be detected at a time (‘real-time’) or the end of the process (‘endpoint’) without the contamination risk. Initially, Real-time PCR for virus detection was developed to increase sensitivity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], thus playing a critical role where antibody methods could not be used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].
