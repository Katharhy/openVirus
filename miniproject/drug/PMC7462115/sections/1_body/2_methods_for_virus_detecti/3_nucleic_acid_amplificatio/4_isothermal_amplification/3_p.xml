<p id="Par58">Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) uses a recombinase to produce a complex with primers resulting in extension without thermal denaturation. The reaction is carried at a low reaction temperature (between 37 and 42 °C), which can easily be provided via a low power source. However, the production of non-specific amplification pieces is common due to the low reaction temperature. Nevertheless, RPA has a short reaction time, which is typically &lt; 30 min [
