<p id="Par59">An alternative isothermal amplification approach is to design primers such that the extension products contain single-stranded primer binding sites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Accordingly, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is the most ordinarily used method, using three pairs of primers (internal, external and loop primers), to get an amplification product which has single-stranded loop regions to which primers can bind without template denaturation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] at a reaction temperature of around 65 °C. The supplementary sequences of internal primers can stick to themselves to produce loop structures, while the extension of the external primers leads to the transposition of the extension products of the internal primers. The products of LAMP reactions are interchangeably oriented repeats of the target sequence. The addition of loop primers increases amplification due to the priming role of loops. These regions can raise sensitivity and reduce reaction times, which are desired outcomes.
