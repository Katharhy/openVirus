<p id="Par57">Helicase dependent amplification (HDA) uses a helicase to separate the strands of double-stranded DNA leading to primer annealing and extension of the supplementary strand via DNA polymerase enzyme at 65 °C. Reaction times for HDA are generally in the range 30–90 min. The function of this method relates to the short products of nearly 70–120 bp [
