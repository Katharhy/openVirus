<p id="Par69">High-frequency nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] are being considered as new sensors and devices. It has been proved that the selective molecular binding to the surface of nanomechanical oscillators may lead to detecting pathogen viral binding through observing their effects on the natural frequency shift of NEMS devices [
