 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>] used a resonating nanomechanical cantilever made from polycrystalline silicon to detect the immunospecific binding of viruses. Arrays of AcV1 antibody-coated polycrystalline silicon nanomechanical cantilever beams were used to detect binding at different concentrations of baculoviruses in a buffer solution. They calculated the mass of single-virus particles bound to the cantilever through a viable technique for sensitive detection of bound mass. Therefore, using this nanoelectromechanical device enables the selective detection of the virus through virus - antibody interaction (TableÂ
