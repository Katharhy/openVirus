<p id="Par77">In other electrochemical techniques, quantitative analysis applying SWV is one of the most promising mechanisms in the production of biosensors, because of their ability to provide more sensitive answers for fast biosensing as compared to differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) techniques. In pulse methods, the systems depend on the usage of pulse changes of potential, and the usual response is measured at a suitable time relative to the time of the pulse [
