 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Nanomaterials (NMs) in combination with new advances in biosensor structures help to provide developed novel electrochemical assays. These materials have great advantages because of promoting electron transfer reactions, electrical conductivity, great surface area, mechanical robustness, and good chemical stability [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. The electrochemical nanobiosensors have been applied to cancer diagnostics and detection of infectious microorganisms, such as viruses, etc. [
