<p id="Par81">The hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) immunosensor was also developed by applying electrochemical methods. Cocatalysis of nanoporous gold and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were applied as modifier factors. The developed immunosensor demonstrated a linear realtionship between peak current and concentration of HBeAg (1 pg/mL to 1 ng/mL as well as 0.064 pg/mL of LoD (limit of detection)).</p>
