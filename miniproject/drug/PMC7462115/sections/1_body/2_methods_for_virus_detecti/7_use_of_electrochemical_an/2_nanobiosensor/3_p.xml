<p id="Par76">Production of biosensors, applying the techniques of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) CV, and square wave voltammetry (SWV), helps fast biosensing for several kinds of analytes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is applied at surface area and interaction modification agents and the electrode surface [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Due to the occurrence of an electrochemical reaction at the electrode surface over interaction with the exact molecule, impedance biosensors have been used more in environmental monitoring of disruptive drugs and chemicals, the interaction between antibody and antigen and DNA strains. The EIS provides data regarding surface adsorption, ion exchange, charge transfer, and diffusion [
