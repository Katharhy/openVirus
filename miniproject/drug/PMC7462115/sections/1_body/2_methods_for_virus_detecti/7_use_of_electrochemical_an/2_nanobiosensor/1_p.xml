<p id="Par74">Analyses of biosensor-based researches have been very significant in the last three decades, due to their advantages that include low costs, quick reactions and responses, easy to use, and being user- friendly [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. A new achievement in biosensor technology is the immobilization of biologically sensitive substances on the surface of a biosensor. Bioreceptor bases are commonly considered as biomarkers, nucleic acids, enzymes, microorganisms, tissues, viruses, bacteria, and antigens. Electrochemical, various field-effect transistor-based methods, and optical methods are defined as the most popular traditional types of biosensors [
