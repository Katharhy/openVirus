<p id="Par82">The electrochemical DNA biosensing instrument is an effective device due to properties, such as fast response time, user-friendly, high specificity, and sensitivity. Electrochemical paper analytical device (ePADs) creates a perfect contribution to the sensor, because of its use of the inexpensive paper substrate. Singhal et al. [
