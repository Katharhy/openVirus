<p id="Par84">Aptamers are artificial single-stranded DNA or RNA oligonucleotides that have a high affinity towards a target, which they are designed to bind to [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. Aptamer-based biosensors or aptasensors, are fabricated by using aptamer as bioreceptors (capturing aptamer/probe) or transducers (signal aptamer/probe) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>] on the application of aptamers in virus detection and antiviral therapy, a list of virus-specific aptamers that have been assessed but are yet to be used in the detection of viruses and treatment of viral infectious diseases, is introduced for the first time. Based on the transducer type, aptasensors are either electrical or optical.
