<p id="Par94">Some materials such as the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) have a Piezoelectric effect which is the ability to generate an electric charge in response to applied mechanical stress. In QCM aptasensors, the aptamer is fixated on the quartz crystal electrode so it can capture the target. The binding of the aptamer to the target changes the quality of the pole, which is subsequently converted into detectable frequency changes [
