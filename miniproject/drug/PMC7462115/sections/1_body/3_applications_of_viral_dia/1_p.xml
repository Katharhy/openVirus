<p id="Par96">No single approach is optimal for detecting all viruses in all clinical situations. Therefore, it is vital to combine culture and nonculture methods to optimize viral disease diagnosis, yielding medically useful, cost-effective, and laborsaving viral testing results. In determining appropriate testing algorithms for the laboratory, one must consider a broad range of factors, including the patient population (i.e., age, immune level, etc.), clinical expressions, physician’s diagnosis, and time of year. However, with global travel and changing epidemiology of viral diseases, it isn’t possible to prepare a virology laboratory for unexpected epidemics or contamination [
