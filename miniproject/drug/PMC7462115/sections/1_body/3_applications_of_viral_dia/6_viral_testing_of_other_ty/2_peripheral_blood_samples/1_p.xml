<p id="Par104">Only a few types of viruses including CMV are isolated from peripheral blood. Rapid shell vial cultures of fibroblasts or H &amp; V Mix yield sensitive results within 24 to 48 h or sooner. Although the detection of CMV in blood samples through shell vial culture shows less sensitivity when compared to CMV isolation in traditional tube cell cultures. However, it’s better to use tube cell cultures for samples with very low levels of virus.</p>
