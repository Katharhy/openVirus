<p>Individual factors play a key role in the natural history of COVID-19. As already observed in SARS [
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and MERS [
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the most serious and lethal forms of COVID-19 are much more frequent in elderly patients, in males, and in individuals already affected by other pathologies. Epidemiological data collected in Italy at the time of this article shows that 95% of all deceased COVID-19 patients were ≥60 years of age and that 65.3% were males. Out of 1738 deceased patients for whom it was possible to examine clinical data, 82% had two or more pathologies, and the number of those suffering from a single pathology was four times the number of those with no pre-existing pathologies [

A recent meta-analysis of thirteen retrospective studies conducted in China (on a total of 3027 patients) has shown that age &gt;65 years is a risk factor for the development of severe forms / mortality from COVID-19 with an odds ratio (OR) of 6.06; according to the same study, male sex results in a risk factor with an OR of 1.76, while the following pathologies constitute independent risk factors for severe forms/ mortality from COVID: hypertension (OR = 2.72), diabetes (OD = 3.68), cardiovascular disease (OR = 5.19), respiratory disease (OR = 5.15) [
