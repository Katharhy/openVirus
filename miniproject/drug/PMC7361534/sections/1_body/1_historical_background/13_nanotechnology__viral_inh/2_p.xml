<p>Another strategy could be the development of nano‐biosensor to recognize and neutralize the epidemic of virus based on earlier development and detection of coronavirus. Nanosensor would open new possibilities to stop the outbreak of HCoVs by identifying the molecular species in real‐time. These sensors, based on semiconductors or hybrid nanomaterials, show rapid identification of the virus even at ultra‐low concentration.

 <xref rid="slct202001709-bib-0094" ref-type="ref">94</xref> reported the field‐effect transistor (FET) based biosensor for SARS‐CoV‐2. The novel biosensor was fabricated by immobilizing the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike antibody on the graphene surface through 1‐pyrenebutyric acid N‐hydroxysuccinimide ester (PBASE) as probe linker. The FET based biosensor exhibited a good response for clinical samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs and cultured SARS‐CoV‐2 with a limit of detection of 1 fg/mL. Further, thiol modified antisense oligonucleotides capped AuNPs showed better response and sensitivity against RNA sequence of SARS‐CoV‐2 (0.18 ng/μL virus load) by modification in surface plasmon resonance behavior.
