<p>Still, we are strugling to find out rapid detection kit, effective antiviral and drug to make potent theranostics against SARS‐CoV‐2. The peripheral protein sequence adaptation and genome modification of virus lead to the resistance toward conventional therapies. With the advent of nanotechnology in recent years, nanomedicine have emerged to be an alternative for conventional therapeutics.

Identification, treatment and prevention using nanotechnology tools would escalate the development to fight against COVID‐19 as frontline tools.

 <xref rid="slct202001709-bib-0082" ref-type="ref">82</xref> In the last few years, nanomaterials have also been investigated against various viral strains, and promising results were attained. A prominent approach, development of iron‐based magnetic nanoparticles (IMNPs) as nanomedicine would help immensely to deal with COVID‐19.
 <xref rid="slct202001709-bib-0080" ref-type="ref">80</xref> The movement of IMNPs can be controlled by the external magnetic field and targeted to affected organs invaded by COVID‐19, i. e., lung, throat, etc. without going to other organelles, as shown in Figure

 <xref rid="slct202001709-bib-0088" ref-type="ref">88</xref> Huy et al. reported the electrochemical synthesis of AgNPs and explored their activity against non‐enveloped viruses. The concentration of AgNPs up to 100 ppm or less was not cytotoxic, while antiviral activities were found in 3.13 ppm for 30 minutes of incubation with poliovirus.

The nucleic acid‐based antiviral drugs face problems of cell penetration. The fragments of nucleic acid, therefore, introduced with the help of nanomaterials. Such an attempt was made by Levina et al., where they prepared titanium oxide nanoparticles and polylysine containing oligonucleotides (TiO

 <xref rid="slct202001709-bib-0084c" ref-type="ref">84c</xref> The authors reported (‐) RNA strands as more sensitive for IAV segment 5. However, IMNPs have great advantageous here over other nanomedicine and drug because of less toxicity.
