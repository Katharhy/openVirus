 <xref rid="slct202001709-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, the bat coronavirus family transfer the virus to other bat species and then, further transfers to mammals, including humans. Similarly, the bird CoVs transfer to another bird species and further transfer in birds and mammals like pigs and whale.
