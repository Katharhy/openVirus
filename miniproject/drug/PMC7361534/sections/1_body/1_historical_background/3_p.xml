<p>CoVs are pleiomorphic, enveloped, with an average diameter of ∼120 nm, and club‐shaped surface projections 20 nm (glycosylated spike glycoprotein) as shown in Figure

 <xref rid="slct202001709-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> These viruses belong to family Coronaviridae, which shows crown‐like appearances under an electron microscope. The CoVs contain large, positively charged strands of RNA associated with nucleocapsid phospholipid protein and the genetic material is surrounded by viral glycoproteins. The CoVs have three types of membrane proteins, which include the spike glycoprotein, membrane protein, and small hydrophobic membrane protein. In addition to these proteins, other proteins like hemagglutinin esterase (HE) has been isolated from a different group of coronaviruses which are not present in the SARS‐CoV genome.
 <xref rid="slct202001709-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> The spikes of coronavirus cause infection in host cells. The structure of spike is clove shaped and has trimeric S1 head and S2 stalk, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="slct202001709-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). During infection, S1 (head) of virus spike binds to host cell receptor for viral attachment and S2 (stalk) allow viral genome to enter into host cell through fusion of viral and host membrane surface.
