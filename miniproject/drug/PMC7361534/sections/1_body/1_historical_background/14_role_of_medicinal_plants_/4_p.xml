<p>The anti‐infectives is highly dependent on natural products and their structures. Combinatorial chemistry techniques have emerged as a successful approach for optimizing structures and have been used effectively in the optimization of various drugs.
 <xref rid="slct202001709-bib-0102" ref-type="ref">102</xref> Few natural products that can act as starting materials for host‐targeting antiviral drugs show a broad spectrum in treating antiviral problems. Tannins that are normally found in plants acts as antimicrobial secondary metabolites. Hydrolysable tannins i. e. chebulagic acid and punicalagin possess inhibitory mechanism against bacteria, viruses, and eukaryotic microorganisms.
