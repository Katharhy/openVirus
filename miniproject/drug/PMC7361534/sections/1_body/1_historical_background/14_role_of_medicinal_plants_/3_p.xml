<p>Natural products present in common vegetables are explored due to its tendency to effectively bind the active sites of COVID‐19 protease and hinder the viral replication. Turmeric (
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic>), coriandrin, apple peels (ursolic acid), cucurbit vegetables (hederagenin), olive oil (oleanolic acid), rosemary, mint family plants (sageone), red pepper (apigenin), g
 <italic>lycyrrhiza glabra</italic> (glabridin) are some of the natural compounds that have better insight into the mode of inhibition of viruses and have the potential for further research.

 <italic>Anthocyanins</italic> represent a class of glycosylated polyphenol, that can act as a potential therapeutic antiviral compounds. It produces anthocyanidins whose nanoformulation are used in drug delivery systems and can reveal antiviral effects through a number of ways, i. e., by binding to host cells, inhibiting viral life cycle, or stimulating host immunity.
