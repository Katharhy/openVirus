<p id="Par6">The S protein can be fragmented into two functional subunits, N-terminal S1 subunit and a C-terminal S2 subunit (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Every monomer of trimeric S protein is approximately 180 kDa, and is liable for attachment and membrane fusion. In the structure, N- and C- terminal parts of S1 fold acts as two autonomous domains: N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Based on the virus, either NTD or CTD can function as the receptor-binding domain (RBD) [
