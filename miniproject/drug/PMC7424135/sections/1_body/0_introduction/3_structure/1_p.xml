 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Among the RNA viruses, the human CoV has the biggest viral genome [27–32 kilobase pairs (kb)] with 80–160 nm in diameter [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A classic CoV has no less than six open reading frames (ORFs) in its genome. All the structural and accessory proteins of CoVs are translated from it’s single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Two big overlapping ORFs, ORF 1a and ORF 1b, reside in two-thirds of the genome at the 50-terminus, and a third of the genome at the 30-terminus encodes for four conventional structural proteins in the sequential arrangement of spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) (50–30) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes polyproteins pp1ab, four structural proteins and six accessory proteins (3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, and 10), which is comparable to the structure of SARSCoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The viral ORFs are produced through purifying selection. The most restricted sequences corresponded to a few non-structural proteins (nsps) and membrane protein [
