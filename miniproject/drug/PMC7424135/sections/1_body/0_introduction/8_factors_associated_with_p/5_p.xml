<p id="Par28">Respiratory epithelium cells of smokers and patients with COPD express higher ACE2 receptor. Nicotine binds and enhances nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR), specifically the α7subtype (α7-nAChR) in lungs and various other tissues, particularly in central nervous system. Increased expression of ACE2 receptors is mediated by stimulation of α7-nAChR, and facilitates the SARS-CoV-2 entry of into the respiratory epithelium [
