<p id="Par55">Considering the characteristic high mutation rates of RNA viruses, more mutations may emerge within the viral genome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. Fortunately, coronaviruses likely have lower mutation rates in comparison to the other RNA viruses because of an intrinsic capacity for a few proof-reading activity due to 30-to-50 exoribonuclease. Lower mutation rates are partly balanced by high virus replication rate within hosts [
