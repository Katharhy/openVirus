<p id="Par12">Analysis of the spike protein sequences from all five identified isolates from the state of West Bengal (Eastern India), two mutations were reported at position 723 and 1124 in the S2 domain. This mutation decreases the flexibility of S2 domain. Another mutation at the downstream of the receptor binding domain (RBD) at position 614 in S1 domain was found similar with the sequence reported from Gujarat (a state of western India). These mutations may be responsible for the affinity or avidity of receptor binding [
