<p id="Par11">Out of 3617 available complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV2 from across the world maintained in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, the E protein possesses several non-synonymous mutations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In another study, analysis of 10 SARS-CoV2 sequences by genome alignment from the NCBI database, did not report difference in amino acid sequences within M and N proteins, while two amino acid variances in the S protein region were reported. Two possible “L” and “S” SNPs were found in ORF1ab and ORF8 regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A third study, utilising genomes of twenty-nine 2019-nCoV and thirty β-coronavirus, it was found that E genes were extremely conserved (99.56%), while S genes had lowest identity (92.87%), suggesting that S gene was of a rapid evolutionary rate [
