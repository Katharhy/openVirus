<p id="Par42">The spike (S) protein on the viral envelope, is believed as a major intention of vaccine development for the prevention of coronavirus infection. The choices to block viral ingress include the employment of natural neutralizing antibodies from convalescent plasma (discussed elsewhere within the manuscript) and engineered antibodies. Engineered antibodies or neutralizing fragments are often utilised in various formats. The antibody/Fc-receptor complex imitates viral receptor to intervene viral entry. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral entrance has been observed for several viruses. In such cases, antibodies mark one serotype of viruses and subneutralize another, causing to ADE of the second virus. A unique mechanism for the ADE is that a neutralizing antibody attaches to the S protein of coronaviruses like a viral receptor, triggers a conformational change of the spike, and mediates viral entry into IgG Fc receptor-conveying cells through canonical viral-receptor-dependent pathways [
