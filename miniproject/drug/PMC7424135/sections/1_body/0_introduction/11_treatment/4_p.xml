<p id="Par43">Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) might possibly alleviate the RAS-induced lung injury, and restrict heart and renal damage. It was reported that ACEIs and/or ARBs increases the ACE2 expression, and also inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) or stops angiotensin II type 1 receptor (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Considering that ACE2 expression might be associated with the vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2, intake of ACEIs and/or ARBs might predispose patients to the infection of SARS-CoV-2 [

However, due to the functional complexity of the RAAS and the lack of strong information on the activities of ACE2 expression in various tissues following the use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, it is difficult to speculate on the relevance of those ACE modulators [
