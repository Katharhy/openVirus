<p>Direct exposure to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market of Wuhan was linked to the first few cases of COVID-19, suggesting possible animal to human transmission. But the subsequent cases reported did not follow this mode of transmission. Therefore, the likelihood of human to human transmission was considered. Although symptomatic individuals are the most important source of COVID-19 spread, recent studies also suggest the probability of asymptomatic individuals transmitting the virus [

According to multiple studies, the incubation period of the virus ranges from three to seven days, but in some cases, it can take up to two weeks for the symptoms to develop. The main mechanism behind the transmission of this virus is believed to be through respiratory droplets generated during coughing and sneezing, similar to other viral respiratory conditions. Another possible mode of transmission is through exposure to a high concentration of aerosols in closed spaces. Hence, based on multiple studies, close contact between individuals is essential for SARS-CoV-2 to spread [
