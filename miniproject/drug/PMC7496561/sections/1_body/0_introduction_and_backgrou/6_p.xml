<p>A third approach is to redevelop new drugs to act specifically against individual coronaviruses. This would require a thorough understanding of the genomics and structural characteristics of the virus. This includes small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules or enzymes that will target specific viral enzymes, inhibition of host cell protease, or host viral endocytosis. Although this seems an effective option because of these drugs' specific anti-coronavirus properties, there is limited data regarding the safety profile as well as the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of these drugs. Hence, it would take a long time to prove the efficacy and reliability of these drugs in patients.</p>
