<p>Spike protein is a large protein (SARS-CoV-2: 1253 aa; SARS‐CoV: 1273 aa) seen in both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. The spike protein from these origins demonstrates a sequence identity of 76%. The majority of the variation has been seen at the N terminus. In the case of SARS-CoV, the S1 site on spike protein contains an RBD, which displays a high interaction with ACE2. It is hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 also binds to ACE2 to enter the human host cell by engaging this RBD. The RBD from the two origins exhibits a 73.5% sequence identity. It has also been speculated that the interaction between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD is weaker than that of SARS-CoV RBD. However, since both domains are highly looped structures, large variations in these two sites will lead to structural rearrangements that will result in even stronger interactions with ACE2. Unpredictability about these interactions will continue to persist until the structure of the SARS-CoV-2-RBD-ACE2 complex is extensively studied. Before any experimental results are available, any claims about the weaker binding of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD toward ACE2 compared to that of the SARS‐CoV RBD is premature [

It acts by binding to oligosaccharides found on the surface of numerous viral glycoproteins including SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein and HIV glycoprotein 120. Although griffithsin is currently under study for HIV prevention, its potency and efficacy for the treatment or prevention of SARS-CoV-2 should be researched further [
