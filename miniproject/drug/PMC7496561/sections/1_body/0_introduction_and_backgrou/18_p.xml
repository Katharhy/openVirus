<p>Coronavirus replicates by recruiting nonstructural proteins like 3CLpro, PLpro, helicase, and RdRpÂ [
 <xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These four non-structural proteins are key enzymes within the viral life cycle. In addition, the spike glycoprotein is indispensable for virus-cell receptor interactions during viral entry. These viral proteins were therefore considered as important targets to develop antiviral agents [
 <xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therapeutic options in response to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are the need of the hour. Here, we discuss the potential for repurposing existing antiviral agents to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection with their site of action as shown in Figure
