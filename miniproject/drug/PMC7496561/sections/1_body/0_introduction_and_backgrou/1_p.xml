<p>Today, the entire world has come to a standstill, grappling with a common enemy. Although we have had numerous outbreaks of diseases in the past, including Ebola, cholera,Â Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the novel coronavirus pandemic has undoubtedly proven to be a tougher challenge leading to millions of cases and a staggering number of deaths. An outbreak that was presumably first detected in a province in China in late December has found its way into almost every part of the world, leading to a global health crisis. Having a better understanding of the virus through various studies will give us an opportunity to hopefully mitigate the severity of this crisis.</p>
