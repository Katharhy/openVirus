This can help to analyze the effects of these drugs on viral replication. Several drugs have been identified using this method, which includes interferon I (interferon alpha, beta, kappa, lambda, epsilon, etc) and interferon II (interferon-gamma). Since the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and also the side effect profile of these drugs are already known, these drugs have a relative advantage. However, their efficacy against coronaviruses remains unknown as yet [
