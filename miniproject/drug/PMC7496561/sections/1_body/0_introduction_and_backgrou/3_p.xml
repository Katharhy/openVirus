<p>SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNAÂ virus whose genome encodes a number of structural proteins, non-structural proteins, and accessory proteins. The nonstructural proteins [3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)] and the structural protein (spike protein) play an important role in viral pathogenesis and hence they are being recognized as potential targets for drug therapy [
 <xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The knowledge of the structural components of the virus including its replication and the metabolic pathway has provided an opportunity to identify various drug target areas.
