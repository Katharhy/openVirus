<p>The spike protein is composed of two subunits, S1 and S2, which are cleaved by receptor transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), a member of the hepsin/TMPRSS subfamily [
 <xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S1 mediates attachment of the virus with the host cell and cellular tropism, while S2, with the help of two tandem domains, heptad repeats 1 (HR1) and heptad repeats 2 (HR2), plays a role in virus-cell membrane fusion. Thereafter, the viral genomic RNA that is released in the cytoplasm translates two different polyproteins, protein phosphatase 1a/protein phosphatase 1bÂ (pp1a/pp1b). These polyproteins encode non-structural proteins forming replication-transcription complex (RTC) in double-membrane vesicles. The replication of RTC proceeds continuously and results in the formation of a subset of genomic RNAs, which is responsible for encoding accessory proteins and structural proteins. The newly formed genomic RNA, along with nucleocapsid proteins, envelopes glycoproteins, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi bodies congregate and result in the formation of viral particle buds, which then attach to the plasma membrane resulting in the release of the virus [
