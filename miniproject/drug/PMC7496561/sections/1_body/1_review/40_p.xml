<p>Principle behind use: all coronaviruses like SARS-CoV, MERS CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are RNA viruses like HIV. According to various studies, the nonstructural protein of coronavirus, especially the main proteases or 3CLpro, is involved in the proteolytic processing of the replicase polyprotein, which in turn is vital for viral replication and maturation [

LPV showed an antiviral effect against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Vero E6 cells with the estimated EC50 (half-maximal effective concentration) at 26.63 μM [
