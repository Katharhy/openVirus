<p>Mechanism of action (MOA)
 <italic>: </italic>RDV (GS-5734), a nucleoside analog, is an RdRp inhibitor. In particular, the triphosphate form of RDV (RDV-TP) has shown to inhibit the RdRp of the virus. The host metabolizes RDV into the active triphosphate form. The primary mechanism of inhibition is the incorporation of RDV-TP into nascent RNA chains by RdRp. This causes delayed RNA chain termination during the process of viral replication [
