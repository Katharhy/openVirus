<p>Stem cell therapy has sparked interest in many researchers as they are resistant to tissue damage, promote tissue repair, and have immunomodulatory effects. Treatment with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been found to inhibit the overactivation of the immune system and, by improving the lung microenvironment, they promote endogenous repair [
