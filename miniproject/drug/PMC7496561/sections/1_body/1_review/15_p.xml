<p>MOA: therapeutic plasma exchange is “a therapeutic procedure in which blood of the patient is passed through a medical device which separates out plasma from other components of blood. The plasma is removed and replaced with a replacement solution such as a colloid solution (eg, albumin and/or plasma) or a combination of crystalloid/colloid solution” [

These include binding of the antibody to the pathogen and thereby negating its infectivity directly or through antibody-mediated pathways like complement activation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity [

Thereafter, the possibility of the usage of convalescent plasma for prevention and/or treatment gathered interest during the West African Ebola outbreak. Various other infections caused by West Nile Virus, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-1 have also been considered as potential targets for plasma exchange [
