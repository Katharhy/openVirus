 <italic>:</italic> chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have several mechanisms of action. Since these drugs are weak bases, they increase endosomal pH in host intracellular organelles resulting in inhibition of autophagosome-lysosome fusion and inactivation of enzymes required for viral replication [

Chloroquine demonstrates broad-spectrum antiviral activity against human coronavirus HCoV-O43 and orthomyxoviruses by interfering with sialic acid biosynthesis since these viruses use sialic acid moieties as receptors. This is due to inhibition of quinone reductase, structurally similar to UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerases, which is a key enzyme in the synthesis of sialic acids. Chloroquine exerts a potent anti-SARS-CoV-1 effect in vitro, which is due to a deficit in the glycosylation of a cell surface receptor, the ACE2 on Vero cells. Chloroquine has an effect on the immune system by its action on cell signaling and the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Cell activation by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling is an important step in the viral replication cycle. Chloroquine prevents phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in Tamm-Horsfall protein 1 (THP-1) cells as well as caspase-1, which was demonstrated in a model of HCoV-229 coronavirus. Chloroquine, being an immunomodulatory agent, induces inhibition of IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α in immune cells [
