<p>Principle behind use: chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are 4-aminoquinolines that are under trial for the treatment of COVID-19. Currently, many clinical trials are ongoing worldwide for chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, or these two in combination with other drugs. Chloroquine has been found to affect glycosylation of ACE2, the receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter cells [

Some of those RNA viruses include HIV, influenza A and B virus, Zika virus, and DNA viruses include the hepatitis B virus and herpes simplex virus. Coronavirus being an RNA virus, chloroquine has demonstrated in vitro inhibition of HCoV-229E replication in epithelial lung cultures. In another study, it was concluded that infections in recently born mice with the HCoV-O43 coronavirus could have been prevented by administering chloroquine through the mother's milk. These studies also exhibited an antiviral effect of chloroquine on a recombinant HCoV-O43 coronavirus [

Currently, there are several ongoing clinical trials to test the efficacy of chloroquine in combination with multiple drugs. On April 27, 2020, the FDA issued a EUA for the emergency use of chloroquine to treat adults and adolescents who weigh 50 kg or more and are hospitalized for COVID-19 when a clinical trial is unavailable or participation is not feasible. The WHO had also added the drug to its Solidarity trial. On June 15, 2020, this was revoked since the drug did not decrease the probability of death or expedite recovery [
