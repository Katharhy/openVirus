<p>Adverse effects and challenges: there have been some concerns regarding the safety of hydroxychloroquine in high doses for treatment in critically ill patients with COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="REF30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Hydroxychloroquine can cause serious cutaneous adverse reactions, fulminant hepatic failure, and ventricular arrhythmias like QTc (corrected Q-T interval) prolongation especially when prescribed with azithromycin [
 <xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Routine electrocardiogram (ECG) is therefore recommended before starting these drugs. Drug interactions should be taken into consideration, especially the administration of drugs that cause QTc prolongation such as antiarrhythmic, antidepressants, anti-psychotics, antihistamine, ondansetron, and moxifloxacin; LPV/ritonavir and RDV should be avoided. Administration of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine requires frequent monitoring of complete blood count, which includes red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC) and platelet counts, measurement of serum electrolytes, serum blood glucose level (since hydroxychloroquine can cause hypoglycemia), hepatic [liver function tests (LFTs)] and renal functions. Other contraindications include hypersensitivity reactions, retinopathy, porphyria, epilepsy, pre-existing maculopathy, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, recent myocardial infarction (MI), and QTc of &gt;500 msec [
