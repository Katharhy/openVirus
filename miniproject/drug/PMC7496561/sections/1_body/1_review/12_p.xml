<p>Adverse effects and challenges: as for safety, according to Gilead Sciences, infusion-related and anaphylactic hypersensitivity reactions were seen following RDV administration, which could be avoided with slowing down the infusion rates. RDV is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity reactions. Elevated transaminases were observed in patients with COVID-19 and, therefore, RDV should not be used in patients with alanine transaminase (ALT) levels of ≥5x ULN (upper limit of normal). The drug should be discontinued if patients develop ALT of ≥5x ULN or ALT elevation accompanied by signs or symptoms of liver inflammation or increasing conjugated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, or INR (international normalized ratio). According to reports, the antiviral effects of RDV is reduced if co-administered with chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate [
