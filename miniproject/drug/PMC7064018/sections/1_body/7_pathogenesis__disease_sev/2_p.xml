<p>Several studies suggest that antibodies against non-SARS-CoVs are highly prevalent in the general population including in children, suggesting that most individuals have been infected by CoVs and have potentially developed a certain degree of (protective) immune response [

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. There is no clear evidence on whether and how prior exposure to a strain of CoV can produce permanent immunity against the strain species or even cross-immunity for other CoV species [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Unlike other respiratory diseases that have a quadratic ("U"-shaped) lethality curve (killing infants and elderly, but sparing adults, presumably because adults have a higher chance to be immune against the infection), SARS-CoV-2 has a lethality that continuously rises with age (sparing children but mostly killing elderly). The severity and the clinical picture could be even related to the activation of exaggerated immune mechanism, causing uncontrolled inflammation as this has been suspected for SARS and MERS [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Hence, there is uncertainty on the impact of individual immune responses on the severity of SARS-like CoV infections.
