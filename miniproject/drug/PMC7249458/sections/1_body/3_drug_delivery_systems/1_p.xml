 </sup> As discussed previously regarding 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> drug screens, there are currently limited therapeutics that have clear clinical evidence of improving outcomes such as days of hospitalization required, need for ICU stay, and need for intubation/ventilation. As new small moleculeâ€“based therapies come through the pipeline, tissue engineers can continue to design drug delivery systems to (1) target medications to specific organ systems to increase bioavailability, and (2) extend the release of medications so that frequent administration is not necessary.
