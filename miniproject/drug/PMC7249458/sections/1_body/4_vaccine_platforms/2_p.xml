<p>Successful vaccination against pathogens relies on presenting antigens and stimulating specific elements of the immune system to build recognition and memory in both humoral and cell-mediated branches. With advances in immunology, biomaterials and tissue engineering are being leveraged to elicit specific host immune responses to augment vaccination strategies.

 </sup> In many of these systems, the biomaterial acts as the drug delivery vehicle for the vaccine as well as the adjuvant. Furthermore, the field is characterizing how the size, shape, and other physicochemical properties of biomaterials affect the behavior of immune cells.

 </sup> The goals of many of these systems are to target antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells and to drive specific responses such as Th1 or Th2 (different helper T classes). For example, conjugation of different receptors to protein-based particles can individually tune Th1 or Th2 response in a murine model.

 </sup> Biodegradable polymers, one of the primary workhorses as scaffold material in tissue engineering, have also been explored. PLGA nanoparticles drive Th1 immune response compared to no carriers and other biomaterials in a vaccine against Chagas disease in a murine model

 </sup> PLGA microparticles in combination with a chitosan/peptide conjugate coating have also been used as a delivery system to target specific mucosal cells and to deliver a swine dysentery vaccine with elevated IgA and IgG production in mice.

 </sup> When chitosan was mannosylated to promote endocytosis, an intranasal vaccine increased IgG levels in a murine model.

 </sup> For influenza, chitosan has also been modified to create a thermoresponsive intranasal murine vaccine against H5N1l.

 </sup> Silver nanoparticles have also been used to deliver inactivated influenza vaccine locally with some specificity to lung immune cells, resulting in greater IgG titers and reduced mortality in a murine model.

 </sup> While there are currently fewer studies regarding coronavirus vaccines, there has been some success in mice in which nanoparticles were prepared from a SARS-CoV-1 peptide sequence, and subsequent sera was successful in preventing infection of Vero cells.
