<p>In addition to various particle-based platforms, tissue engineering strategies have been harnessed to create scaffold systems for vaccination enhancement. With specific physicochemical properties, such as pore size, and profile of released recruitment signals such as granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, scaffolds of PLGA

 </sup> These particle-based and scaffold-based vaccine systems may be promising in translation against SARS-CoV-2. However, the majority have only been studied in mouse models at this point in time, and significant translational efforts will need to be undertaken for clinical trials. Modular platforms in which different antigens can be plugged in
