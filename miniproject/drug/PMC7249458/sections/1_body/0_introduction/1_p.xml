 </sup> Our hospital systems are rapidly filling with patients suffering from viral illness, and the capacity of resources such as emergency departments, inpatient wards, and intensive care units (ICUs) has become overwhelmed in some regions. There is a dire need for new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. Early diagnosis is critical in establishing quarantine and limiting the spread of outbreaks; diagnostics later in the course of an epidemic remain important, particularly in determining established immunity. For those infected, there is a current paucity in validated antiviral therapies, and there is no vaccine at this time, although multiple efforts are under way. Even after the predicted resolution of COVID-19, the increasing frequency of viral outbreaks (including the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus,
