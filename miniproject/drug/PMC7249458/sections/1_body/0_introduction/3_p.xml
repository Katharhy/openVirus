<p>In this work, the potential impact of tissue engineering in improving clinical outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic and future viral epidemics is explored (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Relevant background information regarding SARS-CoV-2 is briefly reviewed, and pertinent tissue engineering work is highlighted, including development of viral 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models, drug delivery systems, and vaccine platforms. Given the current state of the pandemic, it may be challenging to mobilize new efforts within the tissue engineering community in time to change practice in health care. New 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models, diagnostics, and therapeutics will need to be validated prior to safe implementation at the clinical level. In addition, many major academic centers are currently at limited capacity due to precautions to limit the spread of the pandemic. However, COVID-19 can act as a representative outbreak for which tissue engineers can learn from and begin preparations to lead the way to prevent and treat the next viral epidemic better.
