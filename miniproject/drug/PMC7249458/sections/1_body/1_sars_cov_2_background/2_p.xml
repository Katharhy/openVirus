<p>SARS-CoV-2 has the highest viral burden in the nares rather than the throat and is thought to be spread during coughing and aerosolization of droplets.

  <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
 </sup> Compared to SARS-CoV-1, spread of the virus appears to be more rapid due to higher asymptomatic carrier rates and a longer incubation time prior to symptom onset.

  <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
 </sup> Initial symptoms commonly include fever, cough, and fatigue and, less commonly, gastrointestinal manifestations.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
 </sup> Current biomarkers suggestive of infection include elevated lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, D-dimer, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and absolute lymphopenia.

 </sup> In the United States, the most widely available diagnostic test is polymerase chain reaction based, although antibody-based assays are in development and are available in other countries.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
 </sup> The virus primarily affects the lungs, causing ARDS in up to 5–10% of infected patients,

  <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
 </sup> although it has also been causing myocardial injury suspected to be due to high concentrations of ACE2 in cardiac tissue.

 </sup> Mortality is estimated to be 3–4%.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
 </sup> Given the extreme global morbidity and mortality caused by the pandemic, there is a dire need for a better understanding of molecular mechanisms of host–virus interaction, more rapid methods to screen potential therapeutics, and platforms to facilitate safe clinical translation. These are all areas in which tissue engineers are primed to make significant contributions for COVID-19, the next coronavirus epidemic, or other future viral outbreaks.
