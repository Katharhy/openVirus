 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) revealed that RDV derives anti-viral effects against MERS-CoV though inhibition of RNA polymerase. As with SARS-CoV investigations treated by RDV, similar outcomes were observed for MERS-CoV along with limited weight loss, increased pulmonary activity and decreased virus replication (Sheahan et al.,
