<p>Siegel et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) reported that GS-5734 can be used as a potential candidate for the treatment of Ebola and emerging CoV. Agostini et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) reported that CoV is susceptible to the RDV targeting the viral polymerase and the nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN). They compared the sensitivity of WT and ExoN (-) virus to RDV, which ExoN (-) virus showed a greater decrease in viral titer in the presence of GS-5734 relative to WT virus and the determined EC
 <sub>50</sub> value for ExoN (-) virus was around 0.019 M, whereas the EC
 <sub>50</sub> value for to the WT was determined to be 0.087 M (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2A</xref>(ii)) indicated that GS-5734 is integrated into viral genome and can be excluded by ExoN (Agostini et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Also, it was shown that the type of CoV, concentration of antiviral drug, type of anti-viral drug, and incubation time can play an important role on the inhibition of virus infection (
