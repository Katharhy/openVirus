<p>There is currently no approved antiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2 to treat hospitalized patients. Moreover, clinical trials over COVID-19 patients seems to be complicated due to several factors such as inability to apply a placebo, underlying diseases, and evaluating anti-viral drug efficiency. If the synergistic activity of RDV and other anti-viral agents in cell cultures is approved by the current Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with SARS-CoV-2, the outcome may propose a way for developing and performing clinical trials of the relative integration to RDV monotherapy and other anti-viral drug monotherapy for treating patients hospitalized with COVID-19.</p>
