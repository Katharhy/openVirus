<p>Over the recent years, animal model progression of RDV seems to orient primarily on CoV respiratory infections (Sheahan etÂ al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Clinical trials in selective patient populations with CoV or CoV-like diseases are needed to examine the efficacy of the developed drugs. Regarding safety data for RDV, some necessary studies in COVID-19 patients should be conducted to proceed the clinical trials. Studies over CoV-like diseases will probably require the enrollment of a large number of infected patients.
