<p>Arising viral disorders have resulted in meaningful catastrophic pandemics. Genetic exploration in animal models have shown a pronounced mutation of viral genome in the case of CoV, and have even pointed out some viruses indistinguishable to ongoing and past pathogenic strains in animals (Ge et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Woo et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Therefore, in the absence of FDA-approved therapeutics for reducing the human CoV infection, useful broad-spectrum therapeutic platforms against well-known epidemic and zoonotic strains probably pave a way for diminishing the current epidemic diseases.
