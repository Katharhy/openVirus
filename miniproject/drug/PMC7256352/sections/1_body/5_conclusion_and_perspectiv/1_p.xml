<p>Due to the emergence of a new respiratory infections such as the SARS-CoV-2, progression of animal studies and subsequent preclinical and clinical trials are required to explore the activity of RDV. Some preclinical explorations are ongoing to examine the potential of the RDV against the SARS-CoV-2. Given application history of RDV in treating a wide range of infections, as well as the outcomes from clinical trials in patients with SARS-and MERS-CoV, reinforces the rationale for additional trials of RDV against a wider range of infectious including COVID-19. The ongoing studies in SARS-CoV-2 supported by the WHO is expected to furnish potential data corresponding to RDV application in treating COVID-19.</p>
