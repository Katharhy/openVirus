<p>Although a recent research in China suggests bat as the potential source of the virus, there are ongoing researches to clarify the exact origin of the virus (Guo et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). Researches into the origin of SARS outbreaks have led to the discovery of many bat viruses. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to this category of SARS-related viruses (Fung et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The two genome sequences of 
 <italic>Rhinolophus sinicus</italic> show 80% similarity with SARS-CoV-2. The third genome of the 
 <italic>Rhinolophus affinis</italic> virus, RaTG13, resembles 96% similarity with SARS-CoV-2 (Andersen et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). To have better sense of this variation, it is similar to the rate of mutation observed over ten years in the human H3N2 influenza virus strain (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
