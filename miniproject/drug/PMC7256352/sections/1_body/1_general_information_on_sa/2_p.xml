<p>CoVs have four types of proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) (Hasan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). S protein is attached to the virus membrane and play an important role in binding and entry into the host cell; hence, targeting this protein with various drugs and inhibitors is one potential approach to combat these types of viruses (Chatterjee, 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Lai &amp; Cavanagh, 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Woo et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 has proteins on its surface that mediate viral infection by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (Batlle et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Chen &amp; Hao, 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Therefore, one promising way to stop infection by SARS-CoV-2 is to find a compound that blocks the receptor, and consequently prevent the infection by preventing the interaction of S protein with ACE2 receptor (Andersen et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Joshi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The CoV also has 16 unstructured protein (Nsp 1-16) encoded by ORF1a/1b which act as important co-factors for activation of viral replication enzymes (Guo et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) (
