<p>In the past days, it has been repeatedly reported that a vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 has been discovered, but vaccines, like other medicines, require a lengthy testing process to be approved for medical applications (Ahmed et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Prompetchara et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). One strategy to date is the replication of a piece of virus RNA that could one day serve as a vaccine (Enayatkhani et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Although, well-developed DNA sequencing devises has let to rapid genetic sequencing, vaccine development is costly, complex, and time intensive (Plotkin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). This includes finding a viral sequence that, while providing memory to the immune system, does not lead to an acute inflammatory reaction. Achieving this goal requires laboratory experimentation on animal models before subjecting humans. In addition, once the vaccine is discovered, it is not possible to dispatch the sample quickly and easily worldwide. Therefore, pharmaceutical companies have generally found it more profitable to invest in drugs that are used for chronic medical conditions. The CoV, as in case of influenza, may undertake mutations and therefore would require continuous vaccine development.
