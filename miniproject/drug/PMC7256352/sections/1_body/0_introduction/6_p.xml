<p>Furthermore, a combination of BSAAs can be applied against a wider range of viruses, such as those that are not yet well recognized or drug-resistant viruses (Wang, Cao, etÂ al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Potential clinical trials are currently being conducted on these drugs and their results will be published soon (Li &amp; De Clercq, 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Senanayake, 
 <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Perhaps in a near future, BSAAs will be used to treat COVID-19 patients. Although a number of BS have been reported to date, in this review we focused on the RDV as a potential compound that has been assessed on the animal models and reaches the clinical phase against MERS -CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
