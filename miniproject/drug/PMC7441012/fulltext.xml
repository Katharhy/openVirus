In response to previous epidemics and pandemics, including the Black Death, Spanish Flu, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Ebola, surgeons have had to adapt to constraints and evolve their practice of surgery. Our goal was to explore how surgeons responded to these historic infectious threats and identify how these threats affected the practice of surgery in the form of a historical summary.

In response to PPE shortages, the Defense Production Act, donations, and sterilization procedures have been leveraged to accelerate production and maintain inventory. For example, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation and vaporous hydrogen peroxide have been used to disinfect N95 masks.<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> Reusable PPE may help surgeons in hospitals with PPE shortages stay safe throughout the pandemic. As public health measures restricting elective procedures are relaxed, surgeons and hospitals must balance patient needs with safety and equipment availability. Past epidemics have taught us to prepare for this task. To minimize transmission risk, hospitals can now refer to the &#x0201c;American Hospital Association Road Map to Resuming Elective Surgeries,&#x0201d; published in conjunction with the ACS, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, and the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses.<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> Contingency planning for potential resurgence of cases, preparations for an unstable workforce, and preoperative testing for patients undergoing surgery&#x02013;many of which are lessons from the Ebola epidemic&#x02013;may facilitate resumption of surgical operations.</p><p id="p0125">The surgical community has already developed and implemented several innovations. One such innovation is a clear sterile drape that forms a barrier between the operative field and the surgeon during invasive procedures such as tracheostomy.<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> Outside the operating room, clear plastic intubation boxes with protective sleeves are being used to shield providers during aerosol-generating procedures.<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref> Tele and digital medicine has also proven critical to reducing SARS-CoV-2 exposure and ensuring continuity of care for patients with chronic conditions. Previously touted as an opportunity to expand healthcare access to rural and underserved populations, tele and digital medicine&#x02019;s role has expanded to preoperative assessment, postoperative evaluation, and other surgical follow-up visits. Having shown similar health outcomes as in-person visits and with ancillary benefits such as reduced travel costs and time away from work, tele and digital medicine will likely play an increasingly prominent role in caring for surgical patients.<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>
</p><p id="p0130">As the pandemic continues, the welfare of surgical frontline workers ought to be prioritized, as many are experiencing burnout, fatigue, anxiety, and other physical and mental burdens. We may be living in uncertain and unique times, yet the surgical community is no stranger to uncharted territory. Lessons applied from the past contribute to today&#x02019;s innovation and will undoubtedly inform tomorrow&#x02019;s direction (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>

The principles of accepting a reasonable level of risk and not discriminating based on seropositivity have prevailed.</td></tr><tr><td>SARS</td><td>The SARS outbreak demonstrated how systemic responses to highly infectious diseases must be flexible.
