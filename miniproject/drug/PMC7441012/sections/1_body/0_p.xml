 </xref> The healthcare system has also been forced to adapt to the pandemic. For example, after cancellation of elective operations, some surgeons found themselves in nontraditional healthcare roles. But although the COVID-19 pandemic is the most substantial infectious disease challenge faced by many surgeons in their practice lifetime, pandemics can also be transformative. In response to previous epidemics and pandemics, including the Black Death, Spanish Flu, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Ebola, surgeons have had to adapt to constraints and evolve their practice of surgery. Our goal was to explore how surgeons responded to these historic infectious threats and identify how these threats affected the practice of surgery in the form of a historical summary. Insights gained from previous pandemics may provide some solace to those currently responding to COVID-19, and help us look forward to some of the good that may result from an otherwise negative situation.
