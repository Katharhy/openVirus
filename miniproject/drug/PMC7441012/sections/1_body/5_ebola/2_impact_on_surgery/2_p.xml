 </xref> Operative interventions that minimized fluid exposure (ie minimally invasive approaches) and nonoperative management for conditions such as appendicitis, were emphasized. The CDC also published guidelines on donning and doffing PPE, and designating operating rooms for procedures on patients with EVD, practices evolved during the SARS outbreak.
