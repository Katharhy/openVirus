<p id="p0120">Familiar challenges continue. Similar to the Ebola epidemic, the COVID-19 pandemic poses special concern for resource-poor environments such as rural community hospitals. In response to PPE shortages, the Defense Production Act, donations, and sterilization procedures have been leveraged to accelerate production and maintain inventory. For example, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation and vaporous hydrogen peroxide have been used to disinfect N95 masks.

 </xref> Reusable PPE may help surgeons in hospitals with PPE shortages stay safe throughout the pandemic. As public health measures restricting elective procedures are relaxed, surgeons and hospitals must balance patient needs with safety and equipment availability. Past epidemics have taught us to prepare for this task. To minimize transmission risk, hospitals can now refer to the “American Hospital Association Road Map to Resuming Elective Surgeries,” published in conjunction with the ACS, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, and the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses.
