<p id="p0050">Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a 
 <italic>Lentivirus</italic>, can cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and is believed to have originated from chimpanzees in the Democratic Republic of Congo around 1920. HIV is most commonly acquired via sexual activity and sharing needles or syringes. Common clinical manifestations include fever, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. In advanced stages, the virus impairs the bodyâ€™s cellular immunity and patients become susceptible to a range of opportunistic infections, the leading cause of death. The US HIV/AIDS epidemic began in 1981. As of 2016, an estimated 1.2 million people in the US are living with HIV, of whom 1 in 7 are unaware of their carrier status. With antiretroviral drug advances, the number of deaths among adults and adolescents has declined from a peak of 50,876 deaths in 1995 to 15,820 deaths in 2018.
