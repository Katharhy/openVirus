<p id="p0035">Human flu pandemics are caused by influenza A, an Orthomyxoviridae that is divided into subtypes based on 2 surface proteins: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). The H1N1 influenza A virus responsible for the 1918 flu pandemic, colloquially termed the Spanish Flu, was transmitted via contact with contaminated fluid or tissue or through infectious droplets.

 </xref> Influenza infected 25% of the global population, and its death toll of 20 to 50 million was greater than all casualties of World War I. Although most influenza outbreaks disproportionately affect extremes of the age spectrum, this influenza strain had a uniquely high mortality rate for young adults.
