<p id="p0045">The Spanish Flu pandemic advanced principles that continue to inform surgical practice: hygiene and personal protective equipment. As influenza overwhelmed civilian healthcare systems, field hospitals were erected in schools, gathering halls, and large private residences.

 </xref> Compared with a 40% mortality rate for influenza patients admitted to conventional hospitals in the area, the mortality rate reported at Camp Brooks was approximately 10%. Of several measures introduced at Camp Brooks, widespread use of protective masks was most noteworthy. Any provider interacting with patients was required to wear an improvised mask consisting of 5 layers of gauze on a wire frame (made from a gravy strainer) covering the nose and mouth.
