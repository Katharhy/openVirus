<p>Since the SARS-CoV-2 is a newly discovered pathogen (first infection being reported in December 2019) [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], little data about the coinfection with MTB could be found (especially considering the long incubation period of MTB from exposure to developing the disease, often with a slow onset) [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Still, the existent studies showed that TB status might play a role in the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in SARS-CoV-2 coinfection, considering the cases described in China and India [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] concluded that patients with TB are not more likely to get COVID-19, but TB is associated with a 2.1-fold increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease, although the statistical difference was not significant. Moreover, no increased risk for mortality in coincident COVID-19 and TB was found. However, this study included a small number of TB patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the publication bias was not rigorously assessed. Thus, the findings should be interpreted with caution. Similarly, in a cohort of 69 patients, in all cases, COVID-19 contributed to worsen the prognosis of TB patients and/or cause death, although TB was not a significant determinant of mortality [
