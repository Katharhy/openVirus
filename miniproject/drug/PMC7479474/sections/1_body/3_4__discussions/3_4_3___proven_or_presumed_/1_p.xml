<p>One of the most effective ways to prevent diseases caused by pathogens, like bacteria or viruses, proved to be vaccination [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Since the first discovery of SARS, extensive research was done to find a vaccine to prevent the disease [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Different vaccine types were tested: inactivated or live-attenuated virus, DNA-based vaccines, recombinant proteins, virus-like particles, and viral vectors with some promising efficiency, but with neither being finally approved for use [

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], so previous studies on protective immune responses SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV may aid vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Considering that there is no approved vaccine neither for SARS-CoV-1 nor for MERS-CoV, other options are considered, such as the vaccine used for TB prevention [
