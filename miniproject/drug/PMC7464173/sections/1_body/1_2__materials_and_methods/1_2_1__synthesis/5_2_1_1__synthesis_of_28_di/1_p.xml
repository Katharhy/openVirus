 <italic>N</italic>-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP; 0.1 mmol, 12 mg) was added. The obtained mixture was cooled in an ice-water bath to 0 Â°C, then diethylchlorophosphate (2 mmol, 0.29 mL) was added dropwise. The reaction was carried out under argon atmosphere for 9 h. Then, the volatile components were evaporated on a vacuum evaporator. Dichloromethane (15 mL) was added to the residue and washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and water. The organic layer was dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate (VI), then concentrated until dry. The product was purified by column chromatography (SiO
