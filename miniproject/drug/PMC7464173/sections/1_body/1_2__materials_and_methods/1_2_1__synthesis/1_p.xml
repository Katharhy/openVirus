<p>All solvents used in reactions were dried and purified according to standard procedures. The progress of reaction was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) (silica gel 60 254F plates, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The chromatographic plates were developed in a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate (3:2,

 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>). The spots were visualized by spraying them with a solution of 5% sulfuric acid and heating to 100 Â°C. The compounds were purified by column chromatography (silica gel 60, particle size &lt; 63 m, Merck) in the solvent system indicated.
