<p>Among the drugs used in the treatment of viral infections, compounds containing phosphate or the phosphonate moiety within their structure have an important place. Examples of such drugs include cidofovir (active against herpes simplex virus HSV-1 and HSV-2, as well as Epstein–Barr virus), adefovir and pradefovir (active against HBV), tenofovir (active against HIV-1, HIV-2, and HBV), and foscarnet (active against herpes viruses and HIV) [

 <xref rid="B8-biomolecules-10-01148" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Indeed, several patents describing phosphorus derivatives of triterpenes with antiviral activity can be found in the literature [

 <xref rid="B11-biomolecules-10-01148" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Anti-HIV-1 activity has also been reported for BVM analogues that contain a phosphate or phosphonate substituent in the isopropenyl moiety [

 <xref rid="B12-biomolecules-10-01148" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] demonstrates in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value similar to that of BVM, and with a lower cytotoxicity. The results of molecular docking into the Gag C-terminal domain of the HIV-1 capsid–spacer peptide 1 (CA-CTD-SP1) fragment, which is the molecular target of maturation inhibitors, suggest that the potential molecular mechanism of these compounds may be the same, but is further enhanced by the introduction of a phosphonate moiety [
