<p>The subject of this work is the synthesis of new betulin phosphate derivatives having carboxyacyl substituents at the C3 position and an evaluation of their activity against HIV-1. For newly synthesized compounds, molecular docking to the active sites of CA-CTD-SP1 as the molecular target of HIV maturation inhibitors was performed. Moreover, recent in silico studies indicate the possibility of using triterpenoids as substances that may interact with various SARS-CoV-2 proteins [
