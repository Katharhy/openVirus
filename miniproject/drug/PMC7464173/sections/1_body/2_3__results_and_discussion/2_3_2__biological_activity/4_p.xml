<p>An important issue in the study of new chemical substances considered as potential drug candidates is the analysis of their physicochemical parameters. The in silico pharmacokinetic study is being used in the development of new drugs with good oral bioavailability, low toxicity and the least side effects. For phosphate derivatives
