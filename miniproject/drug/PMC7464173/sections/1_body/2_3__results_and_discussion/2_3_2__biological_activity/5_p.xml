<p>The hydrophobicity of compounds was determined on the basis of Log P values. The Log P parameter determines the strength of the drug and its distribution in the body after absorption stage. The obtained Log P values (9.20–10.65) of triterpene derivatives indicate poor permeability across the cell membrane. The compounds shown in the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-biomolecules-10-01148">Table S1</xref> having a number of rotational bonds in the range 8–13 show high conformational flexibility and good binding affinity with the binding pocket. Topological polar surface area (TPSA) is important criteria for the determination of oral bioavailability. Compounds that meet the criterion that TPSA ≤ 140 Å may show oral bioavailability [
