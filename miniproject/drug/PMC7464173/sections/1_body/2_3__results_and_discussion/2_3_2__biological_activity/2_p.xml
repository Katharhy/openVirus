<p>As can be seen, betulin 
 <bold>1</bold> and betulin phosphate 
 <bold>2</bold> did not demonstrate the ability to inhibit HIV replication in the tested range of concentrations. Betulin derivatives containing a 3′,3′-dimethylglutaric group that exhibit significant activity against HIV-1 are described in the literature [

 <xref rid="B35-biomolecules-10-01148" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Corresponding phosphorus derivative 
 <bold>4</bold> demonstrated good activity and selectivity that were higher than obtained for 4′,4′-dimethylglutaric derivative 
 <bold>5</bold>. On the other hand, compound 
 <bold>4</bold> was more active than the previously described 3′,3′-dimethylglutaric derivatives of betulinic acid, which in the C30 position contained a diethylphosphate or diethylphosphonate group (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.6 μM and 0.9 μM, respectively) [
