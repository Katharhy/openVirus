<p>Betulin 
 <bold>1</bold> obtained from birch bark harvested in southern Poland by extraction with dichloromethane was used as the starting substrate. After concentrating the extracts, the produced substance was purified by crystallization from ethanol. In the first stage, a phosphorylation reaction of a hydroxyl group at the C28 position was carried out using diethyl chlorophosphate. After purification, 28-diethoxyphosphorylbetulin 
 <bold>2</bold> was obtained at a yield of 86%. Compound 
 <bold>2</bold> was then reacted with 3′,3′-dimethylsuccinic, 4′,4′-dimethylglutaric, and 3′,3′-dimethylglutaric anhydride according to the method previously described [
 <xref rid="B33-biomolecules-10-01148" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Derivatives 
 <bold>3</bold>–
 <bold>5</bold> were obtained at a yield of 32−38%.
