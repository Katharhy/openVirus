<p>In order to validate docking results a molecular dynamics simulation (MD) has been performed. After a 10-ns run, a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the atomic positions of ligand–protein complexes have been calculated. Low value of ligand RMSD followed by relatively constant value of protein backbone RMSD indicate complex stability and validate docking protocol. MD simulation has been performed for compound 
 <bold>3</bold>, possessing the lowest score for binding energy. Both ligand and protein showed low RMSD values below 2 Å, proving stability of the ligand–protein system (
