<p>According to the results of docking (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-biomolecules-10-01148">Table S1</xref>) obtained from AutoDock Vina, four potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors (
 <bold>BVM</bold>, betulinic acid, and compounds 
 <bold>4</bold> and 
 <bold>6)</bold> were selected based on a lower negative dock energy value. Detailed interactions between ligands and selected SARS-CoV-2 proteins are included in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-biomolecules-10-01148">Supplementary Materials (Figures S3–S6 and Tables S2 and S3)</xref>. MD simulation has been performed for compounds possessing the lowest score for binding energy (
 <bold>BVM</bold>, betulinic acid, and compounds 
 <bold>4</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold>). Low fluctuations of RMSD of all proteins indicate that they reached stable conformation (
