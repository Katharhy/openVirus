<p>Due to 2020’s COVID-19 pandemic, another group of RNA viruses—coronaviruses—have become interesting to scientists. The majority of its large genome is transcribed and translated into polypeptide encoding proteins. These proteins are important for gene expression. The main protease (M
 <sup>pro</sup>), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) are key enzymes for coronavirus replication [

 <sup>pro</sup> mediates the maturation of non-structural proteins (Nsps), essential in the life cycle of the virus [
