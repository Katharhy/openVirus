<p>The last step of HIV-1 replication occurs after release of immature virion outside host cell. During maturation process, viral protease cleaves Gag precursor protein to individual matrix (MA), spacer peptide (SP1), capsid (CA) and nucleocapsid (NC) peptides. This step is essential to produce mature and infectious virions. Recent studies report that the immature CA-CTD-SP1 assembles to create a hexameric structure which forms a cone-shaped core built up with multiple hexameric proteins. Protease can access the cleavage site only after the six-helix bundle unfolds [
