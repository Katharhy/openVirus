<p>Fostering practical approaches for sustainable development in human/community awareness and improving BCC impact are important in reducing and eliminating the persistent public health threat of dengue and emerging arboviral diseases and their vectors. In achieving this goal, leveraging on the community-based 'One Health' approach is paramount in elucidating the relationship between animal-human and environment interactions. Also, there is a need to increase vulnerable populations awareness and for health education promotion in schools/universities, culture/faith-based, stands/tribunes, and community/mass gatherings to improve people's knowledge of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, incriminated vectors breeding habitats, biological behavior, disease transmission dynamics, and complications to develop robust and sustainable community-based sanitation and hygiene practices to combat arboviral/zoonotic disease temporal/spatial spread.
