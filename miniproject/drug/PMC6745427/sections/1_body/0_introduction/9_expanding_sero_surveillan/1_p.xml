<p>Expansion of field and laboratory sero-surveillance and research among asymptomatic populations at risk (including pilgrims, school children, and expatriate workers) is crucial in documenting and generating data on arboviral diseases prevalence and potential risk factors. This is vital to establish robust evidence-based and sustainable early warning indices, policy planning and prediction, response approaches, and action plans. Moreover, it is imperative to enhance quality data and data sharing for evidence community-based risk reduction tactics and management. Promoting community participation and education programs remain key prevention and elimination tactics particularly during annual Hajj and seasonal Umrah pilgrimage, which may need quarantine measures in place to protect tourists from tropical and subtropical endemic high-risk areas in the GCC, Central/South America, Latin America, Asia-pacific, and Africa.
