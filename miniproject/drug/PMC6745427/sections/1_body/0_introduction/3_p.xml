 </sup> Understanding the drivers of mosquito abundance and competence, dengue and other arboviral infection threshold and seroconversion requires further research to elucidate viral host reservoirs and transmission routes (e.g., blood products transfusion, breastfeeding, transplacental, and sexual intercourse). Surveillance and monitoring of performance metrics are the keys to control and eliminate these viruses in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-prone countries.
