 </sup> In 2006, a total of 10 000 infected dengue cases were recorded compared to a significant upsurge of more than 2.5 million at risk in 2016 in more than 130 countries. Zika virus causal factor infection is associated with congenital malformations (microcephaly) and neurological complications (Guillain-Barre syndrome) in children and maternal health issues and remains a serious concern in neighboring
