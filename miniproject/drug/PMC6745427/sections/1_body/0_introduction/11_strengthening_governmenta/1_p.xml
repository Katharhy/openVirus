<p>Although laudable financial support has been devoted to fighting dengue, the threat of dengue and other arboviral diseases epidemic potential remains a public health concern locally and in the region. Promoting public-private stakeholders partnership (e.g., health and environment providers, pharmaceutical companies, non-government organizations, and other sectors), renewed leadership commitment and investment in collaborative and participative research in regional biosecurity including ample funding of research and development is essential for more sensitive diagnostics and tailored cost-effective community-based programs. Importantly, safe and effective dengue and Zika drugs and vaccines discovery for pilgrims/traveler immunization programs should remain a priority in curbing the global health security and other emerging pandemics.
