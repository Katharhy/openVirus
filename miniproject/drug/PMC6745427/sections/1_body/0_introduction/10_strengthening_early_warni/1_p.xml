<p>The use of pilot surveillance stations for early warning detection of disease outbreak accompanied by efficient data analysis and the implementation of remote sensing technologies and geographical information system analysis to predict communities at risk and forecasting the spatial/temporal landscape occurrence of the disease incriminated vectors could be used to sustain control and eliminate the threat of arboviral diseases. The use of such a modeling approach is of vital importance to enhance community/government preparedness and resilience tactics, pathogenic vector mapping, and implementing behavior change.</p>
