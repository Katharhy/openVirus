The NOS uses a star chart with ratings from 0 to 9 for case–control and cohort studies. Since the requirements for a study’s high or low quality are not well known, we considered a study with a higher score than the six of each form of study to be a high-quality study. Among included studies, two scored seven and high, three scored six and the other two studies scored less than six and were therefore considered low quality. The NOS scores for the included studies are shown in Table
