<p id="Par35">Two reviewers (JTL and BTA) independently assessed study quality based on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale assessed the selection, comparability and exposure of a case-control study and selection, comparability, and outcome of a cohort study.
