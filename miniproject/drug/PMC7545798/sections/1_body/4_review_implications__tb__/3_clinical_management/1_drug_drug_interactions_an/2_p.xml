<p id="Par63">A study showed an association between corticosteroid use and lower mortality in COVID-19 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Using a glucocorticoid in the early stages of the prognosis for a brief period of time could minimize the inflammation, but longer-term use could result in the risk of HIV and/or TB activation and even lack of treatment with TB. Careful use of corticosteroids with low-to-moderate doses in short courses is advised [

Besides, fibrosis and extensive pulmonary pathology secondary to TB and COVID-19, as defined in the introduction, can reduce drug penetration at the lung sites. It is a significant risk factor for bad TB outcomes in the event of potential infection or reactivation of TB [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. This may also induce MDR-TB or extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) or recurrent pneumonia. Then, special considerations should be taken into account in the clinical management of COVID-19/TB lung fibrosis. Some RCTs are currently underway evaluating the safety and effectiveness of antifibrotic therapies on COVID-19 lung fibrosis [
