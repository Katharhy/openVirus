<p id="Par67">3. Critical COVID-19 associated to HIV/TB co-infection: Hospitalized in COVID-19/TB unit with ICU as high-risk patients. Infection control and testing, ventilator support, hemodynamic, and drug therapy are milestones [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Apply COVID-19, TB and HIV management as described in severe COVID-19. Short period low-dose corticosteroid therapy, anticoagulant therapy and norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor are recommended [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Anticoagulant therapy mainly with low molecular weight heparin appears to be associated with better prognosis in severe/critical COVID-19 patients with markedly elevated D-dimer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. There is strong evidence against the use of hydroxyethyl starches for the acute reanimation of adults with COVID-19 in shock [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. In adults with COVID-19 in shock, if the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) is &lt; 92%, the review suggested starting supplemental oxygen if SpO2 is &lt; 90% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Initial evaluation includes chest x-ray/CT-scan and CBC should be indicated. Liver transaminases and renal function should be monitored regularly in consideration of COVID-19-HIV and TB drug-drug interactions and clinical considerations. Inflammatory markers, D-dimer, cardiac enzymes and ferritin monitoring should be part of the management.
