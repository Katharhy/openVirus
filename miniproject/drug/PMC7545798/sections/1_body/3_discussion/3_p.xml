<p id="Par51">Our results suggest that the recovery rates between COVID-19/HIV/TB and COVID-19/TB groups were quite the same OR 2.63 (95%CI, 1.80–3.83,

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.00001) respectively. However, COVID-19 patients recovered faster than both COVID-19/HIV/TB and OR 2.09 (95%CI 1.65–2.66, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.00001). This observation is supported by qualitative evidence as shown above.
