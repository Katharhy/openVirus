<p>Looking for amino-acid changes occurring in clusters, my attention was drawn to a segment located near the N-terminus of the nsp3 protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00646-f001">Figure 1</xref>). While 82.3% of its 1945 positions exhibit strictly identical residues between the human and bat homologs, this segment falls down to 44.5% identical residues. In SARS-CoV-2 nsp3, this segment is strongly enriched in acidic amino-acids and coincides with a paucity of predicted secondary structure elements (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00646-f001">Figure 1</xref>). On the contrary, it is predicted as an intrinsically disordered protein region. Such domains form the basis of the dynamic “on–off” switch-type of interactions commonly found in signalling networks (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00646" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]). This stretch of amino-acids roughly maps to the hypervariable region (HVR) previously recognized upon the comparison of nsp3 homologs from more distant coronaviruses (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00646" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]), and to which no function has been assigned or predicted. I then focused further analyses on this well-delineated island of changes within the otherwise highly similar nsp3 from human, bat, and pangolin SARS-CoV-2 closest relatives.
