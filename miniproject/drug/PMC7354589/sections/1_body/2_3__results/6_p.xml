<p>Nsp3 is a large multifunctional protein, several domains of which have been mapped and characterized (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00646" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]). Starting from the N-terminus, there are in succession: an ubiquitin-like domain (positions: 20–106) known to bind to single stranded RNA, an ADP-ribose-binding module (positions: 238–337), a single-stranded poly(A) binding domain (positions: 678–743), a papain-like viral protease (positions: 746–1064), a nucleic acid-binding domain (positions: 1089–1201), and a seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor C (positions: 1494–1563).
