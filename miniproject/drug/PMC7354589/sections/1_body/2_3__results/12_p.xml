<p>In the context of this complex interaction network, PARP14, hinders the phosphorylation of STAT1 at “Tyr 701” through the MARylation at “Glu-657” and “Glu-705”. This precludes the formation of the STAT1/STAT2 heterodimer or the STAT1 homodimers and their translocation to the nucleus. PARP14 activity is thus down-regulating the various IFN-triggered responses, in particular, the pro-inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages responding to IFN-γ stimulation [
