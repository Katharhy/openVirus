<p>The nsp3 segment, delineated as highly variable in the above comparison between the human SARS-CoV-2 and its closest animal homologs, is also the most divergent upon alignment of the human SARS-CoV-2 with the previous SARS-CoV-1 (responsible of the 2002 epidemics) [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00646" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and even more dissimilar in the MERS-CoV (agent of the Middle East respiratory syndrome) [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00646" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00646-f002">Figure 2</xref>). In particular, multiple deletions and insertions make it unlikely that these homologous regions could adopt identical folds and perform similar functions.
