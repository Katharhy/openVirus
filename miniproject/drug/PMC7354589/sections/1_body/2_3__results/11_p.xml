<p>The three different classes of IFN signal through distinct cell surface receptors. Binding of type I and II IFN to their respective receptors leads to the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 which then associate in heterodimers, recruit the IFN-regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to form the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). ISGF3 then translocate to the nucleus were it to induce genes regulated by IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE). Alternatively, binding of type II IFN (IFN-γ) to its receptor complex lead to the sole phosphorylation of STAT1 that then associates in homodimers to form the IFN-γ activation factor (GAF) that translocate to the nucleus and activate genes regulated by the gamma-activated sequence (GAS) promoter elements. Through these distinct activation pathways STAT1 is involved in the regulation of different subsets of ISGs [

The STAT1 phosphorylation/de-phosphorylation process is thus central to the various immune responses triggered by distinct IFN sensing: antiviral defenses through the STAT1/STAT2 heterodimer formation (IFN I and III), or macrophage activation and proinflammatory responses through STAT1 homodimer formation (IFN-γ) (reviewed in [
