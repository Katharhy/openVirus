<p>As a simple, straightforward attempt to delineate genomic changes that might correlate with the crossing of the xenographic barrier to human, and with the clinical features of COVID-19, I compared the whole predicted proteome of SARS-CoV-2 with its closest animal-infecting relatives available in the NCBI public database. In a preliminary step, a comparison of the proteome sequences of 250 human-infecting SARS-CoV-2 isolates did not reveal any region of significant variability, as they were quasi-identical. For instance, out of 250 nsp3 protein sequences (1945 residues long), 214 were identical and 36 exhibited single amino-acid changes (99.95% identity), 11 of which were conservative (data not shown). One sequence from the group of 214 identical sequences (Accession # YP_009725299, Wu et al., unpublished) was randomly chosen and used for subsequent comparative analyses.</p>
