<p>Variable regions became only detectable when comparing the polyprotein 1ab sequence of SARS-CoV-2 with that of its closest relatives in animal hosts. As previously noticed, the most similar isolate is bat coronavirus RaTG13 with 96.7% similarity (Accession # QHR63299) [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00646" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], followed by two other bat isolates (# AVP78030, # AVP78041, 93.5% and 92.5% identical, respectively) [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00646" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and several similar pangolin isolates (e.g., # QIQ54046, 85.4% identical) (Cao et al., unpublished).
