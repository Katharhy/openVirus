<p>Interestingly, when the whole nsp3 sequence was compared to the entire human proteome using BlastP, the only reported significant matches (E-value &lt; 10
 <sup>âˆ’6</sup>) were found to precisely encompass the ADP-ribose-binding module. Moreover, the top hits are human protein with a known function: all of them are mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases. This result strongly suggests that the ADP-ribose binding site predicted in the nsp3 protein is functional, as it has been experimentally verified in a number of other viruses, including SARS-CoV (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00646" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). This is the first brick on which I will build my hypothesis: the N terminal part of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 protein is constituted of a variable protein-binding domain immediately adjacent to the highly conserved active site of an ADP-ribose (ADPR) processing enzyme.
