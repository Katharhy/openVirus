 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00646" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) quickly reached a planetary dimension forcing billions of people into lockdown, grinding to a halt most of the world economies, and killing in excess of 375,000 of the 6.1 million people known to be infected (as of 2 June 2020). Initially catalogued as a respiratory disease (severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS), the investigation of severe COVID-19 cases progressively revealed their association with a dysfunctional pro-inflammatory response leading to severe lung damages [

The unexpected severity and dimension of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted national research organizations to ask their scientists, even without prior knowledge on coronaviruses, to use their expertise to contribute to the solution of this formidable challenge. This work is part of this approach, that of a novice researcher in the field, but competent in viral genomics. In this paper, I present a bioinformatic investigation of publicly available sequence data, in an attempt to identify which molecular processes might be responsible of the specific clinical picture of COVID-19. Several coincidental findings examined in the light of the rich pre-existing bibliographical information strongly suggest that virus-induced de-mono-ADP-ribosylation (de-MARylation) of STAT1 might be one of the key steps leading to the inflammatory cytokine storm seen in the most severe COVID-19 cases.
