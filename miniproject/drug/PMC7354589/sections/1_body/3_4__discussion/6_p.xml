<p>Alternatively, MARylated (hence unphosphorylated) forms of STAT1 might have a protective role against viral pathogenesis that is counterbalanced by the SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 activity. Such a hypothesis is consistent with previous studies showing in a mouse model that SARS-CoV pathogenesis is regulated by STAT1 through an IFN-receptor-independent mechanism (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00646" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). Unphosphorylated STAT1 (in the context of ISGF3) was shown to drive the constitutive expression of genes inhibiting viral replication [
