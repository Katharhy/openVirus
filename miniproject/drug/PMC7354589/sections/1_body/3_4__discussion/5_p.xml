<p>Moreover, a recent unexpected finding makes the above hypothesis even more appealing. Following a monumental work, Ziegler et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00646" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] just showed that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) is an interferon-stimulated gene in cell types found in the in the upper airway (epithelial secretory goblet cells), in the lung (type II pneumocytes), and in the small intestine (absorptive enterocytes), all locations and organs linked to clinical symptoms and viral shedding [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00646" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Accordingly, they found evidence for STAT1 binding sites in the promoter region of ACE2. In consequence, the higher phosphorylated/unphosphorylated ratio of STAT1 promoted by nsp3 in IFN-Î³-stimulated macrophages might lead to more SARS-CoV-2 receptors being expressed at the surface of bystander epithelial cells, enhancing the infection process. Once started, a positive feedback loop will proceed, with more infections generating more IFN, activating more STAT1, in turn generating more inflammation and more virus receptors, with nsp3 permanently counteracting the PARP14-dependent MARylation of STAT1, thus precluding its downregulation and the termination of the pro-inflammatory phase.
