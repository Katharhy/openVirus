<p>However, the variable disordered region flanking the conserved macrodomain, a predicted protein-protein interaction domain, would exhibit a differential (or no) affinity for STAT1 in different SARS-CoV strains, hence modulating the efficiency of its de-MARylation by nsp3 and its consequence on the various IFN-triggered responses, including the proinflammatory activation of macrophages. Alternatively, the nsp3 variable region of SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV could interact with different MARyled targets altogether, leading to different behavior vis-Ã -vis the host innate immune response [
