<p>Finally, the discovery that ACE2 transcription is under the positive control of STAT1 [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00646" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] provides an elegant explanation for the conservation of a functional de-MARylation macrodomain, even though it was shown to be dispensable for the in vitro replication of the virus [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00646" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. By following the natural incentive of all viruses to maximize their infectivity, hereby increasing the density of its receptor, SARS-CoV-2 triggers a cytokine storm as an unfortunate side-effect of COVID-19. Beyond the fundamental interest of establishing a link between nsp3 and the inflammatory response associated to the disease, an in vitro measurement of the de-MARylation efficiency of STAT1 by nsp3 synthetic constructs designed after new SARS-like coronavirus genomic sequences could help predict the virulence of wild animal strains before they start circulating within human populations. The identification of STAT1 as a target might also suggest some therapeutic avenues, such as the use of anti-IFN-y drugs (e.g., Emapalumab), or Jack1/Jack2 inhibitors (e.g., Baricitinib, Ruxolinitinib) (reviewed in [
