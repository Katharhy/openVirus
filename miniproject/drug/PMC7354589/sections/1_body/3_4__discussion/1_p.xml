<p>The ADPR-binding site that was identified in the SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 sequence corresponds to a conserved macrodomain (also called “X domain”) that follows the HVR in all coronaviruses [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00646" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The macrodomain is a ubiquitous structural domain that removes mono-ADP-ribose from proteins, reversing the activity of ADP-ribosyltransferases. This domain has been functionally characterized [

 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00646" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,

 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00646" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It was shown that the macrodomain from SARS-CoV (as well as that of other single-stranded positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses) can remove mono-ADP-ribose in vitro from a variety of targets, including PARP1, PARP10, and PARP15 [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00646" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], although no specific protein targets for viral macrodomains have been identified in vivo. Here I propose that STAT1 is the in vivo target of the SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain, thus precisely counteracting its mono-ADP-ribosylation by human PARP14.
