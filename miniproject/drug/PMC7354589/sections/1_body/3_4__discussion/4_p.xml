<p>According to this molecular scenario, the expression of nsp3 in IFN-Î³-activated macrophages would indirectly promote a prolonged pro-inflammatory STAT1-dependent expression of interferon stimulated genes by inhibiting the downregulation of STAT1 through its MARylation and increasing the pool of STAT1 molecules available for phosphorylation. This would participate in the cytokine storm characteristic of severe COVID-19 cases.</p>
