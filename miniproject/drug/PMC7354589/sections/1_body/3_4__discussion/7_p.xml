<p>A relatively straightforward test of my hypothesis would involve the investigation of the ADP-ribosylation status of STAT1 during SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection (using wild-type and macrodomain-mutated strains) and the experimental demonstration of a physical interaction between STAT1 and the relevant N-terminal regions of nsp3. As the decrease of the MARylated STAT1 pool could indirectly arise from the inhibition of the MARylation function of PARP14, the eventual interaction of the latter with nsp3 should also be investigated.</p>
