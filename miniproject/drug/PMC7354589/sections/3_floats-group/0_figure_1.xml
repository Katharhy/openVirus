 <caption>
  <p>Multiple alignment of the human SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 N-terminal sequence and that of its 3 closest homologs in non-human-infecting coronaviruses. Sequences with accession #: QHR63299.1, AVP78030.1, AVP78041.1 are from 3 different isolates of bat-associated viruses. Their overall similarity over the entire SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 sequence are 93%, 83.3%, 80.9% identical residues, respectively. It goes down to 44% identity in the “variable region” highlighted in green. Predicted secondary structure elements are highlighted in yellow (extended) and purple (helix). The segment highlighted in green is predicted as intrinsically disordered. HUMAN_COV-2 corresponds to Genbank accession #: YP_009725299.</p>
