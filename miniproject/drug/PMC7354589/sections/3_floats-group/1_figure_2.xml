 <caption>
  <p>Comparison of the N-term regions of the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV nsp3 polyproteins. The glutamine-rich hypervariable region (HVR) is highlighted in green. The conserved ADP-ribose binding site is highlighted in purple. A region of lower similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 is also seen between positions 365 and 411 (highlighted in yellow). The rest of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV nsp3 polyproteins are more than 80% identical, but less than 31% identical with that of MERS-CoV. Strictly conserved positions are indicated by “*”, conservative variations by “:” or “.”, insertions by “-”. Genbank accession numbers: CoV2: YP_009725299, CoV1: AAP13439, MERS: AGV08404.</p>
