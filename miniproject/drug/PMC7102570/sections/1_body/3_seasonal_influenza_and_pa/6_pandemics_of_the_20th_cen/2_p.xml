 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">EuroWHO, 2019</xref>), “Three influenza pandemics occurred at intervals of several decades during the 20th century, the most severe of which was the so-called ‘Spanish Flu’ (caused by an A(H1N1) virus), estimated to have caused 20–50 million deaths in 1918–1919. Milder pandemics occurred subsequently in 1957–1958 (the ‘Asian Flu’ caused by an A(H2N2) virus) and in 1968 (the ‘Hong Kong Flu’ caused by an A(H3N2) virus), which were estimated to have caused 1–4 million deaths each. While most cases of pandemic H1N1 were mild, globally it is estimated that the 2009 pandemic caused between 100,000–400,000 deaths in the first year alone.” Elderly individuals had immunity to pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09, and although people developed a milder form of influenza, it spread quickly throughout the world. Once an avian influenza outbreak occurs, more people are infected than in the pandemic of 2009, with similar or faster global spread. Predictions of whether the next pandemic will occur are difficult to determine, but researchers are currently concerned about the A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) strains with high lethality. When these strains adapt to humans and become pandemic, their pathogenicity may be milder, similar to previous pandemics. If an influenza pandemic causes severe disease, it may cause substantial damage to human health and social dysfunction. The need for pandemic countermeasures is an important consideration.
