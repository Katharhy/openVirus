<p id="p0130">The replication cycle of influenza viruses is approximately 6 h from entry to the production of new virus, and robust growth begins after infection at a rate of four replication cycles per day. The course of influenza virus infection was analyzed in 56 different studies with 1280 healthy participants after an experimental influenza virus infection (
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Carrat et al., 2008</xref>). The A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) infections resulted in a substantial increase in viral shedding on the first day after experimental influenza virus infection, and they reached their maximum values on the second day. Fever was reported in 34.9% of infected individuals. Systemic symptoms (fever, muscle aches, fatigue, and headache) peaked earlier, by day 2 after inoculation, and resolved faster than respiratory or nasal symptoms. The presence of a preexisting antibody modified the mean duration of illness of 4.4 days in participants with pre-hemagglutinin inhibition titers of ≤1/8 compared with 1.0 day in participants with pre-hemagglutinin inhibition titers of &gt;1/8 after the inoculation of a wild-type A(H1N1) virus (

The mean durations of viral shedding in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients are 19.4 and 6.38 days with median values of 8.0 and 5.0 days, respectively, indicating that viral replication persists for a week after the disappearance of major symptoms. Preexisting immunity and immunocompetence are important in modifying the severity of symptoms of influenza.
