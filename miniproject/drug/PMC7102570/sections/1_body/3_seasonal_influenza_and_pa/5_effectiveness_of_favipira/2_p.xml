<p id="p0170">An influenza pandemic is a global outbreak of a novel influenza A virus. Pandemics occur when novel influenza A viruses emerge that are able to infect people easily and spread from person to person in an efficient and sustained manner. Two decades have elapsed since an avian influenza case was reported in Hong Kong in 1997, and a decade has elapsed since the most recent influenza pandemic that occurred in 2009. Sporadic cases of A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) influenza infections have been accumulating, and we must prepare for these strains or other novel influenza strains that might progress to an influenza pandemic and spread globally, such as A(H1N1)pdm09. Influenza pandemics can cause severe pneumonia, generate a drug-resistant virus, and render antiviral drugs ineffective during prolonged viral growth in patients treated with oseltamivir or baloxavir. Although drug-resistant viruses may have a reduced ability to grow, the use of drugs in many patients continues the selection pressure to ensure that resistant viruses become dominant. Drug selection continues, and the resistant strain becomes dominant during pandemics because drug-resistant strains are selected in many patients treated with the same anti-influenza drug. Regarding a resistant virus with good replication capability, oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) viruses possessing the NA H275Y substitution spread globally during the 2008 to 2009 season. Thus, we have experience with a global pandemic of an oseltamivir-resistant strain. Favipiravir maintains the same efficacy from the first to the last patient of a pandemic because its resistant strain does not appear or does not replace the original strain.</p>
