<p id="p0075">Mice infected with a low titer represent nonlethal infection models and are considered to correspond to human seasonal infection models. In this model, oseltamivir and favipiravir are equally effective and do not differ in efficacy despite the difference in their mechanisms of action. A high-titer infection represents a lethal infection model and is considered to correspond to a novel influenza infection in humans. Although oseltamivir is ineffective in this model, favipiravir effectively improves survival in all cases, indicating the importance of administering a drug with a mechanism of action that reduces viral load.</p>
