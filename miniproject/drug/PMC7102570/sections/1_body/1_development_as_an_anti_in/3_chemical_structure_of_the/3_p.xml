<p id="p0045">Favipiravir was effective against other RNA viruses, poliovirus, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus but not effective against DNA viruses, herpes simplex virus-1, cytomegalovirus, and adenovirus (
 <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Furuta et al., 2002</xref>). Based on the antiviral activity toward four RNA viruses, we expected that favipiravir should be active against a broad range of RNA viruses. Favipiravir has been evaluated and developed as a broad spectrum anti-RNA virus drug, including lethal RNA virus infections. The anti-RNA virus activity of favipiravir was analyzed at the cellular level, and efficacy studies were performed in animal models of human lethal RNA virus infections, as shown in 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> . Patients with an Ebola virus infection in West Africa in 2014 and patients with other RNA virus infections have been treated with favipiravir (AviganÂ®) based on the efficacy in human lethal RNA virus infections, clinical experience, efficacy in patients with seasonal influenza, and its licensure for human use.
