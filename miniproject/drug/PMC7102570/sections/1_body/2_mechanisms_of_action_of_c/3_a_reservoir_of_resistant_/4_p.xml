<p id="p0125">There is a high probability that the resistant virus is already present in the virus that grew rapidly and in large quantities before the start of treatment. In addition, the viral RNA formed in the cells in patients treated with anti-influenza drugs serves as a source of drug-resistant viruses. Subsequently, drug-resistant influenza viruses should appear more readily from the mutant genomic RNA pool during drug treatment.</p>
