 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> shows the influenza virus growth cycle and the sites of action of anti-influenza drugs. The viral hemagglutinin binds to sialic acid on the cell surface, and the viral particle is incorporated into the endosome. When the endosome is acidified and the pH decreases to a value of 5, which is characteristic of the late endosome, the structure of the hemagglutinin changes through a process mediated by the Matrix-2 (M2) ion channel. Then, the endosomal membrane and the viral envelope fuse, and the viral genome in the viral particle is released into the cytoplasm (uncoating). The viral genome and RdRp complex are transported to the nucleus where the transcription (replication) of viral RNA synthesis begins. The synthesized RNA does not contain the Cap structure required for mRNA, and the Cap structure from the host mRNA is excised and transferred to the viral RNA by the Cap-dependent endonuclease of viral RdRp complex, resulting in the formation of the viral mRNA (Cap-snatching). After the viral mRNA is produced, the viral protein is translated. The viral proteins and RdRp-RNA complex form viral particles that subsequently bud from the cell membrane. Hemagglutinin on viral particles budded from the cell surface binds to the sialic acid on the surface of the infected cell, and the viral particles are released from the infected cell through the cleavage of sialic acid by viral neuraminidase (NA) for the next round of infection.
