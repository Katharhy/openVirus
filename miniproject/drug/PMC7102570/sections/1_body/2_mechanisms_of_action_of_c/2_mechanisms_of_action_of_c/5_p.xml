<p id="p0105">The NA inhibitors (NAIs) zanamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir, and laminamivir inhibit the NA activity of viral particles on the surface of the infected cell and the release of viral particles from the cell surface to other cells for the next round of infection. NAIs result in the accumulation of viral particles on the cell surface and inhibit the spread of virus infection. NAIs are currently the main choice of anti-influenza drugs.</p>
