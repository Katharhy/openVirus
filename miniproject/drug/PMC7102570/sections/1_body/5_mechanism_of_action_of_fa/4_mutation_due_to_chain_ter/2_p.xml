<p id="p0245">Proofreading activity mediated by enzymes such as the 3′-5′ exonuclease of herpesvirus DNA polymerase removes the terminal mismatched base and corrects the base pairing during the elongation process. Viral RdRp lacks proofreading activity and is unable to complete the elongation step when favipiravir-RTP is incorporated as a chain terminator. Coronavirus has been reported to expresses a 3′-to-5′exoribonuclease and its proofreading function among RNA viruses (
