<p id="p0235">Ribavirin is known to cause lethal mutagenesis, as shown in 
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. Ribavirin is incorporated into the elongating RNA strand, resulting in the production of multiple mismatches that lead to lethal mutagenesis (
 <xref rid="bb0605" ref-type="bibr">Vignuzzi et al., 2005</xref>). Favipiravir inhibits RNA synthesis through chain termination, and this inhibitory mechanism more consistently explains the observations reported than a mechanism similar to ribavirin, as described below.
