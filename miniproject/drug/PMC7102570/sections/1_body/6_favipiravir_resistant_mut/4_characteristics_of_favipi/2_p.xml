<p id="p0295">Many laboratories have attempted to isolate favipiravir-resistant influenza viruses but have not been successful. Recently, mutants of influenza virus (
 <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Goldhill et al., 2018</xref>) and chikungunya virus (
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Abdelnabi et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Delang et al., 2014</xref>) that are less susceptible to favipiravir have been reported. Mutated sequences of these viruses have been detected in cultures treated with favipiravir, and reverse-engineered viruses showed favipiravir resistance with altered RdRp activity related to the fidelity and reduced growth property.
