<p id="p0300">The K229R mutation in motif F of the PB1 gene was observed in the virus population cultivated in the presence of favipiravir, and a virus with the K229R mutation was created by reverse engineering and confirmed as a favipiravir-resistant virus. However, the virus was artificially produced and grown as a clone and is not considered a dominant virus in the culture. A K229R mutation in P1 shows reduced polymerase activity and acquired P653L in the PA during replication. The acquisition of the additional PA P653L mutation restores the polymerase activity and favipiravir resistance (
