  <p>Cascade of fever induction by influenza and antipyretic action of cinnamyl compounds and NSAIDs. Influenza infection induces interferon (IFN) production that subsequently induces interleukin (IL)-1 production to act on the hypothalamus. Next, cyclooxygenase is expressed to induce prostaglandin (PG)E
   <sub>2</sub> production and generate fever. Cinnamyl compounds from medicinal herbs, anti-IFN antibody, anti-IL-1 antibody, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (aspirin) act at each step of this process. Cinnamyl compounds and NSAIDs inhibit the induction of IFN and cyclooxygenase activity, respectively, in the fever cascade to work as antipyretics in influenza. Regarding pneumonia, IL-12 and IFN-Î³ production are induced in the bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) on the second and third day of infection, respectively, and an increase in IL-12 levels reduces the viral load in the BALF and the area of pneumonia throughout the lungs.
