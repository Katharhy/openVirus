<p>In base-case scenario, we simulated the HIV epidemic in 1983–2010, parameterized by longitudinal clinical data and literature. The epidemic growth for heterosexuals in the medium term (2012–2023) was then projected with treatment initiation criteria and diagnosis rate of 2011. In response to the recommended test-and-treat strategy for controlling the HIV epidemic, [

 <xref rid="pone.0237433.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] four scenarios of treatment-based interventions were designed for introduction from 2012, while keeping other conditions unchanged. These scenarios were A) rate of retention in care before and on ART at 50% and 100% from 2012; B) immediate treatment for all diagnosed cases from 2012; C) HIV testing campaigns in 2012 and 2017 (assuming 100% diagnosis rate in the respective year); and D) test-and-treat–HIV testing campaign in 2012 and 2017 with immediate treatment from 2012.
