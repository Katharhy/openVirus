<p>To examine the impact of uncertainty of key parameters on model simulation results, sensitivity analyses were performed for the influences of varying the risk ranking ratios of sexual partnership, and proportion of non-locally acquired infections, with the starting point of 1) 1983 and 2) 2012 respectively. Five combinations of partnership types were simulated in the sensitivity analyses by varying the ratios of high:medium:low risk partnership: A) 6%:38%:56% (base-case); B) 3%:38%:59%; C) 3%:41%:56%; D) 9%:35%:56%; and E) 9%:38%:53%. Sensitivity analyses for zero, twice and thrice the annual number of non-locally acquired infections by gender were performed. Other model parameters were kept unchanged and no intervention were introduced in these analyses. Separately, sensitivity analyses for non-locally acquired infections were performed from 2012 with intervention scenarios.</p>
