 </bold>). If retention in care dropped to 50% (Scenario A2), the proportion of SVL would be halved by 2023. The annual number of new infections would increase sharply from 2012, and the total number of male and female new infections in 2012–2023 would be 330 (49%) and 347 (77%) more than base-case, respectively. Immediate treatment alone (Scenario B) would lead to minimal change of new infections above base-case. Scenario C (HIV testing campaign) led to the 3% male and 6% female new infections averted in 2012–2023. Moderate additive effects could result when HIV testing campaigns were combined with immediate treatment (Scenario D), as shown by an additional 4% reduction of estimated total new infections by 2023.
