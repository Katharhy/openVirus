<p>In the absence of non-locally acquired infections from 1983, there would have been zero epidemic growth (results not shown). When the annual number of non-locally acquired infections doubled, the number of newly infected, newly diagnosed and diagnosed prevalent cases would likewise double. The epidemic growth differed when the proportion of male or female non-locally acquired infection was altered separately (

 </bold>). By setting non-locally acquired male infections to zero, less than 400 newly diagnosed and newly infected male resulted in 1983â€“2023 (at least 70% lower than base-case) while there would be 896 newly diagnosed (39% lower) and 513 newly infected female (58% lower). Conversely, setting non-local female infections to zero would simulate 473 (61% lower) and 585 (42% lower) new female diagnoses and infections than base-case, while male epidemic growth became just 19% and 23% lower, respectively. Similarly, an increase of non-locally acquired male infections resulted in substantial growth of both the male and female epidemics, while an increase of non-locally acquired female infections impacted the female epidemic but caused minimal changes to the male epidemic.
