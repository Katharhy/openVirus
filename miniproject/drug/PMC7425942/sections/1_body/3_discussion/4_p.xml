<p>We acknowledge that thereâ€™re limitations in our study. The compartmental design might have underestimated the impact of concurrency. Nonetheless, our projected curves were similar to the epidemic curves derived from reported numbers. On the contrary, network structured models might overestimate the impact of concurrency by ignoring the potentially significant reduction of transmission risk after diagnosis and treatment initiation.

Limited by data availability, phylogenetic analysis was only based on the partial polymerase (pol) gene that included protease and reverse transcriptase regions.
