<p>In analysing the heterosexual HIV epidemic, our deterministic compartmental model has incorporated the inflow of non-locally acquired infection, configured by the mixing of males and females with different levels of sex partnership. Using concurrent sex partnership as a key parameter, the model provides a new explanation for interpreting the epidemiology of heterosexual HIV infections in Hong Kong. Concurrent partnership aside, non-locally acquired infection was of notable importance, as it accounted for about half of female and more than half of male heterosexual infections in 2006â€“2014. [
 <xref rid="pone.0237433.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Instead of a general assumption that all HIV infections had occurred as a result of transmission within a city or country, we have focussed on modelling the dual occurrence of local and non-local infections. With a highly mobile population, the heterosexual HIV epidemic could be under strong influences of non-locally acquired infections.
