<p>As ART could reduce heterosexual HIV transmission, [
 <xref rid="pone.0237433.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] treatment-based interventions are potentially useful. The importance of linkage to care and retention in care has been highlighted in a study in South Africa [

 <xref rid="pone.0237433.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our modelling results suggested that enhancing retention in care to 100% or launching HIV testing campaigns with immediate treatment could reduce new infections by 5–7% in male and 9–10% among female by 2023. We simulated the impact of setting up periodic HIV testing campaign (at 5-year intervals), which is theoretically less costly than an annual campaign. If a 100% diagnosis rate is achieved, very low epidemic growth could result. The benefit would be even bigger if periodic testing is combined with immediate treatment. Whereas epidemic control have been concluded in other studies, [

 <xref rid="pone.0237433.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] a test-and-treat strategy in Hong Kong is not anticipated to achieve such significant outcome. The discrepancy might be due to the current high treatment coverage and high proportion of SVL in Hong Kong, leaving limited rooms of improvement. [
