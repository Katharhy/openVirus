<p>Worldwide, sexual transmission accounts for a majority of prevailing HIV infections. In the past decade, HIV transmission in men who have sex with men (MSM) has escalated globally, an observation also seen in Asian countries. [

 <xref rid="pone.0237433.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In the development of intervention programmes, key populations including MSM, people who inject drugs (PWID) and female sex workers (FSW) have often been the main focus of HIV prevention programme, while heterosexually infected persons are neglected. Despite much lower risk of HIV transmission, the large population size could mean a high number of HIV infections and the challenge of effective prevention program implementation. When transmission of HIV in the key populations could explain the emergence of concentrated HIV epidemics, it could not well explain the sustained transmissions of the virus in the general population.
