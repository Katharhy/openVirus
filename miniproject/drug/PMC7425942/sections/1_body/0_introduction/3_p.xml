<p>In Hong Kong, an international city in Asia, the heterosexual HIV epidemic grew rapidly in the 1980s-1990s but became stabilized from 2000 onwards. Heterosexual infections have accounted for some two-fifths of all reported cases despite the low overall HIV prevalence in the population, [

Following expanding coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-infected individuals in care, the impacts of treatment-as-prevention could play a role in shaping future epidemiology. To explain the transmission pattern of heterosexual HIV infections, a compartmental model was designed to assess the potential impacts of interventions centring on the promotion and enhancement of ART, and non-locally acquired infections.
