<p id="Par5">It could be argued that there are several pieces of evidence showing that the excessive and inadequate use of antibiotics leads to microbial resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], as well as it could be contested that several studies demonstrated that steroid administration do not improve the course of these viral diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. I am well aware of them, as I also conducted research activity in these fields and taught this matter to students and residents. Nevertheless, I think that it can be declared that a lot of information in this field is still missing, not so much concerning full recovery, but, mainly, related to their effect in improving the clinical picture, with many subsequent therapeutic benefits. For example, we should consider that corticosteroids possess an incomparable anti-inflammatory activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and carry very little risk in the short-term administration as compared with other anti-inflammatory drugs, and also directly inhibit the expression of interleukin-6 and its receptor. Other drugs exert the latter effect, but are very expensive and possibly more risky over time and in specific associated conditions.
