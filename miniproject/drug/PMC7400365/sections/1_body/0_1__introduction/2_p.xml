<p>Despite these advances, detectable viral loads following HCV treatment (also known as recurrence) have been an ongoing concern and complicate epidemiological research as the root cause of recurrence can vary. Recurrence is a term that refers to a presence of HCV RNA in the blood without differentiating between reinfection and relapse [

 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-17-04951" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Spontaneous clearance, or the elimination of virus without the use of medication, occurs around 25% of the time with primary infection and around 40% in reinfection [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-17-04951" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Differentiating between reinfection and relapse can only be definitively done through advanced sequencing methods that analyze the HCV strain and compare results to the primary infection.
