<p>Simple genotyping identifies segments of the highly variant regions (~35% variability) of the viral RNA to classify the tested strain as one of seven major types and 67 subtypes [

 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-17-04951" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Simple genotyping of primary infection and reinfection is limited though as it can only distinguish viral strains if the individual is not reinfected with the same strain. In certain geographical areas, the number of different strains is small. For example, among the Kenyan PWID population, two strains (1a and 4a), are dominant [

 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-17-04951" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Even with the advent of pangenotypic regimens, relapse is often treated with a different protocol (drug and length of time) from that used to treat reinfection. Despite these limitations, simple genotyping is less costly than deep gene sequencing.
