<p>One of the main challenges in defining the rate of HCV reinfection is the low availability of clinical data in resource-limited settings. Epidemiological research primarily uses three methods to determine the rate of recurrence. These methods, which differ in accuracy and cost, include deep gene sequencing, also known as next-generation sequencing, simple genotyping, and measuring quantitative RNA load. The “gold standard” (the method with the least uncertainty) involves the deep sequencing of the HCV genome before and after SVR to distinguish reinfection by a separate viral strain from the primary infection; however, the high cost of deep sequencing may preclude its use in resource-limited settings [
