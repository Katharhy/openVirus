<p>Clinicians and policy makers have expressed concerns that PWID are likely to have low treatment adherence and high rates of reinfection [

Conversely, authors of another qualitative study found that the combination of stigma-free medical care with social services reinforces the providerâ€“patient relationship and enhances the positive consequences of treatment, including adherence to substance use disorder treatment and housing/employment stability [

This hesitancy among providers and policymakers to provide PWID with HCV treatment is problematic as it not only exacerbates existing stigma and health disparities, but it also fails to promote effective public health strategies. PWID represent the highest proportion of incident HCV cases and failing to treat PWID can maintain, or even expand, a local epidemic. Therefore, dedicated research in resource-limited settings, including on rates of reinfection, is necessary to better understand the HCV epidemic among PWID in LMICs.
