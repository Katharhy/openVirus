<p>Notably different among the studies was the use of genotype or deep sequencing in distinguishing reinfection from relapse. Genotyping, and particularly deep sequencing, in epidemiological research allows for a closer examination of the factors associated with HCV transmission, such as sharing injecting equipment, the concurrent use of other substances, and unprotected sex. Such molecular epidemiologic tools can enhance our understanding of factors associated with reinfection. Our review did not have enough studies using genotyping to draw large-scale conclusions about factors that play a role in reinfection vs. relapse. Broader use of these tools is recommended.</p>
