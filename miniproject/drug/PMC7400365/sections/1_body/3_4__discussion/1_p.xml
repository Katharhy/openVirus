<p>While the results from the studies in our systematic review were heterogeneous, we found that reinfection rates measured in studies of PWID in upper and lower middle-income countries were comparable or lower than the reinfection rates of PWID in high-income countries. Hajarizadeh and colleagues reported a meta-analysis on PWID who completed DAA treatment; they identified studies conducted in Demark, Spain and the USA with high reinfection rates ranging from 8.0 to 18.3 cases per 100 PY and studies with low reinfection rates from 1.1 to 1.7 cases per 100 PY in Canada, the USA and Germany [

Notably, the USA study results are in both the low and high reinfection groups; the results come from different studies in different geographic regions which may reflect local conditions and variations between populations. Though we observed this inverse relationship between reinfection rates and country income level, further research is needed in LMIC settings. The variance among these studies, along with the absence of studies measuring reinfection rates among PWID in low-income countries, underscore the need for more large-scale observational studies dedicated to PWID in LMICs. Consistent with findings in high-income countries, one study found a reduction in reinfection in OST recipients compared to non-OST recipients, indicating that the beneficial impact of harm reduction services is consistent regardless of economic status.
