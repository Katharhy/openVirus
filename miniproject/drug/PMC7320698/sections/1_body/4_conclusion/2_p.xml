<p id="par0115">CP has the potential to provide an urgent promising treatment option when evaluating existing drugs and developing new specific vaccines and treatments. CP looks to be effective for a better follow of Covid-19 when administered in severe and critically ill patients and may reduce the rate of intensive care unit hospitalization. We observed that all patients with early-stage Covid-19 who did not need mechanical ventilation improved with CP treatment. However, we observed that, despite CP treatment, 6 of 17 (35,29 %) patients who needed mechanical ventilation died. In early stage Covid-19 patients who do not need mechanical ventilation, CP treatment may be a curative treatment option.</p>
