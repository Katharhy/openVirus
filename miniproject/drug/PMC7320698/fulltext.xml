As of June 12, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 cases reported by the world health organization (WHO) reached 7.553.182 and 423.349 deaths [<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p id="par0010">There are currently no proven treatment for Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). There is no effective antiviral drug in the treatment of Covid-19 disease. It is an urgent need to seek an alternative strategy, especially in the treatment of serious patients. Convalescent Plasma (CP) therapy can be used for this disease. CP is the administration of antibodies collected from recently infected and recovered Covid-19 patients to Covid-19 patients for therapeutic purposes. CP was used during the 1918 flu epidemic and reduced mortality among plasma recipients [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. CP treatment is a reliable treatment option for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases for more than a hundred years [<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].

Donors were selected from those who could be blood donors between the ages of 18&#x02212;60. All tests (Eliza, etc.) before donation to the donors were done before the procedure. Antibody titer was checked before donating to the donors. Plasma was collected from donors with antibody positivity. Before starting the procedure, PCR was confirmed to be negative for Covid-19 in both the swab and serum of the donor. Informed consent was obtained from both the donor and the patients. After the CPs were collected, they were prepared and frozen in 200 cc packages with a sterile combining set. The collected CPs were applied to severe Covid-19 patients.

A decrease in viral load has been shown after CP treatment [<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p id="par0085">Duan et al. added 200&#x02009;mL of CP containing high neutralizing antibody titers (&#x0003e; 1: 640) to the treatment of 10 critical patients with Covid-19 (age range 34&#x02013;78) after an average of 16.5 days of admission to the hospital. CP treatment increased the neutralizing antibody titer, oxygen saturation and lymphocyte count in patients; however, it has been observed that it reduces CRP, SARS-CoV-2 viral load and lung lesions in radiological imaging. Compared to the CP treatment group and the control group (10 patients), there was no significant difference between the basic features of the patients, while the clinical results of the patient group given CP treatment were superior (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) [<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p id="par0090">Shen et al. has applied 400&#x02009;mL CP therapy including SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (titer&#x0003e; 1:40) to 5 critical patients (age range 30&#x02013;70, two women) determined by Elisa test. After CP transfusion between the 10th and 22nd days of admission to the hospital, symptoms such as an increase in viral antibody titers, a decrease in SARS-Cov-2 viral loads and normalization of ARDS and fever decreased were observed [<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p id="par0095">Brown BL and McCullough J performed a meta-analysis to investigate the effect of CP therapy on Covid-19 disease [<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

Its reliability was demonstrated in China, where it was used for the first time in this outbreak [<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the current outbreak, CP has been used in our clinic for the second time in the world after China.</p><p id="par0100">Ling Li et al., added CP in addition to standard therapy in 103 Covid-19 patients. The trial was conducted in open, multicentric randomized 7 centers in China. CP and standard therapy were applied to 52 patients and standard therapy was performed to 51 patients. Improvement in CP treatment group was 51.9 %, improvement in standard treatment group was 43.1 %, and this difference was statistically nonsignificant (hazard ratio, 1.40, p 0.26).

CP looks to be effective for a better follow of Covid-19 when administered in severe and critically ill patients and may reduce the rate of intensive care unit hospitalization. We observed that all patients with early-stage Covid-19 who did not need mechanical ventilation improved with CP treatment. However, we observed that, despite CP treatment, 6 of 17 (35,29 %) patients who needed mechanical ventilation died. In early stage Covid-19 patients who do not need mechanical ventilation, CP treatment may be a curative treatment option.</p></sec><sec id="sec0045"><title>Funding</title><p id="par0120">This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p></sec><sec id="sec00005"><title>CRediT authorship contribution statement</title><p id="par00005">
