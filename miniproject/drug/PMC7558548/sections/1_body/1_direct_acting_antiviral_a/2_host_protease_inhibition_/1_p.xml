<p id="Par6">Respiratory viruses such as influenza, parainfluenza and coronaviruses rely on host proteases for the activation of their entry factors that facilitate membrane fusion and entry into airway epithelial cells. The transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is a ubiquitously expressed serine protease that is crucial to  the cleavage and activation of both, hemagglutinin (HA) of human influenza viruses and the spike (S) protein of SARS-like coronaviruses [

Serine proteases involved with the pathogenesis of respiratory viruses are classified as trypsin-like proteases) which possess structurally conserved active site. This feature of trypsin-like proteases may be exploited for the design of inhibitors with broad-spectrum activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, such targets are not without limitations as viruses often access molecular and biological redundancies in their host. Although camostat inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication, it did not completely abolish viral replication, likely reflecting residual S protein activation through alternative means. This is not surprising as the SARS-CoV-2 can also use the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B/L to activate and prime its S protein in TMPRSS2 null cells. However, it must be noted that S protein processing by TMPRSS2, but not cathepsin B/L, is essential for viral entry [
