<p id="Par7">Moreover, the SARS-CoV-2 possesses a multibasic cleavage site which is processed by furin, another cellular protease. Furin induced pre-cleavage at the S1/S2 site likely promotes subsequent TMPRSS2-dependent entry into target cells. The presence of a furin-mediated cleavage site in viral proteins is often associated with highly pathogenic viral strains of influenza viruses [

In general, processing by furin can occur during viral production before egress from the producer cell or in the extracellular space during entry into target cells. Collectively, the presence of multiple exo- and endo- proteases offer drug design opportunities that may be efficiently accessed through drug combination strategies.
