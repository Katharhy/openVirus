<p id="Par10">Recent genome-wide approaches using small interfering RNA (siRNA) or CRISPR assays targeting the cellular “kinome” have highlighted pro-viral cellular factors, which can serve as novel targets for the design of HDAs. As an example, de Wilde et al. performed a siRNA screen targeting the human kinome to identify host kinases relevant for SARS-CoV infection [

Their work also showed other proteins that promote SARS-CoV replication such as the coatomer protein complex (COPB2) and Golgi-specific brefeldin A resistant guanine nucleotide factor 1 (GBF1). Such examples underscore the importance of the vesicular and secretory pathways for viral replication. Similarly, Lesche et al. uncovered 133 genes required for the spread of multiple influenza virus strains. Further studies involving these target genes and 43 approved drugs showed that urea-based kinase inhibitors possess high antiviral activity and low cytotoxicity offering a superior therapeutic window. These inhibitors also showed substantial activity against other viruses such as cowpox virus (CPXV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV1) [
