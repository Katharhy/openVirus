<p id="Par5">Most approved antiviral drugs target viral proteins, often acting selectively against one virus. Historically, drug development efforts have disproportionately focused on targeting viral proteins leading to the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). However, viruses exploit numerous host proteins to carry out essential steps in their life cycles, and these proteins can be targeted for the development of host-directed antiviral agents (HDAs). Since viruses from one family often employ the same host proteins, targeting these proteins can produce agents with broad-spectrum antiviral activity and offer a higher barrier to the development of drug resistant virus strains. A key feature of HDAs is that their development can occur prior to the discovery of a new viral pathogen. The need for HDAs is underscored by the fact that there are over a dozen zoonotic viruses that have caused deadly human disease in recent years and will remain potential sources for future outbreaks. The last decade alone has witnessed two epidemics prior to COVID-19 in the form of the 2012 MERS epidemic (caused by another coronavirus) and the 2016 Zika epidemic (caused by an arthopod-borne flavivirus). A pre-existing repertoire of first-line, broad-acting HDAs that can be readily deployed may be beneficial in slowing the initial viral spread or in suppressing outbreaks. Later, HDAs can be complemented with DAAs and vaccines since their development hinges on the knowledge of specific viral proteins. While broad and deep investigation of viral-host pathways and targets is needed, the following examples illustrate a few of many cellular pathways that are utilized by different viruses, including coronaviruses, to replicate and cause infections.</p>
