<p id="Par11">Gordon et al. expressed 26 tagged, SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells to identify proteins that physically associated with each viral protein. They identified over 300 host proteins that bind to SARS-CoV-2 proteins, many of which are suspected of contributing to the viral life cycle. Among the interactors were Sigma1 and Sigma2 proteins. The authors tested 69 approved or clinical-stage compounds and found that the drug compounds targeting either the mRNA translation and/or regulators of Sigma1 and Sigma2 receptors displayed a prominent antiviral effect. Sigma1 receptors are localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and the mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM). They are multifunctional proteins involved in essential cellular processes, including protein folding, degradation, ER trafficking and oxidative stress, cell survival, and mitochondrial function [
