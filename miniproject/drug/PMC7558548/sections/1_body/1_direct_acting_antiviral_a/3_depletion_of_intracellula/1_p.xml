<p id="Par8">Viral replication places an increased cellular burden on the available nucleotide pools, which can be targeted to compromise viral replication. Inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) catalyzes an essential step in the biosynthesis of guanine nucleotides, i.e., conversion of IMP to xanthosine monophosphate (XMP). XMP leads to the de novo formation of guanosine monophosphate (GMP), a crucial molecule for numerous cellular processes. Inhibition of IMPDH leads to depletion of intracellular guanine nucleotide (GTP /dGTP) levels and thus limits RNA and DNA synthesis needed for viral replication. Examples of IMPDH inhibitors are VX-497, a noncompetitive IMPDH-inhibitor with broad-spectrum activity [
