<p id="Par9">In addition to dGTP-depletion, ribavirin also enhances viral mutagenesis by the incorrect substitution of ribaivirin triphosphate (RTP) in place of GTP into the viral RNA as most viral polymerases lack proofreading capacity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, despite a well-documented history of broad-spectrum antiviral activity, ribavirin displayed strikingly weak antiviral activity against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Coronaviruses possess a unique bifunctional enzyme called nsp14, which methylates the viral RNA cap and excises erroneous mutagenic nucleotides that are inserted by the error-prone nsp12 polymerase. This unique ability allows the coronavirus nsp14 to excise RTP from the viral genome limiting the antiviral activity of ribavirin. This extraordinary RNA correction machinery imparts nucleoside drug resistance to coronaviruses and is the likely source of their RNA-based genome expansion [
