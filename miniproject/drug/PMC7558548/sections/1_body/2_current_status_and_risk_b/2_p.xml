<p id="Par14">The clinical development of and application of an antiviral agent requires careful consideration of its putative benefit 
 <italic>vis a vis</italic> its potential side-effects (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). When targeting host proteins, the topic of drug-related adverse events (DAEs) and toxicity is inescapable. DAEs can be assigned to one of two sources i.e. chemical-related toxicities or pathway-related toxicities. The chemical toxicity of a potential drug is driven primarily by undesirable chemical liabilities of reactive, labile functional groups. On the other hand, pathway-related toxicity is a function of the biological pathway that is targeted for therapeutic intervention. While chemistry associated toxicities routinely encumber any drug development program, pathway-related toxicities are more complex. A common benefit of DAAs is that they are designed to hit a viral protein and not a host protein, thereby reducing theoretical concerns of off-target effects. However, even with DAAs, off-target effects are unavoidable as there are over tens of thousands of known host proteins.
