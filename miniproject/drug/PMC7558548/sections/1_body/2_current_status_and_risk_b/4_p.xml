<p id="Par16">Respiratory viral infections such as those caused by influenza and coronaviruses, or hemorrhagic fevers that are triggered by dengue or zika viruses with pandemic potential are acute infections that can resolve within a few weeks. Therefore, treatment strategies are characterized by short term use, permitting a higher threshold to accept non-fatal, adverse effects. It is noteworthy, that such risk-benefit analysis was recently employed by the FDA and the Data Safety Monitoring Committee in the ATCC-1 trial endorsing an emergency approval of remdesivir for COVID-19. While serious adverse effects (SAEs) were reported in 114 of the 541 (21%) patients in the remdesivir group, the approval suggests a higher tolerance for accepting SAEs in favor of the benefits associated with short term use.</p>
