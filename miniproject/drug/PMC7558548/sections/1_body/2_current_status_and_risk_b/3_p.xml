<p id="Par15">For HDAs, such considerations must take center stage as targeting proteins or pathways that are important to cellular development and homeostasis should be avoided. The cardiac toxicity of HCQ in the COVID-19 setting effectively illustrates this point [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the development of HDAs, the prospect of pathway-related toxicities will require more rigorous investigation in the preclinical and translational stages of drug development. These concerns must be tempered by the fact that such liabilities are routinely faced in the development of drugs for non-viral diseases where host proteins are consistently pursued, including diabetes, oncology and autoimmune diseases. Thus, modern drug development teams are adequately prepared to include such considerations during the mechanism of action and translational workup on a drug candidate.
