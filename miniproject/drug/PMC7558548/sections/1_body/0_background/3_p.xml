<p id="Par4">The approval of remdesivir, a nucleoside analog originally developed for the treatment Ebola virus infections, has added hope to the early management of COVID-19 infections. Remdesivir was found to have in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, further mechanism of action studies showed that it targets the viral nsp12 polymerase and acts as a chain terminator in viral replication. Recent clinical studies involving remdesivir have shown promising results as  its use is associated with a shorter time to recovery in comparison to placebo (11 days vs. 15 days) [

A key concept that is noteworthy from the above experience is the need for broad-spectrum antivirals with diverse mechanisms of action that are readily deployable for the prevention of future pandemics of known or unknown viruses.
