<p id="Par2">The exponential global spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic, has stunned the world with a staggering socioeconomic and public health impact [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. To date, this novel coronavirus has infected over 33 million people in 213 countries and resulted in over 1 million deaths worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Despite SARS-CoV-2 being the seventh known coronavirus to infect humans, the therapeutic landscape has remained barren, creating an urgent demand for the development of effective therapeutics for COVID-19 patients. While effective COVID-19 management requires both antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment strategies, the need for a potent and safe antiviral for therapeutic and prophylactic use is undisputed. However, the expectations of developing safe and selective antiviral agents in a short time frame are impractical given that drug development from target discovery to approval takes 12 years on average [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, initial efforts have been focused on the repurposing of clinical stage or approved drugs. Even with therapeutic repurposing as a rapid strategy to redirect approved or clinical-stage drugs that were originally discovered for other diseases, the global community has witnessed the intricacies, nuances and challenges of drug development.
