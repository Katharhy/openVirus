<p id="Par17">The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic underscores the need for both DAAs and HDAs in our antiviral armamentarium. Broad-spectrum antiviral agents such as HDAs can be readily deployed on a large scale to blunt viral spread while effective vaccines or DAAs are being developed. Although SARS-CoV-2 may fall short of triggering an apocalyptic scenario, it is an omen to looming viruses of known and unknown origins. Our antiviral drug development philosophy requires a careful reconsideration to include host-specific therapeutic targets for the management of viral infections.</p>
