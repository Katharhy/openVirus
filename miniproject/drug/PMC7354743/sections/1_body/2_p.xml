<p id="Par4">For the human population, COVID-19 is the third significant coronavirus infection to occur in the twenty-first century, following severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002â€“2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, which have not stopped yet. Since 2012 until 29 February 2020, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2538 with 871 associated deaths. But while those outbreaks alerted the world to the virulent potential of the coronavirus family, SARS fizzled out faster than a vaccine could make its way through clinical trials, and MERS was not viewed seriously enough to generate sustained funding for vaccine developers. This despite the fact that the 2002 SARS and 2012 MERS outbreaks, both caused by close relatives of the new coronavirus, were warning shots that claimed approximately 774 and 871 lives, respectively.</p>
