<p id="Par9">Thus, in one way or another, all vaccines aimed at preventing zoonotic RNA viruses are focused on producing specific antibodies and activating cytotoxic T lymphocytes that can cause the death of virus-infected cells. In general, the lack of effective vaccines against some RNA viruses, such as coronaviruses, HIV, and HCV, can be explained by the large number of mutations that occur during replication, as well as weak antibody activity. To some extent, the slow progress in the development of HCV and SARS coronavirus vaccines is also due to the lack of sufficient funding and the advent of highly effective DAA in the case of HCV. Nevertheless, a large number of RNA viruses of zoonotic origin will always carry with them the danger of new pandemics; the creation of vaccines can help humans be better prepared to meet them. Ideal vaccines are those that will be effective for the vast majority of people and against most of the strains of the target circulating RNA virus. One promising strategy is to create vaccines based on conservative sequences of viral genomes using oligonucleotides. Despite the impressive success of currently approved adjuvants for generating immunity to viral and bacterial infections, there remains a need for improved adjuvants that enhance protective antibody responses, especially in populations that respond poorly to current vaccines. Today, the larger challenge is to develop vaccines that generate strong T cell immunity with purified or recombinant vaccine antigens. Oligonucleotides can be used as both antigens and adjuvants.</p>
