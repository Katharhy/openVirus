<p id="Par15">At this juncture, we propose a SARS-CoV-2 aerosol-based vaccine based on a lasso-like phosphorothioate oligonucleotide construction containing CpG motifs and antigen-presenting unique sequence (APUS) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Aerosol immunization seems to be a promising method of vaccination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>], including as it does aerosolized delivery of nucleic acids optimized for lung uptake [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>] and nasal spray [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Several independent studies have now demonstrated that the dependence on CpG motifs for TLR9 activation is restricted to synthetic phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (PS-ODN), and that natural phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotides (PD-ODN) bind and activate TLR9 via the 2′ deoxyribose backbone in a sequence-independent manner [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Indeed, further control can be achieved through recognition of cytosine methylation, which acts as a negative determinant, i.e., its presence in mammalian DNA prevents the triggering of TLR9.
