<p id="Par3">SARS-CoV-2 is positive-sense, single-stranded RNA betacoronavirus from the Coronaviridae family. Genomic alignments suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 from the genus 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> may be the result of a recombination of genetic material from two different viruses, one similar to the Chinese horseshoe bat virus and the other closer to the pangolin virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In fact, only two scenarios will occur simultaneously in the very near future: people who are genetically resistant to the virus will get sick, recover, and develop immunity, while people who are sensitive to the virus will need drugs and vaccines, which will have to be researched and developed if they are to recover. Since SARS-CoV-2 mutates constantly and more frequently than other RNA viruses (coronaviruses possess the longest genomes of all known RNA viruses, so more errors are made when they are copied; also, viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases do not have a proofreading nuclease activity), it is likely that many new strains of the virus will appear and this will be a problem for creating vaccines. Still, vaccines are arguably the most powerful medical intervention in the fight against infectious diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Generally, all vaccines work on the same basic principle. They present part or all of the pathogen to the human immune system, usually in the form of injections and in low doses, to induce the system to produce antibodies to the pathogen and activate induction of cross-reactive antiviral T cells, particularly the cytotoxic T lymphocytes that can kill virus-infected cells. Specific T lymphocytes and antibody-producing plasma cells (B cells) represent a kind of immune memory, which, once a virus is detected, can be quickly mobilized again if a person is exposed to the virus in its natural form. Traditionally, adjuvants (aluminum salts, squalene-in-water emulsions, imidazoquinoline derivatives, saponins, synthetic phophorothioate-linked DNA oligonucleotides with optimized CpG motifs, etc.) have been used in vaccines to increase the magnitude of an adaptive response to a vaccine, based on antibody titer or ability to prevent infection. However, a second role for adjuvants has become increasingly important: guiding the type of adaptive response to produce the most effective forms of immunity for each specific pathogen [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Previous studies on several animal coronaviruses also suggest that not only humoral but also cellular, immunity plays a role in protecting against virus infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Classic methods involve taking a whole virus, weakening or killing it, then injecting its remains into a person’s body.
