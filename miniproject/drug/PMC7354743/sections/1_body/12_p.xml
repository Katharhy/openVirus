<p id="Par14">With advancing age, both humans and animals become highly susceptible to SARS-CoV and other respiratory virus infections. Such an age-dependent increase in susceptibility is associated with a significant reduction in the magnitude of the virus-specific T cell response [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Young C57BL/6 mice (6 weeks of age) generate a SARS-CoV-specific CD8 T cell response that is approximately eightfold greater than that observed in 12-month-old mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Virus-specific CD8 T cells play a critical role in viral clearance; CD4 T cells provide the necessary support for the antiviral function of the CD8 T cells [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]; in other words, they depend on the genetic component of the host-virus relationship. Eventually, in the absence of vaccines and drugs, natural selection will rapidly lead to the survival of only genetically resistant individuals in a host population.
