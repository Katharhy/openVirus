<p id="Par12">TLR9 agonists have demonstrated a substantial potential as vaccine adjuvants, and as mono- or combination therapies for the treatment of cancer and infectious and allergic diseases. Commonly referred to as CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN), TLR9 agonists directly induce the activation and maturation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and enhance differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells. Preclinical and early clinical data support the use of TLR9 agonists as vaccine adjuvants, where they can enhance both the humoral and cellular responses to diverse antigens [

When used as vaccine adjuvants, CpG ODN improve the function of professional antigen-presenting cells and boost the generation of humoral and cellular vaccine-specific immune responses. These effects are optimized by maintaining the ODN and the vaccine in close proximity. The adjuvant properties of CpG ODN are observed when administered either systemically or mucosally, and persist in immunocompromised hosts. Preclinical studies indicate that CpG ODN improve the activity of vaccines targeting infectious diseases and cancer. Clinical trials demonstrate that CpG ODN have a good safety profile and increase the immunogenicity of co-administered vaccines [
