<p id="Par23">With respect to the tendency of the body to overexpress cytokines and let loose a ‘cytokine storm’ during coronavirus infection in some humans, we are proposing vaccine construct having the CpG motifs which will help people’s immune systems train for this inflammation reaction in the absence of a real pathogen and real danger. In a broad sense, the immune system copes with the virus much more effectively if it has already encountered it. The unmethylated CpG motif is certainly that portion of the virus genome for which the immune system of sensitive people needs to be prepared. Generally, CpG ODN boosted the humoral immune response induced by vaccines against a large number of pathogens, including influenza virus, measles virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, orthopoxviruses, and other viruses [

At the height of the epidemic, when more than 500,000 people have already died, apparently it is time to try this approach when creating a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Even though SARS-CoV-2 will constantly sweep its tracks, an effective vaccine should contain a CpG motif as a conservative fingerprint of the pathogen to train the human immune response. The fight against COVID-19 will be difficult and lengthy. Nevertheless, the current situation will help to gain experience and the ability to prevent future coronavirus pandemics. Life goes on.
