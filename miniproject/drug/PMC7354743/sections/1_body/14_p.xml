<p id="Par16">In the proposed construction, the main role of the antigen-presenting part of the vaccine will be played by the phosphorothioate oligonucleotides found on the APUS region (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Phosphorothioate (PS) oligonucleotides, which contain a non-bridging sulfur, are the most widely studied oligonucleotides; compared to unmodified oligonucleotides, they possess higher solubility and nuclease stability, with improved membrane penetration. Nuclease stability is important because human lung fluid possesses DNase activity. This activity can be inhibited by the use of direct nuclease inhibitors, which enhance the uptake of oligonucleotide-based vaccines by cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>] or through oligonucleotide modification. Therapeutic use of oligonucleotides is highly dependent upon their efficient uptake by cells. The literature contains many reports of experiments both in tissue culture and in vivo using a phosphorothioate backbone to generate antisense effects mediated by an RNase H-dependent mechanism. These data have led to the investigation of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides in therapeutic clinical trials [
