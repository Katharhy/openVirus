<p id="Par11">In 1995, Krieg et al. reported that unmethylated CpG dinucleotides (CpG ODN) within bacterial DNA activated host defense mechanisms that led in turn to innate and adaptive immune responses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. CpG ODN is a ligand of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9) in antigen-presenting cells. Toll-like receptors (TLR) are a family of non-clonal pattern-recognition receptors that recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP). Under homeostatic conditions, TLR discrimnate ‘non-self’ from ‘self’ in that they do not sense host-derived ‘self-molecules’ but become activated by PAMP during infection [
