<p id="Par13">The majority of studies carried out previously in SARS-CoV-infected humans and animals pointed to a dysregulated/exuberant innate response as the leading contributor to SARS-CoV-mediated pathology. Almost two decades after the 2002–2003 SARS epidemic, we still do not have any approved preventive or therapeutic agents available with which to respond to the re-emergence of SARS-CoV or other related viruses. A strong neutralizing antibody response generated against the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV is completely protected in the susceptible host. However, neutralizing antibody titers and the memory B cell response are short lived in SARS-recovered patients and the antibody will only target the primary homologous strain. Follow-up studies from patients who recovered from SARS suggest that the SARS-CoV-specific antibody response is fleeting. In these patients, the SARS-CoV-specific IgM and IgA response lasted less than 6 months, while the virus-specific IgG titer peaked 4 months post-infection and declined markedly after 1 year. Despite the lack of virus-specific memory B cell response, SARS-CoV-specific memory T cells persist in SARS-recovered patients for up to 6 years post-infection. Consistent with the results from these human studies, results from animal studies also suggest that strong virus-specific T cell responses are required to protect mice from lethal SARS-CoV-MA15 infection. Future vaccine interventions should, therefore, consider strategies that enhance the T cell response to provide a robust long-term memory. Since tissue-resident memory T cells provide better protection, boosting both local and systemic memory T cell responses would be a more useful strategy than either of these interventions alone. Although the amount of data available on virus-specific memory T cell responses to emerging coronaviruses is limited, existing studies indicate that lung resident virus-specific memory CD8 T cells provide substantial protection following SARS-CoV challenge. These studies suggest a potential role for virus-specific memory T cells in broad and long-term protection against SARS-CoV infection. This is important as the response of neutralizing Abs and memory B cells to SARS-CoV declines significantly 1–2 years post-infection; in addition, these responses are strain specific [

Taken together, these data clearly suggest that the CpG ODN/TLR-9 interaction induces a strong innate immune response that promotes the subsequent development of an adaptive immunity triggered by the production of T helper cells one and pro-inflammatory cytokines.
