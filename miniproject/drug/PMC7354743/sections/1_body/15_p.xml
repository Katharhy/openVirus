<p id="Par17">We found that CpG dinucleotides are the least rare dinucleotides in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other known human coronaviruses (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), and hypothesized that their higher frequency could cause the unwanted increased lethal effect on the host, resulting in a 'cytokine storm' in people prone to overexpress cytokines through the activation of specific Toll-like receptor interactions with single-stranded RNA in a manner similar to those of TLR9-CpG ODN interactions. Most RNA viruses that infect mammals and other vertebrates profoundly suppress CpG dinucleotide frequencies [
