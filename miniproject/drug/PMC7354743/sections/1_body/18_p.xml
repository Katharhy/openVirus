<p id="Par20">Thus, in the proposed construct, the CpG 'tail' will trigger cells that express Toll-like receptor 9 (including human plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B cells) to mount an innate immune response characterized by the production of T helper cells 1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which will improve the function of the professional antigen-presenting cells and boost the generation of humoral and cellular vaccine-specific immune responses. Also CpG ‘tail’ is supposed to trigger Toll-like receptors that interact with the single-stranded RNA containing CpG motif in a manner similar to interactions with TLR9-CpG ODN. Generally, the unmodified 'tail' will serve as an adjuvant and will prepare the immune system for the meeting with the antigen found on the 'head'. The sequence of the ‘head’ (5′-GCAGAGACAGAAGAAACAGCAAAC-3′) is well conserved. It is found in every SARS-CoV-2 genome located in GenBank at this moment and belongs to a nucleocapsid phosphoprotein gene [protein_id = ”QJC2104QJC21049.1”) that has 87% query cover with Homo sapiens protein kinase C eta (PRKCH) (NG_011514.1). 9.1] that has 87% query cover with Homo sapiens protein kinase C eta (PRKCH) (NG_011514.1).</p>
