<p id="Par6">Vaccines are usually developed on the basis of certain virus strains, as follows. The most well-known example is influenza vaccines. Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family and are characterized by segmented, negative-strand RNA genomes. Infection with influenza viruses is a constant challenge, burdening people’s health and economies worldwide every year. These infections cause epidemics that can become pandemics, affecting 5–30% of the global population annually, and are responsible for millions of hospitalizations and hundreds of thousands of deaths each year [

These include wild aquatic birds, the natural reservoir for the influenza A virus, and pigs. Since pigs can become infected with influenza B virus, they may provide a natural reservoir for the virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. While influenza, like COVID-19, causes morbidity among all ages, those most vulnerable to its serious complications, such as pneumonia, are the elderly [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. At the present time, the two available types of influenza vaccines are administered by different routes: parenteral inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV), delivered by injection, and intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV). LAIV mimic the course of natural infections and thus induce a stronger immune response than IIV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Intransal administration of LAIV produces a variety of adaptive immune responses, including serum antibodies and mucosal and cell-mediated immunity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Based on data gathered by the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), a partnership of 141 national influenza centers in 111 countries, six WHO collaborating centers, and four WHO essential regulatory laboratories, WHO updates the composition of influenza vaccines (both IIV and LAIV) annually. The WHO GISRS continually collects and analyses global influenza virus samples. By monitoring circulating influenza A and B viruses for how recently they have occurred and with what frequency, changes can be made to the components in the vaccines slated for the upcoming influenza season in both the northern and southern hemispheres [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Current influenza vaccination strategy induces cells to produce antibodies directed against the surface antigens of these viruses, with the main targets being the surface glycoprotein antigens hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The amino acid sequences encoding HA and NA are hypervariable, as a consequence of antigenic drift or shift, respectively. This characteristic makes them responsible in large part for both epidemic and pandemic influenza outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition, these frequent changes to the surface antigens of influenza viruses allow them to avoid antibody-mediated immunity. On the other hand, it has been shown that cytotoxic T-lymphocyte populations, when directed against the internal antigens of influenza A virus, demonstrate a broad cross-reactivity with the influenza virus subtypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Both IIV and LAIV vaccines have a history of safe use in children and adults. However, both can cause adverse events and/or rare adverse events, some more prevalent in children, others more likely to occur in adults [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Each year, necessary changes are made to the formulation of influenza vaccines and when they are administered. Factors that affect those being vaccinated, both genetic and environmental, are difficult, if not impossible, to control. For these reasons, even though vaccines undergo strict monitoring before authorization, the possible occurrence of adverse effects, such as narcolepsy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], cannot be completely eliminated. Consequently, annual post-licensure vaccine safety surveillance is fundamental [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. For all of these reasons, no universal influenza vaccine is yet available against all influenza virus subtypes and seasonal influenza vaccines require annual updates. The lack of preventive vaccines for clinical use in humans against such viruses makes emerging influenza and coronaviruses a serious global threat [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Currently, available vaccines keep deaths from influenza relatively under control. However, when any influenza virus lineage emerges in a novel mammalian host population, the threat of a direct or indirect pandemic is a real risk [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].
