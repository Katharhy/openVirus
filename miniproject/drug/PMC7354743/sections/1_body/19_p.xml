<p id="Par21">Summing up, the proposed design contains CpG dinucleotides, important for in the activation of innate immunity, and a unique genomic sequence of the virus, the antigen-presenting component that activates adaptive immunity. Similar vaccine constructs based on phosphorothioate oligonucleotides can have a wide variety of unique sequences based on the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains, and each vaccine may contain a dozen of these lasso-like constructs. In the very near future, we plan to test such vaccines on the murine coronavirus, taking care not to miss any possible negative effects, and remaining aware that the PS backbone dramatically increases the non-specific ODN binding to a wide variety of proteins [
