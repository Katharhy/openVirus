<p id="Par5">One major hitch in developing a COVID-19 vaccine is that no medically proven predecessor exists for any type of human coronavirus. Only a small number of SARS-CoV vaccines made it to Phase I clinical trials before funding dried up because the virus was eradicated from the human population through non-pharmaceutical interventions when the case numbers were still small. The first vaccine tested in a clinical trial is made from the inactivated form of SARS-CoV. Several live attenuated, genetically engineered, or vector vaccines encoding the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein have been tested in pre-clinical studies. These vaccine candidates are effective in terms of eliciting protective immunity in the vaccinated animals. However, the use of whole virus or full-length S protein-based immunogens in humans should be approached with caution, because their use could induce harmful immune or inflammatory responses. Some authors have proposed the use of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV S protein (residues 318â€“510) in the development of a safe and effective subunit SARS vaccine. This functional domain, responsible for mediating virus-receptor binding, is also a major neutralization determinant of SARS-CoV [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], can cross-react with the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. This suggests that SARS-CoV vaccines might cross-protect against SARS-CoV-2. However, because these vaccines have not been developed further than Phase I, they are currently not available for use. MERS-CoV vaccines are unlikely to induce strong cross-neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 because of the phylogenetic distance between the two viruses. Nevertheless, we can still learn a lot from these vaccines about how to move forward with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design [
