<p id="Par7">The creation of vaccines for seasonal influenza viruses is justified because they work, but for some other RNA viruses, this is not so. The human immunodeficiency virus, types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2), is an example of a zoonotic infection that has spread all over the world without being stopped. At the moment, approximately 38 million people have been infected with HIV, but there is not a single successful vaccine able to effectively contain the HIV pandemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Both types of HIV are the result of multiple cross-species transmissions that occurred when simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) naturally infected African primates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which consists of two identical negative-sense single-stranded RNA molecules, belongs to the genus Lentivirus in the Retroviridae family, subfamily Orthoretrovirinae [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Attempts to develop a safe and effective HIV vaccine have been hindered by the difficulty in clearly defining the specific immune responses responsible for preventing infection and limiting disease progression. Since early attempts to use vaccines to induce neutralizing antibodies ended in disappointment, recent research efforts have focused on vaccines that induce T-cell immunity. The belief that the specific antiviral CD8 T lymphocyte response is crucial for immune control of viral replication has provided an important facet for ongoing efforts to develop effective vaccines against HIV. Unfortunately, while the actions of T cells are known to limit HIV and other viral infections after the infection has already occurred, their role, if any, in protecting against initial infection is much less clear [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. HIV-1 is highly mutable. This, combined with its complex structure and life cycle, has placed further obstacles in the path to developing an effective vaccine. The virus is a master of obfuscation. For instance, it uses variable glycosated residues to camouflage the conserved receptor- and coreceptor-binding sites on the viral envelope (Env) glycoproteins engaged in the virus’s attachment and fusion to host membrane receptors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In addition, the conserved sites are thermostably concealed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These are just two of the features that allow the virus to nimbly evade detection by cross-reactive antibody (Ab)-producing B cells that recognize conserved sites. As a part of its life cycle, HIV-1 is able to integrate into its host’s genome, forming a latent provirus that escapes immune recognition owing to the absence of significant protein expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) typically play a key role in controlling viral infections and contribute to the protective effect of many successful vaccines. Compelling data gathered using experimental animal models have demonstrated that NAb can prevent HIV-1 acquisition; however, no similar data exists for humans and the role of NAb in controlling established infection in humans is also limited. It is clear that HIV-specific NAb drives the evolution of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein within an infected individual. The ability of the virus to evade immune selection may be the main reason HIV-1 NAb exert limited control during infection. Attempts to define NAb capable of providing a broad spectrum of protection against diverse circulating HIV-1 strains have encountered the difficulties posed by the extraordinarily antigenic diversity of HIV-1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Reports that the breadth and potency of humoral responses are higher in subtypes C and A than in subtype B infections provides evidence that viral genetic subtype may also be important [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In addition to its talents for concealment, the virus can also make mistakes. The high error rate of the reverse transcriptase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], combined with the rapid turnover of plasma virions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], further hinders the development of an effective vaccine by providing a dizzying range of variants from which to select and escape from both cellular and humoral immune responses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. At present, at least 12 recognized HIV-1 genetic subtypes are known to exist in humans. Each of these subtypes has rapidly diversified to yield intersubtype recombinants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] that present an even greater challenge in the development of a universal HIV vaccine.
