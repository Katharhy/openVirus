<p id="Par10">Several studies have shown that oligonucleotides can improve the efficacy of vaccines, either by inducing antigen modification (i.e., by enhancing expression of immunogenic molecules) or by targeting certain components of the host immune system to achieve the desired immune response. However, despite their extensive use, problems such as insufficient stability and low cellular delivery have not been sufficiently resolved to achieve effective and safe oligonucleotide-based vaccines [

More recently, strategies that manipulate the expression of genes controlling the immune response or the expression of antigens of interest are being used to improve immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy. This line of research has a history of more than 30Â years; in one of the first experiments, when spleen cells from BALB/c mice were incubated with the nucleic acid fraction from different bacteria, the natural killer (NK) activity of the cells was remarkably elevated and the cells produced factors that activated macrophages and inhibited viral growth. The factor that activated the macrophages was interferon (IFN)-gamma and the other factor, which inhibited viral growth, was IFNalpha/beta. However, the nucleic acid fraction from neither of the vertebrate cells showed any such activity. This report provided evidence for the first time that, while DNA from microorganisms and invertebrates could induce IFN, the DNA from vertebrates, and probably from plants as well, could not [
