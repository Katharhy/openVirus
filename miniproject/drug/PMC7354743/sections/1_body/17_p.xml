<p id="Par19">In our ‘lasso’ construct, we placed the CpG motifs in the ‘tail’ region in the to 5′-purine-purine-unmethylated deoxycytosine-deoxyguanosine-pyrimidine-pyrimidine-3′ position [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>]. The ‘neck’ region of the construct features a double-stranded DNA region stabilized by 30 hydrogen bonds between 10 cytosines and 10 guanines. The double-stranded DNA ‘neck’ makes it possible to form a loop in the region of the antigen-presenting ‘head’. The presence of such a loop allows us to take advantage of the frequent formation of RNA loops in cells and their possible interaction with the corresponding Toll-like receptor interacting with single-stranded RNA. Only adenines, cytosines, and guanines are present in the construct, which makes it possible to activate pattern recognition receptors interacting with both ‘non-self’ DNA and ‘non-self’ RNA. Since the PS backbone is the basis of the construct, the presence of deoxyribose will be of little importance and everything will depend on the nucletide sequence of the construct [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. CpG motifs in nuclease-resistant PS backbones have been found to dramatically enhance B cell stimulatory properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. In almost all vertebrates, the optimal PS CpG ODN are extraordinarily strong mitogens for B cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. While the inhibitory effect observed for poly G motifs of CpG ODN reduces the level of B cell activation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>], in our construct, this motif is found in the double-stranded 'neck' and may have a positive inhibitory effect during possible acute inflammation that occurs after vaccination. As the body temperature rises, the double-stranded DNA ‘neck’ melts to produce a single-stranded oligonucleotide sequence containing two poly G motifs. Of note, in vertebrate genomes, CpG dinucleotides occur only ~ 25% as frequently as would be predicted if base utilization were random [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. Furthermore, the bases flanking CpGs in vertebrate genomes are not random: the most common base preceding a CpG is a C and the most common base following a CpG is a G [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. These types of CpG motifs do not support strong immune stimulation. In addition to these differences in CpG content, methylation of CpG dinucleotides differs between virus and host. These dinucleotides, which are not methylated in the pathogen DNA, are routinely methylated in vertebrate DNA at the 5th position of ~ 70% of the cytosines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. If immune recognition of CpG DNA has evolved as an effective defense, then it seems likely that pathogens would evolve counter strategies to block or evade the defense. One potential strategy would be for a pathogen to reduce the level of CpG in its genome to decrease its immune-stimulatory effects. In principle, this should be much easier for pathogens having small genomes and many of them were shown to have very low CpG content [
