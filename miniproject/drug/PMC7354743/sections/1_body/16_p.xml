<p id="Par18">However, it has been frequently hypothesized that recognition of CpG motifs is part of an as yet uncharacterized ‘self-non-self’ recognition system coupled to an innate immunity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. This may be functionally and perhaps evolutionarily related to the Toll-like receptor 9 that recognizes non-methylated CpG dinucleotides in DNA sequences [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. Atkinson et al. decided to investigate the roles played by the various components of the innate immune system in recognizing dinucleotides and recruiting antiviral defenses. Their interest was caught when they observed that elevated frequencies of both UpA and CpG attenuated viral replication, whereas frequencies lower than those of native viral sequences enhanced replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. However, our thinking goes in the other direction: natural selection aims to strengthen the genotypes of RNA viruses with fewer CpG dinucleotides, because otherwise, a strong 'cytokine storm' is unleashed in people prone to overexpress cytokines, causing the death of the host, which for the virus presents a developmental impasse. Any virus that completely eliminates its host population finds itself in an evolutionary dead end since viruses are obligate intracellular parasites. A certain balance of power exists in the virus-host relationship; to an extent, all of its participants remain ‘gentlemen’ and provide their opponents with the opportunity to survive and reproduce. The system sacrifices units, but the community is saved. Dinucleotides appearing and disappearing during the microevolution of the coronavirus CpG apparently help to adjust (more or less) the optimal level at which the parasite disseminates when the virus replicates, resulting in a moderate number of deaths of individuals in the host population. Since SARS-CoV-2 appeared only recently in the human population, in the near future we will see just such an adjustment as the number of CpG oligonucleotides changes in the direction optimal for the virus to replicate. Interestingly, the genome of virus strains sequenced in China (Wuhan) on February 11, 2020 contained on average 1 CpG dinucleotide more than was observed in later strains from the USA sequenced on May 6, 2020 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Obviously, at the beginning of the microevolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population, natural selection tends to favor viral genomes containing fewer CpG motifs so as not to trigger a strong innate immune response. Apparently, people who become infected with the virus have moderate symptoms and spread SARS-CoV-2 more readily. It is worth noting that the influenza A virus, which originated from an avian reservoir, has undergone a significant reduction in the number of CpG nucleotides since its introduction into humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. This hypothesis is further reinforced by the fact that the CpG motif in an AU-rich oligonucleotide can significantly stimulate the immune response of plasmacytoid dendritic cells [
