<p id="Par2">Vaccines and drugs help mankind reduce the effects of natural selection when meeting and dealing with pathogens. On the one hand, this slows down the process of adaptation of the human population to negative environmental factors; on the other hand, we save that which is most valuable—the life of each individual person. Nevertheless, it must be recognized that drugs and vaccines only delay the fatal meeting of the causative agent of the disease with those who are pathogen-sensitive or their genetic descendants. Natural selection is merciless—only the fittest survives. Since no one knows for sure which pathogen he or she will be sensitive to, everyone expects that at the nearest pharmacy a person will find, at the right time, a medicine that will save his or her life. Obviously, this is not what happens. Today, during the sudden COVID-19 pandemic, we understand how fragile our habitual way of life has turned out to be. In fact, we are at the mercy of pure natural selection, and we are not able to oppose it with any effective vaccine or drug. Nevertheless, a sufficiently large number of research groups have already joined the race to create vaccines and drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which in the next few years will significantly slow down the effect of natural selection. In turn, weakened by vaccines and drugs, natural selection will continue to work and COVID-19 will morph into a disease with mild symptoms in the years to come. However, at this moment in time, during the exponential growth of the pandemic, the virus is aggressive and needs to be restrained as soon as possible.</p>
