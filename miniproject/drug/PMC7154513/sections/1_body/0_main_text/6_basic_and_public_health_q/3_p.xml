<p id="p0085">From the basic science view, we must be forward looking to address questions about the interplay between coronaviruses and their hosts. SARS-CoV-2 is the third recently emerged zoonotic coronavirus. Genomic sequences support that these viruses are closely related to bat coronaviruses. Given the large number of novel coronaviruses identified in bat populations, we likely will continue to have spillover to humans. What factors drive this? Are there genomic signatures in bat viruses that may help predict which viruses will eventually emerge? Do the emerging viruses need to route through an intermediate host prior to infecting humans? What accounts for the spectrum of disease outcomes when this happens, and what drives human-to-human spread? Are there viral and/or host genetic factors involved in disease outcome?</p>
