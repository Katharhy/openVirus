<p id="p0015">A severe respiratory disease emerged in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019. As of early February 2020, at least 28,088 diagnosed and 24,702 suspected cases have been reported, including at least 564 deaths. Unfortunately, the disease has spread globally. The etiologic agent, a novel coronavirus, now called SARS-CoV-2, was immediately identified and characterized in China. Although we know the presence of unprecedented genetic diversity of viruses in nature, this outbreak further indicates that there is considerable uncertainty in predicting when, where, and how novel disease-causing pathogens emerge.</p>
