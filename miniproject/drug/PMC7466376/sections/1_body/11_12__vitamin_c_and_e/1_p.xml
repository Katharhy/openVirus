<p>Vitamin C is a cofactor for multiple enzymes that is water-soluble [
 <xref rid="B103-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. It is absorbed at the intestinal level through the sodium-dependent transporter of vitamin C, filtered freely in the glomerulus and reabsorbed at the proximal tubule level through the same transporter [

 <sup>−</sup> and O

 <sup>−</sup> by inhibiting the NAPH oxidase that produces both O

 <sup>−</sup> and iNOS mRNA expression. Therefore, it prevents the abundant NO production that generates OONO
 <sup>−</sup> in the presence of O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> It also decreases pathological vasoconstriction, as well as the loss of vascular permeability by inhibiting the oxidation of tetrahydrobiopterin, which is the cofactor for eNOS, preventing decoupling between NO and eNOS, which generates O

Another of its effects is to protect against capillary leakage by inhibiting the activation of protein phosphatase 2A, which dephosphorylates occludin which is crucial for the maintenance of tight junctions. Vitamin C has a protective role against mitochondrial permeability, by activating apoptosis pathways. It also inhibits TNF-α and induces ICAM expression, which increases the adhesiveness of leukocytes in the microcirculation [
