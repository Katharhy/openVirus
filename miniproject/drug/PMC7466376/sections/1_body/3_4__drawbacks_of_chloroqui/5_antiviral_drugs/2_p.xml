<p>Remdesivir acts on viral RNA polymerase, evading proofreading by viral exo-nuclease, diminishing viral RNA production. A slowed suspension of the nascent chain of RNA from the virus has been suggested as the antiviral mechanism of Remdesivir. Remdesivir had antiviral activity against many EBOV variants [
 <xref rid="B62-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In-vitro studies showed that Remdesivir suppresses coronaviral replication including that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Remdesivir was efficient against Bat-CoVs and other circulating human-CoV in human lung cells when it was tested in-vitro using epithelial cell cultures of primary human airways. Another study showed that Remdesivir and INF-β were more effective than lopinavir, ritonavir and INF-β in-vitro and in a MERS-CoV mouse model. Therefore, Remdesivir might constitute an alternative for the therapy of patients with COVID-19 [
