<p>Preclinical studies have proposed the administration of 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetylcysteine (NAC), a precursor of glutathione, as a strategy to limit oxidative stress lung injury since it increases the content of intracellular glutathione [
 <xref rid="B89-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. A central feature of many lung diseases is the alterations of the metabolism of glutathione that occurs both in the alveoli and lung tissue [
 <xref rid="B90-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. NAC increases the synthesis of glutathione synthesis, elevates glutathione-S-transferase activity and has a direct action on free radicals. However, treatment with NAC does not decrease lung tissue myeloperoxidase activity or 3-nitrotyrosine levels [

 <italic>N</italic>-acetylcysteine decreases the levels of IL-8, IL-6, ICAM and the soluble Î± receptor for tumor necrosis p55. These mechanisms could be attributed to the adequate control of the inflammatory immune response. In relation to clinical behavior with the use of NAC in patients with septic shock, a shorter mechanical ventilation time and fewer days of ICU stay have been found [
