<p>The use of liposomes (L-NAC) elevates NAC absorption and intracellular concentration. There were high non-thiol proteins with a pre-treatment with L-NAC (25 mg/kg intravenous) and NAC levels were elevated in homogenates of the lung. Lipid peroxidation, chloramine concentration, damage to ACE, lung edema and the concentrations of thromboxane and leukotriene B2 and B4 were diminished in the lungs after NAC supplementation in LPS-exposed animals [
