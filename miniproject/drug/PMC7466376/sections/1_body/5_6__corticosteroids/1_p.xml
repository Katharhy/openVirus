<p>The use of corticosteroids was widespread during the outbreaks of severe MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 and they are now being employed in patients with SARS-CoV-2 in combination with other therapeutics. Combination treatment of low-dose systematic corticosteroids and antivirals and atomized inhalation of interferon are proposed as management of critical patients with COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B67-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Corticosteroids inhibit lung inflammation and diminish the immune responses while increasing the clearance of the pathogen. Systemic inflammation is associated to adverse outcomes in severe cases of influenza and SARS-CoV infection. In SARS, there is still inflammation after viral clearance. In SARS and MERS infections the pulmonary histology shows that there is inflammation, diffuse alveolar damage and septic shock. These conditions have been reported in patients with COVID-19.
