 <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine also called melatonin (MT) is the main endogenous product of secretion of the pineal gland in vertebrates, which is released into the circulation and cerebrospinal fluid [
 <xref rid="B116-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. MT has been proposed as a sepsis control agent. Its wide extracellular and intracellular distribution and its synthesis in various of organs can explain the MT role in modulating in numerous physiological processes through various mechanisms. To date, we are not aware of studies in humans with septic shock using MT [
 <xref rid="B117-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. MT has been shown to possess ROS sequestration properties, which protect lipids of cell membranes, cytosol proteins and nuclear and mitochondrial DNA [

 <xref rid="B117-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that it can prevent lipid peroxidation [

 <xref rid="B119-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>] and reduce levels of hydroperoxide in mitochondria by restoring glutathione homeostasis and mitochondrial function in organelles under oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B120-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Also, MT is also able to stimulate gamma-glutamyl cysteine synthase; therefore, it can increase the intracellular glutathione synthesis [
 <xref rid="B121-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Another of its antioxidant mechanisms is through the restoration of activity of mitochondria that is diminished in some diseases, reducing the consumption of O
 <sub>2</sub> by liver mitochondria. Thus, it protects organs from excessive oxidative damage [
