<p>Regarding acute lung injury secondary to sepsis, an increase in ROS and RNS has been described, derived from the increase in the decoupling of eNOS and iNOS overexpression [
 <xref rid="B123-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>], which is associated with an increase and release of proinflammatory mediators such as TNF-Î±, IL-6 and IL-9 by bronchial epithelial cells. This leads to macrophages [
 <xref rid="B124-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>], activating neutrophils and other macrophages which cause alveolar destruction and collapse of small airways. These changes can induce endothelial damage, increased pulmonary capillary permeability and pulmonary edema causing deterioration in gas exchange [
