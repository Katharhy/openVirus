<p>The release of IL-1 and IL-6 are suppressed by Tocilizumab. Therefore, this drug has a therapeutic effect in many inflammatory diseases, including viral infections [

The inflammatory state induced by the SARS-CoV-2 might also be decreased by the overexpression of cytokine IL-37 which abolishes acquired and innate immune response. IL-37 also inhibits inflammation by its action on the IL-18Rα receptor. IL-37 acts on mTOR thus elevating the adenosine monophosphate kinase that has immunosuppressive activity. By inhibiting IL-6, IL-1β, CCL-2 and TNF-α, this cytokine suppress inflammation and the molecules of the class II histocompatibility complex. Another inhibitory cytokine that may help in patients with COVID-19 is the newest cytokine of the IL-1 family, IL-38, which is produced by some immune cells including macrophages and B cells, IL-38 inhibits IL-1β and other pro-inflammatory cytokines [
