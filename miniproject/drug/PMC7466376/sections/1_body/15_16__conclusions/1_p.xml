<p>Corona Virus Disease-2019, which results in a severe pneumonia that develops into pulmonary alveolar collapses in a few h and leads to the cessation of oxygen exchange, is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Î²-coronaviruses. Recognition by a receptor in the host, protease cleavage of the host membrane and fusion determine the transmissibility and pathogenesis of the virus. The ACE2 receptor is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in all target organs. The mechanism of infection by the virus correlates with the comorbidities that increase the death rate of the infection since the ACE2 receptor number is altered by the diseases or their treatment. Many therapeutic measures have been proposed and are being tested for COVID-19 patients. We suggest the use of antioxidant drugs to improve the conditions of these patients. Oxidizing agents come from the phagocytic leukocytes such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages and eosinophils invading the tissue. Free radicals promote cytotoxicity injuring cells. They degrade essential cellular components and alter the protease/antiprotease balance in the tissue interstitium. They also trigger the mechanism of inflammation following an initial insult. In COVID-19, there is an intense inflammatory response that is known as a cytokine storm. Oxidative stress mediates the activation of NFkB inducing in turn the transcription of certain genes thus promoting cytokine production. Release of these cytokines enhances the inflammatory response. Although antioxidant therapy has not been tested in this disease, consequences of this measure in respiratory failure, particularly in ALI/ARDS, have been reported. It improves oxygenation rates; increases glutathione and promotes a stronger immune response. There is a reduction of the mechanical ventilation time, length of hospital stay, length of ICU stays, mortality rate and multiple organ dysfunction rates in ALI/ARDS patients and therefore it could also help patients with severe COVID-19.</p>
