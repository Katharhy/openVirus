<p>In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) there is an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) [
 <xref rid="B36-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These events are associated with the increased release of pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α by bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages [
 <xref rid="B37-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], which may then activate neutrophils and macrophages, resulting in alveolar wall destruction and the collapse of small airways [
 <xref rid="B38-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These changes may induce endothelial damage, pulmonary capillary hyper-permeability and pulmonary edema, resulting in the deterioration of pulmonary gas exchange [

Furthermore, in severe sepsis in ARDS, when there is life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by the host’s inadequate response to infection, the cardiovascular system increases the cardiac output and lowers peripheral resistance adopting a hemodynamic profile that leads to arterial dilatation [
 <xref rid="B40-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. An excessive drop in peripheral resistance or its prolonged time course may result in progressive hypotension that is refractory to catecholamines and may contribute to severe cardiovascular failure [
 <xref rid="B41-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In different experimental models and in humans with severe septic shock, there is a high production and release of superoxide (O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>) and peroxynitrite (ONOO
 <sup>−</sup>) by different pathways that contributes to failure of the lungs, heart, brain and liver [
 <xref rid="B42-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Despite limited clinical data, moderate and severe septic shock is developed in many viral diseases such as SARS-CoV, which may increase the production of ROS and RNS. Overproduction of these molecules is associated to an elevated expression of iNOS, NADP oxidases, cyclooxygenase 2 and xanthine oxidase that activate transcription factors such NFkB resulting in an exacerbated proinflammatory host response [

 <xref rid="B44-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In addition, O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> and ONOO
 <sup>−</sup> participate as important mediators of the pro-inflammatory interleukin production. Moreover, these molecular species will continue to stimulate the production and release of more ROS and RNS which may interfere with mitochondrial respiration, since mitochondrial dysfunction is commonly induced in a septic shock environment [
