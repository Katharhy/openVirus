<p>Blood pressure (BP) levels are also more elevated in COVID-19 patients treated in the ICU in contrast to patients that did not require the entry into the ICU. ACE2 inactivates Ang II and provides Ang 1â€“7, which vasodilates vessels by activating the MAS receptor, thus negatively regulating RAAS [
