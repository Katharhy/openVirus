In this sense, when SARS-CoV-2 is present in the lower and upper respiratory tract, it results in mild or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The linking of SARS-CoV-2 to the Toll Like Receptor (TLR) results in the liberation of pro-IL-1β and there is then the liberation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin IL-6 and IL-1β.
