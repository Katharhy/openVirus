<p>Clinical investigations of COVID-19 have also found an increased AST level, prothrombin time prolongation and hypoproteinemia. The direct infection of the liver was confirmed by the existence of SARS viral nucleic acids in the liver. Moreover, apoptosis and mitoses, together with atypical features including ballooning of hepatocytes, acidophilic bodies and fibrosis or lobular activities without fibrin deposition, were found in percutaneous liver biopsies of SARS. The SARS-associated hepatotoxicity may be present when there is viral hepatitis or it may appear as an effect of the toxicity of consumed drugs such as elevated doses of antibiotics, antiviral medications and steroids or to an increased reaction of the immune system [
