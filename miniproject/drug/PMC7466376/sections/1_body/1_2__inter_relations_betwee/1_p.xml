<p>The transmissibility and pathogenesis of the viruses depend mainly on receptor recognition by the host, cleavage by a protease and membrane fusion. Entry depends on binding of the surface unit, S1, of the S protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which facilitates viral attachment to the surface of target cells and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming which entails S protein cleavage at the S1/S2 and the S2 site and allows fusion of viral and cellular membranes. This process is driven by the S2 subunit [

 <xref rid="B12-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It is an aminopeptidase that binds to the membrane and plays a vital role in the immune and cardiovascular systems of the host. It is involved in the development of hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), metabolic syndrome (MS) and diabetes [
