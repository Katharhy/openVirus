<p>It has also been reported that the COVID-19 infection leads to a higher mortality rate in elderly patients. Nevertheless, this elevated mortality could be associated with comorbidities and to the fact that these patients are usually receiving other medications to treat other conditions and that may be using ritonavir. Some of these conditions might be prostatic growth. Patients with prostatic growth receive treatment with alfuzosine, which, when combined with ritonavir, predisposes to severe hypotension [

The use of amiodarone increases its plasmatic concentrations and increases the risk of arrhythmias or other adverse reactions of drugs used for the treatment of COVID-19. The use of antipsychotics and neuroleptics is also common in elderly patients. Their use together with ritonavir and pimozide increases the risk of severe hematologic diseases. The use of ritonavir with antihistaminic drugs such as astemizol, terfenadine or with drugs that control the gastric motility increases their concentrations and leads to arrhythmias [
