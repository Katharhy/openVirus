<p>The virus has an incubation period of 2 to 10 days and the clinical spectrum of the disease ranges from a severe respiratory failure to an asymptomatic infection. Patients with the severe form of COVID-19 show a high respiratory frequency (≥30/min), dyspnea, abnormal partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (of &lt;300), low blood oxygen saturation (≤93%), and/or lung infiltrates (&gt;50%). Patients develop septic shock, respiratory failure, and/or multiple organ failure [

There is elevated lymphopenia, lactate creatinine and kinase dehydrogenase and a cytokine storm characterized by increased concentrations of IL-5, IL-1β, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-9, IL-15, IL-12p70, PDGF, VEGF, GCSF, FGF, IFN-γ, GMCSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, MIP-1B and TNF-α [

Oxidative stress (OS) mediates the activation of NFkB inducing in turn the transcription of genes promoting cytokine production. Release of these cytokines, in turn, enhances the inflammatory response. Oxidizing agents come from the phagocytic leukocytes such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages and eosinophils invading the tissue. Free radicals promote cytotoxicity thus injuring cells. They degrade essential cellular components and alter the protease/antiprotease balance in the tissue interstitium [
