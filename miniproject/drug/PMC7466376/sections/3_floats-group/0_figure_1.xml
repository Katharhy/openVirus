  <p>Ultrastructural lung features from a postmortem patient of COVID-19. The patient was a 68-year-old female from our Institute, with type II diabetes, ischemic heart disease, hypertension and morbid obesity as associated comorbidities. The pictures of the electron microscopy panels (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>) were made at 25,000× and 50,000× respectively with a Jeol JEM-1011 electronic microscope. Panel (
   <bold>A</bold>) shows the separation of the two muscular cells of the middle zone of a bronchiole with viral particles. Panel (
   <bold>B</bold>) shows the middle zone of a bronchiole with viral particles, the viral particles found measured between 56.2 and 102 nm and this agrees with the reported size of the virus. Abbreviations: C = cellule, CM = cellular membrane, VP = viral particle.
