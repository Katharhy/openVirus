  <p>SARS-CoV-2 air travel, mask’s effect on transmission, and temperature dependence. (
   <bold>a</bold>) The spread of virus particles depending on coughing and sneezing, as well as particle size. The mode of ejection affects velocity and distance traveled, while the size affects the ability to stay in the air; (
   <bold>b</bold>) The difference in the spread of viral load and aerosol droplets with a mask and without a mask; (
   <bold>c</bold>) The relationship between the mean replication rate of SARS-CoV-2 and the temperature of 24 different countries is demonstrated. There is a moderate negative correlation between the mean replication rate and temperature, with a
