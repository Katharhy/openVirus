  <p>Simulation tools for COVID-19 pandemic modeling and predictions. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Comparison of epidemic curves with (red) and without (blue) intervention, as suggested by the CDC; (
   <bold>b</bold>) The sequence of events initiated by utilizing the results of a simulator is shown; (
   <bold>c</bold>) The main factors considered for the COVID-19 simulators, such as measures of social distancing and probability of community spread; (
   <bold>d</bold>) Comparison of projected curves resulting from various simulations that cover different scenarios of social distancing, for the months of March to January in the US; (
   <bold>e</bold>) Projection of the number of active cases, those hospitalized, and deaths from COVID-19, simulated between May 3 to May 31 in the US; (
   <bold>f</bold>) A rendition of the billiards balls model by the Washington Post, to illustrate the benefits of social distancing. (LEFT) Simulation rendition which depicts effects caused if social distancing is not followed. (RIGHT) Simulation rendition, if social distancing is followed. The simulation renditions are followed by epidemic curve graphs; (
   <bold>g</bold>) A platform provided by the COVD-19 Visualizer website, which updates the number of cases worldwide in real-time; (
   <bold>h</bold>) A rendition of the comparison of mortality cases related to COVID-19, influenza, and pneumonia in the US, as visualized by the CDC; (
   <bold>i</bold>) A rendition of the various visualizations on COVID-19 spread worldwide, provided by the Johns Hopkins website; (
   <bold>j</bold>) Screenshot of an interactive simulator involving various metrics that predicts the severity of COVID-19 spread.
