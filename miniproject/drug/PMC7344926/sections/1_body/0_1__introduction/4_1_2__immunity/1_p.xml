<p>The chain of coronavirus infection happens when one person infects another and the cycle keeps going. This chain breaks when a significant proportion of the population has immunity against the viral or bacterial disease, through what is known as herd immunity [

 <xref rid="B8-diagnostics-10-00409" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This technique remains ineffective for all diseases such that the human body develops immunity against certain disorders after the first infection, or sometimes through vaccination. The same pattern applies to the newly emerging viral infection, COVID-19, due to the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (

However, the biggest concern for COVID-19 is the balance between the natural rate of disease transmission, and social distancing principles such that the population acquires herd immunity after it gets significantly exposed to the virus that facilitates the elimination of the pandemic. However, with the strict social distancing guidelines, the population remains unexposed to the virus to develop herd immunity. Lastly, a recently developed framework, termed as shield immunity, builds a pandemic recovery based on central interactions of recovered individuals, exhibiting no virus, but with their antibodies detected in serological tests [
