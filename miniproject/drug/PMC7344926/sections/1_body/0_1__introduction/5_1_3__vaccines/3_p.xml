<p>Favipiravir (Avigan) is another broad-spectrum antiviral drug that works by inhibiting the RNA polymerase machinery of RNA viruses, resulting in a nonviable virus phenotype. It was developed by Toyama Chemical in 2014 through screening chemical libraries for anti-viral activity against the influenza virus, and was approved and stockpiled in Japan against novel influence pandemics [

The study showed that Favipiravir resulted in a significant decrease in the median time to viral clearance and faster improvement in patientsâ€™ chest computed tomography (CT) scans [

However, this study was small and non-randomized, meaning that it needs to be supported by bigger, open-label, randomized, and controlled clinical trials to test the safety and efficacy of Favipiravir. Even though the drug was not initially approved in the USA for the treatment of influenza, several clinical trials have been designed to test its efficacy in treatment of COVID-19 patients across the entire country [
