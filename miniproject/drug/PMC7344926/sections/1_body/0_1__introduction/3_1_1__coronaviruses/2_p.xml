<p>SARS-CoV is one of 36 coronaviruses in the family Coronaviridae within the order Nidovirales. The demand for consumption of animal proteins allowed for the transmission from animals to humans [
 <xref rid="B5-diagnostics-10-00409" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission, as well as the lack of awareness in controlling infection, resulted in a large-scale spread over 8000 people, with a fatality rate of 10% in southern China in 2003. Horseshoe bats are the natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-like viruses, and civets can amplify the host and facilitate the transmission.
