 <xref rid="B6-diagnostics-10-00409" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. MERS coronaviruses can cause both human and veterinary outbreaks due to the ability of coronaviruses to recombine, mutate, and transmit between animals. Symptomatic MERS-CoV has an incubation period of 2 to 14 days, and symptoms include respiratory and enteric disease. Training and milking of camels have been associated with MERS-CoV infection, and people that consume raw camel milk or improperly cooked meat have a high risk of contracting MERS-CoV. The camel birthing season may result in the seasonal pattern of cases, which has a peak each year between April and June.
