<p>All three types of the coronavirus have shown to be a severe acute respiratory syndrome; however, SARS-CoV-2 has a lower fatality rate of 2.3%, while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have 10% and 36%, respectively. The key host for SARS-CoV-2 is bats; however, the intermediate zoonotic sources need to be identified. The most common signs and symptoms for people with COVID-19 are fever and cough. Fever was observed in around 90% of infected patients. A typical characteristic of COVID-19 is pneumonia and people have displayed heterogeneous symptoms, such as shortness of breath or dyspnea, as well as muscle ache. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted human-to-human and is mainly through indirect or direct contact with mucous membranes in the mouth, eyes, or nose (

SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmission rate than SARS-CoV, probably due to the genetic recombinant event in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 also has an incubation period from 3 to 7 days, but it could be as long as 24 days in rare cases [
