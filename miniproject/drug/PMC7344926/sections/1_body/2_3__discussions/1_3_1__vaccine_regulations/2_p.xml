<p>The University of Oxford is using a non-replicating viral vector from chimpanzeesâ€™ adenovirus to target the S glycoprotein, which is under a Phase I clinical trial [
 <xref rid="B117-diagnostics-10-00409" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. The vaccine contains the weakened version of the adenovirus with the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This spike protein acts as a protection for the immune system if COVID-19 infects the body. The University of Oxford and AstraZeneca have also paired together for the global development of this vaccine following the clinical trials [

However, in the case of a pandemic, many steps, such as clinical development and manufacturing development are done parallelly to speed up the development process. Previous tried-and-true methods must be utilized in vaccine development to allow for sufficient manufacturing [
