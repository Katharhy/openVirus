<p>Molecular testing checks for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material from respiratory specimens, either through swapping nostrils or sampling saliva. In addition to this, COVID-19 diagnostics involves serological testing for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and it can be done through a blood sample from a simple finger prick. Although serological tests are typically faster than molecular testing, a higher rate of producing false negatives is obtained because the human body starts producing antibodies against the virus a few days to a week after the infection. What further increases the complexity of the problem is the fact that the FDA has approved over 40 serological tests from different manufacturers, each with different precision and accuracy measures [
