<p>Pandemic Predictions for Hospitalizations: To prepare, plan, and optimize the health system during the pandemic, forecasting patient outcomes is critical. Factors that make patients at risk for hospitalization should be identified to calculate the probability of developing acute respiratory distress and organ failure during clinic treatments. Based on the dataset that includes blood samples and CT scans from patients, machine learning models can identify patients at high risk and who might develop respiratory distress in the future. Using models such as Gradient Boosting or the Support Vector Machine, key measurable and explainable features that influence those risks can be determined (
