<p>Spatial-Temporal Dynamics of Pandemics: From a societal perspective, ML can be used to predict the number of cases under various quarantine policies and cluster geographical regions to find similarities. Understanding how the virus is transmitted, and its effect on different demographics and geographic regions is crucial for public policy healthcare interventions. The effect of quarantine control in the COVID-19 spread can be accurately predicted using deep learning (

By using this model, the spread of the virus to implement reasonable quarantine rules could be predicted. An autoencoder was created for real-time forecasting of new cases using the latent variable layers to extract the most important features for each geographical region. The autoencoder was fed into a k-means clustering algorithm to group similar regions for further analysis [
