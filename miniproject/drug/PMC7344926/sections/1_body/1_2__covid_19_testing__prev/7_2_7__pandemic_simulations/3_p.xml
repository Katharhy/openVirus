<p>Social Pattern Analysis: Several of the other common models deal with scenarios of the entirety of the population at the outset (single group model), such as social hierarchy, division of the existing population into subpopulations (composite group model), characteristics and traits of individuals (individual models), and so on. For COVID-19 models, a model that capitalizes on individual traits and behaviors can be accurately simulated. To construct the model, a set number of rubrics about the behavior of individuals are considered. For example, the set of actions and time of execution of actions for each individual would be rigid. Given the prior movements of the individual, it should be possible to fully predict the individual’s whereabouts. Of course, except in cases such as the “Diamond Princess”, this would hardly be an accurate assumption, as it does not reflect the reality of the situation. If the models need to consider extensive individualistic behavior, to make them as accurate as possible, there is a need to acquire a huge amount of data. The active number of cases is predicted to decrease steadily until mid-June (

This case study helps in the analysis of how prevention of the COVID-19 infection could have been brought about by implementing control measures. Based on the environment that exists on the “Diamond Princess” cruise ship, a disease transmission model based on crowd flow control would be feasible for simulation purposes.
