<p>Hospital Resource Predictions: The Institute for Disease Modeling produced software called Epidemiological Modeling (EMOD) [
 <xref rid="B90-diagnostics-10-00409" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], which is used extensively by epidemiologists and research groups to understand the effects of taking measures to eradicate the disease, or at least slow it down. Utilizing mathematical basis and concepts, factors such as susceptibility to disease, cases which tested positive for COVID-19, and cases that recovered from COVID-19 are included. There are also assumptions made regarding the probability of a person catching COVID-19 in a population, which is further divided into groups to understand the propagation of the disease. The depletion of healthcare resources, such as the number of beds available in the US, can be circumvented by taking appropriate social distance measures. Simulation models predict the availability of the number of ICU beds, regular hospital beds, and equipment that are required, such as ventilators (
