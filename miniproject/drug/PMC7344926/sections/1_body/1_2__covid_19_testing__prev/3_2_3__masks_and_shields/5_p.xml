<p>With regard to homemade masks which the public has utilized for personal protection, hospitals are far less likely to utilize them in a hospital setting for any purpose other than for use by patients. This is due to their being constructed by a less effective material for blocking pathogens, and to them being made in non-medical-grade conditions that could cause contamination of the masks with microorganisms. Medical-quality masks are three times more effective in blocking the transmission of microorganisms than homemade masks, and are thus not suitable for use by medical professionals in the care of sick patients.</p>
