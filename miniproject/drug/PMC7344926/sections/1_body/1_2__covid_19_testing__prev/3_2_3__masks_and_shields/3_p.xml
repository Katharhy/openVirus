<p>Self-Manufacturing Masks: The three-dimensional (3D) printing community has responded quickly and effectively. A community with over 2 million consumers of 3D printers and 140,000 industrial 3D printers around the world had the unique ability to change their item of production in hours instead of weeks and months, effectively creating elastic production capacity for any device that can be 3D-printed. Bioengineers at the Stanford Prakash Laboratory are currently developing the Pneumask, a modified full-face snorkel mask that can be reused by health professionals for PPE [
 <xref rid="B57-diagnostics-10-00409" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The Pneumask features one inhaling port at the top of the mask, a breathing circuit filter that filters air entering through the inhaling port, and two exhaling ports at the bottom of the face (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="diagnostics-10-00409-f003">Figure 3</xref>e). The eyes, nose, and mouth are sealed from outside contact in this full-face snorkel. The 3D-printed design can be disassembled and autoclaved for reuse. This product has not been certified as PPE yet. At Duke’s Innovation Co-Lab, bioengineers have created a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) design [
 <xref rid="B58-diagnostics-10-00409" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] to modify current surgical helmets (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="diagnostics-10-00409-f003">Figure 3</xref>f (upper)). Surgical helmets do not filter the air in the room, so the laboratory used 3D printing to create a filter that could be attached to the suits (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="diagnostics-10-00409-f003">Figure 3</xref>f (lower)). PAPR was tested by the Precision Air Technology for HEPA certification, and is currently used by Duke Health. This product has also not been certified as PPE yet. In addition to the face masks designed by the Prakash laboratory and the Duke’s Innovation Co-Lab, there are fully 3D printable designs from the Veterans Health Administration and a Maker Mask group in Seattle. Each mask design relies on filter patches to be inserted into the mask. The Maker Mask is only meant for non-clinical settings where there are no FDA-approved masks available (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="diagnostics-10-00409-f003">Figure 3</xref>g). However, the Stopgap mask from the Veterans Health Administration was approved by the FDA to protect clinical personnel from COVID-19 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="diagnostics-10-00409-f003">Figure 3</xref>h). This approval was allowed as the mask had effective disposable filters, tightly fit around the nose and mouth, and was easy to disinfect.
