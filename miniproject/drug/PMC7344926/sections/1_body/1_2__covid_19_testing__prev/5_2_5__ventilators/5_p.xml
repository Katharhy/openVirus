<p>The use of mechanical ventilators on high-risk patients over the age of 65 years is being put under scrutiny. Based on a new report of 5700 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, of the patients between 18â€“65 years old, 76.4% died on mechanical ventilation, and 19.8% of patients died who were not on mechanical ventilation. Of the patients older than 65 years, 97.2% died on mechanical ventilation, and 26.6% died who were not on mechanical ventilation [

The discrepancy between patients who die on and off mechanical ventilation warrants further examination into the risk factors associated with using mechanical ventilation in different patient age-groups, disease stages, and disease severities.
