<p>In this paper, the biological background of coronaviruses was provided, with a specific focus on the newly emerging virus SAR-CoV-2 and the ongoing pandemic COVID-19. The diseaseâ€™s symptoms, methods of transmission, and the currently available medical supportive care were discussed. The control measures for a pandemic were highlighted to incorporate herd immunity, shield immunity, drug repurposing, and vaccine development. The various tools of protection were demonstrated, along with their proper use. A unique perspective was provided to utilize DIY fabrication methods to make face masks, face shields, and ventilators that provide adequate cost-effective protection against the disease. A multidisciplinary approach was presented to integrate machine learning applications, statistical simulations, and digital monitoring in combating COVID-19, tracking its spread, and predicting its trajectory. The role of public regulations in controlling the disease infection rate was shown, with specific emphasis on standardizing the criteria to report new COVID-19 patients, developing novel vaccines, and running nation-wide immunity tests. Finally, this review emphasized the need for preparedness for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.</p>
