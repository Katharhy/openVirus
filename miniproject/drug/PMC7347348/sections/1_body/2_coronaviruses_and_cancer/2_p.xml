<p id="par0065">SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 all belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae. 
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the main characteristics of the three CoV. Periodically, CoV outbreaks unpredictably occur and have rapid diffusion, possibly inducing fatal infections and representing a serious threat to human health. The absence of approved vaccines or drugs for the treatment of infections, together with the wide range of animal reservoirs for new CoV occurrence, make this infective danger even more harmful. Fatality rate ranges from 9.14 % for SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">Source, 2020a</xref>), to 34.4 % for MERS (
 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2020a</xref>), to around 5% for SARS-CoV-2 (with 506.041 deaths out of 10.268.839 confirmed cases as of June 30th 2020) (
 <xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">Source, 2020a</xref>). Epidemiologic studies confirm a higher fatality rate of all three CoV infections in subjects with comorbidities (cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease). Advanced age and male sex both represent additional recognized risk factors for poor outcomes (
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Hui et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Extance, 2020</xref>). Tobacco smoke has been recognized as a risk factor for MERS-CoV infection, but not confirmed in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, review of mortality and morbidity reports of previous CoV pandemics do not show an increased fatality rate in patients undergoing chemotherapy, solid organ transplantation or other immunosuppressive therapy. There is only one report on the features of MERS-CoV infection among patients with cancer during the outbreak in 2015. In this small population of oncologic patients (n = 19), only 15.8 % of them survived the infection, with a case fatality rate (CFR) more than doubled compared with the CFR of non-oncologic patients (
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">Jazieh et al., 2020</xref>). Accumulating data on COVID-19 reveal that, as for other CoV pandemics, patients with cancer did not seem to be more prone to develop infection. Of course, a possible confounding factor might be a higher rate of protective measures adopted by this high-risk population of subjects in view of a pandemic. The widest report on COVID-19 diffusion in China revealed a 0.9 % incidence of cancer among 1099 infected patients (
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Guan et al., 2020</xref>). A recent report from the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China, which collected 1590 cases of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to 575 hospitals, found that 1 % of subjects had a history of cancer (
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2020</xref>). Authors comment this prevalence is higher than that observed in the overall Chinese population according to 2015 epidemiology statistics (0.29 %) (
 <xref rid="bib0335" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). However, as assessed by 
 <xref rid="bib0310" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al. (2020)</xref> the small sample size and heterogeneity of data of this population of patients, make the correlation between COVID-19 and cancer not clear. Moreover, the vague definition of cancer history does not distinguish long-term survivors with diagnosis of previous cancer, from patients receiving active systemic treatment. As assessed by Wang et al. (
 <xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Zhang, 2020</xref>), 12 out of 16 patients included in the report by 
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al. (2020)</xref> had no clear immunocompromised condition (i.e. only 4 patients had undergone surgery or chemotherapy within the previous month). Two more Chinese reports on COVID-19 positive patients highlight a higher incidence rate for subjects with cancer with the epicenter of the epidemics, with lung cancer being fairly the most common diagnosis (
 <xref rid="bib0330" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0325" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). However, data suggest that advanced age, hospital admission and recurrent hospital visits might be critical risk factors, outweighing cancer diagnosis. Overall, these evidences suggest that COVID-19 diffusion in cancer patients is not prominent as expected for other viral infections, rather is as contagious as for the general population.
