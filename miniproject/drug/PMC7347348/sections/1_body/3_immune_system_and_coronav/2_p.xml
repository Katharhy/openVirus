<p id="par0070">Unlike other common viral agents (e.g. Adenovirus, Rhinovirus, Norovirus, Influenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus), CoV have not shown to cause a more severe disease in immunocompromised subjects. For this family of viruses, the host innate immune response appears the main driver of tissue damage during infection. There are many similarities between the pathogenesis of different CoV, mainly due to the high genomic similarity among these viruses, as well as significant differences (

In some individuals, the trigger of an exaggerate immune response through the production of chemotactic factors lead to uncontrolled inflammation and tissue damage (

The host innate immune system recognizes viral Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) through Toll-like receptors (TLRs). This interaction activates the Nuclear Factor Kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) transcription factor and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPK), leading to the expression of pro-inflammatory factors (

CoV infection promotes interferon (IFN) I synthesis and stimulation of signaling pathways (as NFkB, MAPKs, and JAK-STAT), triggering cell phagocytosis, dendritic cells (DCs) maturation, and immune cells chemotaxis. Studies on MERS-CoV show that the virus can directly infect macrophages and DCs, resulting in dysregulation in antigen presentation and cytokine production (
