<p id="par0075">Type I and III IFN represent the major antiviral molecules to limit initial CoV spread, through the promotion of intracellular antiviral defenses in epithelial cells and the recruitment of immune cells (

 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">Nelemans and Kikkert, 2019</xref>). Also T cells, both CD4+ and CD8 + T cells, play a significant antiviral activity. CD8 + T cells account for the majority of inflammatory infiltrate in the pulmonary interstitium of patients with COVID-19, playing both an antiviral cytotoxic effect as well as self-induced tissue injury (
 <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Histopathological findings of patients with SARS-CoV pneumonia show signs of non-specific inflammatory response (e.g. edema, immune cells infiltration), but also severe degeneration and damage of alveolar epithelial cells (
 <xref rid="bib0330" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). A study of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 revealed high levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (as IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-21, G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF) (
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). This so-called “cytokine storm”, in line with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, leads to the accumulation of cells and fluid within lung tissue, with diffuse alveolar damage resulting in respiratory failure (

 <xref rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2004</xref>). There is evidence that dysregulation in the innate immune response contributes to the clinical presentation of patients with severe COVID-19. High IL-6 levels have been shown to correlate with the need for mechanical ventilation and mortality in Chinese hospitalized patients (
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, the therapeutic weapon to counter-attack the cytokine storm-related tissue damage consists in the use of antibodies targeting IL-6 (tocilizumab), and IL-1 (canakinumab, anakinra). SARS-CoV-2 also acts on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, dysregulating immune response through the hyper-production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (
 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">Newton et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, lymphopenia is one of the most common features of patients with COVID-19. A retrospective report from a Chinese hospital on 452 patients with confirmed COVID-19 compared difference in the expression of infection related biomarkers between severe and non-severe cases (
 <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">Qin et al., 2020</xref>). Most patients had lymphopenia, high levels of inflammation biomarkers (e.g. C-reactive protein [CRP], procalcitonin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum ferritin) and circulating cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6) and chemokines (IL-8). Severe cases had higher leukocyte and neutrophil counts, with lower lymphocyte count and subsequent higher NLR. Based on these data, authors suggest that hyper-inflammatory response together with T-cells’ consumption, play a major role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, as observed in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections (
 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">Mahallawi et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by persistent antigenic T cells’ activation leading to an exhaustive status, rather than a failure to activate T cells’ responses (
