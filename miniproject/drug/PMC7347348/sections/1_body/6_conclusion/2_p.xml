<p id="par0150">At the present time, precise data on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and subsequent risk of morbidity in patients with cancer are lacking. Evidences suggest that this risk might be different depending on the oncologic treatment received. There is a strong rationale supporting an increased risk of COVID-19 morbidity in patients treated with immunotherapy and, in this subset of patients, a potential higher risk for those experiencing disease responses to treatment and/or with a history of irAEs. However, with data available we still cannot provide practical indications for the management of oncologic patients in this critical situation. Efforts should be made to prospectively collect data, in order to identify effective interventions to guide treatment decision during the pandemic.</p>
