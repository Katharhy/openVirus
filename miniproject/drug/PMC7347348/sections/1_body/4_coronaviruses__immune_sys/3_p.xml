<p id="par0085">However, cancer treatment has substantially changed over the last years, with less patients receiving chemotherapy and a growing proportion of patients treated with immunotherapy and targeted therapy (e.g. tyrosine kinase inhibitors [TKIs]). This means that, within the subpopulation of cancer patients, at least three categories can be distinguished on the basis of the oncologic treatment they receive and subsequent immune status impairment. The first group includes patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy, and therefore severely immunocompromised. The second includes patients receiving oral anti-cancer agents (e.g. TKIs, targeted therapy, hormonal treatment) and monoclonal antibodies (e.g. drugs targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], and anti-angiogenic drugs), with an overall less impact on the immune system. The last includes patients treated with immunotherapy. For this latter group of patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection may represent a serious threat. In fact, the immune system of patients receiving immunotherapy is reinforced by the treatment itself and might show aberrant responses to external factors. PD-L1 blockade could theoretically increase the immune system hyperactivation during COVID-19 (i.e. the cytokine storm), possibly worsening the outcomes of the infection (
