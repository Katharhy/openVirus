<p id="par0110">Along with the presence of comorbidities, recognized risk factors for COVID-19 include male sex, obesity, and older age. Intriguingly, all these factors impact on the host immune system, and have recently been addressed as crucial determinants of response to immunotherapy. There are sex-related differences in hormones (estrogen, progesterone, and androgens) and sex-chromosome-related genes, which make women more prone to mount a stronger immune response compared to men. The incidence of autoimmune diseases is fairly high in female population, while males show a higher risk of cancer throughout their lifetime (

Regarding obesity, increased body-mass index (BMI) has been correlated with greater survival in patients with chronic conditions, as heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and kidney disease. This so-called “obesity paradox” has not a clear role in patients with cancer, since higher BMI correlates with increased risk of cancer incidence (

Increased age confers immune dysregulation, with fewer naïve CD4+ and CD8 + T cells, decreased regulatory and memory T cells, and an overall pro-inflammatory profile. These changes together shape a condition of immune-senescence, leading to a more restricted repertoire of T cells which might be more prone to develop an exhausted profile during viral infections (
