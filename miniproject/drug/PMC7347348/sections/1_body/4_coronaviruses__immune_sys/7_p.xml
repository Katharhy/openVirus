<p id="par0105">The majority of patients receiving immunotherapy, however, show either primary or acquired resistance to treatment, partially due to an immune system persistently dampened by the tumor (

Curiously, CoV infection in humans shares the same mechanisms involved in immunotherapy acquired resistance, as production of IFN, activation of JAK-STAT pathway and NFkB. On the other hand, PD-1 blockade shifts the balance of antigen-induced cellular reactivity toward a pro-inflammatory T helper (Th)1/Th17 response (
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Dulos et al., 2012</xref>). The consequence of this shift is the enhanced production of IFN γ, IL-2, TNF α, IL-6, and IL-17, and reduced Th2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13, as observed in severe cases of COVID-19. Polarization of immune response towards a pro-inflammatory profile correlates with lower efficacy of immunotherapy and tumor progression. High NLR at baseline, a marker of subclinical inflammation, correlates with poor survival outcomes and reduced response to immunotherapy.
