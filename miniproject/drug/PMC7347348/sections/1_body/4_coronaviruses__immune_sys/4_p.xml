<p id="par0090">In patients responding to treatment (accounting for 20â€“40 % of patients across different studies), their lively immune response often correlates with immune-related adverse events (irAEs) onset. Interestingly, immunosuppressive drugs for the treatment of severe COVID-19 cases have become part of the therapeutic arsenal of oncologists for the treatment of steroid-refractory severe irAEs (e.g. tocilizumab) (

However, there are significant differences in the kinetics of irAEs onset during immunotherapy, suggesting that the immune system activation promoted by immune-checkpoint inhibitors varies over time, and might therefore have a different role also in the susceptibility, development, and complication of infections (
