 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). According to the theory of immune-surveillance, the immune system exerts a continuous monitoring, able to recognize and eliminate potential tumorigenic cells. As so, cancer cells must develop the ability to bypass the immune system control, thereby evading eradication. Tumor-associated inflammation further contributes to tumorigenesis, by supplying tumor cells with growth factors, pro-angiogenic factors, and extracellular matrix-modifying proteins, which eventually favor tumor cells proliferation and metastases (
