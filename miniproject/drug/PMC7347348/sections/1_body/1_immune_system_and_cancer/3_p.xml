<p id="par0055">Thus, cancer itself seems to develop in an immunocompromised field, supporting the concept that oncologic patients are more at risk of infections. This risk is further increased by certain oncologic treatments: cytotoxic chemotherapy negatively impacts on bone marrow production, with decrease in white cell count; bone directed radiotherapy may similarly affect white cell production, while skin and mucosal radiation cause irritation, epithelial lesions and subsequent infections. Major surgery in cancer patients is associated with the activation of pro-inflammatory processes, followed by post-operative immunosuppression (

Long-lasting treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, commonly used as supportive therapy for patients with cancer, have detrimental effects on neutrophil function, humoral and cell-mediated immunity, increasing the overall infective risk (

In clinical practice, preventive measures for subjects undergoing systemic anti-cancer treatment are commonly implemented, as serologic screening for certain chronic infections (e.g. hepatitis B [HBV] and C virus [HCV]), and pneumococcal and/or seasonal flu vaccinations (
