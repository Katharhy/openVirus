<p id="par0060">In the last few years, oncologic treatments have significantly changed with the advent of immunotherapy agents targeting the immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) (

These include monoclonal antibodies against the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), the anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2). The natural function of checkpoint inhibitors is to halt the immune response. Blocking these molecules release the brakes of the immune system, which is reinforced to fight against tumor cells. ICIs have become part of standard treatment for several solid tumors, as melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell and urothelial carcinoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (

Thus, most oncologic patients have changed their features of immunocompromised subjects, rather their immune system is reinforced by the oncologic treatment they receive. This might translate into a distinct susceptibility of oncologic patients towards CoV infections, as explained in the further section.
