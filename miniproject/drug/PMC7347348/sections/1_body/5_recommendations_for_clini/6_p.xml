<p id="par0140">To date, no specific recommendations have been given on the management of patients receiving immunotherapy. Considering the interplay between CoV and the immune system, these patients might be more at risk for an aberrant immune response in case of CoV infection, and therefore deserve additional precautions. This scenario is even more complex, since patients experiencing disease response and/or with history of irAEs might be more at risk, compared to patients whose disease has progressed during immunotherapy (i.e. with primary/acquired resistance). Furthermore, no markers for early diagnosis can be used to guide decision making in the present situation. Patients with severe COVID-19 present high levels of inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphopenia, and high NLR, which are common features also of patients with cancer.</p>
