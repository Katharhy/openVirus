<p id="par0125">Reduction in patientsâ€™ hospital access has been implemented with the use of phone calls and online exchange of clinical documentation, to replace follow up (i.e. non-urgent) visits of disease-free patients. Phone calls are also used to avoid hospital access of patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms, with subsequent redirection to family doctors for home care or, whenever required, to hospitalization (

For patients receiving active oncologic treatments, customization of treatment strategy is needed in order to minimize their presence in hospitals. Proposals in this regard include change of intravenous anticancer drugs to orally administered drugs, if available (e.g. etoposide, vinorelbine), and arranging home administration of oral or subcutaneous anticancer agents; adjustment of chemotherapy schedules, favoring those not requiring frequent hospital admissions (e.g. avoiding drugs with weekly administration if an alternate schedule is feasible); temporary breaks for patients with slowly evolving metastatic cancer, extending disease assessment frequency.
