<p id="par0145">Considering all the above-mentioned issues, we propose a list of clinical and laboratory values (displayed in 
 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> ), which clinician should consider to evaluate the risk of oncology patients in the actual COVID-19 emergency. These clinical and laboratory variables have been recently grouped to form a risk assessment score, which is currently undergoing validation in the clinic (
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">Indini et al., 2020b</xref>). Evidence suggests there is a strong rationale supporting the role of the immune system in CoV infection and patients with cancer, with a complex interplay between pro-inflammatory and immune-suppressive elements which substantially differs among patients receiving different types of treatment. Given the lack of data in this field to date, the assumption of a precise role of these variables is only speculative. Prospective collection of data might help to translate these observations in clinical practice, creating a scoring system to be used as an integrative tool to guide the risk-to-benefit consideration and treatment decision in specific subgroups of patients. Customization of cancer treatment should be pursued, in order to provide patients with the best care in this critical situation.
