On the other hand, most treatment procedures in oncology cannot be delayed without compromising the efficacy of treatment itself, and in some cases the benefit of ensuring a well-delivered anti-cancer treatment plan outweighs the risk of COVID-19 infection. In the current situation, the main goal to safeguard patients’ care is to guarantee the provision of oncologic services, looking after preservation of both patients and health-care workers.

The same measures are used for visitors and caregivers, together with reduction of access for these people during visits and hospitalization.
