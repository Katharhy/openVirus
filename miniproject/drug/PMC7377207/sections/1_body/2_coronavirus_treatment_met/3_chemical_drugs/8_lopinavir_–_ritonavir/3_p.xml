<p id="Par71">The question of whether the earlier lopinavir-ritonavir approach in COVID-19 could have clinical benefit is an important one that needs further study. A new report showed that the average span of viral shedding in COVID-19 was 20 days in patients with severe illness and could be as long as 37 days. There isn’t any proved evidence that lopinavir-ritonavir showed a significant antiviral effect. The reason for this deficit is suboptimal methods of sampling using in the current trial. In brief, lopinavir-ritonavir treatment did not significantly improve clinical development or reduce-throat viral RNA detectability in patients with serious COVID-19 [
