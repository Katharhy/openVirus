<p id="Par80">Zinc is known to be important for immune function and has a role in antibody and white blood cell production. Zinc increase pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1, IL-6, and TNF alpha) concentrations and decreases the production of antibodies, while zinc supplementation has been shown to increase the ability of polymorphonuclear cells to fight infection. It is show that when the intracellular Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration is raised, can be interfere with proteolytic processing of polyproteins in many RNA viruses like coronavirus family. All coronaviruses are unified in requiring a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that is a core enzyme in their RNA-synthesizing machinery. Increased Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> levels directly inhibit isolated RdRp complexes and purified. Zinc supplementation can benefit patients with lower respiratory tract infections such as COVID-19. Because of its role in immune function and potential to decrease coronavirus replication, zinc is currently being investigated for prophylaxis and treatment of patients with COVID-19 [
