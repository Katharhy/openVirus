<p id="Par57">Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with a very similar chemical structure to Chloroquine is one of the disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs that use for healing many rheumatic diseases and also demonstrate a strong immunomodulatory capacity which prevents inflammation flare-ups and organ damage [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. They can also inhibit nucleic acid replication, glycosylation of viral proteins, virus assembly, new virus particle transport, virus release, and other processes to achieve its antiviral outcomes [

In one case, the pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was checked out, the Vero cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and Hydroxychloroquine (EC50 = 0.72 μM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50 = 5.47 μM) in-vitro because of smaller EC value [

On 4 June 2020, the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said that ‘We have concluded that there is no beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We have therefore decided to stop enrolling participants to the hydroxychloroquine arm of the RECOVERY Trial with immediate effect. We are now releasing the preliminary results as they have important implications for patient care and public health.
