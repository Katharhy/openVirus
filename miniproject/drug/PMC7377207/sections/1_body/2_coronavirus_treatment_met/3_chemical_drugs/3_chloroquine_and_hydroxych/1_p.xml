<p id="Par56">Chloroquine (CQ) is a drug that widely used against malaria and in 2006 was observed this drug has an antiviral potential [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The function mechanism of Chloroquine is increasing the endosomal pH. With a pH higher than what is required for virus/cell fusion, the infection is blocked. This interferes with glycoproteins of cellular receptors of sars-cov-2 which bind to their targets [

In one study carried out by a Chinese researchers group about the efficiency of chloroquine in in-vitro studies, using Vero E6 cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05, Chloroquine was highly effective in decreasing viral replication and it can block SARS-CoV-2 infection at low concentration (half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 1.13 μM and a half-cytotoxic concentration (CC50) larger than 100 μM) [
