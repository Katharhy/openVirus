<p id="Par61">Losartan is an AT1 antagonist which its function is specific and competitive for decreasing of the responses to AngII. This drug is a common anti-hypertensive agent that is presently suggested for the regulation of high blood pressure, particularly those cases that are prone to diabetic nephropathies. Losartan causes the release of aldosterone that is the physiological effects of AngII. Then plasma renin activity increases due to the absence of AngII and some biochemical events occur such as AngI to AngII (by ACE), converting angiotensinogen to AngI, vasoconstriction and aldosterone release (by AngII). The presence of aldosterone leads to recollecting sodium from the kidney which finally increases the blood pressure. Thus, losartan can reduce the blood pressure. Accordingly, losartan is a selective antagonist of the AT1 receptor which employs an inhibitory effect on the ACE-AngII-AT1 axis in the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS). So, it may be an effective drug to protect from lung damage induced by coronavirus [

Therefore, it can prevent or control persistent fibrotic diseases such as cardiac hypertrophy and asthma in addition to hypertension. Moreover, apart from direct anti-hypertensive outcomes of losartan, it provides a notable decrease of platelet aggregation by ristocetin and reduction of hematocrit with hemoglobin, following administration in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients which is suggestive for applying losartan for thrombosis and atherosclerosis as well. Other lateral functions of losartan considered to be the immunomodulatory role and significantly regulating IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-17F, and IL-22 cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of rheumatoid arthritis patients.
