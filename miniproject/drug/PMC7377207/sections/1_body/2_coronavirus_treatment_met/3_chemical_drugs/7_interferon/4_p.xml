<p id="Par67">Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), a key protein in the interferon-mediated immune response, is antagonized by the virus. This can indicate the increased response threshold of immune cells to IFNs during CoV infections. Differences in the primary immune responses due to the interferon -depending on the age- lead to the various mortality rates. The increase in these rates in the elderly can be explained through the higher threshold of interferon-mediated immune responses. According to this, earlier induction of interferons in children and their less developed immune system is the main factor for their near to zero lethality rate [
