<p id="Par111">Passive antibody therapy can be a helpful technique to restrict COVID-19 epidemics. Passive antibodies can recognize epitope regions on the foreign virus particle. So they can decrease the disease severity and also the virus replication rate which could be cloned and expressed in suitable expression systems such as mammalian, yeast, or plant. Therefore, recombinant monoclonal antibodies could be tested against SARS-CoV-2 [

So the specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against receptor-binding domain (RBD) in spike protein or specific antibody that binds to ACE2 could efficiently block the virus entry to the cell. In a study, it is shown that monoclonal antibodies can neutralize SARS-CoV, S1, and S2 protein and inhibit syncytia formation between cells expressing the
