<p>The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has become a global threat. However, information regarding this virus remains limited. The available information is inconsistent and there are constant data updates, which may contribute to variation between study results. For more consistent and accurate results, well-annotated data from clinical patients and subclinical subjects in normal populations could help to better understand the pandemic. The information provided in this review is based on data provided by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University during specific date ranges. Key insights into the prevalence, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and potential treatment of SARS-CoV-2 are herein summarized. Research efforts are being intensified to address the current challenges in the quest for adequate treatments, diagnostics, and vaccines. Clinical studies into the genetic variation of receptors such as ACE-2 in tissues and across populations will remain an active area of research until relevant targets and therapies are found. While the development of adequate treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 is underway, it is advisable that good hygiene practices including washing of hands and social distancing should be practiced, and government guidance/guidelines should be followed. This will help to reduce the spread of the disease. We hope that the insights gained from this review will enable researchers to help patients develop accommodating lifestyles and improve the efficiency of health care practitioners.</p>
