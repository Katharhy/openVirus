<p>The degree of spread of COVID-19 is currently about 5.3% and could potentially increase if precautionary measures are not considered. Global prevention of the spread of COVID-19 is therefore a crucial and urgent goal. To prevent further spread of this disease, detection and isolation of individuals with COVID-19 is of the utmost priority. Examples of measures to curb spread include self-quarantine, isolation of infected individuals, social distancing, good personal hygiene (frequent hand washing with soap and water/alcohol-based sanitizers and avoiding touching the eyes, nose and the mouth), and use of personal protective equipment. Certain classes of compounds, called surfactants, are contained in soap and have the ability to neutralize microbes such as SARS CoV-2.

 </sup>This is because soap can assemble into bubble-like structures called micelles that trap viral matter and other biomaterials.

 </sup> Surfactants in soap lather have their hydrophilic parts pointing outwards and interacting with solvent and their hydrophobic heads pointing inwards. This opens the coronavirus outer membrane and encapsulates viral molecules within micelles, thus making insoluble viral molecules easily soluble in water and effectively removing them from hands, surfaces or other areas after about 20 s.

 </sup> Therefore surfactants in soap can disrupt and sequester viruses and other contaminants while sanitizer and disinfectants are designed to kill SARS-CoV-2.
