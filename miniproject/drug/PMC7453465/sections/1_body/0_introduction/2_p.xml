 </sup> Some of the primary measures taken to reduce the number of infections and prevent community transmission are to avoid crowds and gatherings and to practice good hygiene. Interestingly, countries with the highest reported prevalence and mortality such as the United States, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, Russia, Germany, Brazil, France, Turkey, Iran and China, are more concerned with flattening the curve through early case detection, isolation, and development of therapeutic drugs and vaccines. Because of the novel nature of this disease, there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe outcomes. Specific factors such as the serial interval, viral lifespan, incubation period, pathogenic mechanisms, clinical features and optimal disease management remain unclear. Therefore, this review aimed to summarize the epidemiology and pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the use of repurposed Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs for therapy. The entry of this virus into host cells and possible downstream complications deserve closer attention.
