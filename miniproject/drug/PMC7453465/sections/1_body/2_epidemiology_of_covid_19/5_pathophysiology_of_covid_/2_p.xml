<p>Upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus infects type II pneumocytes of the alveoli.

 </sup> These pneumocytes are responsible for surfactant production. Surfactant decreases the surface tension within alveoli and reduces the collapsing pressure. The spike protein of the virus binds to ACE-2 on the pneumocytes (

 </sup> The virus hijacks the host cellâ€™s machinery (ribosomes) to enable translation of its 
 <sup>+</sup>ssRNA genome into different protein molecules. The virus can also use its RdRp to produce additional copies of its 
 <sup>+</sup>ssRNA genome (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0300060520949077">Figure 9</xref>). The translated polyproteins are further processed into different individual components within the host cell. These processes give rise to multiple virions, which are then released upon pneumocyte damage. In response to this process, type II pneumocytes releases specific inflammatory mediators that instruct macrophages to secrete interleukins 1 and 6 (IL-1 and IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. These cytokines cause the endothelial cells lining blood vessels to dilate, leading to increased capillary permeability. In response, fluids accumulate in the alveoli leading to edema.

 </sup> As surface tension increases, the collapsing pressure of the alveoli increases. A decrease in gas exchange is also observed through this process, which in turn leads to hypoxia and difficulty breathing (dyspnea). This can progress to a critical condition such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
