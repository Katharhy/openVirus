<p>The CFR is defined as the percentage of deaths recorded among confirmed cases. As of 14 April 2020, the number of deaths among confirmed cases was estimated at 126,066 to 1,992,189, resulting in a CFR of 6.33%. This differs from the CFR of 3.70% calculated on 15 March 2020.

The highest CFR was observed in Italy, followed by Spain and the Netherlands (

 </sup> High CFRs reflect limited access to health care for the most vulnerable patients and limitations in health-care systems, including limited capacity of surveillance systems to trigger a timely response (WHO, 2020).
