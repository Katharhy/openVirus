 </sup> estimated that the median and 95% confidence interval (CI) of R
 <sub>o</sub> were about 2.28 (2.06–2.52) for early outbreaks of COVID-19. This means that an infected person can transmit COVID-19 to an average of two to three other people. Various studies reported significant variations in R
 <sub>o</sub> using different datasets.
