<p>Taking the R
 <sub>0</sub> and S
 <sub>I</sub> of COVID-19 into consideration, it can be inferred that approximately 4 days are required for an infected person to transmit COVID-19. It is highly likely that the individual can infect approximately two or three other persons, making the spread of COVID-19 extremely rapid and dangerous (

 <sub>o</sub> value (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0300060520949077">Figure 7b</xref>). If R
 <sub>0</sub> &lt; 1, each existing infection causes less than one new infection. In this case, the disease will decline and eventually die out. If R
 <sub>o</sub> = 1, each existing infection causes one new infection. The disease will remain stable in the population, but will not result in epidemic spread. If R
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 1, each existing infection causes more than one new infection. The disease will spread between individuals and eventually lead to an outbreak. COVID-19 was regarded as an outbreak (30 January 2020) with a R
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 1 (
