<p>Ant Financial Services Group, formerly known as Alipay, of the Alibaba group, have devised AI-based applications, based on parameters like self-reported health status, history of travels and contacts, that can identify COVID-19 cases. This system has been implemented in the county of Shizhu, located in Chongqing, in the southwestern part of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China, to monitor the flow of people during the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, which has favored the spreading of the virus. Based on this tool, it has been possible to inform the measure of quarantine. Similarly, in the provinces of Zhejiang, Sichuan and Hainan, advanced data analyses have been exploited to reconstruct social interactions and perform contact tracing. </p>
