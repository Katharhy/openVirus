<p>Computational techniques enable us to visualize in real-time the spreading of the virus, such as the application designed at the John Hopkins University, USA. Furthermore, social Big Data, collected from social networks and other related non-conventional data streams, enable us to reconstruct early epidemiological story of the outbreak. For instance, Sun and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-17-03176" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] performed a population-level observational study, monitoring healthcare related websites, social networks and news reports, between 13th January and 31st January 2020, in mainland China. Authors concluded that non-classical datasets can help researchers understanding the spreading of an outbreak, in terms of health literacy, healthcare-seeking behaviors, and health resourcesâ€™ utilization. Especially in the early stages of the outbreak, non-classical datasets and data streams can inform the design and implementation of effective public health measures.
