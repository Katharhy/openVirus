<p>There are various types of Big Data, based on their sources: (i) molecular Big Data (obtained by means of wet-lab techniques and OMICS-based approaches, such as genomics, and post-genomics specialties, including proteomics, and interactomics); (ii) imaging-based Big Data (like radiomics or the massive data-mining approach to extract clinically meaningful, high-dimensional information from images); (iii) sensor-based Big Data (wearable sensors); and (iv) digital and computational Big Data (with an incredible wealth of data produced by the internet, smart phones, and other mobile devices) [
