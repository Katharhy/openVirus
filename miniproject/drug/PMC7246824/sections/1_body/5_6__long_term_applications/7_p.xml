<p>In the aftermath of disasters, the risk of communicable disorders is high. Designing and implementing policies for properly managing disasters and emergencies should be holistic and multi-level, incorporating prevention, defense, mitigation, preparation, response and recovery. Current policies suffer from gaps, in that, instead of being multi-criteria, broader and highly integrated, foreseeing future events based on risk-assessment scenarios and planning in advance, focus mainly on disaster resistance and are based on contingent evaluations based on administrative and political pressures. </p>
