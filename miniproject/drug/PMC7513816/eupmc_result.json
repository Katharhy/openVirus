    "The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic showed a different severity in the disease between males and females. Men have been becoming severely ill at a higher rate than women. These data along with an age-dependent disease susceptibility and mortality in the elderly suggest that sex hormones are the main factors in determining the clinical course of the infection. The differences in aging males versus females and the role of sex hormones in key phenotypes of COVID-19 infection are described in this review. Recommendations based on a dimorphic approach for males and females suggest a sex-specific management the disease. Highlights The COVID-19 pandemic showed a different morbidity and mortality in males versus females and in elderly versus young people. Sex hormones as well as associated comorbidities can play a role in the pathogenesis and the management of COVID-19 infection. Both oestrogen and androgen influence the function of important target organs for COVID-19. Answering the underlying questions could help develop more effective and sex-specific prevention and treatment strategies."
