  <p>Influenza B virus yield after treatment with LQ. (a) The effect of treatment with LQ against influenza B virus in different models: Pre-C, pretreatment of cells with LQ; Pre-V, pretreatment of virus with LQ; Post-V, posttreatment after infection. UD: under detection. (b) The time course assay: cells were treated with 0.6 mg/mL of LQ after infection with B0215 (MOI = 0.01); the supernatant was collected and titrated after two days. The dotted line is the value which detected limitation.

Cells were infected with B0215 at 0.1 MOI for 90 min at 4°C; the viral solution was replaced with medium containing 1 
   <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of TPCK treated trypsin, LQ (0.6 mg/mL), or 0.12% DMSO. The cells were fixed and immunofluorescence assay was performed at 8 h after infection.
