<p>Influenza B virus (IBV), one of the main pathogens of annual influ enza epidemics, is divided into two genetically and antigenically distinct lineages, B/Victoria/2/1987-like (Victoria) and B/Yamagata/16/1988-like (Yamagata). Both lineages of IBVs circulate or cocirculate globally with the H1N1 or H3N2 subtype of influenza A viruses (IAVs) in annual seasonal epidemics. The proportion of IBV infection cases out of total influenza-positive cases varies from approximately 1% to 40% in a single epidemic.</p>
