<p>First, three antiviral effect models with pretreatment of cells, pretreatment of virus, and posttreatment were performed, the results showed significant inhibitory activity with the pretreatment of virus and posttreatment. A time course also indicated that IBV yield was reduced with LQ treatment at 0–4 h after infection. It demonstrated that LQ may act as a potent anti-influenza B virus agent at an early stage during the infection, typically the synthesis of NP and assembly into vRNP in nucleus. In this study, NP was localized by immunofluorescence staining. The results showed potent inhibitory effect of LQ against NP synthesis of influenza B virus.</p>
