<p>In addition to effectiveness, resistance is another issue of concern of anti-influenza drugs. One approach to increasing antiviral potency and reducing resistance emergence is to use combinations of drugs that target different processes [

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Recently, many studies evaluating combinations of agents, including amantadine, oseltamivir, and ribavirin [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] antiviral therapy with anti-inflammatory drugs or antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and antiviral therapy with immunomodulators [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], have been performed. Because LQ has an effect against IBV in individual administration, we speculated that LQ may have potent antiviral activity when combined with other chemical compounds, such as oseltamivir. Our results confirmed that the viral titer in lungs of mice treated with LQ at 200 mg/kg/day in combination with oseltamivir at 2 mg/kg/day was lower than that in mice treated with either LQ or oseltamivir alone. The viral load and inflammation in lungs of influenza B-infected mice were significantly reduced when 200 mg/kg/day of LQ was administered simultaneously with 2 mg/kg/day of oseltamivir for five days. However, we have not tested the combinations of the treatments in vitro yet.
