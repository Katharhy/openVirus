<p>The cytokines and chemokines evoked by the infection have been shown to contribute to the pathology associated with influenza virus infection [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. LQ is a combination of traditional Chinese medicines. In addition to antiviral activity, it may also have anti-inflammatory activity. Influenza virus infection causes cell necrosis/apoptosis, which induces an immune reaction and the production of cytokines. However, the cytokine storm, including the deregulated and exaggerated production of cytokines, usually aggravates the degree of disease [
