<p>A549 cells growing in 96-well plates at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, were prepared and then infected with influenza B virus (B/Guangzhou/0215/2012, 0.1 MOI) for 2 h. The inoculums were removed, and the cells were treated with 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 mg/mL of LQ. The cells were collected at 24 h after infection, the total RNA was extracted using the TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized using PrimeScript™ RT Master Mix (perfect real time) (TAKARA).
