<p>The effects of combinations of LQ and oseltamivir in the influenza B virus mouse model were also studied. 60 mice were divided into 10 groups (control, placebo, 200 mg/kg/day of LQ, 2/10/50 mg/kg/day of oseltamivir, 200 mg/kg/day of LQ combined with 2/10/50 mg/kg/day of oseltamivir respectively, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 6). Mice except control group were infected with 10-fold LD
 <sub>50</sub> B0215, and control group were inoculated with equivalent solution without virus. Mice were treated with oseltamivir alone or combined with LQ from 4 h before infection to 4 days after infection with the day of infection defined as 0 day, and equivalent amounts of PBS were given as placebo and control. Six days after infection, the mice lungs were collected for titer and pathological examination. Mice were anaesthetized by isoflurane, and at the end of the experiment, mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation.
