<p>To assess the survival rate of LQ treated virally infected mice, 60 mice were divided into 6 groups (placebo, ribavirin 75 mg/kg/day, LQ 100/200/400 mg/kg/day, uninfected control, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 10): 5 groups (placebo, ribavirin 75 mg/kg/day, LQ 100/200/400 mg/kg/day) were inoculated with 5-fold 50% lethal dose (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) of B0215; control group was inoculated with equivalent solution without virus. The drugs were administered at 4 h before infection and continued for 5 days once per day, with equivalent PBS given as placebo and control (Ctrl). Survival was evaluated 15 days after infection.
