<p>Anti-IBV activity was evaluated by cytopathogenic effect (CPE) and MTT assays. Confluent monolayers of MDCK cells in 96-well plates were inoculated with virus (0.01 MOI). After 2 h, the inoculums were replaced with test medium containing a series of concentrations of LQ or DMSO (less than 1%) with 1

 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml streptomycin (Gibco). The plate was incubated at 34°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, for 72 h. The inhibition rates were measured via MTT assay. Three independent tests were conducted, and the 50% inhibition concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was obtained via the Reed-Muench method [
