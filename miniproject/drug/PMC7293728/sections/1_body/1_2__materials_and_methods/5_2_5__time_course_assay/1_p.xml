<p>The most effective concentration of the LQ in IBVs was tested by cytopathic effect (CPE). Three infection models were constructed. Before infection, 10

 <italic>posttreatment of virus, Post-V</italic>). The supernatant was collected at 24 h postinfection, and the virus titers were determined in MDCK cells.
