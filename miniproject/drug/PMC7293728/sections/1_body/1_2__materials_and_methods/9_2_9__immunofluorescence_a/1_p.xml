<p>The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (v/v) at room temperature for 30 min; the membrane was permeabilized with 0.5% (v/v) of Triton X-100 and then blocked with 50 mg/mL of goat serum (Sigma) for 30 min. Next, 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of mouse monoclonal antibody (Abcam) against influenza virus nucleoprotein was added to the cells and incubated at 4°C overnight. After three washes, 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Abcam) was added, and the cells were then incubated at 37°C for 90 min. After washing, the nucleus was stained with 5 ng/mL of DAPI for 5 min. The slips were mounted, and the results were obtained under fluorescence confocal microscopy (Nikon, D-ECLIPSE C1-S1).
