<p>First, a cell proliferation and viability assay based on three independent MTT assays was performed to determine the nonspecific cytotoxicity of LQ for MDCK cells. The 50% toxic concentration (TC
 <sub>50</sub>) of LQ was 4.0221 ± 0.0471 mg/mL (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). There is no significant cellular toxic effect within the concentration range of 0.075–1.0 mg/mL of LQ in MDCK cells when the medicine and cells were incubated together at 37°C for 48 h in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, we tested the antiviral activity of LQ against five stains of influenza B viruses: B/Lee/40, three of Victoria-like virus (isolated in 2009, 2012, and 2016), and one of Yamagata-like virus (isolated in 2016). The results (

 <sub>50</sub>) ranging from 0.228 ± 0.150 to 0.754 ± 0.161 mg/mL, and the selective index (SI) [
