<p>Because LQ has a weak potency against IBV in individual administration, the effect of the combination of LQ and oseltamivir in IBV-infected mice was tested. The viral titer in lungs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) of infected mice treated with LQ (200 mg/kg/day) and oseltamivir (2 mg/kg/day) (average value = log 3.67 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/g) was lower than the viral titer for mice treated with only LQ at dose of 200 mg/kg/day (average value = log 4.5 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/g) or mice treated with only oseltamivir at dose of 2 mg/kg/day (average value = log 4.5 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/g). Interestingly, viral load of 75 mg/kg/day of ribavirin treated mice (average value = log 3.17 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/g) was lower than that of 50 mg/kg/day of oseltamivir (average value = log 3.67 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/g).
