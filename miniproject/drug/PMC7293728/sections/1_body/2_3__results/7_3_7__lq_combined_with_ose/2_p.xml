<p>The results of the pathological changes in the lungs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) showed that treatment with oseltamivir at doses of 2 and 10 mg/kg/day in conjunction with 200 mg/kg/day of LQ is better than oseltamivir alone. Severe interstitial pneumonia was observed in untreated mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7(c)</xref>), 200 mg/kg/day of LQ treated mice (data not showed), and 2 mg/kg/day of oseltamivir treated mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7(i)</xref>) at 6 days after IBV infection. The lungs of 50 mg/kg/day of oseltamivir treated mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7(g)</xref>) were similar to those of normal mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7(a)</xref>), as well as the mice treated simultaneously with 50 mg/kg/day of oseltamivir and 200 mg/kg/day of LQ (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7(d)</xref>). Moderate pneumonia was observed in 10 mg/kg/day of oseltamivir treated mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7(h)</xref>) and 75 mg/kg/day of ribavirin treated mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7(b)</xref>), and mild pneumonia was observed in mice treated simultaneously with 10 mg/kg/day of oseltamivir and 200 mg/kg/day of LQ (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7(e)</xref>). Even though severe pneumonia occurs in mice treated simultaneously with 2 mg/kg/day of oseltamivir and 200 mg/kg/day of LQ (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7(f)</xref>), the inflammatory cells were fewer than those in mice treated with 2 mg/kg/day of oseltamivir alone.
