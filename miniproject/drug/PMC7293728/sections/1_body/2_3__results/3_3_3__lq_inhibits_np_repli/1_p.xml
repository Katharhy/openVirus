<p>To identify the effect of LQ on IBV replication, the synthesis of viral nucleoprotein of infected cells was examined by immunofluorescence. The cells were infected with B/Guangzhou/0215/2012 and then treated with 0.6 mg/mL of LQ for 8 h. Compared to nontreatment or treatment with the same concentration of medicine solvent (0.12% DMSO), 0.6 mg/mL of LQ distinctly decreased the synthesis of nucleoprotein (
