<p>According to three treatment models representing prevention (pretreatment of cells, Pre-C), direct action (pretreatment of virus, Pre-V), and therapy (posttreatment, Post-V), the IBV was inhibited by more than 0.15 mg/mL of LQ with dose dependence in the pretreatment of virus model and the posttreatment model (
