<p>Inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression imbalance will cause tissue damage. Therefore, the effects of LQ on cytokines and chemokines were determined. The results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) showed a significantly increased mRNA level of RANTES (62-fold), IL-6 (99-fold), IL-8 (46-fold), IP-10 (150-fold), TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> (53-fold), MCP-1 (8.8-fold), MIP-1
 <italic>β</italic> (58-fold), and IFN-
 <italic>λ</italic>1 (113-fold) in the A549 cells at 12 h after IBV infection compared to GAPDH gene. Also, a reduction of all inflammatory factors mRNA level was observed in cells treated with ≥0.15 mg/mL of LQ compared to dissolvent treated infected cells. Queerly, a dose-dependent reduction was observed in most of the inflammatory factor mRNA levels except CCL5/RANTES with inverse reduction.
