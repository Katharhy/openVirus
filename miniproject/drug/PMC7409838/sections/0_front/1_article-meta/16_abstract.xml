 <p>This review fully describes the coronavirus 3CL
  <sup>pro</sup> peptidomimetic inhibitors and nonpeptidic small molecule inhibitors developed from 2010 to 2020. Specifically, the structural characteristics, binding modes and SARs of these 3CL
  <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors are expounded in detail by division into two categories: peptidomimetic inhibitors mainly utilize electrophilic warhead groups to covalently bind the 3CL
  <sup>pro</sup> Cys145 residue and thereby achieve irreversible inhibition effects, whereas nonpeptidic small molecule inhibitors mainly interact with residues in the S1â€™, S1, S2 and S4 pockets via hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic bonds and van der Waals forces. Based on the emerging PROTAC technology and the existing 3CL
  <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors, 3CL
  <sup>pro</sup> PROTAC degraders are hypothesised to be next-generation anti-coronavirus drugs.
