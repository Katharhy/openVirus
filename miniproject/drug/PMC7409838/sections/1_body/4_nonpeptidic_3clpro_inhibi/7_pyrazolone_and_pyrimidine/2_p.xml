<p id="p0275">Based on the 1,3,4,5-tetraaryl-substituted pyrazole 
 <bold>69</bold> identified through high-throughput screening, a series of 1,3,4-triple substituted pyrazolinone compounds were designed and synthesized as SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors. Among the resulting compounds (
 <xref rid="fig18" ref-type="fig">Fig. 18</xref> ), 
 <bold>70–73</bold> exerted strong inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 5.5, 10.8, 6.8 and 8.4 μM, respectively, and favourably, 
 <bold>73</bold> could also effectively inhibit coxsackievirus B3 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> [
 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Po-Huang Liang et al. further synthesized a series of analogues by grafting the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor phenyl furan moiety into a 1,3,4-triple substituted pyrazolinone nucleus [
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Among the resulting series, compounds 
 <bold>74d-74f</bold> showed comparable inhibitory activity against SASR and MERS 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>s. In addition to the catalytic residue Cys145, the S1 subsite of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> also included another important component, the oxyanion hole. This component is formed by the interaction of the C-terminal carboxylate anion of the conserved Gln with Gly143, Ser144 and Cys145, which stabilizes the transition state during proteolysis. Docking studies have indicated that the carboxylates present at the A or D ring are critical for disrupting the stability of the oxyanion hole in 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. Further SAR studies have shown that the pharmacophores phenyl at R
 <sub>3</sub> (
 <bold>74a</bold> vs
 <bold>74b</bold>) and a carboxylate at either R
 <sub>1</sub> or R
 <sub>4</sub> (
 <bold>74c</bold> vs 
 <bold>74d</bold>) are essential for the activity (
 <xref rid="fig18" ref-type="fig">Fig. 18</xref>). Because the modification of rings A and B is tolerated well, the D ring can be further altered to enhance the activity of the compounds.
