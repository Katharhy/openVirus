<p id="p0255">Based on an analysis of the optimization of the lead GC376 
 <bold>(52)</bold>, adduction of an aldehyde bisulphite at the P1’ position is necessary for the reaction with the active site Cys148 to generate tetrahedral hemithioacetal. Moreover, the γ-lactam ring at the P1 position and the Leu side chain at the P2 position should be retained and might occupy the S1 and S2 hydrophobic pockets, respectively. Additionally, extending the benzyloxy “cap” to the chlorine-substituted phenylethanol fragment yields GC813 (
 <bold>53</bold>), and its lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> value can be attributed to an extended conformation and might orient the phenyl ring towards the hydrophobic S4 pocket. As a common privileged scaffold in drug design and discovery, the piperidine moiety is a good design element that can exhibit good interactions with numerous classes of proteins, which would result in optimal pharmacological activity and PK properties [

 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> , 54a-54f). The piperidine-based design strategy is an effective tactic for rendering a dipeptidyl inhibitor capable of engaging in optimal binding interactions with all four S1–S4 subsites, and the resulting inhibitors have a lower molecular weight and a reduced peptidyl character compared with the tetrapeptidyl inhibitor, which is expected to display enhanced solubility and PK liabilities. Gratifyingly, 
 <bold>54b</bold> and 
 <bold>54d</bold>, which are representative aldehyde bisulphite compounds, display potent MERS-CoV inhibitory activities with low cytotoxicity (CC
