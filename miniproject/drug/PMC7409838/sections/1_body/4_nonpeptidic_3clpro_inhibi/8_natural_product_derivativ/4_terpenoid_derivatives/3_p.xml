 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.6, 9.9, 5.5 and 10.3 μM, respectively [
 <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Dihydrocelastrol (
 <bold>104</bold>) was synthesized by hydrogenation under a palladium catalyst, but its 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitory activity on SARS 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> was relatively weak. Further SAR research indicated that a quinone-methide moiety in the A ring and a more hydrophobic E ring could promote inhibitory activity against 3CL
