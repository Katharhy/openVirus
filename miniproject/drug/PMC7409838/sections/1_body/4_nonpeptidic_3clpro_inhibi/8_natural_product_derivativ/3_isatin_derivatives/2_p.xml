<p id="p0295">Previous studies have shown that isatin and its derivatives have a wide range of antiviral and antibacterial activities [

 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>], including anti-HIV virus [

 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) [
 <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], anti-mycobacterium tuberculosis and anti-pathogenic activities [
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. In addition, isatin derivatives are good candidates for the development of anti-coronavirus drugs [
 <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. For anti-coronavirus drug discovery, a series of synthetic 5-sulfonyl isatin derivatives (
 <bold>86–92</bold>) were reported as noncovalent SARS M
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors [
 <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. These isatin derivatives inhibited SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> at the low micromolar range, and 
 <bold>86</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.04 μM) was found to be the most potent. SAR studies revealed that the piperidin sulfonyl-substituted compounds 
 <bold>86–89</bold> exerted a more significant inhibitory effect against 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 5 μM) than the piperazine sulfonyl-substituted isatins 
 <bold>90–92</bold>. Among the former, the 4-methyl piperidin sulfonyl (
 <bold>87</bold>, IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.18 μM) and 2-methyl piperidin sulfonyl (
 <bold>88</bold>, IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.25 μM) isatin derivatives were identified as the optimal candidates.
