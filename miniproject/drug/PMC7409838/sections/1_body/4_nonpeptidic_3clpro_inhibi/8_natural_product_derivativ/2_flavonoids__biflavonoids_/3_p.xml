 <italic>Angelica keiskei</italic> were evaluated in terms of their anti-SARS 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> activity. Chalcone 
 <bold>84</bold>, which contains perhydroxyl groups, exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity against 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 11.4 μM. A detailed ligand-protein mechanistic analysis indicated that the chalcones exhibited competitive inhibition with SARS-CoV 3CL
