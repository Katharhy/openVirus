<p id="p0285">Quercetin (
 <bold>76</bold>), epigallocatechin gallate (
 <bold>77</bold>) and gallocatechin gallate (
 <bold>78</bold>, GCG) also show mild inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 73 μM, 73 μM and 47 μM, respectively (
 <xref rid="fig19" ref-type="fig">Fig. 19</xref> ). In addition, 
 <bold>78</bold> exhibits competitive inhibition towards 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, with a 
 <italic>K</italic>i value of 25 μM. According to the results from a docking analysis, the galloyl acyl moiety at the 3-OH position of compound 
 <bold>78,</bold> which occupies the S1 pocket, is essential for inhibitory activity against 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> [

 <italic>Torreya nucifera</italic> (
 <xref rid="fig19" ref-type="fig">Fig. 19</xref>). According to a preliminary screen, the biflavone amentoflavone (
 <bold>79</bold>) (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 8.3 μM) exerted the most potent inhibitory effect against 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. A SAR study based on these flavonoids found that a methoxy substitution at the C-7 position could enhance the inhibitory effect. Specifically, the C-7 methoxy-substituted compounds 
 <bold>80</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 32.0 μM) and 
 <bold>81</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 38.4 μM) exhibited two-fold higher inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> compared with that of 
 <bold>82</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 72.3 μM) [
