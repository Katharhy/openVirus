<p id="p0225">Additionally, Kouji Ohnishi et al. [
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] introduced a non-prime site substituent at the 4-position carbon of the decahydroisoqunolin skeleton to yield the nonpeptidic inhibitor 
 <bold>38</bold>, which exhibits moderate but enhanced inhibitory activity against R188I SARS 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 26 μM). The results indicated significantly increased affinity between 
 <bold>38</bold> and SARS 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> at the S3 to S4 pockets.
