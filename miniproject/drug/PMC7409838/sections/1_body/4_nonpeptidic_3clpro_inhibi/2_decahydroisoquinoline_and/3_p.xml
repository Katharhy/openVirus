<p id="p0220">Based on the abovementioned findings, Shimamoto Yasuhiro et al. performed further structural modifications, and an octahydro-isochromene scaffold was selected as a new type of hydrophobic fused ring (
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> ). An alkyl or aryl substituent was also introduced to the 1-position of the octahydro-isochromene scaffold. The effects of the configuration of the fused ring structure and those of various substituents on the inhibition of SARS 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> were evaluated. Sharpless-Katsuki asymmetric epoxidation and Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation were employed to synthesise the octahydro-isochromene moiety. Introduction of (
 <italic>S</italic>)-2-amino-3-imidazolyl propanal (His-al) at the P1 site and the substituent at the 1-position was achieved through successive reductive amination reactions. 
 <italic>N</italic>-butyl (
 <bold>30</bold>), isobutyl (
 <bold>31</bold>), allyl (
 <bold>32</bold>) and benzyl (
 <bold>33</bold>) were introduced at the 1-position, and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for SARS 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> indicates that the n-butyl substituent is expected to form a certain interaction with the protease. The stereochemical effect of the octahydro-isochromene scaffold was also investigated, and the results showed that the specific (1

 <bold>35</bold> can orient imidazole and the warhead aldehyde at the P1 site to the corresponding 3CL
