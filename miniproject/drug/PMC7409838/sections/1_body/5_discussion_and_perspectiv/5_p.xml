 <sup>pro</sup> noncovalent inhibitors also have some shortcomings, such as drug effects that are not strong and/or durable, which means that these noncovalent inhibitors would need to be administered at high dosages or multiple times. Noncovalent inhibitors can also result in the emergence of resistance after their long-term administration. Based on a review of the advantages and disadvantages of both covalent and noncovalent inhibitors of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, we recommend that reversible covalent inhibitors of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> constitute a new research direction. Specifically, the Michael warhead can be replaced by cyano (or trifluoromethyl), which might result in the formation of a reversible covalent bond with the Cys145 residue, which is unique to the coronavirus 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> S1’ pocket, and this binding can potentially reduce the “off-target” risk and toxic side effects while enhancing the efficacy [
