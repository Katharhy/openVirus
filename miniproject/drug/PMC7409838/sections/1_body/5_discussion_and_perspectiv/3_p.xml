<p id="p0315">Herein, the structural characteristics, binding modes and SARs of recent coronavirus 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors are fully described. The warhead groups of peptidomimetic inhibitors mainly include aldehydes, ketones and different types of Michael receptors. These covalent irreversible inhibitors mainly utilize warhead functional groups to covalently bond with Cys145 residues in the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> S1’ pocket and thereby exert relatively durable inhibitory effects. The published studies have shown that covalent irreversible 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors exhibit significantly improved antivirus activity, and some inhibitors can even achieve effects at nanomolar levels. However, covalent inhibitors exhibit potential off-target problems and toxic side effects. Although the recent studies on peptidomimetic inhibitors are fewer than those that investigated nonpeptidic inhibitors, the aldehyde compounds 
 <bold>11</bold> and 
 <bold>12</bold> and α-ketoamide compounds (
 <bold>25–27</bold>), which are among the recently reported peptidomimetic 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors, exhibit excellent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2. Inhibitor 
 <bold>11</bold> is one of the most effective inhibitors among the aldehyde peptide series. Thus, the toxicity of inhibitor 
 <bold>11</bold> over a 7-day period has been studied at different doses, specifically at dosing levels of 2, 6, and 18 mg/kg on SD rats and at a dose range of 10–40 mg/kg on beagle dogs, and all the tested animals showed significant toxicity after the inhibitor was administered once a day (QD) via intravenous drip. Therefore, 
 <bold>11</bold> might be a good candidate for further COVID-19 clinical research. Coincidentally, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of compound 
 <bold>26</bold> indicated obvious lung affinity, and this compound is suitable for administration via inhalation. Therefore, the pyridone-containing compound 
 <bold>26</bold> might become another lead for further COVID-19 pandemic research.
