<p id="p0190">The coronavirus genome has a structure with a 5′-cap and a 3′-poly-A tail and contains 6–12 open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF (ORF 1a/b) accounts for approximately two-thirds of the genome length and can directly translate two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, according to an a-1 frameshift between ORF1a and ORF1b [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The abovementioned polyproteins are then incised and functionalized into 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) by 3CL protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>), which is also known as M
 <sup>pro</sup> or papain-like protease (PLP) (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ) [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The coronavirus 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> is a cysteine protease composed of approximately 300 amino acids and contains three domains [
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Active 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> is a homodimer that contains two promoters [
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, which has a non-classical Cys-His catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) in the gap between domains I and II [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], can specifically recognize the 11 cleavage sites of nsp4∼nsp16 and exhibits self-hydrolytic cleavage activity [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These functional nsp4∼nsp16 released by cleavage with 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> are responsible for viral genome replication and transcription, and nsp4∼nsp16 also play roles in other important viral life processes, such as protein translation, cleavage, and modification and nucleic acid synthesis [
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, the inhibition of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> can effectively block viral RNA replication and transcription and further block viral proliferation.
