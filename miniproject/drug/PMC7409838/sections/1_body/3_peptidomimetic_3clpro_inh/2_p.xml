<p id="p0200">Structurally, 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors can be classified as peptoids and non-peptidomimetics, and the mechanism of action of peptide inhibitors includes two steps. Peptidomimetics that mimic natural peptide substrates initially bind to 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> and form a noncovalent complex, and the warhead group, which is spatially very close to the catalytic residue of the target protein, undergoes a nucleophilic attack to catalyse the formation of cysteine-participating covalent bonds [
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. These warheads mainly contain Michael receptors [
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], aldehydes [
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and different types of ketones (see 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and

 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>], which covalently bind to the Cys145 residue in the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> S1’ pocket to exert an inhibitory effect.
