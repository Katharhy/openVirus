<p id="p0045">It seems that lymphopenia, hyper-inflammatory state, and cytokines all play a role in the pathology of COVID-19; hence the hypothesis was proposed that immunomodulatory drugs may be beneficial to reverse the condition and treat the disease [

There are limited data about the effects of other immunosuppressive drugs, such as glucocorticoids, IL-1 inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, anti-TNF-Î±agents, methotrexate, and NSAIDs in COVIS-19, and further in vitro and in vivo studies are recommended [
 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Due to the T cell lymphopenia and reduced function, immunoglobulins produced by B cells represent the main arm of the immune system to combat the virus. Seroconversion and antibody production occurs by the first two weeks after infection [

Like other infections, specific IgM is the first defense to appear, and disappears after a short time, but specific IgG remains a long-term defense against the virus. Therefore, neutralizing IgGs play a major role in the patient recovery and control of infection. IgGs reach their peak in the serum during the convalescent phase, and tend to wane after recovery, but memory B cells could still survive to offer long-term protection [
