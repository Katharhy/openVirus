<p id="p0035">Patients with COVID-19 have increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, IL-17, CCL-2, TNF-ɑ, G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, and MIP. The concentration of these markers fluctuates depending on the individual's condition; it seems that increased cytokine levels, especially IL-6, have a direct association with a worsened patient condition [

 <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The cytokine storm (CS) is typical of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH). Consequently, tissue damage, lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) could be expected [

Furthermore, a study showed that the peripheral blood of a patient with severe COVID-19 had a strikingly high number of Th17 cells, which secrete IL-17, and are associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In the mucosal immune response, IL-22, IL-17, and TNF-α are known to induce antimicrobial peptides. Also, IL-22 upregulates mucins, fibrinogen, and anti-apoptotic proteins; therefore, IL-22 may contribute to the formation of life-threatening edema, and the lungs may become enriched with mucins and fibrin leading to the progression of ARDS, seen in COVID-19 patients [
 <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. All of the above-mentioned factors result in pneumonia and ARDS, besides hyper-ferritinemia, coagulopathy, and multi-organ failure in the liver, heart, and kidneys with elevated D-dimer, CRP, BUN, and Cr that are typical of MAS/sHLH [

 <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, NK cell reduction, suppression of antiviral defense, activation of aggressive tissue-damaging immune responses via increased IL-6 secretion, and secondary CS leads to a general picture of hyper-inflammatory immunodeficiency, are all in line with primary HLH. This is important in terms of the viral load, because of the correlation between the RNA viral load and ARDS severity [
 <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Although the typical MAS/sHLH pathology that occurs in immunocompetent patients, may also be seen in COVID-19, but the differentiation between these two patterns is difficult.
