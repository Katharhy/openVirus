<p id="p0040">Although COVID-19 has numerous manifestations, lung injury and severe respiratory failure (SRF) are more common than others. The cornerstone of this condition is MAS/sHLH or immune dysregulation. Alveolar macrophages secret IL-6 that cause overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines by monocytes, and dysregulation of lymphocytes, characterized by CD4 lymphopenia and subsequently B cell lymphopenia. In parallel, the absolute natural killer (NK) cell count is depleted, probably as a result of the rapidly multiplying virus. Moreover, IL-6 decreases the expression of HLA-DR on the membrane and production of IFN-Î³ by CD4 cells [

In conclusion, it seems that innate immunity, characterized by neutrophils and proinflammatory cytokines in the format of the cytokine storm, is trying to limit the infection and overcome the virus; however, it leads to an excessive inflammatory response rather than harming the virus. This causes lung injury with tissue damage and life-threatening edema, enriched with mucins and fibrin, that unfortunately causes SRF and death in severely affected patients [
