<p id="p0025">Similar to all infectious diseases, the immune system plays an essential role in virus suppression. Therefore, it can be assumed that suppression of the immune defense system will make the situation worse, but it is not as simple as it sounds [
 <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. There has not yet been enough scientific evidence to generally employ immunosuppressive drugs in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [

 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. On the other hand, the hyper-inflammatory and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) typical of COVID-19 causes tissue damage to the lung epithelium and ARDS [
 <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; therefore, immunosuppressive drugs may be useful as there is some evidence that an anti-IL-6 approach is effective in critically ill patients in the ICU [
 <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Another high-risk group for COVID-19 is cancer patients, who are administered cytotoxic drugs. Although their immune function may be at an acceptable level, some cytotoxic drugs such as 6-MP used in chemotherapy, have shown destructive effects on virus replication in vitro [
 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. On the other hand, the high number of critically ill patients and increased mortality in patients with underlying diseases (such as hypertension and diabetes) has been proven [
 <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Diabetes mellitus type II can include a hyperinflammatory state with a low-grade inflammatory activity that causes long-term immune system stimulation [
 <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], along with adipose tissue side effects on the immune system, which ultimately drives an immune imbalance [
 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Also, due to the overexpression of ACE2 in islet cells of the pancreas, SARS-CoV-2 may be a diabetogenic virus that causes severe instability in the blood glucose levels of diabetes patients, which worsens the inflammatory imbalance [
 <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As a consequence, the condition of diabetic patients can be worsened after COVID-19 infection, as evidenced by the higher levels of multiple enzymes and inflammatory cytokines compared to nondiabetic individuals with COVID-19 pneumonia [
