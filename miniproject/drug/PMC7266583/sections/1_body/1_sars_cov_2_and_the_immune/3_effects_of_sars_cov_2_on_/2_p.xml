<p id="p0015">Since both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have the same cell entry mechanism, the pathogenesis of both viruses could be the same, or at least very similar [
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. ACE2 is the common factor that binds to the superficial S glycoprotein on the envelope of the virus. It seems that this binding is sensed (essentially) by Toll-like receptor-7 (TLR-7), which is present in endosomes, and which then leads to the secretion of inflammatory cytokines [
 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. ACE2 is highly expressed in some organs, like lung epithelial cells, especially type II pneumocytes, and in cells of the heart, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and bladder [
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore these organs constitute the main target for the virus. Following entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell, the viral RNA genome is transferred from the envelope into the cytoplasm and the translation process begins. After replication of the RNA new viral particles are formed, by incorporating part of the host cell membrane in the new viral envelope. Although, SARS-CoV-2 buds from the infected cell, it does not lyse it directly [
 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Infected lung epithelial cells produce interleukin IL-8 which acts as a chemoattractant for neutrophils and T lymphocytes [
 <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The innate immune response is initially triggered by lung epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages and neutrophils. In the next stage, adaptive immune responses are triggered involving T and B lymphocytes to complete the complete immune response [
 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Virus particles containing single-stranded ssRNA, act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and provoke a strong innate immune response after recognition by Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), which is expressed on monocyte-macrophages and dendritic cells (DC). TLR7 can activate several signaling pathways and transcription factors, such as Janus kinase transducers (JAK/STAT), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), activator protein 1 (AP-1), interferon response factor 3 (IRF3), and IRF7. This signaling cascade leads to increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-1, IL-6, monocyte chemo attractant protein-1 (MCP-1), MIP-1A, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and ultimately interferon 1 (IFN1) [
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, neutrophils are rapidly recruited to sites of infection, where they kill viruses by an oxidative burst, defensin secretion, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) [
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Along with these events, antigen presentation subsequently stimulates the body's specific adaptive immunity (both humoral and cellular immunity) which culminates in approximately 7–14 days after infection. Following the representation of antigens by APCs to the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, pro-inflammatory cytokines are produced via the NF-κB signaling pathway. Activated B cells secrete virus-specific antibodies, while antigen-specific T cytotoxic cells kill virus-infected cells [
 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Additionally, Th17 cells, neutrophils, and granulocytes secrete IL-17, which in turn stimulates production of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, Gro-a, G-CSF, GM-CSF, TNF-α, and PGE2. All these mediators can increase the recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes, and other immune cells. Besides, it has been reported that IL-17 expression is correlated with several inflammatory respiratory diseases [
 <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. All these immune signaling pathways are designed to create an inflammatory environment with the goal of eradicating SARS-CoV-2.
