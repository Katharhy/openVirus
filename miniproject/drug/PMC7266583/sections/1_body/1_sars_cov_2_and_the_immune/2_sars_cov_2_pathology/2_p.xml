<p id="p0010">SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the coronavirus family, members of which have caused two previous epidemics at the beginning of the 21st century; one named SARS-CoV and the other Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Coronaviruses are large enveloped viruses with a positive sense RNA genome. The lipid bilayer envelope of the virus contains several proteins with different tasks. The spike or S glycoprotein (SP), has two domains of S1 and S2, is responsible for invasion, attachment, and entry into human cells. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S1 interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the human host cell surface, which is a similar entry mechanism to SARS-CoV; however, the S2 domain is responsible for virus-cell membrane fusion and viral entry with higher affinity [
