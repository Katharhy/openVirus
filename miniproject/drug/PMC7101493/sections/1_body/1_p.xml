<p>At the discovery of the “non-A, non-B hepatitis” virus in 1989, later named hepatitis C (HCV), this disease was unknown and untreatable, and many naturally considered the diagnosis a death sentence. Interferon provided some respite, but it came at a huge cost for patients who experienced the toxic combination of a prolonged course of injected therapy with extensive side-effects, and ineffective viral clearance with frequent relapse. Treatment was revolutionized in 2011 with the introduction of oral, direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) which have vastly shorter treatment courses and virtually no side-effects. Viral clearance increased from around 50% with injected interferon to over 90% on an oral DAAs. This development has been a pivotal in the control of hepatitis C.</p>
