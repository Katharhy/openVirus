<p>In high prevalence settings where the HCV antibody prevalence exceeds WHO thresholds (2% or 5% in different contexts), screening of the general population is a dire need.

By integrating HCV screening into all existing health programs this avoids missed opportunities for screening, increases cost-efficiency and takes advantage of other operational structures already in place, including TB and HIV programmes. The bottom line is that we need to diagnose and treat at least 5 million people worldwide every year in order to reach the WHO elimination goals by 2030 [
