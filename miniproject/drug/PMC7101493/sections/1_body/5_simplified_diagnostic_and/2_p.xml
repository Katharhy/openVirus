<p>Currently, confirmation of viral clearance following treatment is recommended for all patients. With the increasing efficiency of new combinations of DAAs – approaching 100% – we question whether an additional polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) test is cost-effective from a public health perspective. The WHO elimination goal of 90% reduction in prevalence can be achieved with a low failure rate. Cost-benefit analyses could help establish the optimal use of resources of particular importance in low-resource settings. Pooled procurement of diagnostics may also bring down the price of PCR cartridges, as has been done for TB.</p>
