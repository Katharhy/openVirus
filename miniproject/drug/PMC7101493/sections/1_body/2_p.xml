HCV is still a menace in these countries because of poor health care systems, the need for universal screening and the challenge of competing priorities with inadequate resources. In Pakistan, the country with the second largest burden of hepatitis C, prevalence data from recent years has shown around a 40% increase in HCV antibody rates in the general population. Not only are the health systems ill-equipped to provide testing and treatment services to those suffering from HCV, high rates of nosocomial transmission from poorly functioning health care facilities add to the complexity of the outbreak [
