<p>Lundin et al. screened a library of 16 671 diverse compounds and found a small molecule inhibitor, 
 <bold>K22</bold> (
 <bold>2</bold>), which was able to inhibit HCoV-229E with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.7 μM and CC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 110 μM. Studies for mechanism showed that K22 targeted a very early step in the HCoV-229E life cycle and may interact with viral particles, thus inactivating their binding.
