<p>To identify small molecule entry inhibitors against the SARS-CoV S protein, Sarafianos et al. screened a chemical library composed of 3000 compounds according to Lipinski’s rule of five
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>
 </sup> and identified an oxazole-carboxamide derivative, 
 <bold>SSAA09E2</bold> (
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">3</xref>
 </xref>), that blocks the binding of the RBD of SARS-CoV S protein and ACE2 with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 3.1 μM and CC
 <sub>50</sub> value of &gt;100 μM. Further investigation confirmed that 
 <bold>1</bold> does not alter ACE2 expression but most likely blocks directly ACE2 recognition by interfering with the RBD.
