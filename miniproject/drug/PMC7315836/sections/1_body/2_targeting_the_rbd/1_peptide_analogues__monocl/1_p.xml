<p>Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 to gain entry into the host cells. As such, this critical interaction can be blocked to stop viral entry.

 </sup> This strategy was first demonstrated by Hsiang et al. Using a biotinylated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Hsiang et al. reported the disruption of the SARS-CoV S protein-ACE2 interaction by small peptides. From a total of 14 designed peptides, peptides SP-4, SP-8, and SP-10 (

 </xref> and

 </xref>) significantly blocked the interaction of the SARS-CoV S protein with ACE2 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 4.30, 6.99, and 1.88 nM, respectively. Additional immunofluorescence assay (IFA) studies with S-protein-pseudotyped retroviruses, revealed a novel mechanism of infection inhibition of Vero E6 cells by SP-10.

 </sup> Structural investigation of the RBD-ACE2 complex by Michael et al. revealed crucial charged residues between positions 22 and 57 for SARS-CoV viral entry. This structural information resulted in the design of two longer peptides P4 and P5 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of around 50 and 6 μM, respectively. Glycine linkage of peptide P4 (residue 22–47) with an ACE2 derived peptide (residue 351–357) further improved antiviral activity against a SARS-CoV pseudovirus with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 100 nM and no cytotoxicity up to 200 μM.

 </sup> In light of the successful inhibition of SARS-CoV with this linked peptide, a similar strategy could potentially be effective against the new SARS-CoV-2. The recently solved cryoEM structure of SARS-CoV-2 in complex with the human ACE2 receptor can provide a structural rationale for the peptide design.
