<p>Using the VelocImmune platform, Pascal et al. generated several human, noncompeting monoclonal antibodies that target MERS-CoV S protein and block viral entry into host cells. Among them, two antibodies, REGN3051 and REGN3048, can significantly inhibit MERS-CoV pseudoparticles, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 460 and 180 pM, respectively.

 </sup> In addition, REGN3051 and REGN3048 showed a good performance in a novel transgenic mouse model, which was developed by replacing the mouse DPP4 coding sequence with that encoding human DPP4. Results suggested that both REGN3051 and REGN3048 were able to potently reduce MERS-CoV specific RNA levels in the lungs at a 200 μg per mouse dose compared with the isotype control antibody. At the 20 μg dose, REGN3051 was more effective at decreasing MERS-CoV RNA levels compared with REGN3048 at the same dose.

 </sup> Recently, in the common marmoset model of MERS-CoV infection, de Wit et al. tested the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of REGN3051 and REGN3048. Data demonstrated that their protection might be more effective in a prophylactic treatment process rather than treatment of MERS-CoV.

 </sup> In the latest attempt, Chen et al. identified SARS-CoV-2 RBD specific antibodies from samples of 26 recovered COVID-19 patients using an RBD-specific ELISA binding study. Among them, 311mab-31B5 and 311mab-32D4 effectively neutralized pseudovirus entry, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.0338 and 0.0698 μM, respectively.

 </sup> Recently, in an ELISA based (cross)reactivity assay, assessing antibody-containing supernatants of a collection of 51 SARS-S hybridoma’s derived from immunized transgenic H2L2 mice that encode chimeric immunoglobulins, Wang et al. identified a chimeric mAb 47D11 that targets RBD. 47D11 exhibited cross-neutralizing activity of SARS-CoV-S protein and SARS-CoV-2-S protein pseudotyped VSV infection with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.19 and 0.57 μM, respectively.
