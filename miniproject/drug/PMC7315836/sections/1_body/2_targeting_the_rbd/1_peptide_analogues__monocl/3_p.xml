<p>In a different approach, Hu et al. generated a novel chimeric recombinant protein recently by connecting the extracellular domain of human ACE2 to the Fc region of human immunoglobulin IgG1. These chimeric constructs displayed high-affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBD binding and potently neutralized SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values between 0.8 and 0.1 Î¼M, respectively. These recombinant chimeras also showed cross-reactivity and could have, therefore, useful applications for diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
