<p>Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have potential applications for diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of established and evolving viral infections.

 </sup> Prabhakar et al. isolated specific antibodies from B cells in XenoMouse immunized with SARS-CoV. Further investigation revealed that several Abs directly react with the RDB domain, and a combination of two Abs (4D4 and 3C7) displayed near-complete neutralization efficiency as compared to a single Ab application.

 </sup> Two additional potent monoclonal antibodies, mAb201 and mAb68, could be isolated from transgenic mice immunized with the soluble ectodomain of SARS-CoV S protein.

 </sup> This mAb could bind SARS-CoV S protein directly with affinities of 34 nM (mAb 201) and 83 nM (mAb 68) as judged by SPR analysis. Mice that received 40 mg/kg of mAb 201 or mAb 68 before SARS-CoV infection showed complete protection from reinfection of lung tissues.

 </sup> Cross-reactivity of mAbs is highly desirable, and Dimitrov et al. identified the human mAb m396 that binds SARS-CoV with high affinity (

 </sup> Mice that received 200 μg of m396 were nearly completely protected from infection by Urbani and GD03 virus strains.

 </sup> M396 did compete with the SARS-CoV receptor, ACE2, for binding to the RBD, suggesting that m396 inhibits SARS-CoV-ACE2 binding as the predominant mechanism of action.

 </sup> However, SARS-COV-2 showed some complexities for RBD directed antibodies. For instance, Wrapp et al. tested cross-reactivity of three antibodies, including S230, m396, and 80R, against SARS-COV-2 RBD. Despite the partly high degree of structural homology between the SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV, no binding to the SARS-COV-2 RBD was detected for any of the three antibodies at the concentration of 1 μM. It can be concluded that SARS-COV antibodies will not necessarily be cross-reactive for SARS-COV-2.
