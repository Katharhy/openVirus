<p>Cathepsin L consists of a pro- and a mature-domain. In a low pH milieu, the pro-domain is autocatalytically cleaved to obtain the papain-like folded mature-domain consisting of an N-terminal helical domain and a C-terminal Î²-sheet domain (

 </sup> A well conserved Cys-His-Asn triad in the active site is crucial for substrate binding and catalysis. In light of its importance in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle, cathepsin L is a highly desirable target that will be described in the following section.
