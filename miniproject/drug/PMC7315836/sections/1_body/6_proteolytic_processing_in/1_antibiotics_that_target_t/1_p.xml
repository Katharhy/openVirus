<p>During clathrin-dependent viral entry, the host cellular cathepsin L protease plays a key role in infection efficiency by activation of the S protein into a fusogenic state to escape the late endosomes, and cathepsin L (lysosomal endopeptidase) cleavage is believed to expose a hydrophobic fusion peptide essential to initiate membrane fusion.

 </sup> In light of its vital role in the SARS CoV infection cycle, cathepsin L is a desirable target to interfere with virusâ€“cell entry.
