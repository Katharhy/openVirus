 </sup> More recently, Zhang et al. showed that teicoplanin could also block the entry of the new SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.66 Î¼M. As a routinely used clinical antibiotic, teicoplanin could be potentially used immediately to combat the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
