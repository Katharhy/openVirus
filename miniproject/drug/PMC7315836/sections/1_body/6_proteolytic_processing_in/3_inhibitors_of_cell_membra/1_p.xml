<p>Either the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin L or the cell membrane-associated serine protease TMPRSS2 can facilitate SARS-CoV virus entry into host cells by cleavage of the viral S protein.

 </sup> This cleavage exposes fusion-competent motifs known as fusion peptides, and importantly, for SARS-CoV, the interference of both proteases is required for efficient inhibition of virus replication.

 <bold>Camostat</bold> (
 <bold>22</bold>, 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="other">4</xref>
 </xref>), a commercially available serine protease inhibitor that can efficiently prevent SARS-CoV infections at 10 μM by inhibiting TMPRSS2 activity. However, even at high concentrations (100 μM) of 
 <bold>22</bold>, the inhibition of viral entry via SARS S protein-mediated cell fusion never exceeded 65% (inhibition efficiency), indicating that despite the inhibition of TMPRSS2, 35% of virus entry takes place via the endosomal cathepsin pathway. Therefore, they examined the activity of pseudotyped viruses when treated with a combination of (23,25)
 <italic>trans</italic>-epoxysuccinyl-
 <sc>l</sc>-leucylamindo-3-methylbutane ethyl ester (EST, a cathepsin inhibitor) and 
 <bold>22</bold>. The results suggested that simultaneous treatment with EST and 
 <bold>22</bold> remarkably blocked infection (&gt;95%).

 </sup> Similarly, Pöhlmann et al. reported that 
 <bold>22</bold> could prevent the viral entry of SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, full inhibition efficiency was attained when treated with both 
 <bold>22</bold> and E-64d (a cathepsin inhibitor). Both studies indicate that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter cells via a similar mechanism, showing the potential of 
 <bold>22</bold> as a promising candidate for further development as a SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
