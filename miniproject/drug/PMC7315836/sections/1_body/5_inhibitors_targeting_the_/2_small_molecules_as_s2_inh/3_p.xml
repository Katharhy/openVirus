 <bold>Arbidol</bold> (
 <bold>16</bold>), a broad-spectrum drug, has been licensed for decades in Russia and China against influenza by binding to the HA protein to block the viruses–cell fusion.

 </sup> Recently, Wang et al. identified that 
 <bold>16</bold> efficiently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in vitro with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 4.11 μM, a CC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 31.79 μM, and an SI of 7.73.

 </sup> Vankadari compared protein sequence analysis and found that a small region of the S2 domain (aa947–aa1027) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein resembles that of the influenza virus H3N2 HA. So the mechanism of 
 <bold>16</bold> was to target the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and blocked its trimerization, which may inhibit host cell adhesion and hijacking.

 </sup> In January 2020, in Wuhan, China, a clinical pilot trial conducted with 36 patients with SARS-CoV-2 virus infection received 400 mg 
 <bold>16</bold> three times a day for 9 days; 31 untreated SARS-CoV-2 patients served as a control group. In this trial, patients with 
 <bold>16</bold> showed a tendency to decrease viral load as determined by RT-PCR and reduced mortality (0% vs 16%), as compared to the control group.
