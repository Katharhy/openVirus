<p>The S2 domain is the most conserved motif between the SARS-CoV and the new SARS-CoV-2 S protein.

 </sup> It represents an ideal immunogen for the generation of a novel or repurposing SARS-CoV S2 domain targeting mAbs with cross-reactive potential.

 </sup> Sasazuki et al., for example, could successfully isolate the human mAb 5H10 from immunized Kunming (KM) mice. 5H10 displayed an anti-SARS-CoV neutralizing activity of around 5 μg/mL. Cell fusion assays indicate that 5H10 can inhibit viral fusion and entry rather than viral attachment to the surface of host cells or cleavage of the S protein. Consequently, the S protein of SARS-CoV might be the direct target of 5H10; however, further studies are required to confirm this hypothesis.

 </sup> Tan et al. identified mAb 1A9 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value between 25 and 50 μg/mL), an anti-SARS-CoV S2 domain mAb, that binds to a conserved loop region between the HR1 and HR2 domains of the S2 domain.
