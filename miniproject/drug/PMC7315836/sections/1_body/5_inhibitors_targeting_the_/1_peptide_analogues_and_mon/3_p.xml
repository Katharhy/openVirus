<p>MERS-5HB, a polypeptide derived from the HR1 and HR2 region, was synthesized by Gong et al., and affinity analysis demonstrated a low

 <sub>d</sub> value of 0.24 nM, and an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1 μM against MERS-CoV and CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 50 μM. HR derived peptides is a highly promising strategy for viral fusion inhibition. Successful HR peptides have been used in the past to block entry of other virus families such as the HIV with the gp41 derived peptide Fuzeon (T20), the only approved fusion inhibitor for HIV-1 treatment to date.

 </sup> Therefore, HR derived peptides highlight a promising strategy for inhibitor development combating the new SARS-CoV-2.
