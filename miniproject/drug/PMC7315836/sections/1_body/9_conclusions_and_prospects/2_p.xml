 </sup> Although vaccination strategies were developed in the context of previous epidemics, no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 infections is yet available. Since the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, research groups around the world are now stepping up to develop vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2, and vaccine research routes include nucleic acid vaccines, viral vector vaccines, inactivated vaccines, and recombinant protein vaccines. Typical vaccine development is time, resource, and financially consuming, although this pandemic has created initiatives that hope to speed the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Even the most optimiztic views regarding an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine being created are at least one year away. Even after creation, other hurdles for the SARS-CoV-2 include global implementation and distribution, and different strategies for containing this contagion should be explored simultaneously as the vaccine efforts.
