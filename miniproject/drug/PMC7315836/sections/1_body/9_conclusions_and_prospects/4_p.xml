<p>Recent initiatives such as the governmental (USA) Operation Warp Speed (OWS) to support the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics or the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) publicâ€“private partnership coordinated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are crucial milestones in a coordinated effort to accelerate and prioritize the development of the most promising vaccines and treatments. Initiatives like these that bridge government, academia, and industry should also be continued past the current COVID-19 crisis so that we can respond to future novel outbreaks rapidly and adequately.</p>
