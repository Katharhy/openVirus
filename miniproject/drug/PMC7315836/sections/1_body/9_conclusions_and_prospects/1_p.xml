<p>The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, with its high fatality rate, has raised global concerns and was declared as a global pandemic by the WHO. The number of infections continues to rise, and numerous research groups around the globe have prioritized the identification and development of new COVID-19 treatments. Still, there are no effective treatments to date. Viral entry is the first step in the viral life cycle and represents an attractive intervention point by blocking the coreceptor interaction or the virusâ€“cell membrane fusion event. SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses have similar infection mechanisms. This is especially true for SARS-CoV and CoV-NL63, which share the same human ACE2 receptor crucial for viral entry. Therefore, already developed inhibitors against known hCoVs could potentially be used to combat SARS-CoV-2. These efforts identified a large number of inhibitors, including peptides, antibodies, small-molecule compounds, and natural products with anticoronavirus activity. Although many inhibitors demonstrated efficacy in inhibiting coronavirus virus infection, no specific prophylactic or postexposure therapy is currently available for HCoVs. One of the main reasons causing this is that most of the potenial agents were not adequately evaluated for in vitro and in vivo studies. Most drugs are in the preclinical stage and stopped in animal models due to poor bioavailability, safety, and pharmacokinetics so that few entered human trials. In light of the urgency of the current outbreak, repositioning of already approved drugs is increasingly becoming a promising approach, especially with toxicity and safety data in hand.</p>
