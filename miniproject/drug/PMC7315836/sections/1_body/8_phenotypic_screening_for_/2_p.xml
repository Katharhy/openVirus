 </sup> Hsiang et al. screened a library of 121 Chinese herbs using a biotinylated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to search for active compounds that could potentially inhibit SARS-CoV S protein binding to ACE2. Further studies identified 
 <bold>emodin</bold> (
 <bold>31</bold>,

  <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="other">5</xref>
 </xref>), the active component from 
 <italic>Polygonum multiflorum</italic> and 
 <italic>Rheum officinale</italic>, could block the interaction of SARS-CoV S protein to ACE2, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 200 μM in an S protein-pseudotyped retrovirus assay using Vero E6 cells. However, the mechanism of action of

 </sup> Sarafianos et al. found that 
 <bold>SSAA09E3</bold> (
 <bold>32</bold>), a benzamide derivative, could prevent SARS-CoV virus–cell membrane fusion in pseudotyped-based and antiviral-based assays, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 9.7 μM, but a CC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 20 μM indicates additional unknown cellular targets.
