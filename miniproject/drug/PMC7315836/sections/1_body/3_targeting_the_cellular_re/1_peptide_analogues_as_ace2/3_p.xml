<p>Another peptide derived from the RBD, RBD-11b, located in S1 of the SARS-CoV S protein, is crucial for binding to the host cells ACE2 receptor

 <sub>d</sub> of around 46 Î¼M. Moreover, RBD-11b displays no toxicity, as judged by an MTT (3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo-(-z-y1)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumbromide) cell proliferation assay, on VeroE6 cells. In addition, RBD-11b showed antiviral activity to HCoV-NL63 at a peptide concentration of 7 mM in CaCo2 cells, which also used ACE2 as a functional receptor.
