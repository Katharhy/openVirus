<p>Perhaps the most promising small molecule described to date is the very potent ACE2 inhibitor 
 <bold>MLN-4760</bold> (
 <bold>9</bold>). 
 <bold>9</bold> can inhibit the catalytic activity of ACE2 with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of around 440 pM.

 </sup> The crystal structure of the apo and 
 <bold>9</bold> bound ACE2 complex revealed a significant subdomain movement of the N-terminal and C-terminal subdomains of ACE2 upon 
 <bold>9</bold> binding. This movement is important to position critical residues to stabilize the bound inhibitor. Its high potency makes 
 <bold>9</bold> a very attractive candidate for SARS-CoV-2 interference; however, no antiviral coronavirus data is available at this time.
