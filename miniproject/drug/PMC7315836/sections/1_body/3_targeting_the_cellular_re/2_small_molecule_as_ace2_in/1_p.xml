<p>As discussed previously, peptide and constrained peptide inhibitors have inherent caveats concerning their use as drugs.

 </sup> Therefore, screening for small molecule inhibitors, guided by information gleaned from the previous studies is the next logical step. A virtual screen targeting the ACE2 catalytic site with around 140 000 compounds combined with a molecular docking approach led to the identification of

 <bold>3</bold> showed a dose-dependent inhibition of ACE2 catalytic activity with an IC
