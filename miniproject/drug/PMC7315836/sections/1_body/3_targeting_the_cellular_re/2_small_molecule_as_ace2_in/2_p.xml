 <bold>Chloroquine</bold> (
 <bold>4</bold>) currently has applications for malaria and amoebiasis treatment. Interestingly, Nichol et al. showed that chloroquine could also block the interaction of RBD of SARS-CoV to ACE2 under cell culture conditions with an ED
 <sub>50</sub> value of 4.4 μM.

 </sup> Recently, Wang et al. found that 
 <bold>4</bold> blocked SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.13 μM and a CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 μM in Vero E6 cells.

 </sup> Chloroquine possibly increases endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion as well as impairs with the terminal glycosylation of the cellular ACE2 receptor, thereby reducing the affinity of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2. Besides its antiviral activity, chloroquine may synergistically enhance its antiviral effect with immune-modulating activity in vivo.

 </sup> At present, chloroquine is carried out in clinical research in China for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (ChiCTR2000029609).

 <bold>Hydroxychloroquine</bold> (
 <bold>5</bold>) is an analogue of chloroquine, which shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine but displays a more tolerable safety profile.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">70</xref>
 </sup> Yao et al. showed that 
 <bold>5</bold> had an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.72 μM after a 48 h incubation time. In physiological-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models, Yao et al. found 
 <bold>5</bold> exhibited better in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity than 
 <bold>4</bold>.

 </sup> Recent studies suggest that 
 <bold>4</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold> could cause ventricular arrhythmias,

 </sup> QT prolongation,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref72">72</xref>,

 </sup> retinopathy,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref74">74</xref>
 </sup> and other cardiac-related toxicity, which may pose a particular risk to critically ill patients. Although both show antiviral activity, safety, and effectiveness, they require further clinical research.
