<p>Recently the genome of SARS-CoV-2 was determined, which revealed 80% identity with that of some SARS-CoV strains (GZ02, BJ01, Tor2, SZ3, PC4-227) and interestingly 96% identity to the bat coronavirus BatcoV RaTG13.

 </sup> The receptor-binding spike (S) protein is highly divergent from other CoVs and displays nucleotide sequence identities of 75% or less to all other previously described SARS-CoVs. However, again, the new SARS-CoV-2 S protein shares 93.1% identity to the RaTG13 S protein.
