<p>MERS-CoV can also be activated by furin (serine endoprotease) to initiate the nonclathrin mediated membrane fusion event.

 </sup> Interestingly, in the new SARS-CoV-2 S protein, additional amino acid insertions at the S1/S2 cleavage site results in an “RRAR” furin recognition site absent in SARS-CoV S protein.

 </sup> This polybasic insertion sequence has possible implications for the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle and its increased pathogenicity. Indeed, polybasic furin sites have been observed in hemagglutinin (HA) proteins of highly virulent avian and human influenza viruses, and similar furin-like processing events are also observed for other RNA viruses such as Ebola virus and Marburg virus, human immune deficiency virus (HIV), and flaviviruses.
