<p>To activate the S protein for membrane fusion with the cellular membrane, structural rearrangements within the S2 domain are required. Two heptad repeats, HR1 (dark blue in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>) and HR2 can interact to form a six-helix bundle (6-HB), a common postfusion structure shared by all type I viral glycoproteins, to bring viral and cellular membranes in close proximity. Additionally, the S2 domain contains a membrane interacting domain or fusion peptide that is exposed upon specific triggers such as receptor binding or low endosomal pH. To date, three membrane interacting regions with host-membrane destabilizing effects have been identified in the SARS-CoV S protein: two conserved sequences across coronaviridae, with residues 798–815

 </sup> and residues 864–886,

 </sup> both C-terminal positioned at the second cleavage site in the S protein termed S2′ at Arg 797 and a less conserved third region with membrane disordering properties residues 770–788.

 </sup> Once in the host cell, the viral particle uncoats and is ready for transcription and translation.

 </sup> The first ORF codes for approximately 67% of the genome and is separated into open reading frames (ORF) 1a and 1b (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>). ORF1a and ORF1b are translated into polyproteins pp1a (4382 amino acids) and pp1ab (7073 amino acids) that are processed by 3-C-like protease (3Clpro) and papain-like protease (Plpro). The processing of these polyproteins produces a variety of nonstructural proteins (NSPs), including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and helicase, to catalyze viral genome replication and protein synthesis.
