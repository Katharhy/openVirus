<p>Engagement of the host cell receptor ACE2 is important for viral entry; however, subsequent entry steps can vary and are cell-type specific. SARS-CoV can enter the host cell via both clathrin (endosomal) and nonclathrin pathways (nonendosomal); however, both pathways are dependent upon ACE2 binding.

 </sup> The clathrin-mediated pathway includes the S protein binding to ACE2 and subsequent dynamin/clathrin-mediated internalization of endosomal vesicles that maturate to late endosomes. Within the late endosomes and lysosomes, acidification of the internalized endosomes and H
 <sup>+</sup>-dependent activation of the cellular cathepsin L proteinase takes place that cleaves and activates the S protein, therefore initiating viral fusion with the endosomal/lysosomal membrane (

 </xref>). In the case of SARS-CoV, cell culture studies revealed that the entry process is delayed with a lag phase of around 30 min, suggesting substantial maturation requirements.

 </sup> In accordance with findings that mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) and feline coronavirus (FCV) infections of HeLa cells are also heavily dependent on endosomal maturation, the clathrin-dependent entry and endosomal maturation are key to entry across Coronaviridae.

 </sup> For SARS-CoV-2, a recent study also confirms that virus can use host cell receptor CD147 to gain entry into the host cells besides ACE2.
