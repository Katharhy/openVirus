<p id="Par7">Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a type I membrane protein mainly expressed in the lung, heart, kidney and intestine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. ACE2 consists of an N-terminal peptidase domain (PD) and a C-terminal Collectrin-like domain (CLD) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The PD of ACE2 mainly interacts with the RBD domain of the S protein of the coronavirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. And the RBD domain of the S protein is recognized by the extracellular PD of ACE2 mainly through polar residues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The structural information of ACE2 is limited to the PD domain. So, the S protein of COVID-19 exploit ACE2 for host infection [
