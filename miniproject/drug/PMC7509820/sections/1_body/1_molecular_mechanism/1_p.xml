<p id="Par6">The Coronavirus consists of nucleocapsid protein (N protein), Spike protein (S protein), small envelope glycoprotein (E protein), membrane glycoprotein (M protein), Hemagglutinin-esterase dimer (HE protein) and RNA. The spike protein of coronaviruses facilitates viral entry into target cells. The spike protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein and can be divided into two functional units: the receptor binding subunit S1 and the membrane fusion subunit S2 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. S1 facilitates virus infection by binding to host receptors. And S2 is responsible for the fusion of the virus and the membrane of host cell. COVID-19 uses the serine protease TMPRSS2 as an initiator of spike protein [
