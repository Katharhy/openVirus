<p id="Par3">At the end of 2019, a novel influenza coronavirus (COVID-19) that similar to SARS and MERS appeared in Wuhan, Hubei, China and has been confirmed that has the ability of human-to-human transmission [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The genome of COVID-19 is a single-stranded positive sense RNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The gene sequence analysis showed that COVID-19 has a typical coronavirus genome structure and belongs to the beta- coronavirus cluster [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. With the rapid increase of the number of cases and increasing evidence of human-to-human transmission, the virus is more contagious than SARS and MERS [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Moreover, COVID-19 show very different virological characteristics compare with SARS. For the SARS, the level of RNA usually reaches a peak after 7–10 days of symptoms. However, the level of RNA reaches a peak within 5 days of the symptoms of COVID-19, which can be 1000 times higher than the SARS [

Among them, the A virus is the closest to the coronavirus found in bats and pangolins. It is the original virus type and the B type is derived from Type A, Type C are derived from Type B. Nearly half of the samples infected with Type A are from outside East Asia, mainly in the United States and Australia, and two-thirds of American samples are infected with Type A, and Type B is the most common in East Asia. type C is the main virus type spread in Europe [
