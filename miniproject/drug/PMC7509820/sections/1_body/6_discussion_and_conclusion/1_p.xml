<p id="Par42">At present, COVID-19 has spread around the world. In deaths, the majority of patients over 60â€‰years age and suffer from underlying diseases such as cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Some studies have shown that about half of the survivors of malignant tumors have moderate fear of cancer recurrence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Meantime, Fujita et al. found that 9.1% of lung cancer patients suffered anxiety and requested a treatment delay during the COVID-19 pandemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Coupled with the epidemic, lung cancer patients may more worry about the impact of COVID-19 and the delay of anti-tumor treatmen, which makes them more susceptible to illness, anxiety, depression and insomnia. Calvo et al. found that health surveillance and monitoring is an important part of maintaining wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. Another study also showed that a higher frequency of receiving COVID-19 information and news was associated with a lower risk of anxiety [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. It is recommended high risk patients be identified for psychological morbidities and screening be improved to provide quick, cost effective psychological interventions via online platforms to manage symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. In addition, considering the lack of time and resources for personalized screenings, We recommended programs such as Mental Health and Dynamic Referral for Oncology (MHADRO) to assist with screening for mental health problems for cancer patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Therefore, It is necessary to provide health services to cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic, in order to prevent the predictable decline of cancer conditions, and prevent health system overload and health control crisis.
