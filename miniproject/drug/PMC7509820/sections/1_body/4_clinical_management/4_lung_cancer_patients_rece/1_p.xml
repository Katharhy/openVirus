<p id="Par37">Targeted therapies are revolutionized therapeutics which interfere with specific molecules to block cancer growth, progression, and metastasis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Targeted therapy is recommended for patients with advanced lung cancer with the mutations of targeted driver EGFR, BRAF or the rearrangements of ALK or ROS1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. However, we must be alert to the increase of adverse events that may be caused by targeted therapies in the current epidemic situation. Lung cancer patients who take oral targeted therapy drugs and have stable conditions should maintain the original drug treatment during the epidemic. Patients whose condition improved markedly after targeted therapy and those with stable disease can be appropriately deferred to the hospital for review during the epidemic. Although patients can be treated at home with oral drugs, attention should still be paid to the side effects and adverse events of some targeted drugs. Further, it is necessary to promptly consult an oncologist under proper protection under emergency symptoms or obvious disease progression.
