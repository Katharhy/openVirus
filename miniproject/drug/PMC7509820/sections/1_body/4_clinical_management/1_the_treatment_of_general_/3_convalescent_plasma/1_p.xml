The results of a phase I clinical trial showed that 10 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia had all symptoms, especially fever, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain, improved within 3 days after infusion of plasma from recovered patients, and laboratory tests, Imaging performance and viral load have improved significantly [

In addition, convalescent plasma is suitable for patients with rapid disease progression, severe and critically ill patients base on China’s New Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (Trial Version 8). The infusion dose needs to be determined based on the patient’s clinical condition and weight, usually the infusion dose is 200–500 ml.
