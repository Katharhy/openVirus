<p id="Par33">Tocilizumab is an immunosuppressive drug, mainly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. It is a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin 6 receptor (IL-6R). Previous studies have shown that patients infected with COVID-19 quickly activate inflammatory T cells and inflammatory monocytes / macrophages in the body, resulting in the significant increase in IL-6 levels in the blood, and the levels of IL-6 is associated with the mortality of patients with COVID-19 infection pneumonia [

A recent study showed that all patients experienced a recovery in body temperature after injection of Tocilizumab, and 90% of patients experienced a reduction in pulmonary symptoms. According to China’s New Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (Trial Version 8), Tocilizumab can be tried for patients with extensive lung disease and elevated IL-6 levels in the laboratory. The first dose of Tocilizumab is 4-8 mg/kg, and the recommended dose is 400 mg.
