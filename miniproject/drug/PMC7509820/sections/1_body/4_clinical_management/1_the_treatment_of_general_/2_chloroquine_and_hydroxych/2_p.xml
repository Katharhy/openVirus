<p id="Par28">Hydroxychloroquine is a derivative of chloroquine. The two structures are similar and the mechanism of action is very similar, but they differ in terms of safety and tolerability in clinical use. A study showed that the temperature recovery time and cough remission time of patients were significantly shortened in hydroxychloroquine group. The proportion of patients with improved pneumonia was 80.6%, which was higher than that of the control group (54.8%) [
