<p id="Par17">In Trinidad and Tobago, a seroprevalence study was carried out against antibodies selected from flavivirus and alphavirus in a sample of 384 bats. The sera were analyzed by ELISA using specific antibodies against West Nile virus (VWN), VEEV, EEEV. 2.9% of the sample (11/384) were seropositive against VEEV-specific antibodies, none of the sera were seropositive against VWN and EEEV virus antibodies [

 <italic>Carollia sowelli, Glossophaga sorici</italic>na and

 <italic>Sigmodon hispidus</italic> and 
 <italic>Oryzomys alfaroi</italic>). Rodent specimens were negative for VEEV, WEEV, and WNV [

 <italic>Artibeus planirostris</italic> and 
 <italic>Sturnira lilium</italic>. Immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies confirmed the presence of VEEV in the brain, spleens, and lungs of fruit bats. However, in the liver, heart, and kidney, the virus was not found.
