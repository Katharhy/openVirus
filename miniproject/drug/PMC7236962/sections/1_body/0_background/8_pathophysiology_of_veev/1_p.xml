<p id="Par18">The virus is transmitted by the bite of mosquitoes, which is infected by feeding on reservoirs that contain high levels of viremia. The viremia process is produced in the salivary glands, and then, the virusesâ€™ passage to new reservoirs during the feeding of the vector. The mosquito saliva is deposited in the extravascular space of the affected vertebrae, then by the interaction of the E2 protein and receptors on the surface of the host cell, the viruses enter the cell by endocytosis and are taken to endosomes. The low pH at endosomes releases components of the virus, they move to the cytoplasm through pores in the endosome. The nucleocapsid is disassembled in the cytoplasm, leading to virus replication [

Many species of mosquitoes can transmit this virus because the high epidemic power allows it to infect and produce many cases in humans and animals in a short time. Among the species capable of transmitting VEEV are Culex (Melaconion), Aedes, Mansonia, Psorophora, Haemagogus, Sabethes, Deinocerites, and Anopheles. It is also possible that some classes of Diptera may transmit the virus.
