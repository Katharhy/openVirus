<p id="Par4">The International Virus Taxonomy Committee classified the virus into the Togaviridae family, genus Alphavirus, and according to the Baltimore classification: Group IV (+) ssRNA (REF). The VEEV has single-stranded RNA approximately 70 nm in diameter, with icosahedral symmetry. The 5′ end of the genome encodes four non-structural proteins, nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4, and the 3′ end is responsible for three structural proteins, the capsid and the envelope proteins E1 and E2. Non-structural proteins participate in the replication of the viral genome involved in functions of the cytoplasm of the host.</p>
