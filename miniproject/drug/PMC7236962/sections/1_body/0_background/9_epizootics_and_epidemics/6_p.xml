<p id="Par26">The most recent Colombian VEEV epidemic occurred in the department of Chocó in the period between February and March 2008. Approximately 13% (250/2000) of the inhabitants had a febrile illness compatible with VEEV; two died but could not Isolate the virus during the outbreak. In Colombia, during 2011, there were four foci of encephalitis in horses, three foci of Venezuelan equine encephalitis in the departments of Córdoba and Magdalena, and a focus of eastern equine encephalitis in the department of Casanare (Table

Venezuelan equine encephalitis has an epidemiological behavior of persistence with apparent epidemiological silences. However, this is because, in countries endemic to flaviviruses, the first diagnostic impression is Dengue and recently Zika. Despite having had an epidemic peak of 40,000 cases by 1995, over time, the number of human cases has significantly decreased, and cases in animals have sporadically occurred. In Colombia, in the last 17 years, there has been a significant reduction in the foci of Venezuelan equine encephalitis. However, in 2010, there was an increase attributable to risk factors such as humid tropical areas, with vector proliferation, flooding of the Magdalena, San Jorge and Sinú rivers, and high rainfall of 800–1200 mm. Associated with this, Equidae used as working animals on farms are not vaccinated, which allows viral amplification [
