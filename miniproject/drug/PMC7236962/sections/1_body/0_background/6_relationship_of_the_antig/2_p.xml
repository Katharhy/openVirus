<p id="Par11">Epidemic/epizootic types include the IAB and IC subtypes, both being responsible for significant disease outbreaks in humans and horses. The other subtypes or enzootic viruses such as type ID cause disease in humans and usually do not affect horses [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Horses are susceptible to the virus, and the lethality rate for horses is between 20 and 80% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. VEEV is neurotropic and neuroinvasive, the virus replicates in lymphoid tissue and the brain, causing an acute viral infection that is typically resolved by the innate and adaptive response. However, neurological symptoms occur in 14% of human infections, and approximately 1% result in lethal encephalitis.
