<p id="Par27">Vector control is the foremost approach accessible for controlling several VBDs, including VEEV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. For other diseases are vaccines available for human use, such as is the case of yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue. But for VEEV only vaccines for animals are available. Then, vector control is currently the only method available to protect human people. Vector control seeks to limit the transmission of pathogens by reducing or eliminating human contact with the vectors. A broad range of vector control tools exists, which can be broadly classified into chemical- and notâ€“chemical-based tools. Means pursuing immature vectors can act by destroying the immature stages (e.g., chemical or biological larvicides and predator species) or by removing viable aquatic habitats (e.g., habitat modification or manipulation). Means oriented to the adult vectors function by destroying the vector (e.g., indoor residual spraying [IRS], space spraying) and reducing vector contact (blood-feeding success) with human and animal reservoir hosts (e.g., topical repellents, house screening, insecticide-treated bed nets [ITNs], insecticide-treated dog collars). There are also several novel vector control tools under development, e.g., genetic manipulation of mosquitoes, a bacterial infection of vectors (e.g., Wolbachia), and insecticide-treated eave tubes. The most essential novel strategies, still to be appropriately implemented in VEEV, are gene drive,
