<p id="Par29">Recently, EIDs such as COVID-19, EVD, Lassa fever, and SARS have been an issue of global concern. With globalization, the risk of the emergence of new diseases is increasing since humans have more chances to be exposed to new pathogens. Additionally, the risk of international spread of infectious diseases is increasing because of increased international travel. The process of globalization potentially influences a broad range of biological, environmental, and social factors that affect the burden of many critical human infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Various international organizations and governments have been trying to establish better global systems to respond to EIDs. However, the SARS outbreak in 2003, the EVD outbreak in West Africa in 2014, and the current COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted that the current global system is still not fully ready for such (re)emerging infectious diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. These EIDs threaten public health, as well as the global economy, and are sustained by increasing global trade and travel. However, the disruption of the human-ecological system is another potential factor. Travelers could play a role in importing EIDs and could be a carrier of major epidemics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. It has been observed that (re)emerging infectious diseases are imported by travelers or tourists in Europe, such as chikungunya and dengue in France and Italy as well as COVID-19 in France from China [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Cross-border movements of people, as well as trade in goods and services, are increasing the challenges for infectious disease control. As an example, in 2005, evidence of outbreak importation through international travel was found with the isolation of H5N1 type A influenza virus from two mountain hawk eagles that were illegally imported from Thailand in an airline cabin carry-on baggage to Belgium [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The risk of infectious diseases rises with the increased mobility of people, growth in the international trade in food and biological products, and social and environmental changes. It is evident that trade and international travel are essential to humankind. However, some preventive measures, such as travel restrictions and creation of awareness among trade and travel stakeholders, are paramount to flatten the curve. In recent years, trade embargoes or travel restrictions have been replaced with sensitive early warning surveillance, rapid verification procedures, and international response networks as well as epidemic preparedness through stockpiles of essential medicines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. However, studies have proven that if implemented within 2 weeks of cases, travel restrictions are 99% effective in conjunction with border restrictions that prevent the entry of infected travelers. Additionally, a 90% restriction on long-distance flights can lead to delays in the epidemic peak that range from a few days to a few weeks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. These developments affect all elements of the infectious disease chain: hosts, agents, and vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Moreover, we must not ignore the fact that outbreaks are themselves associated with significant costs in terms of lost trade and tourism revenue. Therefore, a fear of economic penalties and social stigma can arise and can sometimes lead authorities to underreport data in epidemics, hence risking serious public health consequences.
