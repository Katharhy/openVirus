<p id="Par36">Approximately three-fourths of human EIDs are caused by zoonotic pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. However, according to the WHO, humans coexist with animals in a variety of ways, either by hunting [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] or by living as domestic animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. The interface among humans, animals, and the environment we share can be a source of diseases impacting public health [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. However, in most cases, reported causes for and drivers of the apparent trends in disease emergence are lacking in intense evidence-based research. However, there is circumstantial evidence to suggest that novel epidemics and disease syndromes are the results of changing agroecology and human behavior and movements, intensifying interfaces with certain wildlife species and climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Although no clear evidence has been presented to date, hunting has been associated with zoonotic diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. With modern ways of life, however, this hypothesis became obsolete with the low spillover from wild animals to humans. The possible reason was that when people lived as hunter-gatherers, they were always on the move, and it became difficult for microbes to keep up with their human hosts. Once people started living as farmers, they began residing in more significant numbers in the same place and were in daily contact with their accumulating feces for extended periods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Other evidence has shown that bushmeat is an essential source of protein and income in Africa despite its link with numerous EIDs, such as Ebola and Marburg [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The increased demand and commercialization of these types of meat have exposed people to pathogens and thus facilitated the geographic spread of the diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. All the aspects highlighted above have created conditions highly amenable for the spillover of microbes into the human ecosystem.
