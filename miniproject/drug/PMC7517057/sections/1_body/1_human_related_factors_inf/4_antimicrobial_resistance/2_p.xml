<p id="Par39">It has been shown that AMR is the consequence of microbial adaptation and genetic changes that allow them to bypass the human immune system, infect human cells, and spread disease. These microbes can emerge and spread rapidly and become resistant to multiple antimicrobials at the same time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>] by developing mechanisms to exchange or incorporate new genetic material into their genomes, exchanging virtually any stretch of DNA or RNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Sometimes, even doctors prescribe inappropriate antimicrobials (i.e., an antimicrobial is not needed at all, or they prescribe the wrong drug or wrong dose) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>], or physicians prescribe drugs with the wrong prescription doses or antibiotics with an incorrect duration of treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. This practice contributes to the growth and spread of microbial resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>] and can be responsible for nosocomial infections in hospitals. For instance, more than 90% of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> species were resistant to penicillin and beta-lactam antibiotics in hospitals in the United States (US) and were responsible for approximately 19,000 deaths in 1992 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Additionally, between 1989 and 1993, the incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci increased 20-fold in the US, and in 1997, the susceptibility of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> to vancomycin decreased in both the US and Japan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. In the European Union (EU), approximately 15–50% of 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> species are resistant to carbapenems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. Previously, methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) was associated with severe invasive disease only in hospitals; however, in the last 20 years, it has been identified in the community and named community-associated (CA)-MRSA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. As an example, CA-MRSA pneumonia is responsible for approximately 75–85% of admitted patients and 20 to 60% of deaths in the intensive care unit [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. Currently, extended-spectrum β-lactamase resistance is endemic in hospitals and the community worldwide [
