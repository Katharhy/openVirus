<p id="Par41">The use of antimicrobials as additives in plant agriculture (fruits, vegetables, orchids, etc.) and animals and, more importantly, food-producing animals can lead to the development of resistant bacteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. Thus, resistant genes in animals can be transferred to humans through the consumption of food or direct contact with food-producing animals or through environmental spread [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>]. The misuse of antimicrobials, especially in developing countries, is mainly due to their unregulated supply chain, the availability of over-the-counter drugs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>], and self-medication [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>], which is amplified by poverty [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>]. Up to half of all antibiotics prescribed are misused and neither needed nor effective [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>]. Another situation is the discontinuation of treatment by patients with a recurrent infection, which contributes to the development of a virulent and resistant strain of the microbe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>]. All these factors contribute to genetic selection pressure for the emergence of MDR bacterial infections in the community. Given the factors that contribute to the rise of AMR, reducing its risk implies the need to improve in ensuring the appropriate use of antibiotics through the enforcement and improvement of legislation on prescribing and dispensing antibiotics. In addition, the use of antibiotics in animal medicine and food production must be regulated. The government, pharmacists, doctors, veterinarians, and agronomists must work together and establish national guidelines for dispensing and prescribing antimicrobials. Adequate training on the proper prescription of antimicrobials must be given to health professionals, and the population must be educated on the use of antimicrobials and the threat of AMR.
