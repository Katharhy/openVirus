Many countries failed to prevent the epidemic in the beginning by delaying preventive measures. However, a few countries succeeded in controlling the outbreak by adopting an effective mitigating strategy. South Korea and other countries, such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, and Germany, quickly responded after the first case by adopting a strategy involving the testing and isolation of cases, contact tracing, and quarantining of suspected cases to suppress the full transmission of the virus in communities [
