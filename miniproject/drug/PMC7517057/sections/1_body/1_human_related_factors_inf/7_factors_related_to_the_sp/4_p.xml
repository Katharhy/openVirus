<p id="Par48">Host susceptibility includes aged individuals and other individuals with compromised immunity (such as high blood pressure, HIV, kidney diseases, diabetes, and cancers) who face higher risks of COVID-19 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">184</xref>]. Immune-compromised individuals are in a highly susceptible group, as their host defense is indigent; their defenses are already down, which could result in an increasingly poor prognosis for them [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">182</xref>]. Atmospheric temperature variation also plays a role in the spread of COVID-19. It is known that winter is the flu season in cold temperate countries because influenza viruses survive better in cold-dry weather with reduced ultraviolet light. Reduced innate immunity is due to low levels of vitamin D and melatonin and to staying indoors frequently during winter, increasing opportunities for the virus to spread among people [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR186">186</xref>]. COVID-19 started during winter, and it has been shown that the local immune response in the nasal passage is reduced in people during cold winter, making them more susceptible to flu-like viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR186">186</xref>]. This situation may make people living in such areas more vulnerable than those living in tropical areas, leading to differences in the spatial distribution of COVID-19 worldwide.
