<p id="Par46">Human behavior is an essential determinant of the transmission and spread of COVID-19 because the pandemic is spread by individual movements through large droplets and contacts, and possibly by aerosols and fomites, from person to person with direct or indirect contact based on the experience with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">167</xref>]. Self-protection may be the critical determinant for the prevention of COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">168</xref>] from one person to another because when a person protects himself or herself, he or she also protects others. Thus, understanding the collective behavior between and within individual groups would be useful for decision-making. Behavioral differences regarding COVID-19 containment measures such as lockdowns, social distancing, and the use of facial masks may cause some individuals to be more at risk than others and some countries to be more affected than others. Community behavior regarding preventive measures is influenced by cultural habits and misinformation. For example, there was also a great deal of misinformation and rumors that were widespread among the Chinese population and abroad with regard to the virus origin [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">172</xref>], transmission mode, treatment, prevention, and control measures [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">174</xref>]. In addition, the WHO also created misinformation at the beginning of the pandemic by restricting the wearing of masks only to sick people showing symptoms and those who are caring for people with suspected infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">175</xref>]. Thus, some countries advised populations to wear masks only in enclosed spaces such as shops or public transport. Additionally, misinformation created from social media and websites with no credible evidence has generated changes in the behavior of many people, increasing the frequency and spread of COVID-19 locally, regionally, and internationally [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">176</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">177</xref>]. In some countries, such as Japan, Singapore, China, and South Korea, cultural habits—such as the culture of mask-wearing, minimal personal contact, improved hand sanitization, and fanciful suggestions that Japanese speakers emit fewer potentially virus-laden droplets when talking than do speakers of other languages—have helped to flatten the curve and to limit the spread of COVID-19 in communities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">178</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">179</xref>]. On the other hand, in Western countries such as Italy, Spain, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and many other countries where the culture of mask-wearing is not a habit and where hugging, kissing, shaking hands, spending time together, and engaging in other social practices are common, the virus has spread quickly [
