<p id="Par53">Inadequate infrastructures and equipment and lack of awareness regarding laboratory biosafety and biosecurity in certain countries, especially in developing countries, have contributed to the spread of the disease in hospitals. Handling pathogens, especially viruses, may expose health workers to a high risk of contamination if they are not well trained. Thus, to prevent nosocomial infections, sufficient training of health workers in the principles and procedures of good laboratory practice (GLP) is needed. Health workers should be well trained on biohazards and the safe management of biological agents in the laboratory. Laboratory workers must have sufficient knowledge and experience about how to handle emerging pathogens safely and securely [

In many countries, health professionals are working without PPE and are exposed to the infection. Thus, the lack of awareness about COVID-19 preventive measures cause health workers to be exposed and become infected. Additionally, the lack of testing kits, ventilators, and other equipment is impeding some countries from adopting an effective testing and tracing strategy and preventing deaths among severe cases.
