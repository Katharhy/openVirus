<p>In this study, alcohol use and depressive symptoms did not act synergistically to increase the odds of IPV perpetration. At times when participants reported having depressive symptoms, the effect of alcohol use on IPV perpetration became non-significant. However, at times when participants reported having no depressive symptoms, more alcohol use was associated with significantly higher odds of IPV perpetration. This finding diverges from empirical and theoretical evidence suggesting that alcohol use and depression interact to exacerbate violence outcomes [
