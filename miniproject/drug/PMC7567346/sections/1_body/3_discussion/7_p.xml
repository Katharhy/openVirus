<p>Variables measured using self-report may have been biased due to social desirability, resulting in more conservative estimates of IPV perpetration and depressive symptoms [

 <xref rid="pone.0240674.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. This is probable as the questionnaires were interviewer-administered, which may have made participants less likely to report depressive symptoms or IPV perpetration [

Estimates of alcohol use may also be subject to recall bias as data were collected via self-report. However, sub-analyses of the study data validated the self-report alcohol measures using phosphatidylethanol (PEth) [
