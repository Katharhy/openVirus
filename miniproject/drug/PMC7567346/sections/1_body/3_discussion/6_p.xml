<p>We are not able to characterize the gender of all participants' partners due to missing data (N = 42/313). All participants with available data reported recently having female sexual partners only and having female main partners. Additionally, we did not collect data on the length of participants' intimate relationships. Participants whose relationships ended during the study may have been less likely to report IPV perpetration after their relationships ended. However, the vast majority of participants reported stable relationship statuses across study visits.</p>
