<p>Our study findings do not align with the multiple threshold and disinhibition theories, which suggest that people who use alcohol and experience depressive symptoms may have higher odds of IPV perpetration as compared to those who only use alcohol [

Additionally, the co-occurrence of alcohol and depressive symptoms may result in other forms of violence or aggression beyond IPV perpetration; this should be tested in future research.
