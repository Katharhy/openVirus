<p>Despite these limitations, this longitudinal study contributes important findings on the intersection between hazardous alcohol use, depressive symptoms, and IPV perpetration in a high-risk, understudied population. Unexpectedly, having depressive symptoms was found to weaken the alcohol-IPV relationship. These results suggest that men who reported higher alcohol use and depressive symptoms than usual may be experiencing extreme social isolation from an intimate partner, leading to less opportunity for alcohol-related IPV perpetration. Alternatively, men with HIV who are concurrently using alcohol and experiencing depressive symptoms may have fatigue or reduced energy, decreasing risk of alcohol-related IPV perpetration. Previous mental health interventions aiming to reduce IPV perpetration have either targeted participants who misuse alcohol or those who screen positive for depressive symptoms [
