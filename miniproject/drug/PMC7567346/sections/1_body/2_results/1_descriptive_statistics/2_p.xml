At three-month follow-up, the prevalence of IPV in the past three months was 15.4% (44/286), and last-three-month IPV prevalence remained fairly stable throughout the remainder of the study period (six-month follow-up: N = 47/292, 16.1%; 12-month follow-up: N = 42/279, 15.1%). Participants who reported recent IPV perpetration at baseline (N = 94/313) had higher IPV perpetration prevalence estimates across all subsequent study visits as compared to participants who reported no recent IPV perpetration at baseline (N = 219/313;
