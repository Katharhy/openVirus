<p>The best fitting unconditional growth model for IPV perpetration comprised a random intercept with linear and fixed effects for time. The odds of IPV perpetration significantly decreased over time (OR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.34, 0.59, p&lt;0.0001). At baseline, the variance in IPV perpetration significantly differed between participants (Intercept: b = -1.09, SE = 0.14, p&lt;0.0001).</p>
