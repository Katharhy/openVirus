<p>Depressive symptoms significantly modified the effect of proportion of days alcohol abstinent on IPV perpetration (
 <xref rid="pone.0240674.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). However, the pattern of effect modification did not support our hypothesis, as having depressive symptoms was found to weaken the inverse relationship between proportion of days alcohol abstinent and IPV perpetration (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240674.g002">Fig 2</xref>). At times when individuals screened negative for depressive symptoms, those who reported higher proportion of days alcohol abstinent than usual were less likely to report IPV perpetration (Slope: OR = 0.17, 95% CI 0.06, 0.45, p = 0.0004; 
 <xref rid="pone.0240674.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). In contrast, at times when individuals screened positive for depressive symptoms, there was no significant association between proportion of days alcohol abstinent and IPV perpetration (Slope: OR = 4.28, 95% CI 0.80, 22.78, p = 0.09).
