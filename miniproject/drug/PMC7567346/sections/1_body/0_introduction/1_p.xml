<p>The link between alcohol use and male-perpetrated intimate partner violence (IPV) has been established [

 <xref rid="pone.0240674.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The alcohol-IPV relationship is often explained by immediate alcohol intoxication effects, such as distorted perceptions of cues or lowered inhibitions, or by increased relationship conflict [

Such interactions may explain some of the heterogeneity found in the alcohol-IPV association, providing critical understanding on how to effectively intervene and reduce IPV perpetration among men. As both IPV and alcohol use lead to numerous health consequences, including HIV/STI infection, depression, physical injury, and death, IPV and alcohol interventions are urgently needed to improve the health and well-being of men and women at-risk for IPV [
