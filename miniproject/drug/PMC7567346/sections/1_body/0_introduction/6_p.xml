<p>In this study, we tested whether depressive symptoms influenced the strength and/or direction of the alcohol-IPV relationship among men with HIV and hazardous alcohol use in Vietnam. We investigated whether the concurrent effect of alcohol use on IPV perpetration differed at times when an individual reported having depressive symptoms versus not having depressive symptoms. Our specific hypothesis was that the time-varying association between alcohol use and IPV perpetration would be stronger at times when an individual screens positive for depressive symptoms as compared to negative.</p>
