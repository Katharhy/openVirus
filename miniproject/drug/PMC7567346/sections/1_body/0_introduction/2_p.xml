<p>Alcohol use and IPV perpetration are highly prevalent in Vietnam and largely shaped by sociocultural norms that stem from Confucianism [

 <xref rid="pone.0240674.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The World Health Organization found that the annual per capita consumption of pure alcohol in Vietnam was 5.1 liters [
