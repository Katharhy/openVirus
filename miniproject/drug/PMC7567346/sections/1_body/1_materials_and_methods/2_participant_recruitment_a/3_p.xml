<p>At baseline, three, six, and 12 months, quantitative questionnaires and the TLFB were administered to all study participants. Each study visit lasted approximately two hours. Trained interviewers administered questionnaires through face-to-face interviews in a private room at the study site. Participants confirmed informed consent at each follow-up visit. The behavioral assessment collected quantitative data on sociodemographics, alcohol and drug use, mental health, and violence. At the end of each study visit, participants were reimbursed for their travel expenses and given 100,000 Vietnamese Dong (~$4.30 USD) as compensation for lost wages. Retention was 94% (405/430) at three months, 96% (410/427) at six months, and 94% (390/414) at 12 months excluding those who were incarcerated (n = 11/440; 2.5%) or died (n = 15/440; 3.4%) during the study period.</p>
