<p>For this study, analysis was restricted to male participants who reported being married or cohabitating with a partner at baseline (N = 313) for two main reasons. First, a previous study conducted among men with HIV in northern Vietnam demonstrated that the alcohol-IPV relationship operates differently for men who were married or cohabitating versus those who were single, divorced, separated or widowed [
