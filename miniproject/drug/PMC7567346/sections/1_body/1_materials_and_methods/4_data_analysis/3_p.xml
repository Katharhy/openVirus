<p>All variables included in the analysis were centered [
 <xref rid="pone.0240674.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The wave of data collection variable was re-coded to start at zero to ensure the intercept represents the log odds of IPV perpetration at baseline. The alcohol use variable used to estimate time-varying (or within-person) effects was person-mean centered. For depressive symptoms, the person means were calculated and included in the model as controls along with the dummy coded depressive symptoms variable. Age (years) was grand-mean centered and categorical covariates were dummy coded.
