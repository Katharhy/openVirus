<p>Effect modification analyses were conducted in SAS 9.4 with multilevel growth models using maximum likelihood based on the Laplace estimation [
 <xref rid="pone.0240674.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. First, we determined the best-fitting unconditional growth model for IPV perpetration by testing linear and quadratic functional forms. The variance component for the random effect was removed from the model if it could not be estimated. The fixed effect was also removed from the model if it was non-significant.
