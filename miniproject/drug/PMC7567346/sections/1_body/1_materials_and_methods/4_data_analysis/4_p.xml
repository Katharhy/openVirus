<p>After determining the best-fitting unconditional growth model, the adjusted conditional growth model tested the time-varying effects of alcohol use and depressive symptoms and the two-way interactions among depressive symptoms and alcohol use on IPV perpetration adjusting for covariates. Any non-significant interactions were removed from the final model. If an interaction term was significant, the effect of alcohol use on the predicted probability of IPV perpetration was graphed at both levels of the depressive symptoms variable (0 or 1) to visualize the relationships. Standard errors (SEs) and p-values were generated to test the statistical significance of the intercepts and slopes represented in the graphs. Since participants were recruited from different ART community clinics, recruitment site was initially tested as a fixed effect to assess if it influenced results. As it did not change the results, it was removed to make models more parsimonious.</p>
