<p>According to Scafetta, temperature and relative humidity have an impact on viral transmission [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Temperatures from 4 to 12 °C and relative humidity of 60–80% with gentle wind speeds increase the susceptibility to respiratory tract infections and the spread of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Our analysis reveals that temperature and relative humidity are not the only factors with direct impact on fatality rates. The first fatal cases were announced in each of the three countries in March, while the first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported in Portugal, Switzerland, and Sweden on 3 March, 26 February, and 1 February 2020, respectively [

 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. According to these numbers, the spread of COVID-19 should be higher in Portugal, but again it was Sweden. An explanation for the higher fatality in Sweden is the cold weather itself. The virus cannot survive for long outside in the cold, but spreads easily because people remain indoors [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Indoor air is more suitable for the spread of SARS-CoV-2, especially due to close contact of people in unventilated, closed rooms without UV irradiation [
