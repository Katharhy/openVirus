<p>Primc et al. reported a possible relationship between low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations and susceptibility to COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in the northern hemisphere due to reduced solar irradiation especially in the winter months [

 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The infection rates of COVID-19, which started in the month of December 2019, are now showing exponential growth in Northern Hemisphere countries, [

 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. According to a recent review by Grant et al., 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations may play a relevant role in the progression of COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Sufficient plasma (25(OH)D) concentrations around 75 nmol/L ensure cellular immunity, decrease the risk of infections caused by microorganisms, and protect against metabolic syndrome and other chronic illnesses [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Severe vitamin D deficiency is defined as serum 25(OH) D levels lower than 30 nmol/L [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Factors such as screen-based entertainment, sedentary lifestyle, and less outdoor physical activity are directly related to poor endogenous vitamin D synthesis [

 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Higher susceptibility of advanced age individuals to COVID-19 may confirm this hypothesis. Commonly, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are less than 30 nmol/L in elderly individuals and geriatric patients due to indoor dwelling, physical inactivity, and increased pharmaceutical drugs intake, especially in the winter [

 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Sufficient serum vitamin D levels above 70 nmol/L may have a positive impact on recovery rate and survival of patients during illness [

 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Ilie et al. associated mean serum vitamin D levels in elderly populations of European countries with COVID-19 infection and mortality [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. They compared the mean serum vitamin D levels for the populations in Portugal (39 nmol/L), Spain (42.5 nmol/L), Switzerland (46 nmol/L), UK (47.4 nmol/L), Italy (50 nmol/L), Germany (50.1 nmol/L), Turkey (51.8 nmol/L), France (60 nmol/L), Sweden (73.5 nmol/L), and other countries [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Portugal has the smallest, Switzerland represents the average, and Sweden the highest mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and similar population sizes of 10,281,762, 8,516,543, and 10,183,175, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05616-f001">Figure 1</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The highest number of fatalities is in Sweden, followed by Switzerland, and then Portugal, although the opposite trend was expected due to mean serum vitamin D levels and population number. We can conclude that mean plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels have no direct impact on fatality rates and remain controversial in their relation to COVID-19. The results of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05616-f001">Figure 1</xref> show that the highest COVID-19-related mortality was in Sweden, followed by Switzerland and Portugal with median ages of 41.1, 42.7, and 44.6, respectively [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, we also can conclude from our analysis that median age is not a sufficient variable to predict fatality.
