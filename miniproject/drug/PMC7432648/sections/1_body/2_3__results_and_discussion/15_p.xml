<p>The fatality curve in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05616-f006">Figure 6</xref>b shows a peak on 15 April 2020. Thereafter, a steady decline in fatality numbers was reported. This curve may indicate that the worst of the outbreak in the USA is over and the peak lasted for around one month after the first reported case of COVID-19 on 17 March 2020. The US started to test for COVID-19 one month after this first confirmed case [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This delay of testing caused a rapid viral spread through the population because the infected cases were not identified and followed-up [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The unexpected mass of severe cases strained the unprepared health care system. Other compounding factors, such as a lack of drugs, treatment protocols, or vaccines resulted in a health disaster for the USA (105,147) (fatalities in USA due to COVID-19 at the time of writing), in addition to countries such as the UK (39,045), Italy (33,475), Brazil (29,937), France (28,833), Spain (27,940), and Mexico (10,167), which had recorded mortalities in excess of 10,000 prior to 2 June 2020 [

 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Widespread and random testing are effective methods to identify clusters of infections and mitigate the transmission patterns through follow-up and quarantine [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Re-testing cases during the isolation and post-quarantine is essential [
