<p>France recorded 152,091 and UK reported 276,332 COVID-19 cases until the same date [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The highest number of fatalities were counted in France between 31 March and 20 April 2020. UK registered a steady decline of COVID-19 related fatalities after 20 April 2020. According to Ilie et al., the mean serum vitamin D level of the French population is 60 nmol/L, which is higher than that for the populations of Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, UK, Italy, Germany, and Turkey, with 39, 42.5, 46, 47.4, 50, 50.1 and 51.8, respectively [

The COVID-19 case and mortality counts on the European continent reveal mixed results that do not depend on temperature, mean age, or mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, but on the preparedness of the health care system and suitable public health strategies.
