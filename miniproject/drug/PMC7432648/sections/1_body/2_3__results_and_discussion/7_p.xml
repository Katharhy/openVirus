<p>In most COVID-19 confirmed cases, symptoms such as fever, dry cough, fatigue, runny nose, or other upper respiratory symptoms appeared in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [

A precise diagnosis can be carried out by reverse real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) testing and radiological study of the cases [
