<p>The COVID-19 fatality numbers in Germany are almost double the number of fatalities in Turkey. The reason may be due to the higher median age in Germany [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The median age of the German population is the second highest after Japan [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The arrival of the pandemic in Turkey was more than one month later than in Germany. Both countries reacted after the first COVID-19 fatality with a partial lockdown and social distancing measures, and closure of workplaces, schools, and universities [
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The borders were closed for non-essential travel [
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Citizens stranded in other countries were repatriated and quarantined for two weeks. All border crossings were controlled and checked. Authorities started with widespread testing and followed-up on clusters and asymptomatic cases. Turkey started producing masks, effective personal protection equipment (PPE), and respirators to cope with demand inside and outside the country. According to the curves in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05616-f004">Figure 4</xref>, the peak of the pandemic is over for both countries. Both countries were well prepared to handle the pandemic due to well-developed health care systems and by taking the needed measures to control the spread of the virus. Italy and Spain have younger populations compared with Germany [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The median age in Germany is 47.8, while in Italy it is 46.6 and in Spain it is 43.9 [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, the mean serum vitamin D levels for the populations in Italy and Spain are similar to those of Germany [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These factors should have resulted in lower SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and better control of the outbreak. However, Italy and Spain were confronted with a massive outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020. Italy reported the first confirmed case in 31 January 2020 and the first fatality on 23 February 2020 [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Spain confirmed the first case on 1 February 2020 and the first fatality occurred almost one month later on 5 March 2020 [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Spain had recorded 239,638 cases and 27,940 fatal cases with a population of approximately 46,723,749 [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The number of COVID-19 cases in Italy was 233,197 with a population size of 60,431,283 and 33,475 fatalities until 2 June of 2020 (
