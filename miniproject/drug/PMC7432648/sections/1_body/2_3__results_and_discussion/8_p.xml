<p>The first confirmed COVID-19 case in Japan was announced on 15 January 2020, while South Korea had a confirmed case five days later [

 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The total number of fatalities in Japan on 2 June 2020 was 894 within a population of more than 126 million, and South Korea’s was 24 within more than 5 million [

Nonetheless, the factors relevant to this success should be discussed. The median age in Japan of 48.6 years is the highest globally, and could have led to the highest global fatality rates because of the higher susceptibility of elderly [

Both societies gained experience during the SARS outbreak, whereby they developed the habit of wearing masks, which prepared them for this pandemic. South Korea introduced a dynamic and quick response to the needs of the time. The measurements were implemented in harmony with the public through open information sharing and transparency, thus ensuring public support and collaboration [

 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. A drive-through screening system was used to support general widespread COVID-19 testing and all individuals were followed up via personal tracking [
 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. As a result, the pandemic was controlled without a complete lockdown in both countries mainly by widespread COVID-19 testing, individual tracking, and follow-up of clusters. Public support was essential through social distancing, wearing of masks, personal hygiene, transparency during the pandemic, collaboration to meet the needs of the market in mask production, and, most importantly, widespread COVID-19 testing with strict follow up mechanisms for clusters.
