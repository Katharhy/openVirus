<p>A coordinated effort to educate the population about the means of preventing transmission and infection in indoor and outdoor environments during a pandemic is crucial to avoid uncontrolled spread of the virus. Indoor and outdoor climate are related to each other and aggravate viral transmission under given conditions. Indoor environments can proliferate SARS-CoV-2 infection by raised viral loads through droplets and direct contact on infected surfaces more than an outdoor climate. This also confirms the spread of COVID-19 in household contacts and the need for indoor social distancing. According to Luo et al., pre-symptomatic cases within the household may transmit the virus rapidly [

Including dwelling modes in virus containment and control is essential, especially if nationwide closure and lockdowns are not imposed. In addition, a mask wearing strategy needs to be enforced in indoor and outdoor settings, especially in countries with a high population density. Wearing masks can reduce the airborne transmission by droplets and smaller particles, especially in indoor environments [

This mask-wearing strategy combined with social distancing, personal hygiene, cancellation of social gatherings, use of the home office, and school closures resulted in the effective control of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission compared to other neighboring countries [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The authors conclude that a mask-wearing strategy irrespective of COVID-19 symptoms mitigates infection of susceptible individuals [

 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The population readily embraced the recommended prevention methods and social distancing, together with restrictions on the borders, while cases and their surrounding contacts were successfully tracked, isolated, and quarantined [
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. According to the authors, these measures controlled the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak more efficiently and reduced socio-economic tensions without strict nationwide closure and lockdown during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to other countries [
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The measures also reduced the transmission of influenza in the month of February 2020 [
