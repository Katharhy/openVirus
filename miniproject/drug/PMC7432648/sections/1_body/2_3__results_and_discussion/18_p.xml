<p>China, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are among the countries that were able to control the COVID-19 outbreak by reducing infection numbers [

 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Nationwide closures, lockdowns, travel restrictions, personal hygiene, and social and workplace distancing may help to prevent infection. A modeling study from Singapore investigated the impact of control measures implemented to reduce the spread of COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The most effective method was a combination of isolating infected cases, strict quarantine, and closure of schools and workplaces [

 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The lockdown of educational establishments and offices (workplace distancing) paved the way for online solutions, which helped to education and work to continue from home. After the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the Korean government activated a 24/7 emergency response system to screen all travelers entering the country from that city [

 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The Taiwanese Centers of Disease Control (CDC) tested 2105 cases by February 28 using multiplex PCR analysis with FilmArray
 <sup>TM</sup> Respiratory Panel and confirmed 34 COVID-19 patients [

 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. According to Hsih et al., COVID-19 is more contagious than seasonal respiratory pathogens but infected cases have common clinical and laboratory results [
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Therefore, each suspected case needs close follow-up through individual tracking, gathering of mobility and contact data, isolation, and quarantine [
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Hsih et al. underline the elevated pandemic level of SARS-CoV-2 manifested by prolonged viral shedding, and the large number of asymptomatic and mild illness cases that remain undiscovered and continue to spread COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. They also note that some recovered patients still had detectable virus levels for almost two further weeks [
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Furthermore, some patients showed negative COVID-19 test results from their naso-oropharyngial system but positive results in their sputum or fecal specimens [
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The authors are concerned about possible SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the fecalâ€“oral route [
