<p>In this study, we analyze confirmed COVID-19 cases and fatalities in selected countries using the data on the worldwide geographical distribution of SARS-CoV-2 as of 2 June 2020 from the European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) website on 3 June 2020 [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For the first time, we highlight the situation in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) by discussing its national strategies and their impact on case count and mortality. Furthermore, we report the experiences of USA, Italy, and India as special cases. We compare several countries with similar population size in terms of COVID-19 case count and mortality. Sweden–Switzerland–Portugal, Germany–Turkey, and France–Spain are compared as examples of European countries. Latin America is represented by analysis of data from Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, and Mexico. South Korea and Japan were chosen as examples of Far Eastern countries with previous experience of SARS and efficient national strategies to combat COVID-19. We depict the results of the controversially discussed factors of average serum (25(OH)D) concentrations and median age, in addition to geographical factors of temperature and humidity. The outcomes of the analysis underline the importance of pre-existing conditions (health care system preparedness, median age, population size, population density, geographical conditions) and adequate public health strategies within a suitable time-frame. We comment on the effectiveness and problems of the implemented control mechanisms, including the general lockdown- and post-lockdown implications. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for the COVID-19 outbreak and future pandemics.
