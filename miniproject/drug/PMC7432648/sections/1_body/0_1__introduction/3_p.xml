<p>In this work, we analyzed the effectiveness and impact of national strategies and their impact on fatality rates by evaluating data of 17 countries until 2 June. We also investigated the public health strategies in the UAE, which has not been previously represented in the literature. We examined the relationship between pre-existing conditions, climate, population size, mean age, and level of SARS-CoV-2 control by implemented measures.</p>
