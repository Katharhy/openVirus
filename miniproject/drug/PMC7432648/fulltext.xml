Introduction</title><p>A novel coronavirus (CoV) was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. This highly contagious and previously unknown pathogen caused complications in the respiratory system and was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). WHO first declared the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a six public-health emergency of international concern, before subsequently declaring it a pandemic [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are enveloped, non-segmented, positive-sense, single-strand ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. HCoVs can infect animals and humans, causing respiratory, hepatic, and neurologic diseases [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. CoVs are divided into four genera: <italic>alpha-coronavirus</italic> (&#x003b1;), <italic>beta-coronavirus</italic> (&#x003b2;), <italic>gamma-coronavirus</italic> (&#x003b3;), and <italic>delta-coronavirus</italic> (&#x003b4;) [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Human coronaviruses were identified in late 1960 and are known to infect humans, other mammals, and birds. To date, six HCoVs have been categorized. In 2003, a virus was identified in Guangdong province in China causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Later, the virus was confirmed as a member of the beta-coronavirus family and was named SARS-CoV [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A decade later in 2012, two Saudi Arabian nationals were identified to be infected with another coronavirus. This virus belongs to the <italic>beta-coronavirus (&#x003b2;)</italic> family and was termed the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In 2019, a novel CoV caused the outbreak of a SARS-like illness in the animal market of the Chinese city of Wuhan and was termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [<xref rid="B7-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The source of origination and transmission are relevant factors for the development of preventive strategies and treatment protocols. SARS coronaviruses may have circulated in humans before causing the outbreak in 2003 [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> bats were identified as having anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, thus suggesting the bats were a source of the virus [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (2012) in Saudi Arabia is a beta-coronavirus originating from camels as the primary host [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, only bats were identified as key reservoirs [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. COVID-19 originated in Wuhan and was carried through migration by the population to different cities and other provinces around Hubei [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Infection rates increased rapidly and were controlled by a rapid and unprecedented lockdown of cities in the Hubei province followed by further control mechanisms for the whole country [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This unparalleled approach effectively prevented an exponential increase of infection on a national basis in China [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similar measurements were implemented by many other countries once cases started appearing within their borders. Enforcement methods and periods of implementation varied from country to country and delivered mixed results. Factors influencing transmission, disease progression, susceptibility, and virulence are surfacing slowly [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Park et al. studied clinical and demographic characteristics of 44,672 COVID-19 cases in China and noted that everyone without age limitation is susceptible [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The fatality rate is highest in elderly, immunocompromised individuals with comorbidities [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The mean or median incubation time of COVID-19 is less than 13 days and should perhaps be considered to be lower than 4&#x02013;6 days, similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV median incubation times of 4.4 and 5.5 days, respectively [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and infection may occur by respiratory droplets carrying the virus or through contact with infected surfaces (formites) and subsequently touching mouth, nose, and eyes [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Liao et al. reported that particles smaller than 1 &#x003bc;m remain in the air for an unknown time and particles larger than 5 &#x003bc;m settle within one hour [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Particles with sizes larger than 10 &#x003bc;m, also called droplets, settle much more quickly and cause infections through fomites [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, airborne transmission happens mainly via smaller particles. Fine particles smaller than 5 &#x003bc;m have the highest virulence factor because they remain in the air longer and can easily reach the lower respiratory tract [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Particles with a size larger than 5 &#x003bc;m can reach the upper respiratory tract [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Hou et al. showed that the nasal cavity is the first entry and proliferation point of airborne particles [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Accordingly, they argue, preventive measures such as wearing masks and using complementary therapeutic strategies on the nasal site may help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In this work, we analyzed the effectiveness and impact of national strategies and their impact on fatality rates by evaluating data of 17 countries until 2 June. We also investigated the public health strategies in the UAE, which has not been previously represented in the literature. We examined the relationship between pre-existing conditions, climate, population size, mean age, and level of SARS-CoV-2 control by implemented measures.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-ijerph-17-05616"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><p>In this study, we analyze confirmed COVID-19 cases and fatalities in selected countries using the data on the worldwide geographical distribution of SARS-CoV-2 as of 2 June 2020 from the European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) website on 3 June 2020 [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For the first time, we highlight the situation in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) by discussing its national strategies and their impact on case count and mortality. Furthermore, we report the experiences of USA, Italy, and India as special cases. We compare several countries with similar population size in terms of COVID-19 case count and mortality. Sweden&#x02013;Switzerland&#x02013;Portugal, Germany&#x02013;Turkey, and France&#x02013;Spain are compared as examples of European countries. Latin America is represented by analysis of data from Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, and Mexico. South Korea and Japan were chosen as examples of Far Eastern countries with previous experience of SARS and efficient national strategies to combat COVID-19. We depict the results of the controversially discussed factors of average serum (25(OH)D) concentrations and median age, in addition to geographical factors of temperature and humidity. The outcomes of the analysis underline the importance of pre-existing conditions (health care system preparedness, median age, population size, population density, geographical conditions) and adequate public health strategies within a suitable time-frame. We comment on the effectiveness and problems of the implemented control mechanisms, including the general lockdown- and post-lockdown implications. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for the COVID-19 outbreak and future pandemics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3-ijerph-17-05616"><title>3. Results and Discussion</title><p>Progression of CoV to severe pneumonia is directly related to advanced age, history of metabolic syndrome, smoking, and other chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Countries with a high percentage of advanced age and high population density in urban areas need to impose swiftly efficient measurements to reduce fatalities [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Primc et al. analyzed the public health measures of European countries during the pandemic [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. They concluded that qualitative development of the health care system and improving protective health conditions such as serum (25(OH)D) concentrations may be important for the control of COVID-19 [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To investigate the importance of serum vitamin D levels, median age, temperature, and humidity we compare infection control measures and their impact on COVID-19-related fatalities in Portugal, Sweden, and Switzerland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05616-f001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05616-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows the highest fatality numbers in Sweden, followed by Switzerland and then Portugal. Sweden is one of the few European countries refraining from nationwide closures and lockdown [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This, in combination with a lack of clear recommendations for the public in how to prevent viral spread, especially in indoor environments, may have aggravated SARS-CoV-2 spread in Sweden.</p><p>Primc et al. reported a possible relationship between low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations and susceptibility to COVID-19 [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in the northern hemisphere due to reduced solar irradiation especially in the winter months [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The infection rates of COVID-19, which started in the month of December 2019, are now showing exponential growth in Northern Hemisphere countries, [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. According to a recent review by Grant et al., 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations may play a relevant role in the progression of COVID-19 [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Sufficient plasma (25(OH)D) concentrations around 75 nmol/L ensure cellular immunity, decrease the risk of infections caused by microorganisms, and protect against metabolic syndrome and other chronic illnesses [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Severe vitamin D deficiency is defined as serum 25(OH) D levels lower than 30 nmol/L [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Factors such as screen-based entertainment, sedentary lifestyle, and less outdoor physical activity are directly related to poor endogenous vitamin D synthesis [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Higher susceptibility of advanced age individuals to COVID-19 may confirm this hypothesis. Commonly, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are less than 30 nmol/L in elderly individuals and geriatric patients due to indoor dwelling, physical inactivity, and increased pharmaceutical drugs intake, especially in the winter [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Sufficient serum vitamin D levels above 70 nmol/L may have a positive impact on recovery rate and survival of patients during illness [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Ilie et al. associated mean serum vitamin D levels in elderly populations of European countries with COVID-19 infection and mortality [<xref rid="B27-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. They compared the mean serum vitamin D levels for the populations in Portugal (39 nmol/L), Spain (42.5 nmol/L), Switzerland (46 nmol/L), UK (47.4 nmol/L), Italy (50 nmol/L), Germany (50.1 nmol/L), Turkey (51.8 nmol/L), France (60 nmol/L), Sweden (73.5 nmol/L), and other countries [<xref rid="B27-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Portugal has the smallest, Switzerland represents the average, and Sweden the highest mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and similar population sizes of 10,281,762, 8,516,543, and 10,183,175, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05616-f001">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B27-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The highest number of fatalities is in Sweden, followed by Switzerland, and then Portugal, although the opposite trend was expected due to mean serum vitamin D levels and population number. We can conclude that mean plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels have no direct impact on fatality rates and remain controversial in their relation to COVID-19. The results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05616-f001">Figure 1</xref> show that the highest COVID-19-related mortality was in Sweden, followed by Switzerland and Portugal with median ages of 41.1, 42.7, and 44.6, respectively [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, we also can conclude from our analysis that median age is not a sufficient variable to predict fatality.</p><p>According to Scafetta, temperature and relative humidity have an impact on viral transmission [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Temperatures from 4 to 12 &#x000b0;C and relative humidity of 60&#x02013;80% with gentle wind speeds increase the susceptibility to respiratory tract infections and the spread of SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Our analysis reveals that temperature and relative humidity are not the only factors with direct impact on fatality rates. The first fatal cases were announced in each of the three countries in March, while the first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported in Portugal, Switzerland, and Sweden on 3 March, 26 February, and 1 February 2020, respectively [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The average temperature in March 2020 was the highest in Portugal at 12.4 &#x000b0;C, followed by Switzerland with 2.2 &#x000b0;C, and the lowest was Sweden with &#x02212;3.3 &#x000b0;C [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The lowest relative humidity was recorded in Portugal with 70%, Switzerland&#x02019;s was 73%, and the highest was in Sweden with 88% [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. According to these numbers, the spread of COVID-19 should be higher in Portugal, but again it was Sweden. An explanation for the higher fatality in Sweden is the cold weather itself. The virus cannot survive for long outside in the cold, but spreads easily because people remain indoors [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Indoor air is more suitable for the spread of SARS-CoV-2, especially due to close contact of people in unventilated, closed rooms without UV irradiation [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>A coordinated effort to educate the population about the means of preventing transmission and infection in indoor and outdoor environments during a pandemic is crucial to avoid uncontrolled spread of the virus. Indoor and outdoor climate are related to each other and aggravate viral transmission under given conditions. Indoor environments can proliferate SARS-CoV-2 infection by raised viral loads through droplets and direct contact on infected surfaces more than an outdoor climate. This also confirms the spread of COVID-19 in household contacts and the need for indoor social distancing. According to Luo et al., pre-symptomatic cases within the household may transmit the virus rapidly [<xref rid="B28-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Especially vulnerable and high-risk individuals are at risk of being infected. Luo et al. concluded in their prospective cohort study that the risk of transmitting COVID-19 is highest in household contacts [<xref rid="B28-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Public health strategies need to include habitancy and dwelling patterns in relation to climate in measures to control outbreaks. Including dwelling modes in virus containment and control is essential, especially if nationwide closure and lockdowns are not imposed. In addition, a mask wearing strategy needs to be enforced in indoor and outdoor settings, especially in countries with a high population density. Wearing masks can reduce the airborne transmission by droplets and smaller particles, especially in indoor environments [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A study compared community-wide mask compliance in relation to the number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases/fatalities in Hong Kong, Singapore, and other countries [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Singapore has the second highest population density in the world, directly followed by Hong Kong [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Due to their previous experience with the SARS virus in 2003, 97% of the studied population in Hong Kong began using masks when the first COVID-19 confirmed case emerged [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This mask-wearing strategy combined with social distancing, personal hygiene, cancellation of social gatherings, use of the home office, and school closures resulted in the effective control of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission compared to other neighboring countries [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The authors conclude that a mask-wearing strategy irrespective of COVID-19 symptoms mitigates infection of susceptible individuals [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Another study from Cowling et al. analyzed data from 60 general outpatient clinics and three cross-sectional surveys in Hong Kong [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. They findings indicate that rapidly implemented public health measures and the compliance of the population mitigated the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Hong Kong [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The population readily embraced the recommended prevention methods and social distancing, together with restrictions on the borders, while cases and their surrounding contacts were successfully tracked, isolated, and quarantined [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. According to the authors, these measures controlled the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak more efficiently and reduced socio-economic tensions without strict nationwide closure and lockdown during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to other countries [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

Deng et al. compared the characteristics of the fatality group of patients with those of the recovered group [<xref rid="B31-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Advanced age, dyspnea, comorbidities, low oxygen saturation, high white blood cell (WBC) count, low lymphocytes, and high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) are significant indicators of mortality [<xref rid="B31-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Giang et al. directly related people aged 65 and above with death rates [<xref rid="B32-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. They found that the measures of social distancing, lockdown, quarantine, and a high-quality health care system with appropriate numbers of health care workers and emergency rooms helped to decrease fatality rates [<xref rid="B33-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The quality and preparedness of the health care system in a country defines the thin line between survival and death.</p><p>In most COVID-19 confirmed cases, symptoms such as fever, dry cough, fatigue, runny nose, or other upper respiratory symptoms appeared in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [<xref rid="B34-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Distinguishing COVID-19 from other known respiratory tract viruses clinically is a difficult task due to its non-specificity. A precise diagnosis can be carried out by reverse real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) testing and radiological study of the cases [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B39-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Fast and reliable methods of COVID-19 testing can be life-saving tools to eradicate the virus in Far Eastern countries. To validate this thesis, we compared the fatality numbers in South Korea and Japan during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05616-f002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The first confirmed COVID-19 case in Japan was announced on 15 January 2020, while South Korea had a confirmed case five days later [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The first fatality in Japan occurred on 13 February 2020, while South Korea&#x02019;s first COVID-19 fatality occurred on 21 February [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The total number of fatalities in Japan on 2 June 2020 was 894 within a population of more than 126 million, and South Korea&#x02019;s was 24 within more than 5 million [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The low fatality rate in both countries indicates excellent pandemic control. Nonetheless, the factors relevant to this success should be discussed. The median age in Japan of 48.6 years is the highest globally, and could have led to the highest global fatality rates because of the higher susceptibility of elderly [<xref rid="B28-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The number of deaths is low compared to Mexico with a similarly sized population (&#x0003e;126 million) and 10,167 fatalities until 2 June 2020 [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The median age in South Korea is 43.2 [<xref rid="B28-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Both South Korean and Japan adopted early intervention strategies to control the viral spread with measures of social distancing and widespread COVID-19 testing, combined with strict follow-up of clusters of infections [<xref rid="B43-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Both societies gained experience during the SARS outbreak, whereby they developed the habit of wearing masks, which prepared them for this pandemic. South Korea introduced a dynamic and quick response to the needs of the time. The measurements were implemented in harmony with the public through open information sharing and transparency, thus ensuring public support and collaboration [<xref rid="B43-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. These joint efforts orchestrated a supply of masks, their distribution, and smart use [<xref rid="B43-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. A drive-through screening system was used to support general widespread COVID-19 testing and all individuals were followed up via personal tracking [<xref rid="B44-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. As a result, the pandemic was controlled without a complete lockdown in both countries mainly by widespread COVID-19 testing, individual tracking, and follow-up of clusters. Public support was essential through social distancing, wearing of masks, personal hygiene, transparency during the pandemic, collaboration to meet the needs of the market in mask production, and, most importantly, widespread COVID-19 testing with strict follow up mechanisms for clusters.</p><p>Many countries responded with different control mechanisms compared to the experiences of China, South Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B44-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Highly industrialized, European countries were expected to best cope with the pandemic due to their level of sustainable development. To verify this thesis, we analyzed the data of selected European countries and grouped them according to their population size and/or number of fatalities [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Germany (population 2018: 82,927,922) and Turkey (population 2018: 82,319,724) faced their first reported COVID-19 case on 28 January 2020 and 12 March 2020, respectively [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Until 2 June 2020, the number of confirmed cases in Germany was 182,028, while Turkey had 164,769 cases. Germany had reported a total number of 8522 fatalities, while Turkey recorded 4563 fatal cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05616-f003">Figure 3</xref>) [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The COVID-19 fatality numbers in Germany are almost double the number of fatalities in Turkey. The reason may be due to the higher median age in Germany [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The median age of the German population is the second highest after Japan [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The arrival of the pandemic in Turkey was more than one month later than in Germany. Both countries reacted after the first COVID-19 fatality with a partial lockdown and social distancing measures, and closure of workplaces, schools, and universities [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The borders were closed for non-essential travel [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Citizens stranded in other countries were repatriated and quarantined for two weeks. All border crossings were controlled and checked. Authorities started with widespread testing and followed-up on clusters and asymptomatic cases. Turkey started producing masks, effective personal protection equipment (PPE), and respirators to cope with demand inside and outside the country. According to the curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05616-f004">Figure 4</xref>, the peak of the pandemic is over for both countries. Both countries were well prepared to handle the pandemic due to well-developed health care systems and by taking the needed measures to control the spread of the virus. Italy and Spain have younger populations compared with Germany [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The median age in Germany is 47.8, while in Italy it is 46.6 and in Spain it is 43.9 [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, the mean serum vitamin D levels for the populations in Italy and Spain are similar to those of Germany [<xref rid="B27-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These factors should have resulted in lower SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and better control of the outbreak. However, Italy and Spain were confronted with a massive outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020. Italy reported the first confirmed case in 31 January 2020 and the first fatality on 23 February 2020 [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Spain confirmed the first case on 1 February 2020 and the first fatality occurred almost one month later on 5 March 2020 [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Spain had recorded 239,638 cases and 27,940 fatal cases with a population of approximately 46,723,749 [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The number of COVID-19 cases in Italy was 233,197 with a population size of 60,431,283 and 33,475 fatalities until 2 June of 2020 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05616-f004">Figure 4</xref>) [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The highest fatalities were recorded towards the end of March in Italy, while the number of confirmed cases started to decline 10 days earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05616-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Widespread COVID-19 testing was initiated in the beginning of March with a delay of one month after the first confirmed case. Both curves descended slowly towards 2 June 2020 which indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was under control prior to the summer months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05616-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The delay of widespread COVID-19 testing for one month aggravated the pandemic in Italy. Due to this delay, the implemented state of emergency, nationwide closures, lockdown, and further measures did not effectively control the spread of the virus. In addition, lower median age and similar serum vitamin D levels compared to Germany did not have any positive impact on the COVID-19 disease course and did not reduce fatality numbers in Italy.</p><p>France and the United Kingdom (UK) were also severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Both countries have around 67 million inhabitants [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The total number of fatalities in France was 28,833 and in the UK 39,045 until 2 June 2020 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05616-f005">Figure 5</xref>) [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>France recorded 152,091 and UK reported 276,332 COVID-19 cases until the same date [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The highest number of fatalities were counted in France between 31 March and 20 April 2020. UK registered a steady decline of COVID-19 related fatalities after 20 April 2020. According to Ilie et al., the mean serum vitamin D level of the French population is 60 nmol/L, which is higher than that for the populations of Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, UK, Italy, Germany, and Turkey, with 39, 42.5, 46, 47.4, 50, 50.1 and 51.8, respectively [<xref rid="B27-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As a result, low serum vitamin D levels have no direct impact on COVID-19 fatality rates. The COVID-19 case and mortality counts on the European continent reveal mixed results that do not depend on temperature, mean age, or mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, but on the preparedness of the health care system and suitable public health strategies.</p><p>The next epicenter evolved on the American continent. The first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the United States of America (USA) was reported on 21 January 2020 one day after that of South Korea [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The fatality rate on 10 April 2020 was 2% for South Korea and 3.6% in the USA [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. South Korea, due to its previous SARS experience, reacted swiftly with sophisticated, new measures including transparent, community-supported policies and widespread COVID-19 testing with strict individual follow-up tracking mechanisms of clusters of transmission [<xref rid="B43-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The USA had recorded 105,147 total COVID-19-related fatalities and 1,811,277 confirmed cases as at 2 June 2020 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05616-f006">Figure 6</xref>) [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05616-f006">Figure 6</xref>a shows a sharp increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases after 17 March 2020.</p><p>The fatality curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05616-f006">Figure 6</xref>b shows a peak on 15 April 2020. Thereafter, a steady decline in fatality numbers was reported. This curve may indicate that the worst of the outbreak in the USA is over and the peak lasted for around one month after the first reported case of COVID-19 on 17 March 2020. The US started to test for COVID-19 one month after this first confirmed case [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This delay of testing caused a rapid viral spread through the population because the infected cases were not identified and followed-up [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The unexpected mass of severe cases strained the unprepared health care system. Other compounding factors, such as a lack of drugs, treatment protocols, or vaccines resulted in a health disaster for the USA (105,147) (fatalities in USA due to COVID-19 at the time of writing), in addition to countries such as the UK (39,045), Italy (33,475), Brazil (29,937), France (28,833), Spain (27,940), and Mexico (10,167), which had recorded mortalities in excess of 10,000 prior to 2 June 2020 [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Asymptomatic cases are a leading cause of the viral outbreak [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Widespread and random testing are effective methods to identify clusters of infections and mitigate the transmission patterns through follow-up and quarantine [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Re-testing cases during the isolation and post-quarantine is essential [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>The first COVID-19 case in Latin America was reported on 26 February 2020 [<xref rid="B47-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].

The arrival of further epidemics such as measles and malaria may exacerbate the burden on the already depleted health care system in Latin America [<xref rid="B47-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The situation in South America is far from resolved and could develop into the worst COVID-19 outbreak this year.</p><p>China, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are among the countries that were able to control the COVID-19 outbreak by reducing infection numbers [<xref rid="B41-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B48-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].

Education continued without disruption through online teaching after the spring break and is expected to remain distance-learning-based until the end of the educational year in summer 2020 [<xref rid="B53-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Remote working was adopted by most institutions of the federal and local governments in the UAE to protect employees and customers. The pre-existing advanced technological infrastructure of the UAE enabled remote working and online meetings throughout the educational and public sectors [<xref rid="B53-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Numerous apps, such as ALHOSN UAE, were created to track cases and advise the population [<xref rid="B53-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Offices and malls briefly closed and reopened towards the end of May 2020 with strict control measures to prevent COVID-19 spread. The closure of all shopping malls, with the exception of pharmacies, food retail outlets, cooperative societies, grocery stores, and supermarkets, was announced on 25 March 2020 [<xref rid="B53-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Children below 12 years and individuals above 60 years were not permitted to enter malls and outlets [<xref rid="B53-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Everyone entering any facility is required to wear surgical masks and gloves, and is screened for symptoms of fever. Disinfectant dispensers are widely distributed in all buildings. Most institutions, such as Ajman University in Ajman, UAE, contributed unreservedly to the campaign by disseminating the recommendations and applying the necessary measures in a timely manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05616-f009">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>The COVID-19 outbreak is currently under control in the UAE: the number fatalities is low and shows a downward trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05616-f008">Figure 8</xref>). The health care system was rapidly supported and prepared for a mass outbreak. Steadily rising temperatures from April 2020 and high relative humidity did not prevent COVID-19 from spreading. The curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05616-f008">Figure 8</xref>b peaks on 12 May 2020 in terms of the number of fatalities, while in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05616-f008">Figure 8</xref>a the peak for confirmed cases appears around 10 days later [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Increasing UV irradiation, temperature, and relative humidity may have been supportive factors in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the UAE.</p><p>The influence of hot weather and increasing humidity in the coming months should be questioned. The virus cannot be inactivated solely by high temperatures, and can survive in the human body [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The outdoor climate is highly interconnected with the indoor climate and human dwelling patterns. With the steady rise of temperatures above 45 &#x000b0;C and high humidity, indoor environments should be included in thinking about the virus. When the pandemic began at the end of February, the temperature was suitable for outdoor activities. In very hot climates, people gather in indoor environments. The summer months are marked by indoor dwelling, and spending time in air-conditioned closed apartments, offices, buildings, and shopping malls. The indoor environment in summer may cause aggravated SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns and an increase in COVID-19 cases and fatalities. New waves of infection can only be prevented by continuing the community-wide, strict measures of social distancing, personal hygiene, wearing of surgical masks and gloves, nationwide testing, and individual tracking of clusters and their contacts. Equatorial countries may witness an increase in cases and/or fatalities during the coming months. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the summer months can be prevented by adding new strategies to the existing measures. Our recommendation for countries with hot climates in summer is to prevent an influx of cases from other countries and to control indoor environments. The latter can be achieved via sufficient ventilation several times a day, continued strict disinfection protocols using antimicrobial agents/disinfectants for surfaces, and use of humidifiers equipped with essential oils and/or antimicrobial plant extracts. Split air conditioning systems may be better than central systems. These air conditioning systems need to be regularly cleaned and maintained. Sterilization of indoor environments may be possible using UV lamps as an alternative. These measures may inactivate the virus and reduce the number of viral droplets in indoor air. The temperature in closed rooms may not reach 4&#x02013;12 degrees Celsius, but virus-loaded droplets can easily infect anyone in the vicinity by entering the naso-pharyngial tract or the eyes if the viral density in the air is high, or through contact transmission by fomites [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, airborne transmission is a controversial issue, which depends on climatic pre-existing conditions (indoor/outdoor environments) and needs a case-by-case approach when public health measures are to be implemented. According to Cheng et al., a community-wide mask-wearing strategy may decrease the shedding of respiratory droplets or saliva from symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 cases [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Pecho-Silva et al. indicate that airborne transmission can occur due to floating viral droplets suspended in the air [<xref rid="B54-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. They suggest that droplet nuclei may be only produced by specific medical treatment protocols such as intubation and nebulization [<xref rid="B54-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Stadnytskyi et al. reported that SARS-CoV-2-loaded droplet nuclei can be transmitted from an asymptomatic case while speaking in a closed room with stagnant air [<xref rid="B55-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>As a result, transmission by fomites and direct inhalation of droplets in indoor environments is a serious problem in closed, unventilated, and crowded rooms with very poor air exchange. Although the issue remains controversial, strict guidelines should be followed to prevent viral infections until further research emerges. India implemented strict nationwide lockdowns to address the problem of viral transmission; however, by keeping the population indoors it may have created precisely these unventilated, crowded room scenarios that can lead to a high number of cases and fatalities.</p><p>The Indian government reacted rapidly with very strict nationwide closures and a complete lockdown, and prevented an uncontrolled SARS-CoV-2 outbreak from March to June 2020 [<xref rid="B56-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The first fatality in India was recorded on 13 March 2020 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05616-f010">Figure 10</xref>) [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The first COVID-19 case appeared with a delay of more than one month on 30 January 2020 [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The total number of confirmed cases for India was 198,706 within a population of around 1.4 billion [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A total of 5598 fatal cases were reported until 2 June 2020 [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The COVID-19 outbreak was controlled firmly until beginning of April 2020, however, incidence thereafter began to increase. The curve currently shows an upward trend in fatalities and a peak is not yet visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-05616-f010">Figure 10</xref>. A lack of awareness and a relaxed attitude has resulted in an increase in COVID-19 cases and fatalities [<xref rid="B56-ijerph-17-05616" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The situation in India is far from over and strict regulations should continue, paired with mask-wearing strategies, nationwide testing, and control of overcrowded indoor environments.</p><p>We collected and analyzed the implemented public health measures during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Different countries implemented various measures and experienced differing results during the COVID-19 pandemic (<xref rid="ijerph-17-05616-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4-ijerph-17-05616"><title>4. Conclusion and Recommendations</title><p>A lack of preparedness for the sudden onset of COVID-19 by governments and health care systems, combined with inadequate public health strategies and deficiencies in diagnostic mechanisms, treatment options, and management protocols, aggravated the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 globally. There has been a direct impact of public health strategies on case count and mortality. Far Eastern countries with experience of the SARS outbreak controlled the pandemic with the lowest number of COVID-19 fatalities. COVID-19 case and mortality counts in Europe are not directly dependent on temperature, mean age, or mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, but on preparedness of countries&#x02019; health care systems and adequate public health strategies.</p><p>Infection control measures in indoor environments are essential in viral transmission prevention and need to be taken into consideration. Indoor environments are interconnected with climatic conditions. Indoor climates are crucial to the control of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Development of health care systems by increasing the number of hospitals, critical care units, and health care personnel are also key factors, and are particularly needed for the protection of the vulnerable and elderly population. The preparedness of the health care system includes stockpiles of appropriate and effective personal protection equipment (PPE), fast and reliable testing methods, and cluster and individual tracking of cases and their contacts. Recommendations of social distancing, personal hygiene, avoiding of gatherings, and mask wearing must be strictly followed even in indoor environments and household settings, particularly for the protection of those aged over 65 years. Further COVID-19 outbreaks may be expected due to new waves and mutations of the virus. Rapidly implemented, transparent region-specific public health strategies and community-wide compliance are essential during the COVID pandemic and the post-lockdown period. Increased health literacy in the population can improve the management and control of further global pandemics.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are thankful to the Ajman University Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) department, Ajman UAE, for providing us with the figure &#x0201c;Follow Safety Measures on Campus&#x0201d; and Ms. Fariyal S.
