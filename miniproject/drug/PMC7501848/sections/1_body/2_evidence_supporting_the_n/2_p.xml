<p id="p0140">In research carried out by Wang etÂ al. in 2004, has shown that RNA interference (RNAi) activators are effective against SARS-CoV on Vero cells by inhibiting the replication of SARS-CoV [

 <xref rid="bib125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. It was found that only two of them efficiently blocked the viral replication in Vero cells by targeting the RNA polymerase, thus suggesting that anti-SARS agents could have developed by using the siRNA [

 <xref rid="bib127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. HCoV-NL63 S glycoprotein, a viral entry protein, was found to be the target site of designed siRNA. In virus-infected cells, these designed siRNAs significantly inhibited the infection [

In order to ensure its activity, in vitro cleavage reactions were performed using the synthesized ribozyme. The results suggested that ribozymes (Rz) were found to be useful in inhibiting viral replication up to 60% by using chimeric DNA-RNA hammerhead ribozyme. 3T3 cells (fibroblast cell line) transfected with a recombinant plasmid when targeted using chimeric construct significantly reduced the expression of SARS-CoV RNA. Thus found to be a potent and feasible treatment option for SARS [
