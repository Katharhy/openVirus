<p id="p0145">In the mice models and Vero E6 cell line, Dz has been reported to inhibit the replication of several viruses like the influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV by specifically targeting the vitals genes which are responsible for replication of these viruses [
 <xref rid="bib108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. It has been reported that a mono Dz-104 possessing 10–23 catalytic motifs targeted 5′ untranslated regions (UTR) which are highly conserved in the SARS-CoV genome and thereby suppressed SARS-CoV replication in Vero E6 cell line [
 <xref rid="bib130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. In the above study, the Vero E6 cell was co-transfected with p5′UTR-eGFP along with the various concentration of Dz and incubated for 12 h (hr) in the presence of lipofectamine plus. The effect of the varying concentration of Dz was observed by fluorescence microscopy by using the eGFP fluorescence [

Ahn et al. evaluated cells transfected with SARS-CoV replicon, showed significant suppression of SARS-CoV replication upon treating with peptide nucleic acid (PNA) (50% inhibitory concentration of 4.4 μM) fused with cell penetrating-peptide. The antiviral effects of antisense peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) were used to targeting a highly conserved RNA sequence on the programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting (– PRF) signal in the SARS-CoV virus. The PNA that was bound to the specific sequence at the pseudoknot structure in the −1 PRF signal and thereby inhibited the ribosomal frameshift [
