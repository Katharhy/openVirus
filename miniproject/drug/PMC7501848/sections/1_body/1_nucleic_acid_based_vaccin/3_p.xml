<p id="p0055">The nucleic acid-based vaccination technologies involve the use of RNA (mRNA) [
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] or plasmid DNA, which encodes for antigen. These antigens encoded by the nucleic acid can trigger humoral as well as cell-mediated immune responses upon their expression after cellular uptake [
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The nucleic acid-based vaccination technology is considered versatile and flexible as it allows easy maneuvering and manipulation of the antigen. The advantage of producing antigens in the target cells is that it imitates the protein synthesis during the infection as the protein remains localized in the plasma membrane, and protein modification processes like glycosylation can occur with great extents of fidelity [
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Notably, they assist the delivery of an antigen of choice, irrespective of whether it was originated from a bacteria, parasite, or virus, thus facilitating the development of vaccines against a wide range of pathogens [
