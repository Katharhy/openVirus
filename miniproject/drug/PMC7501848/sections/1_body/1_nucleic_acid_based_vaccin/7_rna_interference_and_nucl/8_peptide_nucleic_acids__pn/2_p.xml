<p id="p0135">In 1991, PNAs was first time introduced by Nelson et, al as a molecular biology tool [
 <xref rid="bib121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. It is an artificial imitator of DNA in which the phosphate backbone is swapped with pseudo peptide polymers linked with nucleic acid bases as a side chain [
 <xref rid="bib122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. The polypeptide backbone is mainly made up of N-(2-aminoethyl) glycine which is linked with nitrogenous bases of nucleic acids through methyl carbonyl linker [

 <xref rid="bib123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Lack of phosphate backbones makes PNAs chargeless which enhances the specificity, stability and higher affinity of PNAs towards DNA/RNA without causing any repulsion, unlike other nucleic acid hybridization methods [

 <xref rid="bib124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Since, PNAs have a high affinity towards binding DNA or mRNA thereby it regulates the targeted gene expression at the level of transcription and translation [
