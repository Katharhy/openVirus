<p id="p0120">Deoxyribozyme (Dz) or DNA enzyme are synthetic single-stranded DNA particles that have the potential ability to recognize and cut the particular mRNA molecule at a specific position [
 <xref rid="bib108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Dz contains one catalytic domain flanked by two variable arms which are complementary to the targeted mRNA. When both arms of Dz bind with the complementary targeted mRNA sequences according to Watson and Crick pairing, catalytic domain help to cleave the targeted mRNA sequences [
 <xref rid="bib108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. They are essentially the analogs of ribozymes [
 <xref rid="bib109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. In ribozymes, the ribonucleotide motifs essential for catalytic activity are often biologically unstable. To overcome this, in DNAzymes, these motifs are replaced with stable DNA molecule. This provides enhanced biological stability and more synthetic options in producing modified DNAzymes [
