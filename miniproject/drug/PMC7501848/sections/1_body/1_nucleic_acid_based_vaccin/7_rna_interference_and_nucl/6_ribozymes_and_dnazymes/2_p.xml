<p id="p0115">Several essential biological processes, such as the replication of RNA genome, RNA processing, RNA silencing, and peptide bond formation during translation has been described by the chemical catalysis of RNA [
 <xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Thus, RNA molecules with catalytic activities can be referred to as ribozymes [

 <xref rid="bib103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. RNA-RNA interaction between the ribozymes and its substrate molecules determines the highly sequence-specific reactions catalyzed by ribozymes [
 <xref rid="bib105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Thus, the capacity of ribozymes to inactivate other RNA molecules in a specific manner has encouraged its use as a potential gene suppressor and promising molecular tools with various applications [
 <xref rid="bib105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. In order to cleave substrate mRNA in a sequence-specific manner, nucleic acid enzymes like ribozymes or deoxyribozymes are used [
 <xref rid="bib106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. This results in a specific blockage of expression of detrimental genes. In lower eukaryotes, some bacteria and viruses, several ribozymes promoting the intermolecular splicing, or catalyzing the cleavage reaction have been found (Reference) [
