<p id="p0105">Research on viruses like adenovirus or HIV resulted in the discovery of a new class of small RNAs, in the 1980s, called aptamers [
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. These are short oligonucleotides (RNA or DNA) that specifically recognize and bind to the target sites, with a unique 3-D structure. It can be used as a targeting moiety for drug delivery or as inhibitors of protein function [
 <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. These molecules were first described as the TAR-aptamer (trans-activation response), a virus-encoded transcript in HIV-1 [
 <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. The TAR aptamer was found to bind with the Trans-Activator of Transcription (Tat) protein of the virus [
 <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. It was revealed that the complex formation of this aptamer inhibited the function of Tat protein, which was essential for viral replication as well as regulation of gene expression of both cellular and viral gene [
 <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. The binding of aptamers to their respective target is highly specified, and the order of affinity for the target site is similar to that of the monoclonal antibodies [
 <xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Most of the therapies involving the use of oligonucleotides destroy the mRNA by targeting the translational machinery of the cell, whereas, aptamers directly target the proteins and transform or alter their function by binding to them [
 <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>].
