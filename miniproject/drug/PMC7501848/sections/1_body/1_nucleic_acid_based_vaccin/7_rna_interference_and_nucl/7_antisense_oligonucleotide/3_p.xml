 <xref rid="bib119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Zamecnik and Stephenson discovered the prospective of oligonucleotides to function as antisense agents that hinder the replication of viruses in cell culture [
 <xref rid="bib120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Around 15–20 nucleotides are present in these oligonucleotides, which are complementary to their target mRNA. This strategy can play a crucial role in the field of drug discovery. Usually, ASOs are developed in order to activate RNAase H that further cleaves the RNA moiety of an RNA-DNA heteroduplex and results in degradation of the target. Another mechanism by which this antisense technology works is by restricting the binding of either the ribosome or the polymerase to the 5′ terminus of the target sequence, thus inhibiting the translation by preventing the congregation of the target machinery.
