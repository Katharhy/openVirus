<p id="p0065">Incorporation of a eukaryotic expression cassette that encodes for single or multiple antigens of interest into a bacterial plasmid leads to the generation of DNA vaccines. The plasmid backbone is comprised of the origin of replication and the sequences for antibiotic resistance genes which is used as a selection marker. Mostly, these selectable markers include antibiotic resistance genes against antibiotics like kanamycin [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. DoggyboneTM (covalently closed linear DNA construct) [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and Minicircle DNA [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], comprised of the gene expressing cassette devoid of the backbone of bacterial plasmid DNA. Several studies have reported that bacterial backbone resulted in a lower level of reporter transgene expression compared with mice receiving the expression cassette alone [
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The difference in the expression level may be due to the formation of large random concatamers and smaller circles by the linear DNA than the closed-circular DNA (ccDNA) which remained as circular structures [
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. It was hypothesized that the low expression of the transgene is due to the inhibition resulted by the covalent attachment of the bacterial backbone to the expression cassette [
