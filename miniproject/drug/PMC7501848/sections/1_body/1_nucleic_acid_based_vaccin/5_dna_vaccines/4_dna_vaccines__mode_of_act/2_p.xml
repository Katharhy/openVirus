<p id="p0075">Several studies suggest that DNA vaccines induce both cellular and humoral immune responses via the activation of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> helper T-cells and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cytotoxic cells [
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. DNA vaccines are recognized by various immune receptors upon their entry inside the cell [
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Previous experimental studies involving the ID administration of DNA coated gold particles suggested transfection in keratinocytes as well as in the professional antigen-presenting cells, i.e., Langerhans cells. The MHC class I and class II-restricted recognition of antigen by CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cytotoxic and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> helper T-cells was explained via this transfection [
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The intramuscular administration of DNA vectors, however, resulted in the transfection in myocytes [
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The function of APCs derived from bone marrow, in the activation of MHC class I restricted CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cells upon DNA vaccination, has been well documented by several studies [
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Cross-priming and presentation of both MHC class I and class II-restricted antigens by profession APCs upon phagocytization of transfected somatic cells is the most probable mechanism of action in the case of DNA vaccination [
