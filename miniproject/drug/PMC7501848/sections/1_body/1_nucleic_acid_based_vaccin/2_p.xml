<p id="p0050">Although lots of efforts are being put into research and development of DNA or RNA vaccine over the past few years, currently it has not been perfected enough to be used in humans [

 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Improvements in the DNA and RNA vaccine development strategy might turn out to be very crucial, keeping in view the increased frequency of epidemics, also efficient development of the vaccine may prevent infections caused by highly transmittable pathogens. Since synthetic DNA and RNA are easier to construct, therefore, DNA and RNA based approach could provide for more quick development of vaccines [
