 <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT04283461" id="intref0020" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">NCT04283461</ext-link>), are in phase-1 and phase 1/phase 2 of the clinical trials respectively and are showing promising effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection. These vaccines are targeting the spike (S) protein of novel coronavirus, which plays a promising role in the binding of the virus to the hACE2 receptors. Another RNA vaccine under the title “Study to Describe the Safety, Tolerability, Immunogenicity, and Potential Efficacy of RNA Vaccine Candidates Against COVID-19 in Healthy Adults” (trial identification number: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT04368728" id="intref0025" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">NCT04368728</ext-link>) is in phase 1/phase 2 of the clinical trial (
