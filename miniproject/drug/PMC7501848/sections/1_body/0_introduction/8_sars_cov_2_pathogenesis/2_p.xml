<p id="p0040">The entry of virus particles inside the host cells determines the viral infectivity and pathogenicity [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The spike protein present on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 facilitates the entry of virus particles through the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptors binding domain [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and is proteolytic activated by host cell proteases [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, several research groups are trying to decipher the interaction of hACE2 and spike protein as a novel drug target site to stop the pathogenicity [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The hACE2 receptors present on the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and small intestine, colon, thymus, bone marrow, lymph nodes, the brain of the host cells [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The S1 subunit of the spike protein binds to the receptor-binding domain and assists the attachment of spike protein to the receptor, resulting in conformational changes into the spike protein [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. TMPRSS211, a serine protease and lysosomal proteases cathepsins produced by the host cell cleaves the spike protein at the boundary of S1/S2 in such a way that S1 dissociates from the complex [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and intense structural change in S2 domain was observed, which is necessary for the fusion of the virus into the host cell membrane [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Membrane fusion and internalization of the virus are carried out via the S2 domain of the spike protein [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Unlike SARS-CoV, the pre-activation of SARS-CoV-2 entry inside the host cell is caused by proprotein convertase furin, which reduces its dependency on target cell proteases for invasion [
