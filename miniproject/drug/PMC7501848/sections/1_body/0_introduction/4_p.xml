<p id="p0020">By the introduction of nucleic acid-based therapeutic technologies, the gene expression can be regulated either at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Nucleic acid-based therapeutic molecules try to restore the homeostatic balance in two ways: overexpression of protective genes and silencing of damaged genes. Nucleic acid-based therapeutic biomolecules have also shown some promising results in pulmonary diseases [

Nucleic acid-based therapies, especially, RNA therapies including RNAi (RNA interference), siRNAs (small interfering RNA) and RNA aptamers, Ribozymes and ASOs (antisense oligonucleotides) target and neutralize the crucial components of the virus-like specific mRNA molecules, viral proteins like E (envelope), M (membrane), or N (nucleocapsid), or SARS helicase, etc. These biomolecules have also been found to be effective during the previous epidemic due to SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV has shown that they share 89.1% similarities among each other [
