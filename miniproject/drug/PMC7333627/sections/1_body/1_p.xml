Both guidelines for COVID-19 management by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and by World Health Organization discourage antibiotic therapy or prophylaxis for suspected COVID-19 patients and confirmed patients with mild symptoms, but suggest to prescribe antibiotics for suspicious bacterial infections.
