<p id="para0004">In the early outbreaks of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China occurred in late 2019, Chen et al. reported that 77 (71%) of their patients (
 <italic>n</italic> = 99) received antibiotic treatment and only 1 (1%) patients developed bacterial co-infection.

 <italic>n</italic> = 191) in Wuhan showing that 181 (95%) patients received antibiotics and 28 (15%) patients suffered secondary infections including 1 (1%) of 137 survivors and 27 (50%) of 54 non-survivors.

 </xref> A recent literature mining study on three coronavirus diseases revealed a very low identified/reported co-infection rate in SARS-1 (6%) and MERS (17%) patients. For the COVID-19, only 8% of patients with co-infections were reported, although 72% of the patients received antimicrobial therapy.

 </xref> Lansbury L and colleagues have written to this Journal for their systematically search from literature between 1 January 2020 to 17 April 2020 for studying secondary infections in COVID-19 patients. From their results, only 7% of hospitalised COVID-19 patients had bacterial co-infections. Remarkably, Lansbury's analysis showed that 17 out of 30 studies, mainly in China, indicated the antibiotic usage and &gt;90% of patients in 10 of these studies received empirical antibiotic treatments.
