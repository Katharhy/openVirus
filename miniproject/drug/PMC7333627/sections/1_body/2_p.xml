<p id="para0003">Learnt from the past influenza epidemics or pandemics, bacterial co/secondary infection is one of the major causes of fatalities. Antibiotic prophylaxis seems to be a reasonable approach to reduce potential morbidity and mortality in lower and upper respiratory infections such as pneumonia with unclear aetiological agents. Therefore, during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 and the more recent Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in 2012, most suspected patients were administrated with potent broad-spectrum antibiotics even before the confirmation of the aetiological agents.
