<p id="Par81">The clinical outcome of the patients relies on the fate of interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and immune cells of the host [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Modulation of this virus-host cell interaction and its aftereffects can be possibly achieved with immunomodulatory therapies repurposed from drugs used in autoimmune diseases. The potential drug targets for COVID-19 has been reviewed extensively by Misra et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the early asymptomatic or mild symptomatic stage, antiviral therapy is likely to have maximum efficacy, and the addition of interferon therapy at this stage may theoretically benefit from augmenting the innate antiviral response. In the next stage of pulmonary and systemic hyper-inflammation, early initiation of immunosuppressant, including IVIg, corticosteroids, IL-6, or IL-1 inhibitors may help to halt the immune-mediated damage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. We have summarized the plausible role of targeted immunosuppressive therapy in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The role of IL-1 and IL-6 in particular is worth noticing as they are significant drivers of proinflammation in the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) of COVID-19. The IL-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra, has proven its beneficial effects in the MAS in rheumatic diseases, as well as in chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T)-mediated severe CRS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Data from uncontrolled or historically controlled case series are encouraging for anakinra showing its safety and benefit on mortality, especially in critically ill patients with COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. The high level of IL-6 in COVID-19 patients results from the secretion through viral infected respiratory cells, as well as from the infiltrating lymphocytes and monocytes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. The anti-IL-6 treatment strategy has shown efficacy in a similar CRS-like phenomenon observed with MAS in rheumatic diseases and has become an attractive target for COVID-19 critical cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. To date, the supporting evidence for the beneficial effects of tocilizumab (a monoclonal antibody against the IL-6 receptor) is limited to observational studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. The results of ongoing randomized controlled trials with IL-1 and IL-6 targeted therapy may clarify the role of tocilizumab in COVID-19. The downstream effects of IL-6 and its receptor are mediated via cytosolic Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling, a common pathway for multiple proinflammatory cytokines. Trials with baricitinib, which targets JAK-STAT signaling, are also ongoing in critically ill patients with COVID-19 [
