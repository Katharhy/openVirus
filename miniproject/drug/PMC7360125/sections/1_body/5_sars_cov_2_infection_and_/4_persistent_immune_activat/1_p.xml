<p id="Par75">The third theory of persistent viral infection and oligo/polyclonal activation can be explained by the constant presence of viral antigens driving immune-proliferation resulting from the ineffective clearance of viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Such mechanisms are commonly encountered with the Epstein-Barr virus which resides in autoreactive B cells imparting immortality to the cells. These long-living autoreactive B cells cause lymphoproliferation and polyclonal activation culminating in chronic autoimmunity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. As the possibility of the persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus cannot be completely ruled out, this may add to an additional mechanism of autoimmunity. On a brighter side, complete clearance is reported in cases of other members of the coronavirus family following the development of specific antibodies [
