<p id="Par74">Lymphopenia due to reduced CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells is well documented in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2. The reduction is possibly secondary to functional exhaustion and preferential accumulation of the primed lymphocytes at the site of viral infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. These preferentially accumulated lymphocytes exhibit increased activity as confirmed by the expression of HLA-DR, CD69, CD38, and CD44. Activated lymphocytes, along with activated macrophages at the target tissue lead to bystander killing of adjacent, non-infected healthy cells via proinflammatory cytokine and reactive oxygen species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. With SARS-CoV-2 infection, the multisystem inflammatory syndrome appears after the peak of viral load. This suggests a build-up of inflammatory cytokine and bystander activation of the macrophages by SARS-CoV-2 through pattern recognition receptors (PRR). It also suggests bystander killing of the cells devoid of ACE2 receptors by free oxygen radicals released in the inflammatory milieu [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Bystander damage can be one of the mechanisms responsible for the manifestations like ARDS, myocarditis, and neurological involvement reported with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Autopsy reports of COVID-19 patients show diffuse infiltration of lymphocytes in the lungs and focal infiltration in the heart, kidney, liver, pancreas, and adrenal gland, suggesting bystander damage by cytotoxic CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Besides, in patients surviving SARS-CoV-2 infection, bystander activation may lead to sequestered autoantigen presentation leading to the emergence of neoepitope and autoimmune manifestations, as seen in SLE [
