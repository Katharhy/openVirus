<p id="Par73">Pre-clinical studies of diabetes and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis suggest the role of bystander activation as one of the mechanisms predisposing to autoimmunity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. The bystander damage starts with the virus-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells migrating to the infected target tissues and exerting perforin and granzyme-mediated cytotoxicity. The target cell death in the inflammatory milieu activates the surrounding macrophages to release reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide resulting in bystander killing of surrounding uninfected cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. The CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells contribute to this bystander damage through the release of proinflammatory cytokines and enhancing phagocytic activities of macrophage [

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The association of hepatitis C virus and Sjogren syndrome serves a classical example among RMDs explaining the bystander activation and damage theory [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Hepatitis C, primarily a hepatotropic virus, also exhibits sialotropism and lymphotropism leading to bystander activation of the salivary gland epithelium and lymphocytes, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. The activation of salivary epithelial cells and resultant antiviral defense in the salivary gland result in bystander damage manifesting as sicca symptoms and parotidomegaly. Bystander activation and dysregulated proliferation of the lymphocytes result in cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, generation of rheumatoid factor, autoantibodies (ANA, anti-SSA, anti-SSB), and low complements.
