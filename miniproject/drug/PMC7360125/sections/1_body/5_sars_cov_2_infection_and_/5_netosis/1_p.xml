<p id="Par76">Knight et al. noted the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) by demonstrating elevated serum levels of cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes, and citrullinated histone H3 among patients with COVID-19 compared to healthy controls [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. NETs consist of extracellular webs of nuclear chromatin materials and supporting histones along with antibacterial proteins and oxidant enzymes from neutrophilic granules. The principal role of this transient phenomenon is to trap the microorganisms to resolve the infection. However, sustained netosis may beget inflammation and thrombosis [

In the past decade, researchers have established the role of netosis in autoimmune disease including but not limited to, SLE, RA, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV), antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS), and an autoinflammatory syndrome, deficiency of adenosine deaminase-2 (DADA-2) [
