<p id="Par77">In COVID-19, a rise in neutrophil counts during early infection is a poor prognostic factor. The migration of these neutrophils towards virally infected sites follows the IL-8 gradient [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. The production of free oxygen radicals and IL-1β by macrophages and pyroptosis of virally infected cells stimulate and maintain netosis of the migrated neutrophils [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Exposure of chromatin, histones, and neutrophil granules with sustained netosis, serve as a source of autoantigens. This may lead to the recognition of self-peptides by antigen-presenting cells and result in the expansion of autoreactive cells (Fig.
