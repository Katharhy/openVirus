<p id="Par68">The interplay of various genetic, hormonal, immunological, and environmental factors constitutes the mosaic of autoimmunity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Viral infections play a substantial role in the development of several autoimmune diseases in individuals with underlying immune dysregulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Follow up data from survivors of viral outbreaks like influenza, Zika, Ebola, and Chikungunya have shown development of autoimmune phenomenon within weeks to months after recovery. While GBS, fulminant type1 diabetes, IgA vasculitis, APS have been observed after a previous outbreak of influenza [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], transverse myelitis, arthralgia, myalgia, and arthritis were reported following Zika [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], Chikungunya [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and Ebola infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Besides overt clinical manifestations, long-term persistence of autoreactive cells and autoantibodies (against antiphospholipid with influenza and ds-DNA and heat shock protein-60 with Ebolavirus) have also been demonstrated with some of these infections [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> enlists known viral infections and associated autoimmune diseases with the possible mechanisms as elaborately described by Smatti et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Similar mechanisms may lead to autoimmunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We herein describe some of the possible mechanism of autoimmunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection as follows:
