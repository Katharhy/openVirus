<p id="Par69">Molecular mimicry, as a result of the cross-reacting epitope between the virus and the host, leads to both humoral and cellular autoreactivity (Fig.

Recently, an epitope mapping analysis has identified immunogenic linear epitopes, 2′-O-ribose methyltransferase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and 3′-to-5′ exonuclease proteins from autoimmune dermatomyositis patients matching with the SARS-CoV-2 peptides [
