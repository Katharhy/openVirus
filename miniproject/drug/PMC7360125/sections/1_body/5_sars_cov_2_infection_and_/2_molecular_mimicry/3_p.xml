<p id="Par71">The role of genetic susceptibility should also be considered while evaluating the role of cross-reactive epitopes in precipitating autoimmunity. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) susceptibility map for SARS-CoV-2 has shown that HLA-B*15:03 efficiently presents highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are shared among the common human coronaviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. The association of HLA-B*15 with primary Sjogren’s syndrome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] and Bechet’s diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] is well documented, and the consequence of its association with SARS-CoV-2 peptide presentation needs to be carefully followed up.
