<p id="Par70">In addition to the presence of cross-reactive epitopes, activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) either by an adjuvant or infectious stimulus is essential to increase the expression of co-receptors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Viral RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 activates dendritic cells through cytosolic RIG like receptors and endosomal TLRs, as well as by the release of interferon α/β and γ enhancing antigen-presenting capacity (Fig.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Such activation by the virus can result in precipitation of inflammatory cascade in the presence of an already existing cross-reactive antigen. The clinical phenomenon of initial asymptomatic to mild symptoms followed by severe autoinflammatory syndrome in COVID-19 is proposed to be due to a similar autoreactive adaptive response with SARS-CoV-2 infection [
