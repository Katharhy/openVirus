<p id="Par72">Following molecular mimicry with the dominant epitope, diversification in epitope specificity commences resulting in the neo-epitopes presentation. Immune response to these neo-epitopes differs from that to the dominant epitope and involves newer targets for autoimmunity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. In SLE, before clinical disease onset, autoantibodies are targeted against Ro, La, and phospholipid antigens. In contrast, the clinical manifestations commence with the appearance of autoantibodies to ds-DNA, Smith (Sm), and ribonuclear protein (RNP) antigens [
