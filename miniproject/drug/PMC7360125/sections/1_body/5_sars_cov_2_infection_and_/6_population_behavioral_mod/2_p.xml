<p id="Par79">One of the key influencers to hygiene hypothesis is the microbiome of an individual which plays a protective role against autoimmune diseases. The mechanisms conferring protections by microbiome include antigenic competition, the role of lymphocyte homeostasis against pathogens, and the effect on immune regulatory pathway favoring the anti-inflammatory milieu with IL-10 and TGF-Î² secretion from the regulatory cells and TLR mediated receptor desensitization [

Additionally, the psychological stress caused by isolation, the anxiety of contracting the infection, and the economic burden along with its numerous adverse short- and long-term socio-economic consequences can turn as a trigger of various autoimmune diseases [
