At the negative spectrum of these hygienic measures, an increase in autoimmune disease should be born in mind as proposed by the proponents of the hygiene hypothesis. During the second half of the twentieth century, with the improvement in lifestyle especially in the developed world, the burden of infectious disease reduced with a parallel increase in autoimmune diseases like type1 diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel disease, and multiple sclerosis [
