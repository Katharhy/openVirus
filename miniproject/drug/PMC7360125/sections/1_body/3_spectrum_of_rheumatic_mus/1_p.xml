<p id="Par64">With scientific literature pouring in from different parts of the world on the clinical presentations and complications of SARS-CoV-2 infections, atypical clinical and laboratory manifestations mimicking RMDs have been reported (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Musculoskeletal manifestations reported with COVID-19 include arthralgia, myalgia, and proximal weakness with elevated creatine kinase (CK) level [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Some of these manifestations preceded respiratory symptoms of COVID-19. For instance, a patient who presented with proximal weakness with muscle edema on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), turned negative for myositis-specific and associated antibodies but progressed to develop the symptoms of COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The spectrum of dermatological manifestations mimicking RMDs includes COVID toes/pseudo-chilblain, transient urticarial or maculopapular rash, livedoid/necrotic lesions, punctiform or diffuse purpura, and erythema elevatum diutinum-like rash [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. COVID toes/pseudo-chilblain is reported predominantly in children and young adults and seems to be a relatively late feature of COVID-19. On the other hand, livedoid/necrotic lesions are seen in elderly patients with severe COVID-19 with no association with the duration of infection. Cases of young stroke involving large vessels, commonly evaluated in rheumatology clinics, have also been reported with COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A couple of cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) has been described as a consequence of post-viral autoimmune phenomenon. Out of the two reported cases, one succumbed to respiratory complications, and the other recovered with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)/plasmapheresis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Myocarditis related to COVID-19 in young patients without any prior cardiac morbidity has been reported with early onset of cardiac symptoms. They present with intact coronaries in cardiac echo and MRI showing the classical features of myocarditis. Improvement of myocarditis was noticed following treatment with hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and intravenous methylprednisolone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. An increase in the incidence of Kawasaki disease has been reported from Italy as a post-SARS-CoV-2 phenomenon. As compared to the classical Kawasaki disease, these children were older (mean age, 7.5 years) and reported to have more cardiac involvement, shock syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Cytokine storm or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), yet another entity encountered in rheumatology practice, is reported with COVID-19. The clinical manifestations start 8–9 days after the onset of respiratory symptoms and range from unremitting fever, cytopenia, to hyperferritinemia ultimately resulting in multiorgan failure. Hyperferritinemia and elevated serum interleukin (IL)-6 are often associated with mortality in these patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. There are reports of improvement with therapy targeting IL-1 and IL-6, and there are multiple ongoing clinical trials to evaluate the role of immunosuppressive therapy for this cytokine storm reported with COVID-19. In addition to these clinical manifestations mimicking RMDs, laboratory reports of positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], antiphospholipid antibodies, lupus anti-coagulant assay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and increased level of D-dimer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] have been reported with COVID-19. All these reports of COVID-19 mimicking or precipitating RMDs points towards a possibility of persisting intermediate to long-term immune dysregulation.
