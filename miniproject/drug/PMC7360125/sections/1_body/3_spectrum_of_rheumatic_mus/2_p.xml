<p id="Par65">Based on evidence from in-vitro studies and experience from other viral infections, several antiviral therapies are currently in trial/practice in different parts of the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. There are reports of rheumatic musculoskeletal adverse reactions following the use of these drugs. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> depicts the list of the major anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs with their mechanisms of action and the important rheumatological adverse events. Of these, some adverse events deserve special mention. Myopathy and neuromyopathy can rarely occur following long-term treatment with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Favipiravir can lead to hyperuricemia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Lopinavir-ritonavir-related rheumatic adverse events include arthralgia, back pain, osteonecrosis, and vasculitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Ribavirin can cause arthralgia, back pain, myositis, and exacerbation of sarcoidosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Musculoskeletal pain and myalgia have been reported in up to half of the patients on interferon therapy. Additionally, in rare cases, interferon therapy can lead to drug-induced RMDS, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Sjogren syndrome, myositis, sarcoidosis, and vasculitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. With the increased use of these drugs, there is a possibility of a rise in these adverse drug reactions necessitating active pharmacovigilance. Moreover, it must be noted that some of the frontrunner drugs like remdesivir have limited clinical data making it even more important to be vigilant.
