<p id="Par62">Our objective was to narrate various autoimmune and rheumatic manifestations that are associated with COVID-19 and the drugs used in its treatment. We conducted a literature search for articles since inception and published until 20 May 2020 in the English language using the Medline database. The search terms used in various combinations were: “coronavirus disease-19”, “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “rheumatic”, “autoimmune”, “musculoskeletal”, “clinical”, “manifestations”, “antivirals”, and “vaccines”. Additionally, we performed a focused literature search in the same database for articles on drugs used in COVID-19. We included original research articles, reviews, viewpoints, opinions, commentaries, case series, and case reports as relevant to our objective. The search strategy was used to obtain the titles and the abstracts of the relevant studies which were initially screened, and if necessary, the full text was retrieved to determine the suitability. The references and related citations for the resulting articles were also reviewed for pertinence. Finally, the information was synthesized in a logical sequence with expert inputs from the senior authors.</p>
