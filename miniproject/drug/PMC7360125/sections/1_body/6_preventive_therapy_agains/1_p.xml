<p id="Par80">Currently, a multitude of vaccines for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection is under investigation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Except for the nucleocapsid, all immunogenic epitopes have been reported to have at least one match with human proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. This homology between the human and viral proteins is an established factor in vaccine-induced autoimmunity with the mechanism of molecular mimicry, as discussed above. Furthermore, there is a theoretical possibility of the involvement of pathogenic priming in re-infection by COVID-19, triggering the release of proinflammatory cytokines leading to cytokine storm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Similar instances have been experienced with H1N1 influenza [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>], MERS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>], and SARS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. Thus, while developing vaccines, these epitopes should be carefully excluded to minimize unintended autoimmunity due to the risk of pathogenic priming.
