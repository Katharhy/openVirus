<p id="Par82">In this review, we primarily aimed at understanding the potential pathways and manifestations leading to autoimmunity and other RMD-like illnesses that could be triggered due to COVID-19 or the treatment for the same. This information may help the rheumatology community to tackle the threat of novel RMDs, RMD mimics, and other manifestations, including cytokine storm, Kawasaki disease, and coagulopathy. The immune consequences of SARS-CoV-2-host interaction along with the environmental changes, explain the basis of rheumatic musculoskeletal manifestations of COVID-19. There is a need for preparedness for a possible surge in diverse autoimmune diseases following the pandemic. The rheumatology community is already joining hands to treat, support, and inform our existing patient partners during this pandemic with the advantage of accessibility to cutting edge technology at our disposal. With a likely long-term coexistence of SARS-CoV-2 and the human host and the use of numerous therapeutic strategies, this preparedness may help in the effective management of the rheumatic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the post-COVID-19 era.</p>
