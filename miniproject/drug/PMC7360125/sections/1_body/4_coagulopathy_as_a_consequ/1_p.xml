<p id="Par66">One of the factors leading to mortality in COVID-19 patients is the presence of coagulopathy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The autopsy findings of COVID-19 death from a majority of the cases show the presence of coagulopathy either in the form of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or multiple pulmonary thrombi coexisting with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) changes in the lungs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The laboratory markers of COVID-19 coagulopathy include increased D-dimer level, borderline thrombocytopenia, and prolonged prothrombin time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Though the exact mechanism underlying coagulopathy is unclear, a possibility of local lung-TMA as a coronavirus-associated hemostatic lung abnormality (CAHA) is proposed, linking inflammation and endothelial cell activation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Endothelial cell activation results in the production of von Willebrand factor (vWF) in excess to the clearance capacity of ADAMTS-13. This leads to local thrombotic microangiopathy and perpetuates lung damage [
