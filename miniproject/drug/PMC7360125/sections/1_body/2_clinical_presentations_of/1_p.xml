<p id="Par63">SARS-CoV-2 enters the cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors located on the nasopharyngeal and bronchial mucosa, and on alveolar pneumocytes in the lungs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The smooth muscles of the arterial walls and endothelial cells of the veins in every organ of the body express ACE2 receptors explaining the ubiquitous distribution, and the possibility of multisystem involvement by the SARS-CoV-2 virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The spectrum of presentation of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to severe-critical illness which is categorized as mild, severe, and critical illness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Patients with mild presentation have symptoms of fever, cough, nasal congestion, sore throat, malaise, headache, and myalgia without dyspnea. The severe presentation includes patients with respiratory distress as indicated by a respiratory rate of ≥ 30/min, SpO
 <sub>2</sub> (blood oxygen saturation) of ≤ 93%, PaO
 <sub>2</sub> (partial pressure of oxygen)/FiO
 <sub>2</sub> (fraction of inspired oxygen) ratio of &lt; 300, or presence of infiltrates in more than half of the lung fields in a radiograph or CT scan. Critical illness encompasses respiratory failure, septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Besides respiratory symptoms, multiple cohorts have reported anosmia and dysgeusia, ranging from 34–87% of the patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Gastrointestinal manifestations, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been reported in 11–24% of the cases and as presenting symptoms in a few reports of COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In a case series from China, 32% of the patients had ophthalmological manifestations, mainly conjunctival redness and edema with increased eye discharge [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The other musculoskeletal, dermatological, neurological, and cardiovascular manifestations have been discussed in detail further in this review. The risk factors for severe disease and mortality include old age, immunocompromised status, and comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disorders, chronic kidney disease, liver diseases, cancer, and severe obesity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Initial data from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance provider registry suggests that the features and prognosis in patients with RMDs on immunosuppressive agents contracting SARS-CoV-2 are similar to those in the general population [
