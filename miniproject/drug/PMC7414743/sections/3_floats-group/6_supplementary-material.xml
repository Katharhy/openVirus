    <bold>Additional file 1: Figure S1.</bold> Mean model projections of the (A) number of HIV/HCV diagnosed active PWID (B) number of new HIV/HCV diagnosed active PWID, (C) number of chronic HCV infections among active PWID, and (D) number of new chronic HCV infections among active PWID with observed scaled-up DAA treatment rates from 2015 in Andalusia with various treatment scale-up scenarios. 
    <bold>Figure S2.</bold> Mean model projections of the number of new. HIV/HCV diagnosed MSM with observed scaled-up DAA treatment rates. From 2015 in Andalusia with various treatment scale-up scenarios. 
    <bold>Figure S3.</bold> Model projections (mean and 95% intervals) for HCV chronic prevalence and incidence among people who inject drugs (A,C) and HIV+ people who inject drugs (B,D) in Andalusia, Spain with observed scaled-up DAA treatment rates from 2015. Black line indicates mean projection, grey lines indicate 2.5–97.5% interval projections. 
    <bold>Figure S4.</bold> Comparison of the model projected trends in HCV chronic prevalence among HIV+ individuals with a history of injecting drug use against the data. Model projections shown as solid line (black the mean projection, and gray lines the 2.5–97.5% interval projections). Calibration data sampling bounds (minimum and maximum) shown in red. 
    <bold>Figure S5.</bold> Comparison of the model projected trends in HIV and HCV prevalence against the data. HIV prevalence (A,B) and HCV chronic prevalence (C,D) shown among people who inject drugs by injecting duration (&gt; 10 years and &lt; 10 years). Model projections shown as solid lines (black the mean projection, and gray lines the 2.5–97.5% interval projections). Calibration data sampling bounds (minimum and maximum) shown in red. 
    <bold>Figure S6.</bold> Mean model projections of the number of new HCV infections among HIV+ MSM and PWID in Andalusia, Spain if all coinfected individuals were diagnosed and treated annually from 2020, and in addition 10% of HCV monoinfected PWID were treated annually.
