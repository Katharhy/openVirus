<p id="Par31">Continuing current DAA treatment rates among HIV-diagnosed individuals could dramatically reduce the number of prevalent diagnosed coinfected individuals (mean 76% relative reduction (95%I: 75–76) from 2015 to 2030, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, black line), moderately reduce the number of newly diagnosed HIV/HCV coinfections (mean 12% relative reduction (95%I: 10–15) from 2015 to 2030, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, black line), and would moderately increase the number of new HCV infections (diagnosed and undiagnosed) among PLWH (mean − 12% relative reduction (95%I: − 38 - 36) 2015–2030). When considering the impact on the broader HCV epidemic, the model projects continuing current rates would reduce the number of new HCV infections by a relative 29% (95%I: 19–37%) by 2030.
