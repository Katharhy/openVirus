<p>Previously, a broad spectrum of methodologies have been used as part of multiple important studies to develop combination therapies to address multiple disease indications.

 <sup>]</sup> Substantial efforts have also been directed toward new drug development. When confronted with a novel pathogen strain with high virulence, a potential capacity for rapid and continuous mutation, and poor patient outcomes, the global community often requires rapidly actionable responses due to patient mortality that may quickly follow initial diagnosis. To address the COVID‐19 crisis, a substantial number of clinical trials have been initiated.

 <sup>]</sup> Treatment options explored to address COVID‐19 have included repurposed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza‐related monotherapies and drug cocktails, trials of investigational therapies such as remdesivir (Gilead Sciences), and has sparked a worldwide effort to develop a vaccine. Among large sets of candidate therapies for drug repurposing in combination therapy, standard approaches involve drug selection based on mechanism of action. Drug dosing is subsequently determined by established clinical guidelines. Traditional design approaches are based on trial‐and‐error, and barriers include sub‐optimal efficacy and dose‐limiting toxicities. In sum, the lack of a systematic way to interrogate the massive drug‐dose parameter space created by these pools of candidate therapies preclude the ability to optimize treatment outcomes.
