<p>In order to assess single drug toxicity and antiviral efficacy, single drug‐dose response curves were acquired. Cell viability was assessed at 24 h and VSV infection was recorded at 12 and 24 h at an initial cell density of 12k per well. The MOI was maintained at 0.01. The VSV and drugs were simultaneously added to the host cells for co‐incubation. Dose response curves for Amantadine HCl (AMT); Dexamethasone (DEX); Azithromycin (AZT); Chloroquine Diphosphate (CLR); NPX, Naproxen Sodium (NPX); Fluoxetine HCl (FLX); LRT, Loratadine (LRT); Omeprazole Sodium (OMP); Ritonavir (RTN); Lopinavir (LPN); Doxycycline (DOX); Ribavirin (RBV) (

With the exception of AZT, FLX, LRT, LPN and DOX, which mediated observable toxicity at high concentrations, the candidate monotherapies and their studied concentration ranges appeared tolerable (over 75% cell viability). Of note, the final DMSO concentration for all the tests did not exceed 0.3% to ensure the cell viability can be attributed to drug treatments.
