<p>Of note, some of the candidate drugs performed well as monotherapies. However, this is a common observation in in vitro platforms, and there is a subsequent need to ultimately incorporate these drugs into clinically actionable combination therapy regimens in order to optimize their use against a pathogen in question, despite their promising single drug activity. Importantly, sufficient testing of the drug‚Äêdose parameter space may also reveal that drugs with promising monotherapy activity do not belong in the optimal combination therapy regimens, which has been commonly observed using our platform.
