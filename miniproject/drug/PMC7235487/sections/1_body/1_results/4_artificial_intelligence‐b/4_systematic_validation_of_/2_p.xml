<p>To validate the combination regimens of the 5 candidate drugs that were advanced for further consideration, we conducted a subsequent round of experiments with 30 combinations consisting of these 5 drugs (MOI = 0.1, Table S3, Supporting Information). Viral infection and drug treatment was simultaneously applied to host cells. The viral infection from each drug treatment was recorded at 12 h (

 </xref>). A parabolic polynomial model was built with stepwise regression following the combinatorial optimization studies. When assessing the drug interaction coefficients as well as the parabolic response surfaces, broad synergy was subsequently observed (Figure

 <sc>m</sc>), Chloroquine Diphosphate (0.5 × 10

 <sc>m</sc>) (

 </xref>). Of note, both of these combinations were based on individual drug doses that were lower than the high doses needed to achieve sufficient efficacy as monotherapies. It is important to note that for many of the top‐ranked combinations, the component therapies exhibited unfavorable efficacy when delivered as monotherapies, but played a key role in mediating optimal efficacy when co‐administered. As an example, for Amantadine HCl, Chloroquine Diphosphate, and Omeprazole Sodium, monotherapy was shown to be relatively ineffective at high doses. Compared to no drug treatment, Amantadine (HCl) treatment exhibited infection rates of ≈75%. Chloroquine Diphosphate treatment exhibited infection rates of ≈25%, and Omeprazole Sodium treatment exhibited infection rates of ≈50%. To further evaluate the importance of drug and dose optimization in systematic combination therapy design, it is important to note that Optimal Combo 1 and Sub‐Optimal Combo 2 were comprised of the same therapies, but at different doses. This alone resulted in infection rates of 1.5% and 10.7%, an approximately sevenfold difference in efficacy and demonstrating the importance of simultaneous drug and dose optimization. This is further confirmed by the scenario where replacing Amantadine HCl with Omeprazole Sodium and administering this combination at a sub‐optimal dose results in a 21.6% infection rate. This represents a 14‐fold difference in efficacy compared to Optimal Combo 1. With regards to the factors contributing toward the optimal treatment outcomes, analysis of the interaction terms showed that the effects were primarily due to single‐drug contributions, drug quadratic effects, 2‐drug interaction synergy as well as 3‐drug interaction synergy (Figure
