<p>The lung cancer cell line (A549, ATCC, USA) was cultured in high‐glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, USA) that was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen, USA) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Invitrogen, USA). The culture was maintained at 37 °C containing 5% v/v CO
 <sub>2</sub> and the cells were harvested upon reaching 80% confluence. 100 µL of cell suspension (4–12k cells per well) was seeded in 96‐well plates and pre‐incubated for 12 h for treatment with the candidate drugs and viral platform. Cells without any drug treatment and without viral infection served as a control. Each condition was run in triplicate. Drug‐induced cytotoxicity was measured using a cell counting kit‐8 (CCK8, DOJINDO, Japan). Briefly, 15 µL of CCK8 solution was added to each well containing 150 µL solution and then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in order to conduct the cytotoxicity assay. The cell viability was assessed by measuring the absorbance (450 nm) via a microplate reader (BioTek, Synergy HT, USA).
