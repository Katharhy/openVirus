<p>Project IDentif.AI sought to overcome this barrier that is pervasive across the drug development roadmap for virtually all indications, and demonstrate that the rapid interrogation of a 12‐drug parameter space could be completed within a timespan of days. In lieu of drug selection followed by dose finding, we used a previously established quadratic correlation between the 12‐drug pool and drug doses (input) as well as inhibition of A549 infection by VSV and A549 viability (outputs) to systematically identify the top drug combinations. This was achieved independent of any prior knowledge of drug targets, mechanism‐of‐action, or complex disease biology. Furthermore, the implementation of our platform does not require training based on existing data sets or big data. Instead, a specified set of experiments based on a broad spectrum of drug‐dose combinations that sufficiently represents the parameter space that is created by the 12‐drug set is prospectively conducted. As such, the optimization process is driven completely by prospectively validated data on a cell line or patient sample. Many efforts to evaluate drug sets for single drug treatment or sampled combinations have been conducted. Global optimization of combination therapy design from a large drug set opens up the doors to a broader spectrum of actionable regimens. As our study has shown, even when combinations comprised of the same drugs are administered at varying doses, a sevenfold difference in efficacy was observed, and even greater differences (14‐fold) were observed when one drug was substituted (omeprazole sodium) for another (amantadine HCl, yielding a combination of azithromycin‐chloroquine diphosphate‐omeprazole sodium‐ribavirin) under sub‐optimal dosing conditions. This is an interesting finding considering the single drug substitution resulted in such a profound disparity in treatment outcomes, even if all of the drugs considered comprised the top 2 optimal combinations. This further demonstrated the importance of simultaneous drug/dose optimization. Importantly, this process produced multiple drug/dose‐optimized combinations within 3 days. This approach has the potential of providing a pipeline of alternatives for patients if issues such as drug resistance are encountered.</p>
