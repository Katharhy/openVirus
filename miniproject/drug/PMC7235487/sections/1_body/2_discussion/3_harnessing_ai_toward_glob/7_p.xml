 <sup>]</sup> This will play a key role in bringing these critically important and potentially high‐efficacy and high‐specificity interventions toward broader use. Numerous efforts have considered drug repurposing for infectious disease indications as an approach to quickly respond to an outbreak. Small molecule therapeutics are ideal for rapid deployment in response to an epidemic because they are often stable at room temperature, easily available and have known human pharmacokinetic and safety profiles.
