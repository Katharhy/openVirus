<p>Deploying AI‐optimized infectious disease intervention may result in impact beyond technical and clinical innovation. To scale these platforms toward broader use, healthcare policy, economics, and infrastructure implications as they apply to the patient, payer, and system should be considered. This platform in many ways simultaneously serves as a diagnostic and intervention, because it identifies actionable intervention by calibrating prospectively‐obtained patient or population‐based data. Added possible benefits include the fact that optimizing drug repurposing to use well‐established and potentially cost‐effective therapies to manage unpredictable clinical courses, and reductions in treatment complications associated with dose‐limiting toxicities and lack of efficacy that may be encountered with trial‐and‐error/nonoptimized repurposing. These outcomes may lead to reduced healthcare cost burden, which opens up important discussions on how these platforms can be scaled and efficiently integrated into healthcare workflows to enable better informed healthcare spending decisions by patients.
