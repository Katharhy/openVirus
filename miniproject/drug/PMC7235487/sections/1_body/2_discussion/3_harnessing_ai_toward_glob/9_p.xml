<p>A major challenge in drug repurposing efforts is that few drugs demonstrate the safety and potency alone to achieve therapeutic antiviral activity. Therefore, studies have focused on combinational strategies to meet the potency and safety dose requirements to be considered in response to a new threat.

 <sup>]</sup> These efforts rely on in vitro and in vivo testing to evaluate and can be considerably difficult to demonstrate, even with two drug combinations.

 <sup>]</sup> In vitro and especially in vivo testing of single drugs or combinations can be a lengthy process (months to years).

 <sup>]</sup> Higher complexity combinational approaches offer the greatest benefit, but traditional methods developing higher‚Äêorder combinations . Emerging in silico modelling and AI approaches that are driven by prospective experimental validation are converging to allow for potentially rapid responses to outbreak and pandemic events.

 <sup>]</sup> The approach described here, and other recently reported methods are key steps to higher order combinational treatment formulations that overcomes past limitations with repurposing and will allow for disease specific and likely personalized antivirals.
