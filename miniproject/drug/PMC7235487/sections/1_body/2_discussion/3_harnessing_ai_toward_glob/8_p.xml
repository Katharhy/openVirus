<p>Most successful cases of drug repurposing have been largely serendipitous clinical discoveries, however tremendous effort has also been focused on rational drug repurposing through pathogenic phenotypic in silico and in vitro screening efforts. How these drugs works are often complex and can be on‐target or off‐target of the original indication. On‐target mechanisms of action(s) (MOAs) are often useful targets to block pathogen attachment, entry, and replication within the host. Existing viral drugs are usually the first to be applied to novel viral threats. An additional benefit with repurposed molecules is their potential off‐target impacts on a pathogen. These off‐target effects are usually harder to define during development.</p>
