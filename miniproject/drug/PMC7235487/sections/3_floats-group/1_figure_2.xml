  <p>A–L) Single drug dose response curves for cell viability and viral infection. Cell viability is accessed at 24 h and normalized to the untreated control without being treated with drugs or virus. VSV infection is recorded at 12 and 24 h and normalized to the untreated control which only be treated with virus. Initial cell density is 12k per well in 96 well plate. MOI is 0.01. VSV and drugs are simultaneously added to host cells for co‐incubation. Dose response curves for drugs. Abbreviations: AMT, Amantadine HCl; DEX, Dexamethasone; AZT, Azithromycin; CLR, Chloroquine Diphosphate; NPX, Naproxen Sodium; FLX, Fluoxetine HCl; LRT, Loratadine; OMP, Omeprazole Sodium; RTN, Ritonavir; LPN, Lopinavir; DOX, Doxycycline; RBV, Ribavirin. Error bars show standard deviations (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3).
