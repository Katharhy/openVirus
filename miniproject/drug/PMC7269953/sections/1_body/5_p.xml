<p id="p0060">Currently, there are no finally verified data and no antiviral drugs licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency for treating patients with COVID-19 or for managing their complications. Since its first outbreak in China, COVID-19 was empirically treated with antiviral and respiratory supportive therapies mainly agents already used in prior SARS epidemics. Thus, this provides an opportunity for the research community to better outline the value of immune-modulating agents in the treatment of COVID-19. Current evidence revealed that a timely anti-inflammation treatment is of pivotal importance in avoiding exacerbation and preventing further injury in severe SARS-CoV-2–induced pneumonia. Although the use of some of them is still controversial, a plethora of anti-inflammatory agents have been proposed to alleviate the systemic CS. Based on the promising results from an open-label study in 21 patients with severe and critical COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], tocilizumab—a human monoclonal antibody that binds to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (IL-6Rs)—is currently being investigated to address cytokine release syndrome in patients with severe ARDS, which includes randomised, controlled trials (ChiCTR2000029765; NCT04320615) and single-arm trials (ChiCTR2000030796; NCT04317092). These studies must be considered alongside two trials assessing the safety and therapeutic efficacy of anti–PD-1 inhibitors in patients with similar eligibility criteria (NCT04268537; NCT04333914).
