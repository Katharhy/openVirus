<p id="p0045">The immune checkpoint pathway is an endogenous component of the immune system that is responsible for coordinating the physiological immune response, maintaining self-tolerance and protecting tissues from damage. Several models have shown that blocking programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) can prevent T-cell death, regulate cytokine production and reduce organ dysfunctions. T cells play a vital role in viral clearance, with CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) capable of secreting an array of molecules such as perforin, granzymes and interferon gamma to eradicate viruses from the host. At the same time, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> helper T cells (Ths) can assist CTLs and B cells and enhance their ability to clear pathogens. However, persistent stimulation by the virus may induce T-cell exhaustion, leading to a loss of cytokine production capability and reduced functions [
