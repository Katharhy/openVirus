  <p>Systematic screening of the ExoRDec library. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Interaction network of validated PPIs after NLR retesting. Viral proteins are indicated in black circles, factors of the ExoRDec library in grey boxes. Redundant targeting (i.e. cellular protein targeted by three or more viral proteins) is depicted with blue boxes. Edges that were only found with viral protein of pH1N1 are indicated with dashed lines. (
   <bold>B</bold>) KEGG pathways enrichment analysis. The ExoRDec library and associated proteome was divided in two clusters, i.e. non-targeted (âˆ’) and targeted (+) by viral proteins. Each bar corresponds to a KEGG pathway found to be statistically significant (
   <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) in each cluster. The length of the bar represents the proportion of genes belonging to the pathway that are present in the cluster with respect to the whole pathway. The number associated to each bar corresponds to the total number of genes present in the cluster for the given pathway. Enrichment analysis was carried out using the ClueGO plug-in of Cytoscape as described in the methods section.
