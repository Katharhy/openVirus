<p>In the present study, we focused on ERI1 found in our screen as an interactor of PB2, PB1, NP and, to a lesser extent, of M1 proteins of IAV, although subsequent experiments showed that the interaction with PB1 and M1 was probably indirect and mediated by RNA. ERI1 belongs to the DEDDh exoribonuclease family. Some exonucleases in this family have already been reported to be essential for the multiplication of different RNA viruses. For instance, coronavirus nsp14 protein was shown to carry an exoribonuclease activity required to maintain viral replication fidelity, while Lassa fever virus nucleoprotein possesses a DEDDh exonuclease activity essential to suppress host innate immune system activation (
