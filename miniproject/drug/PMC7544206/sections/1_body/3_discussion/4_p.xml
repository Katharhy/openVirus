<p>The differences observed in viral transcription levels between non-target and ERI1 silenced cells, with consequences at the protein level, are unlikely to be linked to a role of ERI1 in viral mRNA splicing or export from the nucleus. Indeed, the effect of ERI1 silencing was observed at similar levels for the products of unspliced viral transcripts, such as NP, PB2, NS1 and later NA and M1, and for the M2 protein translated from an M1 spliced transcript. Our data are more in favor of a role of ERI1 in viral mRNA maturation and quality control, whose defect in the very early steps of infection would reduce the efficiency of early protein synthesis following primary transcription. A decreased production of the viral proteins involved in transcription/replication of the viral genome could then induce a reduction of the secondary produced viral transcripts at later times post infection, consistent with what we observed at the protein level.</p>
