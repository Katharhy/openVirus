<p>ERI1 targeting by IAV is thus another example supporting the growing evidence of the complex viral hijacking of cellular RNA decay machineries that rewires cellular gene expression in order to create a favorable environment for viral replication. Further work is needed to try and decipher the specific mechanisms, but the interaction identified between ERI1 and PB2/NP could already be considered as a potential target for the development of new antivirals.</p>
