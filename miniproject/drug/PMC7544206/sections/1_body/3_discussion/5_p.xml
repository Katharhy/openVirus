<p>ERI1 could have indirect roles too. For example, like the exonuclease activity of Lassa virus NP which was shown to inhibit innate immunity (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), ERI1 during IAV infection could be hijacked to modulate the innate immunity in order to promote viral transcription. On the other hand, ERI1 is known to regulate the relative abundance of miRNAs (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) and some miRNAs have been reported to interfere with IAV replication, such as miR-584-5p and miR-1.249, or miR-323, miR-491Â and miR-654, respectively inhibiting H5N1 and H1N1 by targeting PB2 and PB1 genes (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). ERI1 could therefore be recruited by the IAV vRNPs to target specific miRNA degradation and thus promote viral replication overall. Sequencing the miRNA repertoire upon ERI1 silencing would thus help addressing a potential role of ERI1 in miRNA homeostasis during IAV infection.
