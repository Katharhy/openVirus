<p>The 75 cellular proteins composing the ExoRDec library, selected using GO terms associated to exonucleases and RNA decay (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Tables S1, S2</xref>), were systematically screened for interaction with viral proteins (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M1, NS1 and NEP) from IAV strains A/Paris/650/2004(H1N1) (sH1N1) and A/Bretagne/7608/2009(H1N1pdm09) (pH1N1) by a split 
 <italic>Gaussia</italic> luciferase assay as previously described in (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). This initial screening identified two to nine cellular proteins as putative interacting partners for each viral protein. These interactions were retested using the NLR (Normalized Luminescence Ratio) method as described in (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) to take into account the background noise of interaction and the expression level of each tested partner, thus discriminating between true interacting partners and false positives. Nineteen ExoRDec proteins were validated as interactors of at least one viral protein (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref> and Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The interaction profiles between sH1N1 and pH1N1 were almost identical (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>), and several ExoRDec factors were found to interact with more than one viral protein (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>); ADARB1, ERI1, EXOSC6 as well as ADAR and HMGA2 were the most connected, with interactions validated to four and three viral proteins, respectively. The direct interactors (first neighbors) of each factor of the ExoRDec library were retrieved from the human proteome interaction network. Cellular process enrichment analysis of all these cellular proteins revealed a specific enrichment in RNA degradation processes only for the viral-protein-interacting ExoRDec factors and their first neighbors (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).
