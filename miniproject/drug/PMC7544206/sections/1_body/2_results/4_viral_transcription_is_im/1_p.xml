<p>The role of ERI1 on the virus life cycle was further studied in A549 cells silenced by ERI1 siRNA in comparison to non-target siRNA treated cells as control. During single cycle infection in ERI1 silenced A549 cells compared to control, the accumulation of the viral proteins PB2, NP and NS1 was reduced at 3hpi. Such decrease was less obvious at 6 hpi, at which point accumulation of the late viral proteins M1, M2 and NA was slightly reduced (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The effects of ERI1 depletion were thus primarily detected during the initial steps of viral protein accumulation, suggesting an involvement of ERI1 from the early stages of the viral life cycle, possibly during transcription. Indeed, viral mRNA production was reduced in ERI1 silenced A549 cells compared to control as soon as 3hpi, and more obviously at 6hpi (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Likewise, a decrease in vRNA production was also apparent at 6hpi in ERI1 silenced cells. This might be a consequence of the decreased production of viral proteins due to impaired viral transcription (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">B</xref>), since the synthesis of new genomic vRNA requires the accumulation of neo-synthesized viral replication proteins. Conversely, overexpression of ERI1 led to an increase in viral transcription as assessed by mRNA/vRNA ratios (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Last, these ratios were also reduced in ERI1 silenced cells (compared to cells treated with control siRNA) under cycloheximide (CHX) treatment that is known to block 
 <italic>de novo</italic> translation (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">E</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest a role of ERI1 in viral transcription, including in the initial synthesis of mRNA from the incoming vRNPs (viral primary transcription).
