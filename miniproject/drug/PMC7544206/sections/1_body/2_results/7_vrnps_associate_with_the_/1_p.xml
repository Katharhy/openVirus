<p>ERI1 nuclear functions comprise histone mRNA maturation. ERI1 participates in the histone pre-mRNA processing complex and binds to the stem loop structure in the 3′UTR of histone pre-mRNA, forming a ternary complex along with the stem loop binding protein (SLBP) (

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). The ΔSAP and R105A mutants of ERI1 were previously reported to be impaired for histone mRNA binding and maturation in the nucleus (

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Although the ΔSAP lacks almost a whole protein domain, it was shown to be properly folded and functioning (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In the lysates of IAV infected cells, the proportions of histone mRNA (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) and viral NP mRNA (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) that were co-purified by the mutants as compared to ERI1 wt were similarly reduced. In addition, the ΔSAP mutant that showed the strongest reduction in interaction with viral proteins in GPCA (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>) was unable to co-immunoprecipitate PB2 and NP viral proteins (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>), suggesting that the interaction domain of ERI1 with the vRNP could lie in the SAP domain. In infected cell lysates, PB2 purification was found to co-immunoprecipitate both ERI1 and SLBP (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). As for the co-purification of ERI1, the co-purification of SLBP with PB2 and NP was sensitive to RNase treatment (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). Furthermore, the PB2 eluates were found to be specifically enriched in several histone mRNAs compared to control eluates (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>). Histone mRNA co-purification with PB2 was also greatly reduced in ERI1 silenced cells compared to non-target siRNA treated cells (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref>). Taken together, these results support the conclusion that the form of ERI1 that is recruited to vRNPs during IAV infection is bound to histone mRNA and associated with SLBP, as part of the histone pre-mRNA processing complex.
