<p>ERI1 was identified by GPCA as an interactor of the PB2, PB1, NP and M1 viral proteins. The lower NLR values obtained with PB1 and especially M1 indicate a weaker association of ERI1 with these viral proteins (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), suggesting that, within the vRNPs, PB2 and NP are the main targets of ERI1. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using transient transfection expression in HEK-293T cells further confirmed the specific interaction of ERI1 with PB2 and NP, and to lesser extend with PB1, while no significant interaction was detected for M1, corroborating the GPCA results (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). In addition, the binding of PB2 and of NP to ERI1 was still detected under RNase treatment, both in GPCA and co-immunoprecipitation assays, while the interaction with PB1 was lost in co-immunoprecipitation (

Overall, these data demonstrate a direct, RNA-independent interaction of ERI1 with the viral PB2 and NP proteins. Interestingly, when PB2, PB1 and PA were expressed along with Strep-ERI1 or Strep-mCherry, all three viral proteins were retrieved upon Strep-ERI1 purification (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>), suggesting that ERI1 might interact with the tripartite polymerase complex.
