<p>ERI1 can be schematically divided into two domains, the N-terminal domain containing a nucleic-acid binding ‘SAF-box, Acinus and PIAS’ (SAP) sub domain and the C-terminal domain containing the exonuclease activity, connected by a small inter-domain spacer (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Overexpression experiments with ERI1 wild-type (wt) or with mutants for RNA binding (R105A, ΔSAP) or DEDDh exonuclease activity (D134A+E136A, i.e. no-DE) were used to decipher which of these activities contributes to the role of ERI1 in IAV multiplication. While overexpression of ERI1 wt led to a two-fold increase in viral transcription, overexpression of R105A, ΔSAP or no-DE mutants was not associated with such increase in viral transcription, even though they accumulated at the same levels as ERI1 wt (Figure

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">C</xref>). Overexpression of the no-DE mutant even led to a slight decrease in viral transcription. Given that ERI1 no-DE mutant retained the ability to interact with viral proteins (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4A, B</xref>) while losing its exonuclease activity, such decrease in viral transcription could be the consequence of a dominant negative effect due to the capture of the viral proteins by a catalytically inactive form of ERI1. In all, both RNA binding and exonuclease activities of ERI1 appear to be required for its role in IAV multiplication.
