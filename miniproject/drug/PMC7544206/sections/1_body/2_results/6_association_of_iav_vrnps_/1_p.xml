<p>In IAV infected cells, purification of endogenous ERI1 specifically co-immunoprecipitated PB2 and NP viral proteins (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>), confirming in an infectious context the interaction detected by GPCA and transient expression experiments (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">E</xref>). Conversely, PB2 immunoprecipitation co-purified Strep-ERI1 from the lysates of cells transfected with Strep-ERI1 and infected with IAV (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>), while Strep-ERI1 purification allowed to retrieve the tripartite polymerase complex (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>).
