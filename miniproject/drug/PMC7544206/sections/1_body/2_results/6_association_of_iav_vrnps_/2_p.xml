<p>Since ERI1 RNA binding activity was found to be required for viral transcription (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">D</xref>), we assessed the involvement of RNA in ERI1 interaction with the vRNPs during infection, using RNase treatment. Unexpectedly, when RNase was used, viral PB2 and NP proteins were no longer co-purified along with Strep-ERI1, while without RNase the co-immunoprecipitation of PB2 and NP viral proteins was possible (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>). These results indicate that the interaction of ERI1 with the vRNPs is RNA-dependent in an infectious context, although a direct, RNA-independent interaction of ERI1 with PB2 and NP was detected in co-transfected cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3C, D</xref>). Quantification of the viral NP mRNA and vRNA co-purified with Strep-ERI1 from infected cell lysates showed that a significantly higher proportion of mRNA was co-purified as compared to vRNA (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">I</xref>). In a non-infectious context, we found that viral RNAs, like histone mRNAs, were more co-purified with Strep-ERI1 than with Strep-mCherry, showing that ERI1 is able to bind to viral RNAs (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4C</xref>). Our data are thus suggesting that ERI1 could be recruited to viral mRNA, possibly through both interactions with NP and PB2 of the vRNPs and direct binding to RNA, in line with a potential role of ERI1 in viral transcription.
