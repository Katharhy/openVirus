<p>The role of the 19 validated ExoRDec factors on the viral life cycle was further investigated using small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing. Upon siRNA knock down of these 19 factors, A549 cell viability remained above 80% compared to the non-target treated cells, except for INPP5K (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2C</xref>). We chose to focus on ERI1, a 3′-5′ cellular exoribonuclease involved in multiple cellular RNA maturation and degradation processes, for which a redundant targeting by viral proteins was found by GPCA (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Silencing of ERI1 by two individual siRNAs confirmed the results of the siRNA screen, and ERI1 was found to impair the viral life cycle of four different IAV strains (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>). The effects are lasting over time and the production of infectious viral particles in ERI1 knock down cells remained lower than in non-target treated cells at several time points post-infection (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).
