<p>Some exonucleases were reported to restrict or support the replication of influenza A viruses. Interferon-stimulated exonuclease gene 20 protein (ISG20) interacts with influenza virus NP and inhibits viral replication (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Binding of NS1 to viral dsRNA produced during viral replication counteracts IFN-α/β-induced RNase L activation (
