<p>RNA decay is a central cellular process that regulates RNA stability and quality, and thereby gene expression (reviewed in (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)). Controlling transcript stability is essential to ensure proper cellular physiology and the establishment of adapted responses to viral infection. Growing evidence points to the existence of a large interplay between eukaryotic RNA turnover machineries and viral proteins. On the one hand, viruses evolved mechanisms to evade RNA degradation pathways, and on another hand, they can manipulate these pathways to promote their replication (reviewed in (
