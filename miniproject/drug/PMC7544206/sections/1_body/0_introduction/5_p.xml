<p>This led us to systematically screen interactions between IAV viral proteins that constitute or bind to the vRNPs and a selected set of 75 cellular proteins carrying exoribonuclease (Exo) activities or associated with RNA decay (RDec) processes (referred to as the ExoRDec library). Influenza A virus proteins exhibited preferential targeting of RNA degradation pathways and eight targeted cellular factors were identified as contributing to viral multiplication. Among them, ERI1, a 3′-5′ cellular exoribonuclease of the DEDDh family involved in the processing of small RNA, ribosomal RNA and histone mRNA (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29–36</xref>), was found to interact with several components of the vRNPs and to be required for viral mRNA transcription. We provide evidence that, in infected cells, vRNPs co-opt the histone mRNA trimming complex through binding to exonuclease ERI1 to promote viral transcription.
