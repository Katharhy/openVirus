<p>Influenza A viruses (IAV) also rely on cellular proteins to complete their cycle through complex and highly coordinated virus-host interactions (reviewed in (

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)). IAVs are major pathogens responsible for seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Their segmented, negative sense RNA genome is encapsidated with the nucleoprotein (NP) and associated to the heterotrimeric polymerase (FluPol), thus forming the viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNP). In the nucleus of infected cells, the FluPol, composed of PB1, PB2 and PA, conducts the transcription of the genomic viral RNA (vRNA) into viral messenger RNA (mRNA) and the replication of vRNA 
 <italic>via</italic> an intermediate, complementary RNA (cRNA) (reviewed in (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)). Viral mRNA synthesis is primed through short oligonucleotides snatched from capped cellular transcripts by the cap binding domain of PB2 and the endonuclease domain of PA (reviewed in (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)). Polyadenylation occurs through stuttering of the polymerase at an oligoU stretch near the 5′ end of the vRNA. Additional viral proteins that associate to the vRNPs are implicated in the regulation of transcription and replication (NS1, NEP) or mediate nuclear export of neosynthesized viral vRNPs (M1 and NEP) (
