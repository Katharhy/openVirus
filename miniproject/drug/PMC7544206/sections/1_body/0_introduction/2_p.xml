<p>Many cellular exonucleases involved in RNA decay are known to restrict viral replication. The exonucleases Xrn1 and Xrn2 restrict hepatitis C virus replication in association with the 5′ RNA triphosphatase DUSP11 (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Several RNA viruses are also sensitive to the nonsense-mediated decay pathway because of shared features with aberrant RNAs, such as the presence of multiple ORFs on the same RNA or large 3′ untranslated regions (reviewed in (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)). Some core components of the RNA exosome, a major cellular RNA surveillance machinery, as well as two associated exonucleases, Rrp6 and Dis3, were shown to restrict the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus, Sindbis virus and Rift Valley fever virus (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Conversely, components of RNA decay machineries were reported to support viral replication. The Sm-like proteins (Lsm1–7) are known for their involvement in mRNA degradation and yet, they are hijacked by several viruses to promote viral RNA translation and replication (

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The cytoplasmic 5′-3′ exoribonuclease NbXRN4 was reported to promote the replication of Bamboo Mosaic virus (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The putative 3′-5′ RNA exonuclease ERI3 associates with DENV-2 genomic RNA and is required for viral RNA synthesis (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Lastly, flaviviruses were shown to exploit the exonuclease Xrn1 to produce non-coding subgenomic RNAs required for pathogenicity (
