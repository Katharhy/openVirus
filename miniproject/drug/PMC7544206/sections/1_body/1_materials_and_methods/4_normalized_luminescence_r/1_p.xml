<p>For the NLR method, the Gluc1-viral proteins/Gluc2-ExoRDec pairs were tested in GPCA along with controls consisting of 200 ng of Gluc1-viral proteins plus 100 ng of Gluc2 and 200 ng of Gluc1 plus 100 ng of Gluc2-ExoRDec. The NLR was calculated as the fold change of protein pairs values over the sum of the control values. For a given protein pair A and B, NLR = (Gluc1-A + Gluc2-B)/[(Gluc1-A + Gluc2) + (Gluc1 + Gluc2-B)] (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). NLR validation experiments were conducted three times for each ExoRDec factor. As described in (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), for each viral protein tested, a Random Reference Set of 11 factors was used to calculate a 99.73% confidence interval. The upper limit of the confidence interval was set as the positive threshold.
