<p>HEK-293T cells were transfected with Strep-ERI1 or Strep-empty expressing plasmids using linear PEI (polyethylenimine) and infected with A/WSN/33(H1N1) at an moi of 5 pfu/cell. Infected HEK-293T cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM MOPS–KOH pH 7.4, 120 mM KCl, 0.5% Igepal, 1× protease inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) supplemented with 200 U/ml RNasin (Promega) or 100 μg/ml RNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific)). For Strep-tag purification, clarified lysates were incubated with Strep-Tactin beads (Strep-Tactin Sepharose High Performance, GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4°C. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer. Protein complexes were eluted from Strep-Tactin beads with desthiobiotin (IBA). For PB2 purification, clarified lysates were cleared for 1 h at 4°C with dynabeads protein A (Invitrogen) to remove aspecific binding and then incubated with anti PB2 antibody (GTX125926, Genetex) overnight at 4°C. Protein complexes were allowed to bind to protein A dynabeads for 1 h at 4°C. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer. Pulled samples were diluted in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by western blot. For histone mRNA co-purification, PB2 pull down was performed as previously described. Beads were diluted in RLT buffer (RNeasy mini kit, QIAGEN) and RNA purification was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription and subsequent qPCR for histone mRNA detection was performed as described above.</p>
