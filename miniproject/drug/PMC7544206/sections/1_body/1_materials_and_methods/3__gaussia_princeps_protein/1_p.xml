<p>HEK-293T cells were seeded into white 96-well plates at 3 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well. After 24h, cells were transfected with linear PEI (polyethylenimine) (Polysciences Inc.) with 200 ng of plasmid expressing a viral protein fused to Gluc1 at its N-terminus (PB1, PB1, PA, NP, NS1, NEP) or at its C-terminus (M1) and 100 ng of a Gluc2-ExoRDec-expressing plasmid. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were washed with 100 μl of phosphate buffered saline and lysed with 40 μl of Renilla lysis buffer (Promega E2820) for 30 min at room temperature. 
 <italic>Gaussia princeps</italic> luciferase enzymatic activity was measured with a Berthold Centro LB960 luminometer by injecting 50 μl of luciferase substrate reagent (Promega E2820) per well and measuring luminescence for 10s. Results were expressed in relative luminescence units.
