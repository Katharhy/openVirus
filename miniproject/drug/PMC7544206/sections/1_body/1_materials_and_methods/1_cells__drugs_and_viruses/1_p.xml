<p>HEK-293T and A549 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). MDCK and MDCK-SIAT cells (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) were grown in Modified Eagle's Medium (MEM) supplemented with 5% FCS. Cycloheximide (CHX, Sigma) was added to the medium (100 μg/ml) at the time of infection. The A/WSN/33(H1N1), A/Paris/650/2004(H1N1), A/Bretagne/7608/2009(H1N1pdm09) and A/Centre/1003/2012(H3N2) viruses were produced by reverse genetics. For the siRNA screen, cells were infected with A549 cell-adapted H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 viruses obtained by reverse genetics as described in (
