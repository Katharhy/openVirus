<p>HEK 293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well and transfected with 60 ng of Strep-ERI1 plasmids with linear PEI (polyethylenimine). At 24 h post-transfection, cells were infected with A/WSN/33(H1N1) at an moi of 5 pfu/cell. At 3 hpi total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and viral RNAs were quantified as described below.
