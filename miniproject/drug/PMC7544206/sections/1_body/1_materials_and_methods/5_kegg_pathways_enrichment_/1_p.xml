<p>Functional enrichment analysis was performed using the ClueGO Cytoscape plug-in v2.5.1 (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The analysis consisted in determining if certain ExoRDec factors showed statistically significant differences regarding the KEGG pathways (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) they were associated to. This enrichment was calculated for two lists of ExoRDec factors: i) interacting and ii) not interacting with viral proteins, along with their first neighbors in the human proteome retrieved from the APID2net database (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), of 294 and 664 proteins respectively. ClueGO parameters were set as follows: statistical test used = enrichment/depletion (two-sided hypergeometric test), multiple test correction method used = Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg, combine clusters with 'or' = true, percentage for a cluster to be significant = 75.0, kappa score threshold = 0.45.
