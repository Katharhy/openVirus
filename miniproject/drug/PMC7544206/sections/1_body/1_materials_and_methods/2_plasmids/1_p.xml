<p>The Gateway entry plasmids containing the ExoRDec ORFs were obtained from the human ORFeome resource. To generate vectors encoding Gluc1-, Gluc2-, GlucFL-, 3XFlag and Strep-fusion proteins, the ORFs were transferred respectively into a Gateway-compatible pGluc-GW, pCIneo3XFlag-GW or pIBA105-GW destination plasmid. All constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing and the sequences were deposited into GenBank under accession numbers
