<p>RNAs were extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) from A/WSN/33(H1N1) infected A549 cells. Strand-specific RT-qPCR for NP and NA vRNAs and mRNAs was performed as described in (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Briefly, cDNAs complementary of NP and NA vRNAs and mRNAs were synthesized using tagged primers in order to add a strand specific tag unrelated to influenza virus at the 5′ end. Tagged cDNAs were then used as a template for the qPCR reaction using a tag specific primer and a segment specific primer. For HIST1H2AB mRNA amplification reverse transcription was carried out using random hexamer and SuperScript II (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer's instructions. All qPCRs were performed using SYBR green reagent (Agilent Technologies) on a Light Cycler 480 (Roche) using primers as described in (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) to specifically detect NP and NA mRNAs and vRNAs, or HIST1H2AB F (5′-cacacgccccaagagtttat-3′) and HIST1H2AB R (5′-ctccgcaaaggcaactactc-3′) primers to detect HIST1H2AB mRNA (
