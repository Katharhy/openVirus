Influenza A viruses are major human pathogens that are responsible for seasonal epidemics, but the interplay between viral proteins and cellular exonucleases has never been specifically studied. Here, using a stringent interactomics screening strategy and an siRNA-silencing approach, we identified eight cellular factors among a set of 75 cellular proteins carrying exo(ribo)nuclease activities or involved in RNA decay processes that support influenza A virus multiplication. We show that the exoribonuclease ERI1 interacts with the PB2, PB1 and NP components of the viral ribonucleoproteins and is required for viral mRNA transcription. More specifically, we demonstrate that the protein-protein interaction is RNA dependent and that both the RNA binding and exonuclease activities of ERI1 are required to promote influenza A virus transcription. Finally, we provide evidence that during infection, the SLBP protein and histone mRNAs co-purify with vRNPs alongside ERI1, indicating that ERI1 is most probably recruited when it is present in the histone pre-mRNA processing complex in the nucleus.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Union Seventh Framework Programme</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="DOI">10.13039/100011102</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>278433-PREDEMICS</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>LabEx Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>10-LABX-0062</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Minist&#x000e8;re de l&#x02019;Education Nationale, de la Recherche et de Technologie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche M&#x000e9;dicale</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="DOI">10.13039/501100002915</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDT201805005278</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Marie Sk&#x00142;odowska-Curie European Union Horizon 2020</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>665850</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>RNA decay is a central cellular process that regulates RNA stability and quality, and thereby gene expression (reviewed in (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)). Controlling transcript stability is essential to ensure proper cellular physiology and the establishment of adapted responses to viral infection. Growing evidence points to the existence of a large interplay between eukaryotic RNA turnover machineries and viral proteins. On the one hand, viruses evolved mechanisms to evade RNA degradation pathways, and on another hand, they can manipulate these pathways to promote their replication (reviewed in (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;8</xref>)).</p><p>Many cellular exonucleases involved in RNA decay are known to restrict viral replication. The exonucleases Xrn1 and Xrn2 restrict hepatitis C virus replication in association with the 5&#x02032; RNA triphosphatase DUSP11 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Several RNA viruses are also sensitive to the nonsense-mediated decay pathway because of shared features with aberrant RNAs, such as the presence of multiple ORFs on the same RNA or large 3&#x02032; untranslated regions (reviewed in (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)). Some core components of the RNA exosome, a major cellular RNA surveillance machinery, as well as two associated exonucleases, Rrp6 and Dis3, were shown to restrict the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus, Sindbis virus and Rift Valley fever virus (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Conversely, components of RNA decay machineries were reported to support viral replication. The Sm-like proteins (Lsm1&#x02013;7) are known for their involvement in mRNA degradation and yet, they are hijacked by several viruses to promote viral RNA translation and replication (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The cytoplasmic 5&#x02032;-3&#x02032; exoribonuclease NbXRN4 was reported to promote the replication of Bamboo Mosaic virus (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The putative 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; RNA exonuclease ERI3 associates with DENV-2 genomic RNA and is required for viral RNA synthesis (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Lastly, flaviviruses were shown to exploit the exonuclease Xrn1 to produce non-coding subgenomic RNAs required for pathogenicity (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>Influenza A viruses (IAV) also rely on cellular proteins to complete their cycle through complex and highly coordinated virus-host interactions (reviewed in (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)). IAVs are major pathogens responsible for seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Their segmented, negative sense RNA genome is encapsidated with the nucleoprotein (NP) and associated to the heterotrimeric polymerase (FluPol), thus forming the viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNP). In the nucleus of infected cells, the FluPol, composed of PB1, PB2 and PA, conducts the transcription of the genomic viral RNA (vRNA) into viral messenger RNA (mRNA) and the replication of vRNA <italic>via</italic> an intermediate, complementary RNA (cRNA) (reviewed in (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)). Viral mRNA synthesis is primed through short oligonucleotides snatched from capped cellular transcripts by the cap binding domain of PB2 and the endonuclease domain of PA (reviewed in (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)). Polyadenylation occurs through stuttering of the polymerase at an oligoU stretch near the 5&#x02032; end of the vRNA. Additional viral proteins that associate to the vRNPs are implicated in the regulation of transcription and replication (NS1, NEP) or mediate nuclear export of neosynthesized viral vRNPs (M1 and NEP) (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;24</xref>).</p><p>Some exonucleases were reported to restrict or support the replication of influenza A viruses. Interferon-stimulated exonuclease gene 20 protein (ISG20) interacts with influenza virus NP and inhibits viral replication (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Binding of NS1 to viral dsRNA produced during viral replication counteracts IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-induced RNase L activation (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). PA-X endonucleolytic cleavage of host transcripts followed by their degradation by the 5&#x02032;-3&#x02032; exonuclease Xrn1 was shown to promote host shut off (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Recently, the RNA exosome, known to restrict many RNA viruses, was found to be hijacked by the IAV FluPol to snatch 5&#x02032; caps from host non-coding RNAs or mRNAs that would otherwise be targeted to degradation (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>This led us to systematically screen interactions between IAV viral proteins that constitute or bind to the vRNPs and a selected set of 75 cellular proteins carrying exoribonuclease (Exo) activities or associated with RNA decay (RDec) processes (referred to as the ExoRDec library). Influenza A virus proteins exhibited preferential targeting of RNA degradation pathways and eight targeted cellular factors were identified as contributing to viral multiplication. Among them, ERI1, a 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; cellular exoribonuclease of the DEDDh family involved in the processing of small RNA, ribosomal RNA and histone mRNA (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29&#x02013;36</xref>), was found to interact with several components of the vRNPs and to be required for viral mRNA transcription. We provide evidence that, in infected cells, vRNPs co-opt the histone mRNA trimming complex through binding to exonuclease ERI1 to promote viral transcription.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Cells, drugs and viruses</title><p>HEK-293T and A549 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS).

The lower NLR values obtained with PB1 and especially M1 indicate a weaker association of ERI1 with these viral proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), suggesting that, within the vRNPs, PB2 and NP are the main targets of ERI1. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using transient transfection expression in HEK-293T cells further confirmed the specific interaction of ERI1 with PB2 and NP, and to lesser extend with PB1, while no significant interaction was detected for M1, corroborating the GPCA results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>).

During single cycle infection in ERI1 silenced A549 cells compared to control, the accumulation of the viral proteins PB2, NP and NS1 was reduced at 3hpi. Such decrease was less obvious at 6 hpi, at which point accumulation of the late viral proteins M1, M2 and NA was slightly reduced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The effects of ERI1 depletion were thus primarily detected during the initial steps of viral protein accumulation, suggesting an involvement of ERI1 from the early stages of the viral life cycle, possibly during transcription. Indeed, viral mRNA production was reduced in ERI1 silenced A549 cells compared to control as soon as 3hpi, and more obviously at 6hpi (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Likewise, a decrease in vRNA production was also apparent at 6hpi in ERI1 silenced cells. This might be a consequence of the decreased production of viral proteins due to impaired viral transcription (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">B</xref>), since the synthesis of new genomic vRNA requires the accumulation of neo-synthesized viral replication proteins. Conversely, overexpression of ERI1 led to an increase in viral transcription as assessed by mRNA/vRNA ratios (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Last, these ratios were also reduced in ERI1 silenced cells (compared to cells treated with control siRNA) under cycloheximide (CHX) treatment that is known to block <italic>de novo</italic> translation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">E</xref>).

Furthermore, the detection of an effect on the viral life cycle for eight of 19 interactors identified among the 75 tested from the original ExoRDec library, underscores the performance of the stringent protein-protein interaction screen applied here for the identification of functionally relevant factors. Some of the identified factors have been previously reported to be essential for IAV replication, such as the Double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase ADAR and the U6 snRNA phosphodiesterase USB1 (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), or to be important for the replication of other RNA viruses, such as the Apoptosis-Enhancing Nuclease AEN and the DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic site) lyase APEX1 (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54&#x02013;56</xref>). Interestingly, redundant targeting was observed in most instances, with factors targeted by three (ADAR, HMGA2) or even four (ADARB1, EXOSC6, ERI1) viral proteins. This redundant targeting may reflect the importance for the virus to target those specific pathways. Remarkably, our study identifies the exosome subunit EXOSC6, found by others to interact with PA, as an interactor of PB2, PB1, NS1 and NEP (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Such broad targeting of the RNA exosome by viral proteins further highlights its crucial requirement in the IAV life cycle. A more extensive comparative screening with proteins from a wider range of IAV strains will however be required to further generalize these observations. It is interesting to note that the viral protein PA-X was not included in our initial screening of the ExoRDec library because of technical constraints related to the PCA design. As PA-X is known to be tightly associated to RNA decay (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), its screening against the ExoRDec library could also be of great interest.</p><p>In the present study, we focused on ERI1 found in our screen as an interactor of PB2, PB1, NP and, to a lesser extent, of M1 proteins of IAV, although subsequent experiments showed that the interaction with PB1 and M1 was probably indirect and mediated by RNA. ERI1 belongs to the DEDDh exoribonuclease family. Some exonucleases in this family have already been reported to be essential for the multiplication of different RNA viruses. For instance, coronavirus nsp14 protein was shown to carry an exoribonuclease activity required to maintain viral replication fidelity, while Lassa fever virus nucleoprotein possesses a DEDDh exonuclease activity essential to suppress host innate immune system activation (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). An ERI1 homologue, the putative 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; RNA exonuclease ERI3, is critical for DENV-2 RNA synthesis and viral particle production, and was found to associate with DENV-2 RNA (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>In the cell, ERI1 has multiple roles both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. In the latter, ERI1 mostly plays a role in histone mRNA maturation, while in the cytoplasm, it is involved in histone mRNA decay, 5.8S rRNA maturation and miRNA homeostasis (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29&#x02013;36</xref>). A common feature of all these processes is the prime role of ERI1 in RNA 3&#x02032; end trimming. Trimming of histone pre-mRNA by ERI1 requires the recognition of the 3&#x02032; stem loop upstream of the processing site. However, ERI1 trimming of other RNA species does not seem to require a specific RNA sequence nor structure aside from the existence of a 3&#x02032; ssRNA overhang. Various RNA species can thus be potential substrates for ERI1, but whether these include viral mRNAs is not known. Our data uncovered a role of ERI1 in promoting viral transcription of influenza A viruses, mostly evident during the early stages of the viral life cycle, for which both ERI1 activities - RNA binding and 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; exoribonuclease activities - were shown to be required. The RNA binding activity requirement could at least be explained by the recruitment of ERI1 when it is stably bound to histone pre-mRNAs in association with SLBP, as supported by our results showing an RNA dependency in an infectious context. Since ERI1 seems also able to directly interact with IAV viral RNA, one could envision that ERI1, recruited as part of the histone processing complex, could then directly interact with the viral proteins of the vRNPs in order to be loaded onto viral RNAs. The role of the exonuclease domain is also not clear at this stage. Interestingly, the exonuclease domain of ERI3 was not shown to be required for its role in promoting Dengue virus 2 mRNA synthesis (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), suggesting that the mechanisms involved in promoting viral transcription, which are also still unknown for Dengue virus, might differ. We observed a clear enrichment in viral mRNAs co-purified with ERI1. Since ERI1 is known to play a role in the maturation of cellular RNAs, one could envisage that ERI1 contributes to the maturation of IAV mRNAs during synthesis, which is necessary for their efficient translation. RNA-seq methodology might be an interesting tool to test this hypothesis.</p><p>The differences observed in viral transcription levels between non-target and ERI1 silenced cells, with consequences at the protein level, are unlikely to be linked to a role of ERI1 in viral mRNA splicing or export from the nucleus. Indeed, the effect of ERI1 silencing was observed at similar levels for the products of unspliced viral transcripts, such as NP, PB2, NS1 and later NA and M1, and for the M2 protein translated from an M1 spliced transcript. Our data are more in favor of a role of ERI1 in viral mRNA maturation and quality control, whose defect in the very early steps of infection would reduce the efficiency of early protein synthesis following primary transcription. A decreased production of the viral proteins involved in transcription/replication of the viral genome could then induce a reduction of the secondary produced viral transcripts at later times post infection, consistent with what we observed at the protein level.</p><p>ERI1 could have indirect roles too. For example, like the exonuclease activity of Lassa virus NP which was shown to inhibit innate immunity (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), ERI1 during IAV infection could be hijacked to modulate the innate immunity in order to promote viral transcription. On the other hand, ERI1 is known to regulate the relative abundance of miRNAs (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) and some miRNAs have been reported to interfere with IAV replication, such as miR-584-5p and miR-1.249, or miR-323, miR-491&#x000a0;and miR-654, respectively inhibiting H5N1 and H1N1 by targeting PB2 and PB1 genes (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). ERI1 could therefore be recruited by the IAV vRNPs to target specific miRNA degradation and thus promote viral replication overall. Sequencing the miRNA repertoire upon ERI1 silencing would thus help addressing a potential role of ERI1 in miRNA homeostasis during IAV infection.</p><p>ERI1 targeting by IAV is thus another example supporting the growing evidence of the complex viral hijacking of cellular RNA decay machineries that rewires cellular gene expression in order to create a favorable environment for viral replication. Further work is needed to try and decipher the specific mechanisms, but the interaction identified between ERI1 and PB2/NP could already be considered as a potential target for the development of new antivirals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="SEC5"><title>DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>The plasmid sequences were deposited into GenBank under accession numbers <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="MT966965">MT966965</ext-link> to <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="MT966999">MT966999</ext-link>.
