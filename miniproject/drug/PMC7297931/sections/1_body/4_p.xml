<p id="Par6">It is still unclear why coronavirus disease is milder in the pediatric population, similar to other respiratory viral illnesses. Mortality and morbidity of coronavirus disease are postulated to be due to the exaggerated cytokine storm that results in self-destruction of the lung parenchyma and other organ systems [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Similar to other respiratory viral diseases, such as the seasonal influenza, two demographic groups seem to have a higher propensity to die from the disease, namely frail elderly people with chronic disease and seemingly healthy adults with exacerbated autoinflammatory responses with cytokine storm syndromes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In contrast, two groups of patients seem to survive epidemics of coronavirus infections with very mild symptoms, namely the children and infants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Our pediatric experience concurs with global data and allows us to reassure anxious parents of the benign nature of coronavirus among children and young people. Nevertheless, from a public health perspective, our current imperative is to contain these imported cases and to prevent onward transmissions, especially from children and young people to the elderly and vulnerable patients with co-morbidities. Coronavirus in mild or asymptomatic adolescent returners, like soldiers in the Trojan Horse, have to be contained. Universal masking, vigilant contact tracing, surveillance programs for testing suspected cases and social distancing are proven effective non-pharmaceutical interventions that are indispensable for containing the epidemic. The global battle against the coronavirus continues.
