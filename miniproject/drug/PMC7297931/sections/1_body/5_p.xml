<p id="Par7">The latest engima associated with pediatric COVID-19 is a novel multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) of hyperinflammation resembling toxic shock syndrome, atypical Kawasaki disease (KD) or the Kawasaki disease shock syndrome (KDSS) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Another novel acronym, PIM-TS is coined which stands for pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Although controversial, common respiratory viruses including adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus and respiratory syncytial viral have long been reported to be associated with KD. We postulate that SARS-CoV-2 may behave like any respiratory virus that can occasionally cause MIS, KDSS or the multi-organ dysfunction syndrome so familiar to the intensivists. Perhaps, we do not need another acronym.
