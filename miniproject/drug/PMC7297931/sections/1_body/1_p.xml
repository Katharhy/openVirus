<p id="Par3">According to the data gathered by the Centre for Health Protection, as of May 22, there have been 111 confirmed pediatric cases of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, China consisting of 62 males and 49 females, aged between 0 and 18 years old. All cases have been reported to be either mild or asymptomatic, with no pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admissions and fortunately no deaths [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Most of the pediatric cases were imported cases (90%), and the remaining were mostly epidemiologically linked with local/possible local cases (7.2%), followed by those epidemiologically linked with imported cases (1.8%) and local cases (1%). The mean age for the imported cases is much higher than that of the non-imported cases (15.1 versus 6.5 years, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). When comparing the local proportion of COVID-19 infections in the 0–19 years age group in Hong Kong, China with other countries (most of these countries use 19-years as their upper age limit), the percentage (14.3%) is very high (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This can be explained by the aforementioned group of overseas students that have been imported to our city. Most of the local imported cases were travelers returning from the UK and the USA [

The infection is generally very mild in children, and 39.6% were asymptomatic. This phenomenon is consistent with our experience with SARS 17 years ago, when most of the infected children also had mild clinical manifestations [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Hence, it is reassuring that children are less likely to be adversely affected by COVID-19. In contrast, mortality appears to be higher in the local adult population at approximately 0.4% and even higher (3.7%) in the US [
