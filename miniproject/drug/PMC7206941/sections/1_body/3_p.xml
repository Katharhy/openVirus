<p>The assistance battlefront is another relevant focus of AMIBâ€™s effort. Our challenge will be to provide the best possible care to patients, with safety for the professionals in charge of their respective work shifts. Available reports report that there has been occupational contamination and even deaths of infected professionals. In view of this evidence, it is essential to adopt the measures already disclosed by AMIB, available on its website (

Any breach of the announced protocols is not safe. Adherence to these recommendations will increase the time dedicated to the care of patients and managers should be alert to mobilize other professionals for back-up tasks, thus relieving those who are directly involved in caring for patients. Another responsibility of the Technicians and Managers is to ensure that all recommended personal protective equipment is available at all times. Our strength should not be exposed to additional risks. Whenever possible, young people should be assigned to direct care. Older people can supervise and carry out rear tasks. Visits and the flow of people in the units must be restricted.
