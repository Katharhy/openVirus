<p>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and immunofluorescence assays are often used to diagnose HMPV [

 <xref rid="B30-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These assays can score the viral nucleic acids and proteins of an acute infection and they may also score residual viral components after replication-competent virus has been cleared. Serum anti-viral antibodies serve as another marker of HMPV exposure, because the B cell response to HMPV is rapid and long-lasting [

 <xref rid="B30-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Serological findings suggest HMPV has been circulating globally in humans for decades or more before its first discovery, and that most children are first infected with HMPV before the age of five [

 <xref rid="B33-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], with nearly 100% of teenagers and adults being seropositive [

The late discovery of HMPV was likely due to the virusâ€™s slow replication, requirement for trypsin, and minimal cytopathic effects (CPE) in many tissue culture cell lines. HMPV disease was often attributed to another virus such as RSV or influenza. Tertiary monkey kidney epithelial cells were eventually found to support robust HMPV amplification and CPE [
