<p>Sendai virus (SeV) was recently tested as a candidate vector for an HMPV F vaccine [
 <xref rid="B65-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. SeV is a mouse parainfluenza virus, closely related to hPIV-1. The recombinant was produced by inserting the HMPV F gene into the SeV backbone between F and HN genes. When the vaccine was delivered intranasally to small research animals, it induced a robust immune response that was protective against an HMPV challenge.
