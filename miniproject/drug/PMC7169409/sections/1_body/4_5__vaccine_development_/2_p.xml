<p>Several HMPV vaccines have been produced and tested in pre-clinical studies [

 <xref rid="B30-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These include recombinant vaccines such as vaccines based on alpha virus or bovine PIV3 [

 <xref rid="B61-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Killed virus has been tested, although there is a concern that killed virus may exacerbate disease, as was the case in the 1960s when a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine was clinically tested [
 <xref rid="B62-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Protein, peptide, and virus like particle (VLP) vaccines have also been tried. Live-attenuated HMPV vaccines have been produced, including cold-adapted variants and viruses with mutations in the F or polymerase proteins [
