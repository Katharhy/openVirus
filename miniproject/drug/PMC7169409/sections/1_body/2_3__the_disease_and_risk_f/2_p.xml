<p>Among numerous studies of hospitalized and outpatient children worldwide, HMPV has been associated with between 6% and 40% of respiratory illnesses [

In a study by Davis et al. in the United States, hospitalizations were highest for children under the age of 2 years (approximately 2 per 1000 person years). More than 50% of all hospitalized children had an underlying complex chronic condition such as a pulmonary disorder [

In this study, the most severe symptoms were observed among children between the ages of 1 and 2 years, indicating that maternal antibodies provided a degree of protection to infants. Risk factors for serious disease included a history of premature birth or chronic airway disease. A history of premature birth was similarly identified as a risk factor for severe HMPV disease by Pancham et al. in their study of pre-school children [
