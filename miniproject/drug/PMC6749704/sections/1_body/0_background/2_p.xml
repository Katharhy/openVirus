<p id="Par12">The majority of high-income countries have concentrated hepatitis C epidemics with transmission predominantly occurring among PWID [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In settings where the prevalence of hepatitis C among PWID is less than approximately 50%, mathematical models show that treatment-as-prevention can be effective at reducing incidence as long as treatment scale-up is rapid, has sufficiently high coverage, and is supported by harm reduction to minimise re-infection and prevent epidemic rebound [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Many high-income countries have well-established health systems that are equipped to do this, for example Australia, Canada, and a number of European countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, if the prevalence of hepatitis C among PWID is extremely high (greater than approximately 75%, such as Fiji, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, and Pakistan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]), it is unlikely that even three monthly testing of PWID would be sufficient to achieve major reductions in incidence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Settings with high prevalence among PWID are therefore likely to need significant additional prevention measures to achieve hepatitis C elimination.
