<p id="Par34">For countries with concentrated epidemics, the price point for a vaccine to reduce the total cost of the optimal strategy was a median US$247 (IQR US$204–442) per course (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix E—Table S7). Below these threshold prices, the savings from less frequent testing and treatment requirements among PWID outweighed the additional cost of the vaccine. For countries with mixed epidemics, the price point for a vaccine to reduce the total cost of the optimal strategy was a median US$1.36 (IQR US$0.94–3.04) per course (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix E—Table S7). The price point was much lower for settings with mixed epidemics because the vaccine needed to be delivered at much larger scale.
