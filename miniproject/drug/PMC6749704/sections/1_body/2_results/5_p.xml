<p id="Par36">For 14 countries (8%), the optimal non-vaccine strategy involved no testing and treatment programme among PWID. Common to these countries is a very high hepatitis C prevalence among PWID (&gt;â€‰80%). The extremely high prevalence in these settings meant that there were not many uninfected PWID, and so hepatitis C incidence was low. Scaling up treatment led to an increase in the number of susceptible PWID and a subsequent increase in incidence. Therefore, according to our modelled definition of optimal, the non-vaccination strategy with the lowest cumulative incidence in 2030 involved no intervention or cost, but also had no impact on the epidemic. This illustrates some of the challenges faced when aiming for elimination in high prevalence settings.</p>
