<p id="Par29">An 
 <italic>optimal WHO incidence reduction target strategy</italic> was determined for each country, with and without a vaccine available, as follows. First, all combinations of non-vaccine interventions in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> were run, and the corresponding cumulative incidence (2018–2030), cumulative costs of testing and treatment (2018–2030), and relative reduction in incidence by 2030 were recorded. Scenarios were considered dominated if they cost more but prevented fewer cumulative cases than another scenario, and dominated scenarios were excluded from further consideration. Among the non-dominated scenarios, the optimal strategy was considered to be the one that achieved an 80% reduction in incidence by 2030 in the most cost-effective way (as measured by cost per incident case averted). Where no scenarios could achieve this level of incidence reduction, the non-dominated scenario with the greatest 2030 incidence reduction was selected. This process was repeated with a broader set of scenarios that included all vaccine and non-vaccine intervention options. Case study examples are presented for Australia, Brazil, China, Egypt, and the USA in Additional file
