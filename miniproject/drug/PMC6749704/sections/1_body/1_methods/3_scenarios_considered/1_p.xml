<p id="Par24">The interventions considered are described in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and include all combinations of (a) testing/treatment of PWID, (b) testing/treatment of the general community, (c) testing/treatment/vaccination of PWID, (d) testing/treatment/vaccination of the general community, and (e) an age-based vaccination programme for the general community. The model was projected between 2018 and 2030, and a 5-year period (2018–2023) was used to scale-up all interventions except age-based vaccination, which was modelled to begin immediately.
