<p id="Par25">For each country, incidence rates and prevalence among PWID are partially driven by existing harm reduction coverage. Our main analysis assumed no changes to prevention interventions among PWID; however, alternate scenarios were tested in the sensitivity analysis, where prevention among PWID was scaled up by 20%, 40%, and 60% over a 5-year period (2018–2023). This was implemented as a relative reduction in the force of infection for the fraction of PWID considered to be adequately covered by harm reduction (Table
