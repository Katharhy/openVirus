<p id="Par20">The model was calibrated to 167 countries at the national level, based on population size estimates from UN Population Division [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] data (15–64 years), the estimated prevalence of injecting drug use [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and the prevalence of hepatitis C among PWID [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and the general population [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix A). The models were calibrated by fitting the uptake rate of injecting drug use and the force of infection constants among PWID and the general community. Limited global datasets were available with hepatitis C prevalence estimates, meaning that the models were calibrated using flat epidemic curves (in the period before the strategies were implemented), to fit these estimates.
