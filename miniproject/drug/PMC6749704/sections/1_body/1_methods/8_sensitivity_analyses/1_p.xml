<p id="Par31">The model was run with alternate assumptions including a 90% or 50% efficacious vaccine rather than 75%, a vaccine being only half as efficacious if administered after successful treatment, no staffing costs or double the staffing costs associated with delivering testing (+/− vaccination) and treatment services, 5 or 100 years duration of protection from the vaccine rather than 10 years, an average of 90 days between Ab and RNA tests rather than 60 days, antibody testing and RNA testing occurring on the same day (to reflect a rapid point-of-care antibody test), an average of 60 days from diagnosis to treatment rather than 30 days, 70% retention in care following a positive antibody test rather than 80%, and half the test positivity rate among the general community (reflecting testing at random). These alternate assumptions were run on the theoretical settings in order to assess any dependence on epidemic type and initial prevalence, and the results are provided in Additional file
