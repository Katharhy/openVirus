<p id="Par30">A Monte Carlo probabilistic uncertainty analysis was undertaken, where 100 random input parameter sets were drawn and uncertainty in outputs were estimated as the central 95 percentiles of these runs (parameters for the force of infection constants, treatment efficacy, costs, rates of retention in care, and times to progress along the care cascade were randomly selected from their uncertainty ranges or +/− 10% using uniform probability distributions). However, uncertainty in the coverage of health service parameter (when it was varied between 70 and 90%) was more than the combined uncertainty from these parameters. As this is also the parameter with the most uncertainty and practical implications, in order to better reflect true uncertainty we reported wider uncertainty bounds on our outputs corresponding to 70–90% health service coverage.</p>
