<p id="Par43">The total cost of reaching the WHO hepatitis C elimination targets has been estimated at US$51 billion globally [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. For many countries, the direct costs associated with hepatitis C are currently low, because there are no or limited services available to manage hepatitis C-related liver disease. As a result, the required outlay on hepatitis C testing and treatment programmes represents new costs with minimal immediate direct economic benefits. However, when the indirect economic benefits of hepatitis C elimination are considered, such as a larger and more productive workforce, this spending has been estimated to lead to a US$19 billion return on investment by 2030 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The issue of cost is therefore largely one of affordability. This is relevant because in this study we have modelled the use of a vaccine alongside the scaling up of other programmes as a way to improve prevention and reduce hepatitis C transmission—only one component of hepatitis C elimination—and the vaccine was modelled to be delivered through testing and treatment programmes because they will also be required to reduce hepatitis C morbidity and mortality. Our estimate that a US$200 per course vaccine could reduce the cost of elimination by US$7.4 billion should therefore be interpreted as approximately a 15% reduction in the estimated total cost, should financing be obtained for hepatitis C elimination.
