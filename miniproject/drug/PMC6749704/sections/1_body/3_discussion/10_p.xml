<p id="Par46">Much of the cost-effectiveness of a future vaccine will be driven by currently unknown properties such as duration of protection, storage requirements, shelf life, number of doses required for protection, and cross-genotype efficacy. For example, if a vaccine were only effective for genotype 1, additional genotype testing may be required alongside our modelled “test (treat) and vaccinate” strategies which would greatly influence cost. If or when a vaccine does become available, follow-up studies are warranted to assess and compare the cost-effectiveness of different implementation strategies against various willingness-to-pay thresholds. Instead, the primary aim of this study was to generate evidence that a vaccine for hepatitis C has the potential to unlock health and economic benefits beyond what is achievable with DAAs alone. We modelled vaccine interventions to be scaled up between 2018 and 2023 and maintained until 2030. While this cannot happen as a vaccine is many years away, this time period is the window where DAA treatments are expected to have their greatest impact, with the model projecting that even in this period a vaccine would be a critical biomedical intervention. As more treatment uptake and epidemic data become available, new vaccine scenarios should be modelled based on the updated and more detailed epidemic curves of individual countries, in particular in the context of stabilised treatment.</p>
