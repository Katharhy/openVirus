<p id="Par37">This study shows that vaccines can play an important role in the elimination of hepatitis C. We found that for the majority of settings, the WHO target of an 80% reduction in hepatitis C incidence by 2030 is unlikely to be achieved without additional prevention measures. Integrating a vaccine within hepatitis C testing and treatment programmes could greatly improve the feasibility and likelihood of reaching the WHO elimination incidence reduction target by directly reducing transmission and reducing the high-frequency testing burden among risk populations.</p>
