<p id="Par40">For concentrated epidemic settings, which represent the majority of developed countries, a vaccine could significantly reduce the costs of hepatitis C elimination. When a vaccine was modelled at US$200 per dose, 66 countries were identified where it would reduce the cost of reaching the WHO incidence reduction target, with an aggregate cost saving of US$7.4 billion. This is because of (a) the reduced number of PWID requiring regular screening because of their vaccination status, (b) the reduced frequency of screening required, and (c) the reduced number of treatments required. Compared to achieving elimination with testing and treatment alone, the price point to save costs by including a vaccine was a median US$247 (IQR US$204–442) and US$1.36 (IQR US$0.94–3.04) per course in countries with concentrated and mixed epidemic settings, respectively. Therefore, a vaccine for hepatitis C must be cheap and simple to manufacture so that it is economically feasible to deliver at scale in low- and middle-income countries, with some costs potentially offset by profits in high-income countries. By way of comparison, the sale price of vaccines for other diseases varies greatly by pathogen and also by country [
