<p id="Par44">The total cost of developing a vaccine from discovery through to licensure varies widely but has been estimated at US$0.5â€“1.0 billion [

While much can be learned from this study, it is a reminder that a vaccine for hepatitis C will still require significant research and development investment. By comparison, billions of dollars have been invested in HIV vaccine development; in 2019, there were 39 ongoing HIV vaccine trials, with 28 past and current phase II trials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. For hepatitis C, the market size of a vaccine will be determined by who is to be vaccinated (target population), how often (life-long versus waning immunity with a need for revaccination) and which countries adopt a vaccination programme, with most profits derived in developed countries. However, a lack of data and a reliance on DAAs to underpin global elimination efforts is blocking interest in hepatitis C vaccine development. Like almost all vaccines, a public-private partnership is likely to be required to fund a future candidate, but to form such partnerships there must be a shift in global opinion towards one that supports the urgent development of a preventive vaccine.
