<p id="Par45">The main limitations of this study relate to the hypothetical vaccine. Prophylactic vaccines for hepatitis C are currently undergoing clinical trials, and their final properties are yet to be determined. First, for our main analysis, we assumed a 75% efficacious vaccine was available with a 10-year duration of protection, which is conservative compared to what may be achievable. Second, we assumed that the vaccine had a single efficacy value (modelled as a population average across genotypes and age groups) and that the vaccine efficacy was the same in naive individuals as previously infected individuals. It remains to be determined if the immune system is fully restored after attaining DAA-mediated viral clearance and is responsive to hepatitis C vaccination. However, our sensitivity analysis suggests that vaccine efficacy post viral clearance does not change the optimal strategy and has a minor impact on cost. Third, we used a single average cost for a vaccine course that is likely to require multiple doses. Some of the costs of delivering these doses can be minimised by combining with existing interactions with healthcare providers; for example, in the scenarios being considered, the initial dose for adults is delivered with a testing interaction and so no additional staff costs would be required, and for adolescents much of the delivery costs could be avoided by inclusion with human papillomavirus or hepatitis B vaccine schedules. When a vaccine is available, it will also be important to consider the acceptability of the vaccine among all population groups and the potential for loss to follow-up between doses. The potential impact of these assumptions for our results is that (1) the average vaccine efficacy may be different than estimated (e.g. corresponding to the 50% efficacy scenarios in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), (2) the cost of delivery may be higher than estimated (corresponding to the higher cost scenarios in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), or (3) the achievable coverage may be reduced due to loss to follow-up between doses or people opting out of vaccination (corresponding to the lower bounds of error bars). In each of these cases, the model still projects that epidemiological and economic benefits can be gained through vaccine development.
