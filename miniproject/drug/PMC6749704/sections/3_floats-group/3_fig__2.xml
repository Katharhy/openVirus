  <p>Countries where the WHO target of an 80% reduction in incidence by 2030 could be reached with or without a vaccine available. Countries are shown according to whether (a) there was a non-dominated scenario without a vaccine that reached the target (green), (b) the only non-dominated scenarios that reached the target required a vaccine (orange), or (c) there were no non-dominated scenarios that reached the target (red). Projections assume 80% coverage of testing, treatment and vaccination programmes, and a maximum testing frequency of six monthly among PWID</p>
