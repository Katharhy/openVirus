     <p>Individual countries were classified as concentrated or mixed: epidemics were classified as mixed if the country was not in a WHO high income classification AND the total number of people living with hepatitis C was &gt; 5 times the total number of estimated hepatitis C-infected PWID. This classification was used as without modelling transmission among the general population in these settings, the model was unable to produce the correct number of people living with hepatitis C based on injecting drug use-related transmission alone.</p>
     <p>Countries with general community transmission according to the above definition were classified as mixed rather than generalised (at the national level), since their PWID populations had significantly higher hepatitis C prevalence than the general community, and so the epidemics were assumed to have a concentrated component.</p>
