<p>The two types of immune responses are innate and adaptive immune responses 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>. In innate immune system, cells recognize and respond to pathogens in a nonspecific manner. Various types of cells, including B and T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, eosinophils, macrophages, mast cells, and neutrophils are involved in an innate immune response.

 </sup> Antigen presenting cells (APCs) kill the invading pathogens by engulfing and digesting them. Later, they move to the lymph node, where the antigens are presented to the naïve T cells, resulting in differentiation of T helper cells into different effector T cells (CD8 + T Cells/Th1; CD4 + T Cells/Th2).
