<p>BCG induced protection is also reported especially in case of respiratory virus infections. A study on BCG vaccination done in South Africa and in Guinea-Bissau reported up to 70% reduction in the incidence of respiratory tract infection including that of Respiratory Syncytial virus. A similar study showed the protective efficacy of BCG vaccination against influenza A virus and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) where it was shown that peritoneal macrophages are significantly activated by the vaccination to produce protective cytokines.
