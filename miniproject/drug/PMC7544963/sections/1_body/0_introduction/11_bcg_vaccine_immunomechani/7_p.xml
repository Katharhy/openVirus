<p>The shift in immune response toward cellular or humoral immunity occurs through stimulation of phagocytes and the cytokine environment

 </sup> Appropriate stimulation of TH1 immune responses is needed to achieve the therapeutic outcome of BCG vaccine. Inhibition of TH1 and TH2 immune responses occurs through (interleukin) IL-10 and (interferon-gamma) IFN-γ, respectively. Blocking IL-10 or inducing IFN-γ can lead to TH1-dominated immunity that is essential for BCG-mediated heterologous immunity.
