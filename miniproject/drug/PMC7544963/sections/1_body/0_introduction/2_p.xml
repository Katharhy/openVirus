 </sup> Though the origin source of SARS-CoV-2 has not been traced to date, the virus is assumed to be of zoonotic origin (from animals), primarily bats, followed by maintenance of virus in the ecosystem through human-human transmission cycle. A few of the ongoing studies have further expanded COVID-19 hosts, including dogs, cat, and few wild animals.
