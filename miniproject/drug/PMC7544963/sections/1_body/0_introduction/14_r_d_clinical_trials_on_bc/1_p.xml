In summary the clinical trials confirms the investigators hypothesize that BCG vaccination can reduce HCW infection and disease severity during the epidemic phase of SARS-CoV-2. Similar studies are underway in many countries including Murdoch Children’s Research Institute in Australia (MCRI), and India. Since the studies are ongoing, we have to wait to get the concrete conclusion till the end of the study with analyzed data and report with a positive hope to mitigate COVID-19, which is on top priority, globally to avert this public health crisis.
