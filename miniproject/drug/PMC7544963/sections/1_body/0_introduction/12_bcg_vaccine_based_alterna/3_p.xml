 </sup> In the study, analysis of different countries based on wide variation in the intensity of the disease has revealed that in the countries where BCG vaccine is given to newborns and children to prevent childhood TB, the vaccine seems to offer cross-protection against COVID-19.

 </sup> The study reported that countries that have either stopped or do not provide universal BCG vaccination to children, including the United States, Italy, Spain, and France, have more COVID-19 cases and deaths as compared to the countries having universal BCG immunization program. Middle-high- and high-income countries that currently have universal BCG policy have reported 0.78 ± 0.40 deaths per million. A significant difference can be noticed while comparing COVID-19 mortality data from middle-high- and high-income countries that never had a universal BCG policy with the data from countries that have BCG vaccination in their regular immunization programme. The former have a significantly higher mortality rate, 16.39 ± 7.33 deaths per million people. Moreover countries like Japan and Russia where the vaccine composition includes the original BCG strain have shown low per capita death rate compared to European countries where modified BCG strain is used for vaccination.

 </sup> But Brazil is the exception with having second highest number of cases and mortality. The reason for this high number is not clear. Some of the low income countries with universal BCG policy have reported zero deaths per million.
