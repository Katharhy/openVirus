<p>The elderly population is more susceptible than younger people are to many diseases, including influenza, pneumococcal and zoster. In addition, the information on the occurrence of COVID-19 worldwide has provided a strong indication of elderly population more prone to the disease. This increased susceptibility is generally believed to be a result of the aging immune system, which is manifest in lower levels of immune responses to such vaccines in terms of both antibody levels as well as cellular immunity. The figures for age susceptibility pattern are almost similar in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the current SARS-CoV-2 infections.

 </sup> summarized the influence of routine childhood immunization (usually five to six vaccines) on protection against COVID-19. A few vaccines such as Hepatitis B, rubella, mumps, poliomyelitis, and varicella also lead to development of immunity against SARS-CoV-2, and thereby, provide protection against the invasion of the lung cells. The mechanisms have revealed that TH1 cells (CD4+) are stimulated by killed or inactivated vaccines. The activated TH1 cells then lead to an increase in the production of IFN-Î³, IL-2, and IL-12, which aid in maturation of killer T cells and increase the cytotoxic activity of NK cells, thereby, terminating the virus-infected cells.
