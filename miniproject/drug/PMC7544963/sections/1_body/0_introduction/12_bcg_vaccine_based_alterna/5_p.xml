<p>The number of confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19 in the United States, Italy, and Spain has outnumbered that of China, which was the epicenter of the outbreak of the disease first identified in Wuhan city in the beginning of December 2019. Why did COVID-19 spread in China, despite the country having a universal BCG strategy since the 1950s? The reason may be that the virus spread unexpectedly and rapidly without it being recognized as a new virus and one capable of high-level interpersonal spread, while measures were not taken initially to restrain its spread. In addition, banning and weakening of the TB prevention and treatment agencies during Cultural Revolution (1966â€“1976) may also be responsible. This may have produced a pool of potential hosts that could be affected by SARS-CoV-2 and may have played a viral role in spread of COVID-19 transmission. Currently, the condition in China appears to be improving promisingly.
