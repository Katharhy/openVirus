<p>Due to the unavailability of a standard and/or specific drug or an appropriate safe and effective approved vaccine to combat in the battle against COVID-19 pandemic, globally researchers are working to find some alternative therapeutics. Usually, the mechanisms outlined for the release of a safe and effective molecule/drug for use in healthcare settings require a long chain of safety, efficacy and feasibility checks. Thus, a drug/vaccine already in use holds better promise in current emergency and global public health crisis. Therefore, scientists and pharmacologists across the globe are searching for vaccines/drugs in use to flatten the explosive graph of SARS-CoV-2-affected population worldwide.</p>
