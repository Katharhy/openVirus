 </sup> Among all vaccines, BCG is given in highest number to children under five years of age under the universal immunization programme. It is generally given to newborn babies at birth; however, if vaccination is missed at birth, it can be given any time until the age of one. According to the data from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, the percentage of children vaccinated with BCG went up from 92% in 2015–16 to the current 97%. BCG vaccination is above 95% in all the states of India. In India, since the first COVID-19 case was confirmed on January 30, 2020 (Kerala), and the first COVID-19 fatality was confirmed on March 11, 2020 (Karnataka), the total number of confirmed cases has reached to approximately 2.1 million with nearly 43,000 deaths in the following 191 days (WHO Situation Report-201, India as on August 8, 2020).

 </sup> The question before medical researchers is that will BCG vaccination, which had been started in India long ago, help in preventing COVID-19 cases and reducing the death toll?
