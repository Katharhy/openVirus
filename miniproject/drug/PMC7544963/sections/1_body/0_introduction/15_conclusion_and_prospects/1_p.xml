<p>Due to the enormous impact of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, the early research that was mainly focused on the epidemiology and clinical manifestation has turned toward early and accurate diagnosis as well as timely development of an appropriate therapeutic methods and vaccines to control the escalating SARS-CoV-2 infections. Until a suitable cure is available, alternatives like BCG vaccine, which is used for preventing childhood TB, may also be used to provide additional cross-protection against COVID-19 and is a topic of discussion. The initial observations from the countries that have stopped and do not provide childhood BCG vaccination, including the United States, Italy, Spain, and France, revealed that these countries are reporting more COVID-19 cases and deaths than the countries that provide universal BCG vaccination. This higher protection against COVID-19 from the BCG vaccine is assumed to be due to nonspecific and cross-protective immunity.</p>
