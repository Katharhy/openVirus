<p>In addition to DAMPs and pathogen-derived substances including PAMPs, numerous unidentified inflammation-inducing intracellular substances exist. Clinical observations suggest that substances from certain organ-specific cells can injure cells in the same or in other organs. Severe pneumonia and ARDS can be caused by nonpathogen-associated insults such as blunt chest contusion, gastric content aspiration, multiple injuries, multiple transfusions, burns, pancreatitis, near-drowning, inhalation of toxic gas, and amniotic fluid embolism [

Orchitis (or oophoritis), a complication of the mumps, generally appears after swelling of the parotid glands [
 <xref rid="b65-cep-2020-00759" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], suggesting that orchitis-inducing substances may originate in injured parotid gland cells. Sympathetic ophthalmia occurs when a traumatic injury to one eyeball induces inflammation in other healthy eye [

 <xref rid="b67-cep-2020-00759" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In HSP, skin purpuric vasculitis appears mainly in pressured areas such as the buttocks and lower extremities and can be easily elicited by mild external pressure such as a tourniquet test [
 <xref rid="b68-cep-2020-00759" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The initiation of joint symptoms may be related to minor physical trauma at the affected joints such as the knees and hips in many patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis or other adult arthropathies, including osteoarthritis [
 <xref rid="b69-cep-2020-00759" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. These findings suggest that the affected vascular or joint cells in HSP and arthritis may be vulnerable to inflammation as a result of mild physical trauma. Therefore, in viral pneumonia, substances from initially infected cells and those from lung cells affected or injured by immune-mediated insults can induce further inflammation in neighboring lung tissue cells and possibly other organ tissue cells.
