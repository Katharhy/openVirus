<p>DAMPs are substances produced by cells injured in various events, including infection and trauma. Well-studied intracellular DAMPs include high mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1), S100 proteins, and heat-shock proteins [

Binding DAMPs to pattern-recognition receptors on innate immune cells can induce proinflammatory cytokines and other proteins that influence adaptive immune cell functions, such as the determination of T-cell subtypes and autoantibody production [

Elevated levels of intracellular protein DAMPs, such as HMGB-1, S100 proteins, and heat-shock proteins, have been reported in infectious diseases, immune-mediated diseases, cancers, and neurologic diseases [
