<p>A theory or hypothesis is needed to increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of various diseases. We presented the PHS hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis of the diseases, including all infectious diseases, influenza, MP pneumonia, ARDS, KD, and all kidney diseases including genetic diseases and cancers [

In the PHS hypothesis, the adaptive immune system controls pathogenic or etiological protein substances using a recombination of immune genes for B-cell receptors (BCRs) and T-cell receptors (TCRs); B cells control pathogenic proteins through antibody production, and T cells control pathogenic peptides, possibly through TCR-related immune reactions. The innate immune system controls larger substances such as intact viruses, bacteria, and apoptotic bodies through phagocytes, while smaller non-protein substances such as polysaccharides, viral DNAs, and viral RNAs are controlled through TLRs, natural antibodies, complements, and other immune protein systems.
