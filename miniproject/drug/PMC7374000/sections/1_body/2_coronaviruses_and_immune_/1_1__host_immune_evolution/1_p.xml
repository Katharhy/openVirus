<p>Multicellular organisms, including human beings, likely evolved from single-cell organisms in which toxic substances were extremely small, and the protection system may be an intracellular adapted system that consists of immune proteins and peptides such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Multicellular organisms, in contrast, are constructed of many organs, and each organ cell is separated and protected by cell membranes, has different receptors, and produces different proteins. The immune systems of various organisms may have evolved to protect their cells at the molecular level. Plants and insects, which evolved far earlier than mammals, still have only innate immune systems [

It is believed that external insults from natural sources such as toxins and pathogens may not change at a rate sufficient to allow a new immune system to evolve in mammals and other animal species. Furthermore, the innate immune system of mammals can effectively remove external pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and fungi, if the pathogens cannot hide themselves within the hostâ€™s cells. Small substances derived from pathogens such as PAMPs and biochemicals can induce immune reactions through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) similar to Tolls in insects. Therefore, the adaptive immune system of mammals may have evolved against mainly internal insults, including the dysbiotic state of microbiota since mammals are composed of different organ cell types and microbials in the microbiota. Besides the invasion of numerous microbials in the microbiota, each organ cell can produce countless immunologically active substances, including pathogenic proteins and peptides. Given that mammalian immune systems may have evolved to protect self-cells from exposure to toxic cellular components from other self-cells, it is possible that one of the major functions of apoptosis, autophagy, DNA traps of immune cells, and epigenetic changes such as gene methylation within cells may perform this critical role [
