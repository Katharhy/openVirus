<p>Because communication across cells is required to maintain a healthy state in multicellular species, this task involves the production of signalling substances in certain cell lines and receptors on other cells. All human diseases may have etiological or triggering substances of disease onset, ranging from extremely small materials, such as elements or monoamines, to larger materials, such as bacteria and parasites. The former category includes carbon monoxide, nicotine, and chemicals (or drugs) with an affinity for the receptors expressed on or in host cells [
