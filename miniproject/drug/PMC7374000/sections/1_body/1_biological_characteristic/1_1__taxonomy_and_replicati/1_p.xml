<p>Coronaviruses viruses have a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 27–34 kilobases and belong to the Coronaviridae family. Coronaviruses affect mainly mammals and birds; to date, 7 subtypes, including SARS-CoV-2, are known in humans. Human coronaviruses 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1 cause mild respiratory tract infections in the form of the common cold, with rare cases manifesting as severe pneumonia. SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) can cause serious respiratory tract infections, although the majority of infected patients recover completely [

Coronaviruses attach to complementary host cell receptors, and viral RNAs and viral structural proteins are replicated using nonstructural proteins such as polyproteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and the host cell’s ribosomes. Viral RNA and structural proteins are then assembled into progeny viruses. Among the abundant viral RNAs synthesized in virus-infected cells, including 7–10 specific viral mRNAs, only full-length genomic RNA is packaged. Virus-infected cells contain larger numbers of various virus-originating proteins and viral RNAs than the number of intact virions by a factor of 10

Host cell–originating immune proteins such as interferons and immune peptides against invading pathogens and other cell contents are also found in the cells. The clinical manifestations of some viral infections, such as measles, are reportedly associated with viremia from the secondary focus, such as regional lymph nodes [
