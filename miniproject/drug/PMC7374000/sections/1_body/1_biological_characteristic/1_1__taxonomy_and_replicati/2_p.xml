<p>The entire genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported, upon which reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) diagnostic tools have been developed [

 <xref rid="b16-cep-2020-00759" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. RNA viruses can easily exchange RNA within a host and species and possibly across species, like influenza viruses, but how extremely minor changes in structural or nonstructural proteins can induce different levels of virulence and clinical phenotypes in different target-cell injuries are not understood. Also unknown is which viral proteins are immunogenic or pathogenic to host cells. Inactivated intact viruses, attenuated live viruses, viral proteins, and viral nucleic acids have been used for vaccine development [
