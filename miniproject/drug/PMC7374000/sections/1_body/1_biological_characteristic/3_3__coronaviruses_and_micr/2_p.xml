<p>Coronaviruses may have evolved approximately 8,000 years ago, and the most recent common ancestor of coronaviruses in mammals, birds, and humans has been described [

Although viruses in the microbiota of humans have received less research attention, viruses and human species almost certainly coevolved toward a symbiotic relationship. Approximately 8% of the human genome may be related to ancient viral genomes, and in the microbial world, certain bacteriophages (viruses of bacteria) can kill bacteria, whereas other bacteriophages have a symbiotic relationship with the same bacterial hosts [

 <xref rid="b35-cep-2020-00759" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and each outbreak can be initiated by carriers whose viruses have adapted to the host as the normal flora. Because equilibrium between the microbiota and a host’s immune system is constantly evolving such as by the turning of pathogens into normal constituents of the host’s microbiota, the majority of infected patients with adapted pathogens, even younger children with no immunity to a new strain, may be mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic. In this pandemic, infants, neonates, and even fetuses of mothers infected with SARS-COV-2 may have uneventful outcomes [

 <xref rid="b37-cep-2020-00759" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Since the delicate and complex viral replication processes may not be performed by order or information from the viral genome, it is possible that a host may help replicate adapted viruses within certain cells, and viruses may evolve the ability to expel their progeny outside, rather than inside, the host through the engagement of a low-virulent nature as normal flora in the host. Initially severe infectious diseases, including pandemic influenza, scarlet fever, Korean hemorrhagic fever, and infection-related immune-mediated diseases such as KD and Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), have become less severe over time in Korea [
