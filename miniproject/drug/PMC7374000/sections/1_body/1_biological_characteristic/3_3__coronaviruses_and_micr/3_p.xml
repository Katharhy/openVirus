<p>Coronaviruses are species-specific across mammals and birds, as are other viruses and pathogens such as influenza viruses and mycoplasma species. This may be a result of a symbiotic relationship between the species and the adapted virus. Considering their epidemiological characteristics such as a lack of stable carriers in humans, it is possible that zoonotic avian influenza viruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may not be adapted viruses though human-to-human transmission is possible. In the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be competition among adapted strains for predominance in the microbiota, or adaptive viruses may require a new strain to maintain themselves in the microbiota of the host species.</p>
