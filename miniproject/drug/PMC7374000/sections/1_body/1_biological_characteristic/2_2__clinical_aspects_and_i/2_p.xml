<p>Despite the similarity of structural proteins across species-specific viruses, the primary affected organ cells differ among host animals. Humans and chickens suffer most often from respiratory tract cell injury, whereas cows and pigs are affected mainly by gastroenteric cell injury. In influenza virus infections, lower respiratory cells are mainly affected in human and mammals and enteric cells in birds [

Interestingly, during this pandemic, cases of severe Kawasaki disease (KD)-like disease, temporally named “multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)” have been reported in large cities in Western countries, but not in East Asian countries such as Japan and Korea, where KD is endemic. Children affected by MIS-C are older and manifest shock syndrome with acute heart failure, gastroenteric symptoms, and other symptoms like KD [

 <xref rid="b25-cep-2020-00759" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It is unknown whether the disease is associated with SARS-CoV-2 or other pathogens related to the changed environment such as school closure caused by COVID-19. Early intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and corticosteroids appear to effectively lead to early recovery from the disease as shown in KD [
