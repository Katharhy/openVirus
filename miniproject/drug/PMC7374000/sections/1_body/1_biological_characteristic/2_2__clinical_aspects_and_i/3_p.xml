<p>Along with different clinical manifestations, infected patients have differing incubation periods. It is possible that different substances may be produced according to the infected cell, such as upper respiratory epithelial cells versus the regional lymph node cells or lower respiratory endothelial cells. Because the intracellular environment differs among infected cells, the timing and direction of the expulsion of viruses and related substances can also differ. Accordingly, viruses and substances in upper respiratory epithelial cells are easily discharged outside the host, while those in regional lymph node cells or lower respiratory endothelial cells are discharged inside the host. Occasional reported cases of SARS or COVID-19 relapse [
