<p>Although the focus, i.e., the location of initial infected cells in the respiratory tract, and how many cells are infected are not yet known, viruses and substances derived from infected cells can direct their way to the inside of the host as bacterial commensals in microbiota do on occasion. Clinical manifestations and disease severity depend on the amounts of these diverse substances. The infected patients with little or less amounts of these substances may experience asymptomatic or mild infections and can recover rapidly from the disease. Thus, patients after asymptomatic or mild infections can produce a negative result on RT-PCR but a positive result on serology. RT-PCR results can be positive in SARS-CoV-2 carriers after asymptomatic or mild infections. Further, since virus culturing and/or paired immunoglobulin G (IgG) testing is a standard method for confirming viral infection, not all RT-PCR-positive patients may be contagious.</p>
