<p>Epidemiological data on all infected patients during outbreaks can help scientists estimate the potential of herd immunity development to pathogens and predict future progression of the pandemic. In Korea, during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, approximately 1.5% of the total population (~740,000/49,000,000) reportedly had RT-PCR-proven febrile symptoms; of them, a total of 225 patients died for a mortality rate of 0.03% [

The mortality rate of the 2009 pandemic was higher in older patients (&gt;65 years) with underlying diseases despite infection rates being far lower than those of other age groups and might have been lower than the annual seasonal influenza. Postpandemic serologic studies have reported that 40%â€“60% of the population, especially young children and young adults, may be asymptomatic or have only mild infection [
