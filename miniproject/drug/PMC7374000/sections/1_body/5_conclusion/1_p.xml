<p>The etiologic agent of COVID-19 is SARS-CoV-2, but many issues in COVID-19 as well as other infectious diseases remain unresolved. To further increase our understanding of the issues, including the pathogenesis of COVID, we discussed the issues and proposed a mechanism of acute organ cell injury in COVID-19 using the PHS hypothesis. Pneumonia patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show hypercytokinemia with corresponding lymphopenia in the early disease stage; thus, early immune modulators are necessary. However, the guidelines recommend the use of corticosteroids only for patients with advanced pneumonia or ARDS. This policy may be unwarranted since the immunopathogenesis of pneumonia may be the same for all patients regardless of severity or age and the critical immune-mediated lung injury begins in the early stage of COVID-19.</p>
