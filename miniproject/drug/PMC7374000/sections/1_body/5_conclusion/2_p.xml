<p>Based on the PHS hypothesis and our previous experiences with viral infections such as influenza, acute bronchiolitis, and MP pneumonia, a rationale for early corticosteroid treatment was presented. Corticosteroids may exert a direct influence on whole-host immune systems and induce early stabilization of aberrant immune reactions on lung injury in COVID-19. We hope that this article will be helpful for clinicians, researchers, health care workers, and administrators tasked with responding to this ongoing pandemic disease.</p>
