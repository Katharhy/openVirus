<p>As previously suggested, the immunopathogenesis of COVID may involve 2 stages of disease progression: first, target-cell injury caused by aberrant immune reactions against substances from infected cells; and second, further target and other cell injuries caused by substances from target-cell injury and/or secondary bacterial invasion. During immune responses to viral insults, all host immune cells may communicate with each other via cytokine networks and major histocompatibility complexes [

Therefore, diverse immune proteins, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and other cytokines and immune proteins may be involved in inflammatory processes in COVID-19 and other immune-mediated diseases. Blocking one of the inflammatory pathways could reduce inflammation and result in clinical improvement. Therefore, antivirals, interferons, immune-modulating drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, biologics for cytokines, antisera obtained from recovered patients, and other anti-inflammatory drugs may effectively improve morbidity in patients with COVID-19 by reducing the inflammation-inducing substances or altering the disease process. However, these drugs, including high-dose corticosteroids and IVIG, have a limited effect on advanced ARDS because they cannot resolve the excess inflammation-inducing substances associated with target-cell injuries and insults from secondary bacterial invasion. The hostâ€™s immune system cannot call up soldiers into the extensively extended battlefields. There have been few well-designed randomized controlled trials for these drugs and no proven effective drugs for improving mortality [
