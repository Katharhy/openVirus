Viral diseases, including COVID-19, are self-limiting, meaning that the hostâ€™s immune system can theoretically control the insults without complications. However, a small proportion of COVID-19 patients experience progression of the disease or complications, such as severe progressive pneumonia and ARDS. Thus, clinicians and researchers are searching for treatment modalities to prevent disease progression and complications. Due to a lack of data on antivirals for children, study groups recommend that outpatients and hospitalized patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 could be managed with supportive care, including herbal medicine [
