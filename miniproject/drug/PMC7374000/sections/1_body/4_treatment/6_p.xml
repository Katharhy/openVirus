<p>Because the severity of ongoing diseases is associated with corresponding immune reactions and the effect of immunomodulators is dose-dependent, higher doses may be needed for patients with severe pneumonia. In addition, because specific adaptive immune cells may begin to appear within a week, rapid tapering of corticosteroids within a week may be necessary to avoid the acute suppression of normally acting immune cells [

This treatment policy, based on the PHS hypothesis, provides a rationale for early immune-modulator treatment of infectious or infection-related immune-mediated diseases that can elicit acute or subacute whole-organ destructive diseases including myocarditis, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, fulminant hepatitis, necrotizing pancreatitis, acute adrenal insufficiency (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome), extensive epidermolysis, and acute encephalopathy [
