<p>Aberrant or hyperimmune reactions of the host against infectious insults such as cytokine storm are part of the immunopathogenesis of pneumonia and ARDS caused by various pathogens, including SARS-CoV, influenza viruses, and Streptococcus pneumoniae [

Although numerous studies, including those of SARS-CoV and influenza, have been conducted, the effects of corticosteroid are inconclusive due to multiple confounding factors; the timing, dose, and schedule of corticosteroid therapy and the selected subjects differed across study groups [
