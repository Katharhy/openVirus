<p>We reported that early systemic immunomodulators such as corticosteroids and/or IVIG with antibiotics or antivirals can halt the progression of pneumonia and induce the rapid recovery of pulmonary lesions in patients with influenza virus or MP infections [

 <xref rid="b107-cep-2020-00759" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. In MP pneumonia, MP considered one of the smallest bacterial species, is extremely sensitive to antibiotics such as macrolides, tetracyclines, and quinolones in vitro. However, some patients exhibit progressive pneumonia despite adequate antibiotic treatment. We have suggested that the pathogenesis of lung injury in MP pneumonia is similar to that of viral pneumonia, and antibiotics may have a limited effect on MP infection [
