<p>Studies of the early use of corticosteroids in adult patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) also reported that early corticosteroid therapy administered within 24 or 36 hours can help reduce morbidity and treatment failure [

 <xref rid="b115-cep-2020-00759" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. The majority of patients in these series are older individuals with underlying conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Although hyperglycemia was more common in the treated patients, it can be controlled with insulin therapy. The number of patients requiring treatment in intensive care units and/or with mechanical ventilation can also be reduced [

A meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled studies of patients with severe CAP reported that adjunctive corticosteroid treatment showed favorable outcomes such as reduced all-cause mortality, septic shock, and the requirement for mechanical ventilation without increasing the risk of adverse events [
