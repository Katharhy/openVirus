<p>Corticosteroids and/or IVIG may achieve the early stabilization of aberrant immune reactions performed by a host’s entire immune system and especially nonspecific adaptive immune cells, as they can be considered host cell–originating substitutes including cortisol and serum IgG [
 <xref rid="b62-cep-2020-00759" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The beneficial effects of corticosteroid on various infectious diseases, including viral infections such as Epstein-Barr virus infection and infectious croup as well as severe bacterial infections such as tuberculous meningitis and typhoid fever, are well known. Furthermore, methylprednisolone pulse therapy (30 mg/kg/day or 1 g/day for adults) is used for 3 or more consecutive days for severe infectious disease and immune-mediated diseases such as MP pneumonia, lupus nephritis, KD, acute central nervous system diseases, and even advanced chronic kidney diseases [

 <xref rid="b122-cep-2020-00759" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. The convalescent plasma contains antibodies against viral fragments and other antibodies and possibly anti-peptides against etiological and inflammation-inducing substances. Thus, it is possible that IVIG can act as a part of the convalescent sera against pathogenic proteins.
