<p>Including the causes of the appearance of different clinical phenotypes among individuals, many questions remain regarding the pathophysiology of COVID-19. For example, where does viral replication occur during the incubation period and why does this period differ among patients? How do viruses induce organ cell injury? Is the novel coronavirus more virulent than other coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)? How does cytokine storm affect entire lung tissues, and which cytokines are responsible? Why does lymphopenia occur and what is the role of lymphocytes? When will this pandemic resolve? As with many other human diseases, the physiopathology of COVID-19 is poorly understood.</p>
