<p>The host immune system reacts not only to substances derived from infectious pathogens, such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and other toxins, but also to substances derived from injured or infected host cells as a result of infectious insult, including damage (danger)-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), particularly in cases of intracellular pathogen infections such as COVID-19 [
