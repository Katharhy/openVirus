<p>Some patients with pneumonia may delay or fail to induce specific immune cell clones against pathogenic proteins or peptides derived from infected or injured organ cells, and the ongoing activation of nonspecific adaptive immune cells with high levels of proinflammatory cytokines may be responsible for further injury of neighboring cells and other organ cells, resulting in a vicious cycle and manifesting chronic pulmonary diseases or chronic extrapulmonary complications. Because the prognosis for pneumonia depends on the ability of a hostâ€™s immune system to control both the initial substances and the diverse substances from target cells injured by initial insults, early control of initial lung cell injury and possibly initial other organ cell injury, is crucial to preventing disease progression.</p>
