<p>The immune system of neonates matures and acquires a memory as the host grows and ages. The innate immune system of neonates is relatively compatible with that of adults, while adaptive immune systems such as thymus size, white blood cell level with lymphocyte differentials, and immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgM, IgA, and IgE levels may mature with age [

Younger children with infectious diseases such as hepatitis A, SARS, and MP pneumonia and those with infection-related immune-mediated diseases such as KD and acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis experience less severe clinical symptoms than older children and young adults [
