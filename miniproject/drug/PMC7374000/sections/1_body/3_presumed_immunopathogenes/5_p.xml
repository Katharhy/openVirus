<p>Older patients with underlying diseases show more severe outcomes in COVID-19 as well influenza, SARS, and hemolytic uremic syndrome caused by toxin-producing Escherichia coli [

 <xref rid="b86-cep-2020-00759" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Older patients with underlying diseases may lack the numerical capacity of the immune cells to respond to pathologic lesions since the hostâ€™s immune cells are also acting against the insults from active underlying diseases. Conversely, acute exacerbation of underlying diseases, especially immune-mediated diseases such as type 1 diabetes or immune-mediated cardiovascular disorders, may be caused by the mobilization of immune cells to new battlefields, which can result in a fatal outcome of otherwise mild cases of pneumonia. Older patents have higher erythrocyte sedimentation rates and C-reactive protein levels than younger patients, suggesting that immune activation was ongoing at presentation in cases of 2009 H1N1 influenza [

 <xref rid="b87-cep-2020-00759" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. In addition, pneumonia itself may be a major risk factor since initial immune-mediated lung cell injuries can induce further inflammation and secondary bacterial invasion. Some patients show an atypical and slow disease progress, which can delay the diagnosis of pneumonia [
 <xref rid="b88-cep-2020-00759" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. A large proportion of patients who succumb to viral pneumonia have commensal invasions, including
