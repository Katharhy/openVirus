<p>In the case of pneumonia, the target cells may be lower respiratory tract cells, possibly respiratory endothelial cells, while the main etiologic substances may be pathogenic peptides since numerous T cells infiltrate pathologic lesions in lungs with corresponding peripheral lymphopenia. At the first stage, rapid and first-line immune responses are elicited by innate and nonspecific adaptive immune reactions, including nonspecific T cell, possibly cytotoxic T-cell activation, NK cell activation, antibody-dependent cytotoxic reaction, and/or complement system pathway activation. However, the initial immune reaction may be somewhat crude and less effective across the immune network, and the imbalanced cytokine network caused by excess proinflammatory cytokines and proteolytic enzymes may ensue, which may be related to target lung cell injury, which can induce fibrin leakage to the alveolar space and thromboembolitic insults. In the second stage, the substances derived from injured target cells or the changed circumstances caused by the initial insult induce further inflammation of the neighboring lung tissue cells with corresponding immune cells and immune proteins. Secondary bacterial invasion through broken lung barriers can induce further lung tissue inflammation, which may overwhelm the hostâ€™s immune system. After the appearance of specific T cells and specific antibodies (B cells), inflammatory substances, including the pathogenic proteins and peptides, are effectively controlled and inflammation processes may cease (
