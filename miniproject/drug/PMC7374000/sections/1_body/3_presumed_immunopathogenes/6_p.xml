<p>In infectious diseases, antipathogen IgM and following IgG antibodies typically begin to appear at 3â€“4 days or more after disease onset [
 <xref rid="b90-cep-2020-00759" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. A plasma cell clone produces specific antibodies for only one protein, which can bind BCRs, and a specific T-cell clone can do the same for only one peptide. Thus, antigens that induce pathogen-specific antibodies are not whole virions but rather fragments of virus proteins derived from infected cells or fragments from antigen-presenting cells that engulf entire virions. In SARS, some patients with severe pneumonia have a prolonged seroconversion period, and pneumonia can further progress to ARDS despite the appearance of antiviral antibodies [

It is possible that the patients may have few intact virions at the initial focus, and the fragments or by-products from the replication processes in the infected cells can induce immune reactions that are responsible for inflammation and target-cell injury. Individuals who acquired cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies to the H1N1 virus can be infected with influenza during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic as previously mentioned [

 <xref rid="b92-cep-2020-00759" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,
 <xref rid="b93-cep-2020-00759" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. These findings suggests that both antipathogen antibodies and other immune substances may be needed to prevent infectious diseases and alleviate clinical symptoms.
