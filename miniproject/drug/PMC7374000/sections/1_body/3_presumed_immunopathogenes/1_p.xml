<p>Based on clinical and pathologic characteristics of the disease and the PHS hypothesis, the pathogenesis of acute or chronic lung injury in COVID-19 is as follows. During the incubation period, substances that can induce injuries to lung cells and possibly other organ cells are produced by SARS-CoV-2-infected cells as the focus of initiation of the disease. The potentially toxic or signalling substances spread systemically and locally and then bind to receptors on the target organ cells that have an affinity for them. To control various sized substances at the early stage of COVID-19, innate immune system cells and proteins such as neutrophils, macrophages, NK cells, immune proteins, and possibly immune peptides, as well as nonspecific T cells and B cells (nonspecific antibodies), may comprise the first-line effectors since specific immune reactions take at least several days or more to take effect due to the immune gene recombination of TCRs and BCRs. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 such as fever, myalgia, and pneumonia begin to appear at this stage. The cytokine storms in rapidly progressive severe COVID-19 and other infectious diseases [
