<p id="Par15">The sequences generated from the N = 278 PWID that were co-infected with HIV and HCV provided an opportunity to directly compare viral diversity for both viruses within the same individuals. The same genotypes and subtypes found in the overall study (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) were also represented within the co-infected group; namely, HCV genotypes 1, 3, 4, 6 and HIV subtypes A, C, URF (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Remarkably, the prevalences of each HIV and HCV strain within the co-infected subset were nearly identical to the overall proportions of each classification in the complete sample (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>), suggesting that infection with one virus (HIV or HCV) did not influence the strain acquired in a second viral co-infection.
