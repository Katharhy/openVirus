<p id="Par13">Classification of the HCV 5′UTR-core regions of N = 498 specimens identified a diverse set of strains circulating in Indian PWID (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Overall, the most common genotype was 3a (N = 194, 39%), followed by 1a (N = 134, 27%), with genotypes 1b, 1c, 3b, 3i, 4a, 4d, 6, 6n, 6 v, and one unclassifiable (U) sequence also present (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). A comparison of the genotype distributions in each city revealed that unique strains predominated in different regions of India (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In the Northeastern city of Imphal, genotypes 3b (50%) and 6n (25%) were most common (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Notably, Imphal was the only site where genotype 6 strains were found in this study. An unclassifiable strain was also identified from Imphal that branched basal to all genotype 3 references and displayed evidence of recombination with genotype 1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), although this strain was not related to the 3a/1a recombinant previously identified amongst PWID in Kolkata

 </sup>. In contrast, the predominant strains in the Northern city of Amritsar were 3a (61%) and 1a (12%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Additional diversity was also observed in Amritsar, with genotype 4 strains exclusively found at this site (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Although New Delhi and Kanpur are both located in Central India, the most highly prevalent strains of HCV were 3a (54%) in Kanpur and 1a (45%) in New Delhi, indicating that city-level differences exist within the Central region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This is further supported by the detection of genotypes 1b and 1c in Kanpur but not in New Delhi (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
