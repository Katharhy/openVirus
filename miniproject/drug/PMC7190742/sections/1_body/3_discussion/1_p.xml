<p id="Par18">This is the first large scale viral diversity study conducted amongst PWID in India, which generated N = 1905 viral sequences from N = 975 PWID participants located in five cities across the Northern, Central, and Northeastern regions of India. The diverse HIV and HCV strains identified in this study are consistent with those identified in other cities and study cohorts in India

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup> than in non-PWID populations in India (0.22–0.88%)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,

 </sup>, it remains possible that the strains in the PWID group are a reservoir for the epidemic in the general population in India. Our data can inform treatment and prevention strategies targeted towards PWID to enable the greatest impact on the local HIV and HCV epidemics in India. In particular, the low prevalence of INSTI resistance mutations observed in this study suggests that INSTI-based regimens could be successful in India as a first-line HIV treatment option. With DAA cures available for HCV, treatment is an important component of the HCV elimination goal set by the World Health Organization (WHO)
 <sup>

 </sup>. As part of this goal, 90% of all HCV infections should be diagnosed by 2030, with 80% of eligible patients receiving treatment
 <sup>

 </sup>. Sequence diversity has the potential to impact both of these elimination activities; diversity can challenge the accuracy of diagnostic tests
