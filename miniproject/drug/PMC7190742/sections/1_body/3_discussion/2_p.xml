<p id="Par19">Although considerable HCV diversity and HIV URFs were identified in our study, this is likely an underestimation of the true genetic diversity for each virus because subgenomic sequences cannot capture the full extent of recombination in a given sample

 </sup>. Therefore, we propose that complete genome sequencing should be conducted to identify the true prevalence of viral recombinants in India. Since recombination requires co-infection with multiple strains, we predict that the higher rates of HIV and HCV incidence amongst PWID would result in higher rates of novel recombination events in this population. Given that the overwhelming majority of the HIV strains were all subtype C, the possibility remains that recombination events between such similar strains could be difficult to detect. However, the identification of at least one recombinant HCV strain by subgenomic sequencing suggests that other recombinants could likely be identified in whole genome characterization studies.
