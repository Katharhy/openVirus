<p id="Par21">An important purpose of this study was to characterize viral diversity in India towards the ultimate goal of using diverse viral strains in circulation as a challenge for diagnostic tests. By pairing HIV and HCV sequence data with serological and viral load data, this surveillance study demonstrated that the ARCHITECT HIV Combo, Anti-HCV, and HCV antigen tests were able to detect a diverse range of HCV genotypes and HIV strains present in PWID in India. In addition to reaffirming the sensitivities of these assays in a unique population, these data also highlight the importance of continued vigilance against the threats posed by viral evolution to the accuracy of diagnostic tests. Given that diagnostic screening for HIV and HCV is the first step in treatment and prevention efforts, a sustained effort to track viral diversity remains a critical component of global strategies to end these pandemics.</p>
