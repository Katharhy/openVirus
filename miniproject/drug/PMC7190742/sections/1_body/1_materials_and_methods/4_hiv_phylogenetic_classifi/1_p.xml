<p id="Par9">Individual sequences were aligned to reference strains for HIV-1 Group M strains A-K, and CRF01–96 by MAFFT. Alignments were degapped and trimmed to the query sequence length. Neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees and classifications were assigned as described above for HCV. The reference and sample sequence list in the alignments used to generate trees shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> was reduced to improve visualization while representing the full range of viral diversity encountered in study specimens. In particular, CRF branches that did not include study sequences were removed. Phylogenetic tree figures were prepared using FigTree 1.4.2 and Adobe Illustrator CC 2018.
