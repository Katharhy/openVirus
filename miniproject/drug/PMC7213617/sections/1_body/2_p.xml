<p>Based on the previous reports and observational studies in SARS and MERS, the most widely used antiviral regimen was the combination of ribavirin and IFN, and this use was based on studies showing the efficacy of this combination in reducing viral replication and disease severity in animal models.

 </sup> In a more recently published update, the use of interferons and LPV/r is ranked under the Recommendation of “benefit is likely to exceed risk.”

 </sup> One series of case reports showed that viral clearance is achievable by triple antiviral therapy in MERS patients.

 </sup> These aforementioned therapeutic regimens are based on the treatment experience during the SARS and MERS epidemics. However, there is currently no evidence supporting their use in patients with COVID-19. Randomized clinical trials are therefore required to provide robust and reliable clinical evidence for the efficacy of these treatment regimens for the treatment of COVID-19. In this present study, we chose three variations of therapeutic drugs used to manage SARS and MERS patients: ribavirin (intravenous loading dose of 2 g, followed by oral doses of 400–600 mg every 8 h depending on the patients weight, for 14 days); LPV/r (oral, 400 mg/100 mg per dose, twice a day, refer to 14 days); and IFN-α-1b (atomizing inhalation, 5 million U or 50 μg per dose, twice a day, for 14 days). We refer to the three different therapeutic regimens as ribavirin plus IFN-α1b (arm A); LPV/r plus IFN-α1b (arm B); and ribavirin plus LPV/r plus IFN-α1b (arm C), and we aim to compare the effectiveness and safety of these different antiviral regimens for the treatment of COVID-19. It should be noted that the recommended doses of the three prescribed drugs are based on the treatment experience in past SARS and MERS clinical trials, and current Chinese guidelines for COVID-19.
