<p>This study has several challenges. First, the relatively low numbers of newly diagnosed patients in Chongqing at present as a result of effective public health measures in response to the outbreak could mean that we may not achieve our proposed cohort total of 108 patients. Second, it is likely that the necessary increased number of close interactions between the admitted 2019-nCoV-infected patients and medical staff conducting this study during the study period, will increase the risk of 2019-nCoV exposure to the study medical staff. Third, in the study we will dispense a combination of three antiviral drugs to one arm of the study cohort for the treatment of COVID-19. Some physicians do not recommend a combination of three, or more than three antiviral drugs in specific regimens for the treatment of COVID-19 according to Version 6 of the clinical guidelines. The recommendations in the guidelines are extracted and distilled from the clinical experience of physicians, but have no current evidence in its support. A case report has indicated that, in patients with MERS-CoV infection, the proposed drug regimens to treat COVID-19 will have good outcomes.

 </sup> Hence, we aim to conduct a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial to obtain robust clinical data of therapeutic efficacy and safety for three different antiviral regimens, through which we hope to provide clear and credible evidence for or against the use of these regimens in the management of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.
