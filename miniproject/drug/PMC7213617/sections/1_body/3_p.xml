<p>Our research is designed as an open-labeled, single-center, prospective, randomized and controlled clinical trial. We hope to enroll a sample size of 108 patients for this study, based on a power of 80%, and a level of confidence set at 95%, while also considering a dropout rate of 10%. One hundred and eight eligible patients with confirmed mild to moderate COVID-19 will be enrolled at Chongqing Public Health Medical Center. Patients will be blocked randomization individually to one of three treatment arms by means of random computer-generated lists, with an allocation ratio of 1:1:1, with block sizes of nine patients. The enrolment, intervention, and assessment processes are shown in Figure
