<p id="p0110">Antibody fragments would probably illustrate a useful, actual and low cost choice in Ebola diagnostics applications than full-length antibodies. Rodriguez-Martinez LM 
 <italic>et al.</italic> expressed three recombinant anti-GP scfv fragments in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures. These scFvs contained the heavy and light variable parts of the three well-studied anti-GP full-length mAbs. All three scfvs showed distinctive anti-GP binding activity in ELISA experiments similar to the full sized anti-GP antibodies. It is necessary that the usage of samples containing proper EBOV particles and samples from Ebola disease patients have to be studied to entirely validate the diagnostic usefulness of these scFvs
