<p id="p0120">Bispecific antibodies that are designed for binding to two targets and are being used significantly for different medicinal areas could be also employed as an appealing diagnostic tool for detecting viral targets. Chen YP 
 <italic>et al.</italic> designed a bispecific diabody against human red blood cells (RBCs) and hepatitis B virus antigen (HBsAg) to detect HBsAg in blood samples. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), this bispecific diabody showed accurate binding to each RBCs and HBsAg. When the results were compared with those of the traditional immunoassay, as a reference, this diabody-mediated agglutination assay represented a promising result with 97.7% sensitivity and 100% specificity
