<p id="p0115">ScFv antibodies were also developed against ZIKV envelope protein using phage display technology. In this study, after bio-panning, 4 scFvs showed specific binding affinity to ZIKV_E proteins that could be proposed for both diagnostic or therapeutic perspectives for ZIKV

 <italic>et al.</italic> designed a novel synNotch receptor including scFv against HBsAg (hepatitis B antigens) linked with an intracellular synthetic transcription factor and suggested it for viral sensing and cellular immunotherapy. The designed system sensed HBV particles and membrane-bound HBs antigens and reacted expressing reporter molecules, secNL or GFP

 <italic>et al.</italic> by using of DNA recombinant technology designed a new anti-HBsAg/Alkaline phosphatase bifunctional scFv for detecting HBsAg. They suggested that their anti-HBsAg scFvs can be used in one-step ELISA after additional linker optimization studies
