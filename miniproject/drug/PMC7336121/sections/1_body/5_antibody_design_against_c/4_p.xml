 <italic>et al.</italic> used a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-based screen for identification of a receptor for multiple emerging arthritogenic alphaviruses, including chikungunya, Ross River, Mayaro and O'nyong nyong viruses. They introduced the cell adhesion molecule Mxra8 (Matrix Remodeling Associated 8) as an entry mediator for viral entrance. During their experiments, it was recognized that anti-Mxra8 monoclonal antibody can blocked chikungunya virus infection in different cell types, including primary human synovial fibroblasts, osteoblasts, chondrocytes and skeletal muscle cells. They suggested this mAb as a pharmaceutical target
