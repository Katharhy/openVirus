<p id="p0155">Although antiviral drugs are designed to target viral proteins and have been successfully developed for curing viral infections, but due to viral resistance there are a narrow spectrum of action and immediate need for replacement. This have forced drug leaders in the industry to look for new drug targets 
 <xref rid="b0395" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>. Recently, a variety of approaches have been developed in diagnosis, treatment and prevention of viral diseases on the basis of neutralization or modification of cellular or molecular targets. Since targeted drugs interact with their targets based on their specificity, antibodies and recombinant proteins are among the best choices. A new generation of potent monoclonal antibodies against viral diseases has been introduced in the past decade. The advancement of technology and the strong desire of scientists to produce new drugs that put different targets together resulted in the development of bispecific antibodies involving two targets in a therapeutic strategy for a specific disease (e.g. viral infections). From two categories of bispecific antibodies, the one that can connect two target cells are considered for treating the viral diseases much more than the others.
