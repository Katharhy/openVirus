<p id="p0160">In order to prevent Hepatitis C virus infection (HCV), 
 <underline>Meuleman</underline>
 <italic>et al.</italic> developed a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody named mAb16-71 that targets scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI). This mAb can effectively prevent infection of Huh7.5 cell line and primary hepatocytes of HCV. It inhibits cell to cell transmission of the virus. Efficacy of mAb16-71 was evaluated in uPA-SCID mice by treating 1 day before and 3 days after viral inoculation. Results showed that in 1 day before inoculation, all chimeric mice were protected against different types of HCV genotype and in 3 days after inoculation the viral load was decreased. They revealed that mAb targeting the HCV co-receptor SR-BI prevents intrahepatic viral infection and the spread of different genotypes
