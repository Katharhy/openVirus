<p id="p0145">In addition of VHH, scFv construction against spike protein of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (from corona virus family) provides a protection against viral infection in piglets 
 <xref rid="b0375" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. Phoolcharoen 
 <italic>et al.</italic> used a scFv with neutralizing potential on rabies in which was chemically conjugated with RVG (a 29 amino acid peptide) specifically for nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) binding in the CNS. The molecule entered neuronal cells more efficiently than scFv suggesting as a novel tool against rabies in the brain 
 <xref rid="b0380" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. ScFvs derived from immune phage display library against viral-replicon particles expressing the glycoproteins (GP) of marburg virus demonstrated protective efficacies ranging from 75 to 100% in mice that have challenge with wild-type marburg virus
