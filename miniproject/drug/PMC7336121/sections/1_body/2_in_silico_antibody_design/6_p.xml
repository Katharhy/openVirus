<p id="p0090">An example for antibody engineering and affinity improving is about used mAbs against S protein of coronaviruses. Several mAbs have already been represented against SARS-CoV including CR3014, m396, CR3022 and the recently m336 mAb which is a human MERS-CoV-specific monoclonal antibody 
 <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein (193 amino acid: N318-V510) is considered as the main target for neutralizing antibodies 
 <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Different epitopes on RBD are recognized by various antibodies; for instance, the CR3022 and CR3014 neutralizing antibodies noncompetitively interact with RBD and synergistically neutralize the virus entry into the target cells. Some of the most potent SARS-CoV specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g., CR3014 and m396) failed to show neutralizing effects against SARS-CoV-2. On the other hands, the CR3022 can be a candidate as therapeutic neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 either in combination with other neutralizing antibodies or alone

 <italic>et al.</italic> indicated the interaction of several residues from the heavy chain (33T, 31S, 58A, 52T, and 97A) and from the light chain (96Y) of the m396 antibody with ACE2 antigen. Additionally, Thr33 and Ser31 located in H1 region, Thr52 and Asn58 residues from the H2 region and Val97 located in the H3 region are other residues interacting with the ACE2 antigen. Given these properties, optimization of the m396 properties to enhance its affinity towards the ACE2 protein could be beneficial. Therefore, the introduction of new mutations within the sequence of this antibody is envisaged in which leads to an affinity maturation against the ACE2 from SARS-CoV-2
