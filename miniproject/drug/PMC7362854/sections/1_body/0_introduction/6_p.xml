<p id="p0070">This work addresses potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs based on small heterocyclic molecules. In this work, fourteen promising approved drugs or/and experimental drugs selected by experts in antiviral research and clinical parasitic infections were analyzed from the point of view of bioavailability by applying the Lipinski-Veber rules and determining their physicochemical parameters to find similar patterns and peculiar characteristics that could be valuable in antiviral drug optimization and drug combination or new antiviral agent design.</p>
