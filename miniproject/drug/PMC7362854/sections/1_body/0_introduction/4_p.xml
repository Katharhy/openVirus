<p id="p0060">Based on this information and their experiences, many scientific researchers have begun to contribute to the design and development of molecules against coronavirus. The largest obstacle is that there is simply no time to create a new drug, and the need exists to use old drugs or experimental drug candidates, i.e., to find such compounds for which preclinical trials have been conducted and safety has been proven, and it remains “only” to check activity against SARS-CoV-2, thus realizing a drug repurposing strategy [
