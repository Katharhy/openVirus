<p id="p0030">The current pandemic coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a new infectious pneumonia-like illness caused by a novel virus strain, so-called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This virus is a member of the β-Coronaviruses genus (family Coronaviridae) and is similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The common symptoms of a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 include respiratory symptoms, fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, and central nervous system conditions leading to multiple organ failure. In more severe cases, infection causes bilateral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, kidney failure, and ultimately, death [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Current data on COVID-19 indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 mortality rate is generally far lower (3–5%) than that of SARS-CoV (9–15%) and MERS-CoV (34–37%), but SARS-CoV-2 is much more transmissible/contagious than the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses and affects more people over the age of 60 or those with comorbidities that weaken the immune system [

 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>]. At the height of the crisis, this virus is spreading at a rate and scale far worse than previous coronaviral epidemics.
