<p id="p0150">In addressing the pK
 <sub>a</sub> values of the selected drug molecules, it can be noted that among the 14 studied drugs, seven drugs do not present essentially acidic properties in water (pK
 <sub>a</sub> &gt; 12), and are strong conjugated bases (comp. 
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>3</bold>, 
 <bold>8</bold>, 
 <bold>9</bold>, 
 <bold>13</bold> and 
 <bold>14</bold>). Three drugs (comp. 
 <bold>5</bold>, 
 <bold>6</bold> and 
 <bold>12</bold>) show notably weak acid strength (pK
 <sub>a</sub> = 8–12), and the two drugs umifenovir (
 <bold>7</bold>) and ingavirin (
 <bold>11</bold>) are weak acids with 5.24 and 4.55 pK
 <sub>a</sub> values, respectively, but they are stronger than the other evaluated drugs. In this context, it is well known that the pH environment to which an orally administered drug molecule is subjected is highly changeable (stomach pH ∼ 3.5, intestinal tract pH ∼ 8.5 and plasma pH = 7.4), and the absorption and transport capacities of these molecules also depend on their pKa, which can have a pronounced effect on the pharmacokinetics. From the data of 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, we can easily observe a good correlation between pK
 <sub>a</sub> and % ABS parameters: drugs with notably low acidity (pK
 <sub>a</sub> = 12–15) have generally poor to moderate absorption in the alkaline intestine (% ABS &lt; 67.60) (comp. 
 <bold>1–3</bold>, 
 <bold>8</bold>, 
 <bold>9</bold>, 
 <bold>13</bold> and 
 <bold>14</bold>), except for the azithromycin molecule, which exhibits a 8.63 value of pK
 <sub>a</sub>, and its intestinal absorption is expected to be quite poor (% ABS = 46.87), comparable to that of remdesivir.
