<p id="p0125">In this context, it is of interest to quickly compare molecular descriptors, i.e., physicochemical properties and bioactivity scores (drug-likeness), of these molecules to identify selected similar patterns and peculiar characteristics. This simple and rapid approach could be helpful in antiviral drug optimization and drug combination and possible identification of molecular hybrid entities, the so-called chimeric molecules. These physicochemical properties, which form the well-known Lipinski “rule of five” (RO5) [
 <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] and Veber’s rule [
 <xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], can be easily established using the basic tools of open access, e.g., Molinspiration [
 <xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The importance of RO5 (MW &lt; 500, cLogP &lt; 5, number of hydrogen-bond acceptors HBA &lt; 10 and number of hydrogen-bond donors HBD &lt; 5) is associated primarily with the solubility of the drug and the permeation of in vivo barriers. It is known that 
 <italic>a</italic>) calculated descriptors are only simple filters that could aid selection of drug-like compounds; 
 <italic>b</italic>) RO5 compliance is not a guarantee that a compound will be drug-like; and 
 <italic>c</italic>) certain of the pharmacological targets in current drug discovery do not have high affinity and selectivity ligands that comply with RO5, and several studies do focus on series of compounds beyond the RO5 chemical space with the expected consequences on the properties of ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) of the identified ligands. Furthermore, according to Veber’s rule, good bioavailability is more likely for compounds with ≤10 rotatable bonds (ROTB), total HBA + HBD &lt; 12 and topological polar surface area (TPSA) ≤ 140 Å
 <sup>2</sup>. These two parameters reflect that 
 <italic>a</italic>) as the number of rotatable bonds increases, the molecule becomes more flexible and more adaptable for efficient interaction with a particular binding pocket of the target, and 
 <italic>b</italic>) the TPSA descriptor correlates well with passive molecular transport through membranes and can predict the transport properties of drugs in the intestines and permeation of the blood-brain barrier. TPSA values less than 140 Å
 <sup>2</sup> are associated with good cell membrane permeability.
