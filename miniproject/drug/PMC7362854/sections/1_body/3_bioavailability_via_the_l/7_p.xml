<p id="p0145">The best absorption (% ABS) according to our calculations (92–99%) was found for antimalarial 4-aminoquinoline drugs 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold>. Other small nitrogen-containing molecule drugs such as favipiravir (
 <bold>4</bold>), umifenovir (
 <bold>7</bold>), ruxolitinib (
 <bold>10</bold>) and ingavirin (
 <bold>11</bold>) also demonstrated good absorption (76–90%), which is an indication of good bioavailability by the oral route. This feature is consequence of their good TPSA values, ranking from 28.16 to 95.08 Å
 <sup>2</sup>, which also indicates notably good cell membrane permeability. It is worth mention that the presence of a 3,4-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-tetrahydrofuran-2-yl fragment in the heterocyclic ring increases the TPSA parameter of nucleoside-based drugs EIDD-2801 (
 <bold>8</bold>), ribavirin (
 <bold>9</bold>) and remdesivir (
 <bold>1</bold>) (TPSA = 143.15–203.57 Å
 <sup>2</sup>). Increased TPSA values are also observed for macrocyclic molecule drugs azithromycin (
 <bold>12</bold>), ivermectin (
 <bold>13</bold>) and danoprevir (
 <bold>14</bold>). Among these three drugs, ivermectin is the most hydrophilic molecule, is well resorbed after oral administration, and its distribution to the brain is discouraged by the blood-brain-barrier (TPSA &gt; 140 Å
 <sup>2</sup>) because of its molecular size, which is not conducive to passive diffusion, but it can be transferred in the presence of efflux pumps, for which ivermectin is a substrate [

 <bold>5</bold>) and hydroxychloroquine (
 <bold>6</bold>) show the same capacity, and remdesivir (
 <bold>1</bold>), lopinavir (
 <bold>2</bold>) and ritonavir (
 <bold>3</bold>) are much more flexible molecules (ROTB = 15–17).
