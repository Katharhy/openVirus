<p id="p0200">Returning to the idea of single drugs with multitargeting properties, drug combination based on a hybridization approach could be useful and efficient in creation of an antiviral molecule hybrid drug that possesses two or even three pharmacophore groups that act selectively on different viral replication targets (RdRp/3CLpro and RdRp/PLpro), viral cell entry (S protein/ACE2) and regulation of the human immune response to viral infection (JAK 1/JAK 2/interleukin (IL)-1Î² and IL-6). Understanding the mechanisms by which these drugs affect SARS-CoV-2 is expected to be critical to optimization and development of preventative and therapeutic strategies [
