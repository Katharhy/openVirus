 <xref rid="bib132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>], and on 02 May, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for remdesivir for treating COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bib133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. Thus, it is the first drug shown to help fight COVID-19. However, other drugs, such as favipiravir (Avigan®), a viral RNA polymerase inhibitor, or tilarone (Amixin®), an inducer of interferon, are also gaining attention [

 <xref rid="bib135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. During the last two months, the activity related to the drug design and development for suitable anti-SARS-Co-V2 agents has been constantly ongoing, but without new significant achievements [

 <xref rid="bib143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. Its combination with tocilizumab (monoclonal antibodies drug, Actemra/RoActemra®) is being studying for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia (phase 3). Favipiravir, an inexpensive antiviral drug, was approved for a COVID-19 treatment in several countries. Recently, it was found that dexamethasone (glucocorticoid) reduced deaths in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease [
 <xref rid="bib144" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>], but once again, more investigation on this drug is required [
