<p id="p0185">Special attention has been focused on use of (hydroxy) chloroquine drugs for a COVID-19 cure. Both drugs, which show remarkable absorption, cell membrane permeability and transport properties, are important drugs in the treatment of malaria as well as severe rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus diseases in which they bind to a heme moiety and interfere with normal hemoglobin metabolism. These drugs also interfere with lysosomal activity, autophagy, and membrane stability and alter signaling pathways and transcriptional activity, which could result in reduction of the cytokine storm by modulating T-cell stimulators and inflammatory molecules [
