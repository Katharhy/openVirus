<p>CoVs members belong to the subfamily 
 <italic>Coronovirinae</italic> within the family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> and the order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic>. Based on their protein sequences and phylogenetic relationships, members of the 
 <italic>Coronavirinae</italic> subfamily can be classified into four groups, 
 <italic>Alphacoronaviruses</italic>, 
 <italic>Betacoronaviruses</italic>, 
 <italic>Gammacoronaviruses</italic>, and 
 <italic>Deltacoronaviruses</italic>. 
 <italic>Gammacoronaviruses</italic> and 
 <italic>Deltacoronaviruses</italic> infect birds and might infect mammals, but never reported to cause any illnesses in humans [

 <xref rid="B21-pathogens-09-00331" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. On the other hand, 
 <italic>Alphacoronaviruses</italic> and 
 <italic>Betacoronaviruses</italic> are capable of causing respiratory illnesses in humans and gastrointestinal illnesses in animals. Before December 2019, six common coronaviruses (members of 
 <italic>Alphacoronaviruses</italic> and 
 <italic>Betacoronaviruses</italic>) were known to infect humans. HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 and they belong to the Alphacoronaviruses. HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 belong to lineage A 
 <italic>Betacoronaviruses</italic>, and the two deadly viruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV belong to lineages B and C of 
 <italic>Betacoronaviruses</italic>, respectively [
 <xref rid="B20-pathogens-09-00331" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The genomic analysis found that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> group, lineage B [
 <xref rid="B4-pathogens-09-00331" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-pathogens-09-00331" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].
