<p>CoVs are zoonotic pathogens originating in animals and can be transmitted to humans through direct contact. All CoVs that caused epidemics (including COVID-19) are believed to be originated in bats. Bats are hosts of many coronaviruses [

 <xref rid="B22-pathogens-09-00331" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, in most cases, these viruses were transmitted to humans through an intermediate animal host. SARS-CoV started through direct contact with market civets cats [

 <xref rid="B13-pathogens-09-00331" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The COVID-19 is suspected to be emerged in the seafood market in Wuhan, China, [

 <xref rid="B20-pathogens-09-00331" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Most of the early reported cases have been in that market, which was closed later by the Chinese authority. Evolutionary analysis of COVID-19 virus revealed that it is most similar to the bat SARS-like coronaviruses, and for the similarity, it was named SARS-CoV-2. In summary, most of the scientific report believes that SARS-CoV-2 was originated in bats and transmitted to humans through intermediate animal host in the seafood market [
 <xref rid="B5-pathogens-09-00331" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Nevertheless, researchers are yet to find a definitive answer to which animal serves as an intermediate host.
