<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large group of viruses common among many animals, including humans. They can cause respiratory illnesses in humans and gastrointestinal illnesses in animals. Under the electron microscope, virions of CoVs have large peplomers that make it look like a crown, hence the name corona, meaning “crown” or “halo” [

The circulating strains were causing mild symptoms in immunocompetent people. Typically, coronavirus symptoms include runny nose, cough, sore throat, headache, and fever that can last for several days. However, in immunocompromised patients, there is a chance that the virus could cause a lower respiratory illness like pneumonia and bronchitis [

Nine years later, a strain of CoV evolved in Saudi Arabia to cause the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), approximately 2500 cases have been confirmed, including 861 deaths with a fearful case–fatality rate of 34.4% [
