<p>Given the lack of specific treatment for COVID-19, many groups are working urgently to find an alternative strategy to control the replication and spreading of the virus. We have explored different scientific databases searching for the most promising options for the treatment of COVID-19 and provide an overview of our findings. We are going to review the characteristics of coronaviruses, its origin, genome structure, and replication to explain how each treatment strategy could act on preventing or slowing the viral infection.</p>
