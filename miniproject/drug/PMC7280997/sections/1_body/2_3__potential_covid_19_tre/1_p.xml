<p>Antiviral drugs usually interfere with the viral replication machinery in the target cells. Given that viruses have similar actions of infection, different studies suggest the use of successful antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. Oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir are neuraminidase inhibitors that have been used for influenza treatment. A recent report suggests the potential activity of these drugs against SAS-CoV-2 by interfering with the virions budding and releasing from the cell [
 <xref rid="B35-pathogens-09-00331" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, this virus uses different mechanisms other than neuraminidase to facilitate its release out of the infected cell. Another recent study suggests that ribavirin if combined with interferon-Î², might be a promising drug for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication [
 <xref rid="B7-pathogens-09-00331" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although this claim was based on previous in vitro findings [
 <xref rid="B36-pathogens-09-00331" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], no other studies have shown the same results. Moreover, two reports did not recommend the use of this drug. On one hand, because it has no significant activity against SAS-CoV, and on the other hand, ribavirin is toxic with hemolysis activity [
 <xref rid="B37-pathogens-09-00331" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-pathogens-09-00331" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Even though, there are many drugs with general antiviral activity; that can interfere with vial entry or blocking the virus receptors. Some examples are listed in 
 <xref rid="pathogens-09-00331-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. These drugs are either under investigation, showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, or constituted a treatment option of COVID-19.
