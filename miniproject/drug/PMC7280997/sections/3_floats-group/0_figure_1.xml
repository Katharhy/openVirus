  <p>The genomic organization of SARS-CoV-2. The genome encodes two large genes ORF1a (yellow), ORF1b (blue), which encode 16 non-structural proteins (NSP1– NSP16). These NSPs are processed to form a replication–transcription complex (RTC) that is involved in genome transcription and replication. For example, NSP3 and NSP5 encode for Papain-like protease (PLP) and 3CL-protease, respectively. Both proteins function in polypeptides cleaving and block the host innate immune response. NSP12 encodes for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). NSP15 encodes for RNA helicase. The structural genes encode the structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), highlighted in green. The accessory proteins (shades of grey) are unique to SARS-CoV-2 in terms of number, genomic organization, sequence, and function (figure created with
