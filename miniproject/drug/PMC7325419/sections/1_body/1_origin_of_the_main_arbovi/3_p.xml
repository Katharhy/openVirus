<p>The YFV came from West Africa and arrived in the Americas during the slave trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). It is believed that the DENV spread throughout the world through transport routes in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and that, after establishing itself, decreased between the 1950s and 1970s due to the aggressive vector control method of the time (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). In the 1990s, DENV reemerged following a decline in vector control efforts and increased insecticide resistance, culminating in one of the worst global epidemics with 2,326,000 reported cases in the Americas in 2015 (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The first case of CHIKV on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin was confirmed in October 2013. Subsequently, CHIKV spread to the Caribbean, Central America, and some regions of South America, totaling about 1.6 million cases (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Some complications have been reported, including hemorrhaging and cardiac, neurological, and gastrointestinal injury (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The social damage caused by CHIKV infection is inestimable because the virus can remain in the tissues of the joints, causing persistent arthralgia for months or even years (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Kantor (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) suggested the virus was imported from Asia since it was shown that the isolates had the Asian genotype. Oliveira Melo et al. (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) suggested that ZIKV introduced in the Americas also came from Asia. This study evaluated two pregnant women from the state of Pernambuco, in northeast region of Brazil, who were diagnosed with fetal microcephaly and had symptoms of ZIKV infection. The patients were submitted to an amniocentesis test, blood test, and qPCR to detect the presence of the virus. Although the blood test was negative, amniocenteses and qPCR showed a positive result for ZIKV. The virus was isolated and sequenced, and the result showed Asian genotype in both cases (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Studies based on the sequence of a large number of virus isolates indicated that a cryptic ZIKV circulation occurred in the Northeast of Brazil as early as February 2014, and from the region the virus disseminated nationally and internationally (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In February 2016, the World Health Organization declared the situation “a public health emergency of international importance” due to the increasing number of cases of ZIKV infection in Brazil, and its possible association with neurological disorders and congenital anomalies, such as microcephaly (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In 2016, the situation worsened and at the end of the year, the World Health Organization estimated that ~4 million people were infected with ZIKV. The impact of this number of cases in Brazil had deeper social and emotional consequences, since 1,434 cases of microcephaly were confirmed (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The extent of the financial and political problems that the epidemic may cause in the future is still unknown, but efforts need to be concentrated on supporting and monitoring affected families. Lately, the first clinical case of infection with Mayaro (MAYV), a virus of the Togaviridae family recently arrived in Haiti, has been described. This virus was discovered in 1954 in Trinidad and Tobago, but so far only isolated cases are known in the Amazon and other regions of South America. According to epidemiological data available to the Ministry of Health, there were 197 notifications distributed in nine Brazilian states between December 2014 and June 2015, mainly in the north and center-west regions. There are still no records of deaths from the disease, but as is the case with CHIKV, those infected can continue to experience joint pain for weeks or months. Although 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> sp. is the main vector of MAYV, 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> is also capable of transmitting this arbovirus (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The constant transit of arboviruses represents a challenge in the diagnosis and treatment of patients because, in addition to causing similar clinical manifestations (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), they can be transmitted simultaneously.
