<p>Along with the five arboviruses listed above, it is worth highlighting the presence of La Crosse and Rocio viruses, which can be transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>. The first cases of Rocio virus (ROCV) were recorded in the southeastern region of Brazil during a viral encephalitis epidemic that lasted for about 2 years in the 1970s. Although subsequent outbreaks did not occur, there was serological evidence of ROCV circulation, which serves as a warning signal for possible new epidemics (

 <italic>Aedes</italic>. Although 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> is not a very efficient vector, 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> is able to transmit this virus. The cases of encephalitis due to LACV infection have low mortality, but there are reports of patients with neurological complications, which may make the differential diagnosis difficult with other arboviruses (
