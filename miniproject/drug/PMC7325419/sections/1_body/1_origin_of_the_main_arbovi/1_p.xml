<p>Arbovirus (arthropod-borne virus) is the non-taxonomic term used to define a group of viruses transmitted by hematophagous arthropods (

The reasons for the emergence or reemergence of some diseases are not fully known, but the following mechanisms have been identified as causes of change or increases in the incidence of many diseases: altered habitat, loss of biodiversity, niche invasion or host–shifting by pathogens, human–induced genetic changes in disease vectors or pathogens, environmental contamination, and diminishing global travel times, when infected people carry pathogens before symptoms occur (
