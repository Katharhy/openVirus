<p>The physical and chemical control methods are based on the elimination of breeding sites and in the use of insecticides to reduce population density, thus decreasing the transmission of pathogens and, consequently, preventing epidemics. In 1902, Oswaldo Cruz led the first Brazilian public campaign to control 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic>, which was based on the elimination of artificial breeding sites. At the time, this campaign aimed to reduce the transmission of yellow fever. However, the vector was eradicated only in the middle of 1955. Afterwards, the mosquito was reintroduced over time and became endemic in much of the country. In the following years, control strategies were guided by the “Programa Nacional de Controle da Dengue” (PNCD), which recommended using physical strategies based on the identification of regions according to infestation rates. To date, WHO has promoted integrated vector control, in addition to conventional tools such as mosquito nets treated with materials, nets, oviposition traps (ovitraps), among others. Numerous studies have shown that ovitraps are an effective strategy that contributes to the monitoring of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> populations hence the areas at risk of transmission of arboviruses (

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Mackay et al. (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) developed the autocidal gravid ovitrap (AGO-A), a lethal ovitrap based on the gravid ovitrap (GO). It has already been shown that the use of AGO has significantly reduced the prevalence of mosquitoes infected with CHIKV (
