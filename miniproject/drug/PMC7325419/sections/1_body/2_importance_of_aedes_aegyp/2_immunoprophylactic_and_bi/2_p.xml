<p>While efforts in the search for vaccine targets are being made, vector control strategies need to be developed that can prevent the emergence of new epidemics and the simultaneously control circulating arboviruses. Due to the lack of antiviral drugs against arboviruses, the main measure for preventing or reducing the transmission of diseases depends entirely on the control of vectors or the interruption of human-vector contact (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In this context, the use of sterile insect technique (SIT) and Release of Insects carrying a Dominant Lethal (RIDL) developed by genetic engineering was proposed as a control strategy (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). Alphey and Andreasen (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>) reviewed these techniques, which are largely based on the RIDL. After copulation, this dominant gene causes the death of its progeny. These approaches show a great potential for disease control (

 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>) and have been tested in different endemic countries for 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> control (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). In Brazil, the use of OX513A self-limiting strain reduced the local 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> population by up to 95% in a suburb of Juazeiro, Bahia (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). This transgenically modified 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> mosquito containing a dominant lethal gene transgenic strain (OX513A), was incorporated into the target field population (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). Furthermore, the impacts of introgression from a 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> transgenic strain remain unclear for arbovirus control and transmission purposes (
