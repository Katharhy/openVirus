<p>Despite abundant evidence of success, the use of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> presents limitations in countries with wide temperature fluctuations. Ross et al. (
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>) showed a drastic reduction in the frequency of wMel infection after a heatwave of a 43.6Â°C, an effect that is stage specific. Another limitation of this strategy is that the establishment of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in the mosquito population depends on resistance to insecticides. Garcia et al. (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>) released 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> strains infected with 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> using susceptible (wMelBr) and resistant (wMelRio) mosquito-infected 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains to pyrethroids in an isolated region of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Only the 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> strain infected with the resistant strain (wMelRio) allowed the establishment of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. The use of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, when combined with other strategies such as a transmission blocking vaccine (TBVs), could help reduce arbovirus transmission; yet endemic countries spend about twice as much on treating patients as they do on preventing mosquito-transmitted diseases (
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>). The cost of dengue in the Americas is already billions of dollars a year (
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>). The strategy of investing in patient treatment and disregard vector control has already proven to be a complete failure, as arbovirus-related diseases have shown no clear sign of reduction over the past years.
