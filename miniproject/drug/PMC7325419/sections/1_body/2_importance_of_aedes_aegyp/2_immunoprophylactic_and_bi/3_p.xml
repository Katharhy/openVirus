<p>A number of natural predators (fish and crustaceans) and pathogenic organisms (fungi and bacteria) have already been employed in an attempt to control 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic>. The entomopathogenic bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis var. Israelensis (Bti) is commonly found in nature and carries toxins with strong insecticidal activity through the formation of spores and crystals. The Bti has high specificity for 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and is practically innocuous to humans (

 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). The use of this bacteria enabled the development of larvicides such as DengTechÂ® (Fiocruz/BR3) and VectoBac WG. However, it has been reported that environmental factors such as high temperatures and a high annual rainfall interfere with VectoBac's efficacy (
