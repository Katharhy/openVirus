<p>The TBVs are strategies that consist of using essential vector proteins capable of inducing specific antibody production after host immunization. Therefore, after blood meal on an immunized host, the antibody triggered by vaccination could induce interference in the cell cycle on the vector or/and block virus infection to the vector, thus preventing disease transmission to human hosts (

 <italic>Leishmania infantum</italic> by 
 <italic>Lutzomyia longipalpis</italic> (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>) have been reported in the literature, showing this strategy as promising and possibly helpful in interrupting distinct pathogen transmission cycle. Notwithstanding the potential of TBVs, they do not directly protect humans, so there is resistance to their use in public health programs (
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>). In 1980, there were about 95 species of arboviruses cataloged in Brazil alone, but this number has doubled in the last three decades and today 210 arboviruses circulate in the country. It is known that at least 37 of them are capable of causing disease in humans (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The recent epidemics in South America warn of the possibility of the emergence of new arboviruses and the resurgence of diseases transmitted by previously controlled vectors (
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>). In addition to preventing disease transmission, new strategies for sustainable control of vector populations are highly recommended (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). As viruses first infect and multiply in the midgut, molecules overexpressed after blood meal have been suggested as possible TBVs. The challenge with this strategy is the fact that some viruses have more than one serotype (
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>). Our research group has focused on the development of TBVs against some vectors, including 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic>. In a pre-clinical trial, we analyzed distinct vector antigen targets. The data are in the final phase of analysis, but we have already identified promising targets that interfered in all 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> developmental stages and reduced the number of mosquitoes generated at the end of the first generation by up to 90% (unpublished data). TBVs that target specific mosquito molecules can help to reduce the circulation of pathogens transmitted by the same vector simultaneously. Taking into account the challenges of controlling vector-borne diseases, the future of vaccines against pathogens transmitted by vector will most likely incorporate the TBV rationale. One example is the use of subunit vaccines against Dengue in which nanocarrier platforms are added to recombinant immunogenic DENV proteins. Such nanocarriers are able to increase the immunogenicity of rather poor immunogens in the presence of adjuvants, potentiating their use. Carbon nanotubes are a good example of carriers that could be used for this purpose (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), being also associated to the TBV antigen in a single formulation. This approach could permit improved vaccinal efficacy toward a new generation of high-performance vaccines against vector-borne diseases.
