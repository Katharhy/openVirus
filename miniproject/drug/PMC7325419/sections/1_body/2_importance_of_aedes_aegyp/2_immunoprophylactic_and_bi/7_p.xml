<p>The medical importance of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> is clear, such as the failure to control it, the large number of transmitted pathogens, and the persistently high number of cases, as observed in dengue. In this scenario, biotechnological proposals, such as TBV development, could result in an important reduction in number of vectors and prevent the transmission of pathogens.
