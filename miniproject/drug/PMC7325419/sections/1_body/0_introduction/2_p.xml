<p>The 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> genus has more than 950 species of mosquitoes, many of which transmit potentially deadly pathogens to humans and other animals. Among the species, 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is currently the main global arbovirus vector (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Carvalho and Moreira (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) reviewed the main reasons for 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> having both reproductive success and being so well-adapted to the urban environment. This mosquito lives in urban habitats and reproduces primarily in artificial containers (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). A single female makes several blood meals during each feeding period and hematophagy occurs preferentially in humans (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The blood meal is essential for egg maturation. During oviposition, the female spreads the eggs in many breeding sites to ensure reproductive success and can remain viable for over 1 year (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Beyond the vertical transmission, an infected female is able to transmit the arbovirus for the rest of its life after virus incubation (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In this review, we demonstrate the impact caused by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>-borne diseases based on current literature, highlighting the history of vector control based on the major biotechnological approaches for preventing new arboviral epidemics.
