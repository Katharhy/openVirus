<p>Mosquitoes of the Culicidae family are considered the most dangerous animals on earth due to their capacity to transmit diseases and their medical importance regarding viruses, protozoa, and nematode transmission (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) vector-borne diseases are considered public health problems and have a major social and economic impact causing high morbidity and mortality, especially in developing countries (
