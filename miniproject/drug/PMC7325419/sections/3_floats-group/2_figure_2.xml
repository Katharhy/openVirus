  <p>Survival rates in mice immunized or not with a subunit anti-Dengue vaccine and challenged with a virulent DENV3 strain. Briefly, the recombinant Dengue serotype 3 Envelope protein was produced in 
   <italic>E. coli</italic>, purified by affinity chromatography, and quantified. Purified recombinant proteins were covalently linked to multi-walled carbon nanotubes though a diimide-activated amidation protocol (
   <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>). Evaluation of the nanotubes functionalization was verified by transmission electronic microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Ten-weeks old BALB/c mice were divided into 4 groups: non-immunized control (PBS), vaccine-immunized group (MWNT-rDENV3E), animals immunized with the recombinant protein alone (rDENV3E), and animals inoculated only with pristine nanotubes (MWNT). All groups were either immunized or mock-immunized three times every 7 days, through the intramuscular route. After 7 days of the last inoculation, animals were challenged with 10
   <sup>3</sup> PFUs of DENV3. Animals were evaluated daily until the appearance of neuropathology and were then humanely euthanized when a 25% weight loss was confirmed. In total, surviving mice were evaluated for 21 days. The study was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments from the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (CETEA/UFMG 270/2010). The symbol “*” in the groups (MWNT, rDENV3E, MWNT-rDENV3E) demonstrates statistical differences (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared to PBS group, according One-way ANOVA test and Tukey's post-test analysis.
