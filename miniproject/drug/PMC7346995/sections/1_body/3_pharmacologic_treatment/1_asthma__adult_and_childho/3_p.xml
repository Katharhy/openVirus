<p>From the data available, it is currently clear that children are far less affected by COVID-19 than adults and that clinical symptoms are usually milder in children than in adults.
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Moreover, according to data from the American CDC, it is found that the prevalence of asthma in children (n = 345) with COVID-19 is about 11.5%, which is lower than that in the general population (20%). However, these data must be interpreted with caution because the total number of children included in the study was relatively small, and there was a considerable amount of missing data.
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Although specific studies on the effect of COVID-19 in asthmatic children have not been published yet, COVID-19 may not be an asthmogenic virus in children. In a review article, it is suggested that pediatric allergists should treat patients with asthma, AR or other allergic conditions according to the usual guidelines. In addition, there is no evidence that currently available asthma and allergy medications, including antihistamines, ICSs and bronchodilators, increase the risk of disease exacerbation by COVID-19. It is also not advisable to stop oral steroids in the management of asthma if the patient is already taking these medications or to avoid oral steroids for the treatment of an acute asthma attack even if it is due to COVID-19.
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Although additional studies are needed in patients with pediatric asthma, it seems that COVID-19 is not a risk for asthma exacerbation in healthy or asthmatic children. During the current pandemic, asthmatic children should continue to receive preventive treatment in order to be under good control. There have been no studies on the effect of COVID-19 on AR in children yet. The Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA)-European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) mentioned that patients with common allergic conditions do not develop additional distinct symptoms or seem to be at increased risk of severe disease when infected with COVID-19.
