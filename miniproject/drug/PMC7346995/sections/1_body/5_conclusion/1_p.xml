<p>It is still uncertain whether COVID-19 increases the risk of aggravating asthma or allergic diseases. Detailed monitoring and optimal treatment with AIT, ICS and biologics need to be continued in all patients suffering from asthma and allergic diseases. This can be achieved in a safe condition using optimal protective measures. Patients at high risk (older age and comorbid conditions) should be monitored more strictly. We applaud all the allergy/immunology specialists who strive to stay up for optimal health protection by focusing on patient management during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
