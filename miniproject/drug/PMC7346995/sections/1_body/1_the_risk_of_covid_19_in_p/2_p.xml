<p>Immunosuppressive agents are frequently used to achieve a well-controlled status in patients with asthma or severe allergic diseases. Systemic corticosteroid, one of the most widely used rescue medications in allergic diseases, is known to increase the risk for systemic infections, and so do other immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate and cyclosporin.
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Fortunately, the advent of biologic agents, such as anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE), anti-interleukin (IL)-5 and anti-IL-4 antibodies, has improved treatment outcomes with reduction in medications including systemic corticosteroids. As it is not clear whether biologics may increase the susceptibility to serious infections, further studies are needed to draw conclusions. Taken together, we should consider the possibility of bidirectional influences between COVID-19 and asthma/allergic diseases, which can be influenced by patients' clinical characteristics such as age, comorbid illnesses, and profiles of the medications.
