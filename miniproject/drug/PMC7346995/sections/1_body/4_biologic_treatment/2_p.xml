<p>In allergic children, biologics are mainly used in patients with severe eczema or severe asthma. There have been no studies or guidelines on the usage of biologics in allergic children during the COVID-19 pandemic. A case report suggested that immunosuppressive therapy with biologics might be effective in COVID-19 patients with an overactive immune response, cytokine storm; however, there have been no systematic studies on this.
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> When children under treatment with biologics are infected with COVID-19 and present with only mild symptoms, the treatment can be continued. However, when either adults or children who develop severe COVID-19 symptoms, the treatment should be delayed until they completely recover.
