<p>As of April 2020, the situation in Shanghai has come under good control, owing to the immediate reaction of the local government to raise the emergency response level to the highest grade in early January, right after the outbreak had started in Wuhan. As one of the most important and busiest traffic hub cities in the world, Shanghai has applied no traffic restrictions until now; but strict measures have been issued to ensure that potentially affected passengers would be detected on arrival at the airports or train stations, so that they could be quarantined immediately without passing on the disease to more people. Patients suspected of having COVID-19 are received at designated clinics in each administrative district. Those confirmed to have the disease are centralized to the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, a hospital specializing in infectious diseases established during the SARS outbreak. This has been very successful in that the total number of confirmed COVID-19 infection has been curtailed to a little over 300, most of them coming from other places in China or from other countries. With merely 3 deaths so far, it has been a remarkable achievement for a metropolitan city of over 20 million population. However, patients with other diseases may have had their treatment delayed due to limited access to routine healthcare during this pandemic. The latter has been largely slowed down, either because of resources deviated to deal with the epidemic (there have been over 1000 doctors and nurses sending to Wuhan from Shanghai), or caution on the side of the hospital for protection of healthcare staff as well as unaffected patients. Elective surgery was suspended in most general hospitals when the situation in China was critical in late January and early February. Invasive examinations including endoscopy were also considered risky and not prescribed unless in an emergency.</p>
