<p>However, the public health system in Shanghai has been very efficient in taking things under control. Thoracic and cardiovascular surgery services were gradually returning to near to normal by March. At the Shanghai Chest Hospital, a tertiary referral center specializing in chest diseases, emergency surgery was not stopped, and selective surgery for lung cancer, esophageal cancer, and mediastinal tumors resumed in early February, right after the Chinese New Year holidays. This was undertaken very carefully, screening candidates using both clinical history and computed tomography. Only those without history of traveling to severely affected areas or contact with a person suspected of coronavirus infection and no sign of pulmonary infection, would be admitted. Surgery was postponed for patients with ground-glass opacity lesions smaller than 1.5 cm, mostly pure ground-glass opacity with a mean computed tomography value less than 500 Hu, and those showing no enlargement or consolidation during follow-up. They were treated similarly to patients with benign diseases in whom postponed elective surgery would do no harm but may help avoid an unnecessary risk of exposure to coronavirus. In the more than 700 cases operated on in the past two months, the majority recovered uneventfully with only a few morbidities (none related to coronavirus). With the COVID-19 outbreak now a pandemic around the world, almost every surgeon is facing similar problems to some extent. It is now known that the situation may go on much longer than expected. The experience in Shanghai shows that except in severely affected regions, enough attention should be paid make sure that routine care is still available to the patients in need. Selective surgery for cancer patients in non-severely affected regions is safe, as long as enough precautions have been taken.
