<p>As Asia is the largest continent, it is not surprising that the degree to which thoracic surgical services have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic has varied greatly from one region to another. Although some regions have experienced significant reductions in the volume of thoracic surgery operations, others have maintained near-normal service. The key determinants of whether thoracic surgery services can be provided during the pandemic appear to be: prior experience with epidemics, resulting in pre-established response plans; prompt government action to both reduce import of cases and limit local spread (i.e., flatten the curve); adequate resources to split between dedicated COVID-19 care and normal clinical services; prioritization of important clinical disease (such as thoracic cancer); and volume of confirmed or suspected cases in a specific region. The lesson from the Asian experience appears to be that if prompt action is taken to control the viral outbreak in its early stages, it is still possible to maintain a degree of specialist surgical service to the most in-need patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. When the world emerges from this current pandemic, it is necessary to draw from current experiences to establish robust response strategies in preparation for future outbreaks.</p>
