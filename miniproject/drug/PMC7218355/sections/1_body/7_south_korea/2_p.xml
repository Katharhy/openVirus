<p>Korea seemed to have the virus under control in the early phase of the situation, but an outbreak within a particular religious group (Shincheonji) has derailed plans. Since the first cluster outbreak associated with the Shincheonji occurred at Daegu on February 20, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has surged. At the time of writing, 82.6% of the total cases occurred as a result of cluster outbreaks related to religious groups and long-term care hospitals. As a result, 67% (125/186) of deaths were reported in Daegu province, where the outbreaks associated with Shincheonji occurred. The acute surge of COVID-19 patients in this area overwhelmed the capacity of local medical resources, especially for intensive care.</p>
