<p>As a response by the public healthcare system, the Korean Center for Disease Control urgently designated 80 hospitals to provide negative-pressure isolation wards exclusively for COVID-19 patients, and to triage the patients. In hospitals located in high-risk regions, including Daegu, a test was conducted on all patients before admission, and results were generally available within 4 hours. As patients were properly triaged before admission, most cardiothoracic surgical operations could be performed as normal, and no special intraoperative measures were in place at the time of writing. Although the situation could be quite different in each hospital in terms of the clinical burden of COVID-19, most hospitals have performed lung cancer surgery as usual.</p>
