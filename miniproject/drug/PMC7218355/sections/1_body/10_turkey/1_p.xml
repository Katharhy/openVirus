 </sup> Nationwide vaccination and sanitation strategies commencing in the 1950s have since paid off, and epidemics have been averted during the last 50 years. Turkey’s first SARS-CoV-2 case was diagnosed on March 11, 2020. On March 27, tough restrictions such as cancelling all international flights, banning citizens from intercity travel via public transport and airplanes, and closing picnic and recreation sites on weekends were announced.

 </sup> From March 11, Istanbul became the epicenter of the outbreak in Turkey, with more than 60% of Turkish cases. Many secondary and all public and private tertiary care hospitals with expertise in infectious disease, chest disease, anesthesiology, and specialist intensive care were announced to be “hospitals of the pandemic”. This meant that all confirmed and/or suspected cases can be admitted to those hospitals, and all patients can be treated under the nationwide insurance system umbrella. The number of elective thoracic surgeries performed reduced during the last two weeks of March in most hospitals in Istanbul. At the time of writing, almost no elective thoracic surgical operations are being performed, including stage III lung cancer cases. Most thoracic surgery units were re-purposed as wards for COVID-19 patients. In Istanbul, almost all thoracic surgery attending and consulting surgeons as well as thoracic surgery residents were put on duty lists to care for COVID-19 patients. Only a small number of wards could be dedicated to noninfected cases. This reorganization of thoracic surgery units did not happen in other cities in Turkey, in which only small numbers of patients were diagnosed to have COVID-19. Many thoracic surgery units outside Istanbul have reportedly continued to perform elective surgeries.

 </sup> However, the number of thoracic surgeries performed were claimed to be reduced to some extent due to public restrictions that were in effect in the whole nation. As the reported number of new cases and mortalities in Turkey continued to increase, although at a slower rate, as of April 6, it is unknown whether other thoracic surgery units in other cities would continue to perform elective surgeries with their patients admitted to dedicated thoracic surgery wards.
