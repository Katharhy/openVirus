<p>Singapore confirmed its first COVID-19 infection on January 23, 2020. The first patient was a Chinese tourist from Wuhan: a 66-year-old male. About a week later, a 47-year-old woman who travelled to China was confirmed to have coronavirus. At the time of writing, Singapore had reported a total of 1375 confirmed COVID-19 cases with 6 deaths and 30 clusters. Of these, 571 are still in hospital, 344 have recovered, and 25 are in critical care. Singapore, being a country at the crossroads of travel and the hub for international entry into South-East Asia, was definitely going to be affected by this pandemic. The past experience of this country in handling the 2003 SARS crisis held it in good stead. After the SARS episode, the country made a collective decision to build a dedicated hospital for epidemics/pandemics like this. Named the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, it is customized to handle outbreaks like this, including customized intensive care. This has helped Singapore to concentrate all infected cases in one hospital so that the rest of the healthcare system is not overburdened. In spite of this, there has been an overflow which has slowed down elective care of surgical and nonsurgical patients.</p>
