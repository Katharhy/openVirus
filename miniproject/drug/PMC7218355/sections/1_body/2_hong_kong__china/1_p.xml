<p>Hong Kong has largely avoided a massive surge in the incidence of COVID-19 cases despite the large numbers of people that normally travel daily between it and mainland China where the virus outbreak was first reported. This is probably due to a combination of two factors.

 </sup> First, Hong Kong was the epicentre of the 2003 SARS outbreak, and the local population learned painful lessons from that time very well. From the first news of the situation in Wuhan in January 2020, the vast majority of Hong Kong people spontaneously began rigorous mask-wearing, personal hygiene, and social distancing. Second, the official response by the healthcare system was also relatively quick. On January 8, before a single case had even been confirmed in Hong Kong, the new “severe respiratory disease associated with a novel infectious agent” was listed as a notifiable disease, and all visiting at public hospitals was restricted. By January 25, when there were only 5 confirmed cases in Hong Kong, the Hospital Authority activated its emergency response level, suspending all visiting at public hospitals and requesting all public hospitals to review their nonemergency services.

 </sup> The latter effectively meant that the majority of elective surgery operations were suspended to allow resources to be focused on the COVID-19 response. The private healthcare sector in Hong Kong is relatively large and robust, and private hospitals quickly followed suit by applying very strict policies regulating both patients and staff to ensure that any person with suspected COVID-19 could not enter. The net result of these parallel approaches was that care for suspected cases of COVID-19 was concentrated in public hospitals, whereas private hospitals could continue a degree of normal service, including elective surgery.
