<p>Cardiothoracic surgery services in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 outbreak have been affected to a lesser degree than other surgical specialities. It was recognized that patients on the waiting lists for cardiac and thoracic malignancy operations may have conditions that require prompt surgery, and hence these cases have been prioritized. Although the elective cardiothoracic operating lists in the public hospitals were initially reduced to some degree, normal or near-normal service was soon resumed. Again, the lessons learned from the 2003 SARS outbreak enabled hospitals to quickly adapt measures protecting operating room staff and allowing surgery to proceed.

 </sup> At the time of writing, because the viral outbreak has thus far been reasonably controlled, the ward and intensive care unit bed situation in Hong Kong has not been excessively strained and has not compromised cardiothoracic surgical services. The parallel approach taken by the private hospitals to ensure a virus-free environment also ensured that they were in a good position to not only maintain near-normal volumes of private thoracic operations, but also to take up any shortfall in the public service. In particular, patients concerned about being managed in comparatively busy public hospitals that also treated COVID-19 cases had the option of private surgery instead. Overall, the only noticeable effect on cardiac and thoracic surgical services has perhaps been a drop in the number of operations for non-neoplastic thoracic conditions. At the time of writing, the only uncertainty in the near future is whether a recent uptick in the number of COVID-19 cases due to Hong Kong citizens returning from abroad and a mini-outbreak from those going to bars and clubs may evolve into a full-blown second or third wave of infections.

 </sup> If this occurs and causes a surge in admissions, the provision of cardiothoracic surgery services may yet come under review.
