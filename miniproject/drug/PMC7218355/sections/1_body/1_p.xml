<p>The specialty of general thoracic surgery includes the management of serious diseases such as lung cancers, esophageal cancers, mediastinal and chest wall diseases. Successful management of many of these diseases is time-dependent. It is therefore a clinical and ethical necessity to provide adequate care for patients with thoracic surgical conditions, even during the COVID-19 pandemic.

 </sup> This paper collates the experience of the Thoracic Domain of the Asian Society for Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery. Domain members describe how different regions in Asia have coped with maintaining thoracic surgical services during the challenging months of January to April 2020. As COVID-19 afflicted East Asia earlier than most other parts of the world, it is hoped that the sharing of these experiences may help surgeons everywhere in tailoring their own responses to the COVID-19 challenge.
