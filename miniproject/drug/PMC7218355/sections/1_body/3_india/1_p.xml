<p>India saw its first cases on January 30, 2020, originating from a patient who travelled from China. An update on April 9, 2020 showed that there were 5734 confirmed COVID-19 patients, of whom 473 have recovered and 166 have died. The actual number of cases is expected to be much higher because testing is limited and socioeconomic conditions in the country differ vastly. A lot of patients in the rural community may not have access to healthcare and testing. The infection rate of COVID-19 in India is reported to be 1.7%, significantly lower than in the worst affected countries. The Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897 has been implemented, and there has been a total lockdown since March 24, 2020 for 21 days. This has affected the 1.3 billion population in the country. All tourist visas have been suspended and international incoming and outgoing flights have been suspended.</p>
