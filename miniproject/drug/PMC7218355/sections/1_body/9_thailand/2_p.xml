<p>Few dedicated COVID-19 hospitals have been opened. Several hospitals have started COVID-19 wards, person under investigation wards, cohort wards, and acute respiratory infection clinics since January 2020. Modification of clinics, wards, intensive care units, and operating rooms has been undertaken, including negative-pressure locations. To avoid the loss of healthcare workers observed in many countries (which disrupted the healthcare system, leading to even more deaths), there was a particular focus on protecting healthcare personnel. Improvised equipment and tools have been used, such as examination chambers, face shields, and endotracheal intubation boxes, to protect doctors and nurses. Donation and support from non-medical organizations have been a huge help. For surgery, besides postponing elective cases, guidelines have been issued to surgically manage confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases properly (including pre-, intra-, and postoperative measures) whilst providing a safe environment for surgical teams.</p>
