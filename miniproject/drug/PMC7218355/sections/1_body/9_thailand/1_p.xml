<p>Thailand has been the number one destination for Chinese tourists for decades. When COVID-19 started to spread widely, Thailand was probably the most at-risk region (except for Hong Kong and Macao). The first COVID-19 case detected in Thailand was in a Chinese tourist. The spread first started amongst people who had contact with foreigners. However, Thailand currently ranks sixth in the world among countries with the strongest health security, second for “rapidly responding and mitigating the spreading of the endemic”, and has been coping well with the endemic since the beginning. The total of number confirmed cases was under 100 in January and February. In March, two outbreak clusters changed the game. One cluster was in the Thai boxing stadium that contained 5000 people crowded into a closed space. Among these people were tourists from around the world. The other cluster was at a party that included a sick Chinese man. These two clusters, together with returning Thais from abroad, brought the total confirmed cases to just over 1000 in early April 2020. The situation was getting worse so several acts were announced. Shutdown of several main cities, including Bangkok, and stay-at-home/social distancing campaigns have been introduced. These actions have allowed the situation to be better controlled. Regarding the effect on the healthcare system, increasing numbers of confirmed and critical cases raised nationwide awareness. Each hospital prepared for the worst-case scenario and realized that most lacked adequate resources, especially protective equipment such as medical masks and gowns. Shutdown of nonemergency/non-urgent services was instituted in most hospitals, including surgical services. Siriraj Hospital, the largest hospital and one of the main hospitals treating critical COVID-19 patients, has postponed all elective cases (including even cancer operations) for months. The majority of the other hospitals markedly reduced their surgery volume but still operated on cancer patients. The total number of confirmed cases in Thailand at the time of writing was around 2200, with 1400 patients admitted. In Siriraj Hospital, the number of confirmed cases admitted is currently 61, with no deaths.</p>
