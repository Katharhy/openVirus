<p>From the lesson learned from the SARS outbreak in 2003, Taiwan started its prevention program the first moment that person-to-person transmission of an unknown viral infection in Wuhan (COVID-19) was confirmed. The response included border control, case identification, and containment. The travel history of all citizens could be assessed by all hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies to identify individuals at high risk through contact. The policy also included resource allocation with control of all surgical masks, N95 masks, and negative-pressure control rooms by the Taiwan Center for Disease Control, to ensure their availability for disease prevention and treatment.

 </sup> As of April 2020, there were around 400 confirmed cases (including 6 mortalities) in Taiwan. COVID-19 infection was detected among the medical personnel in one medical center, which led to a policy of restriction for all visitors to hospitals in Taiwan. The government has encouraged people to delay their visits to hospital for “minor disease”. However, there are no clear criteria on disease categories. Although, there is a decrease in patient numbers in all surgical departments, medical and surgical practice in Taiwan remains unchanged for all patients without risk of COVID-19 infection. This situation may be changed or further modified as the situation evolves at the time of writing. As an example of the potential fluidity of the situation, a second wave of new cases due to overseas citizens returning to Taiwan was observed in March, although there was subsequently a continuous decrease in reported new cases.
