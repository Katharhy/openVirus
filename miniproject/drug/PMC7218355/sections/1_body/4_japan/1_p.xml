<p>After a patient in Japan was first diagnosed with COVID-19 infection on January 15, 2020, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare released the first information on a new coronavirus-related pneumonia in Wuhan City on January 22, 2020. The first death of a patient in Japan was confirmed on February 13. In the early phase, horizontal infection from abroad was the major problem. However, the number of patients gradually increased, and after the total of domestic infections exceeded 1000 on March 21, a sharp increase was observed, mainly in urban areas. On April 7, 2020, the government issued an emergency declaration to seven prefectures including Tokyo and Osaka, and expanded it nationwide on April 16. As of April 17, the number of COVID-19 patients was 9167, and the number of deaths was 148. Coronavirus-infected patients were admitted to hospitals designated by law, and treated at national expense. Due to the surge in the number of the patients and nosocomial infections in some hospitals, a shortage of beds, hospital staff, equipment such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenators, ventilators, and N95 masks, became the most important issues.</p>
