<p>The statement also contained details of cautions when performing surgery. If a patient was diagnosed with or strongly suspected of having COVID-19 infection, attention should be paid to the following. Aerosol/droplet infection during tracheal intubation and extubation is recognized as presenting a significant risk to anesthesiologists, surgeons, and medical staff. Personal protective equipment must be worn in the operating room. Surgeons and medical staff who are not involved in intubation/extubation should wait outside the operating room as needed. The operating room is exclusively for COVID-19-positive patients, and a negative operating pressure is preferred. Access to the operating room for medical personnel should be minimized. A smoke exhaust device is necessary for electrical cautery. Surgeons fully equipped with personal protective equipment have considerable physical and mental fatigue and should try to reduce surgery time as much as possible and consider a change of personnel during surgery.</p>
