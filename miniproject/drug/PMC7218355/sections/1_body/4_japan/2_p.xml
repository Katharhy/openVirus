<p>On April 1, 2020, the Japanese Surgical Society made recommendations regarding surgery for patients diagnosed with or suspected of having COVID-19. This was a joint statement of the Japanese Medical Science Federation and the 9 surgical societies. It was a tentative summary of issues based on current evidence and guidelines from overseas academic societies, which surgeons should be aware of. This statement analyzed the current and future status of COVID-19 infection and described how to continue to provide surgical treatment to patients. In the statement, it was emphasized that ensuring the safety of both patients and medical staff was most important in continuing medical activities. It was also suggested that patient triage before surgery may be indispensable when medical resources were limited. In thoracic surgery, operations for malignant tumors and lung transplantation were listed as high-priority and should be performed even if resources were limited. On the other hand, surgery for low-grade malignant tumors such as stage IA adenocarcinoma with ground-glass opacities was given a lower priority. Prior to any surgery, a polymerase chain reaction test on the patientâ€™s nasopharyngeal swab was recommended. Chest computed tomography, as a sensitive means for detecting lung infiltration, was also recommended just before surgery.</p>
