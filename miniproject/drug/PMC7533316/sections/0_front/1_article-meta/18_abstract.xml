 <title>Summary</title>
 <p>Pandemics deeply affect the health and economy of the world population. A precise determination of affected communities is of great importance to establish containment measures and reduce the economic impact. Here, we propose the development of Units for Vigilance of Emerging Diseases based on the screening of pathogens released to wastewater treatment plants to follow the spread of the infectious agent to determine the location of infected people.</p>
