<p>International agencies consider that an annual investment of between 1.9 and 3.4 billion to strengthen plant, animal and human health systems would produce a global public benefit. The fact that treated wastewater is used for agriculture might potentially disseminate plant pathogens across wide agricultural areas that are worth monitoring. Current legislation in many countries requires the analysis of the presence of certain pathogens such as 
 <italic>Salmonella,</italic> faecal coliforms and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. Theses analyses are normally performed by WWTPs managing companies whose costs are normally passed on to the consumer. Therefore, we believe that the creation of such UVEDs for WWTPs under the coordination of a central service to analyse countrywide nucleic acid samples would greatly benefit our society and should be implemented by future legislation similarly to the analysis of other pathogens in the treated wastewater. This approach would represent the beginning of a shift from personalized medicine to community medicine.
