<p id="Par76">Rift Valley Fever has emerged and extended outside Africa in the 2000s, leading to the re-description of the human disease. There is a global concern about the risk of RVFV exportation in areas where competent vectors are present including Europe and North America. Economic losses, human morbidity and mortality may be significant during epidemics. Infection with RVF has a wide clinical spectrum and may result in delayed complications. There are no commercially licensed vaccines nor antiviral treatment for humans. Human cases are often detected when the virus has already spread among livestock and people, hence outbreak control is challenging. Thus, human case surveillance systems for early detection and correct management are essential to reduce global morbidity and mortality. We proposed a tool for physician guidance on the field. This algorithm should be evaluated during ongoing and coming outbreaks, and could help neighboring places in the detection of cases. We identified frontiers of knowledge and remaining uncertainties concerning RVF which deserves more interest. In particular, therapeutic trials on specific supportive care, antiviral molecules or immunotherapies, should be anticipated to be implemented at the start of future epidemics.</p>
