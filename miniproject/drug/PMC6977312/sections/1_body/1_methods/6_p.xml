<p id="Par50">We used data on RVF human cases reported by the WHO in the rubric “disease outbreak news” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and the CDC outbreak summaries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] to build an epidemiological overview and we used the software Adobe Illustrator 22.1 and macrovector official freepik for figures.
