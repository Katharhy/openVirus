<p id="Par65">Macular exudates with potential permanent loss of central visual acuity were firstly described in 7 among 20,000 estimated cases (&lt; 0.05%) during the 1950–51 outbreak in South Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. The prevalence of ocular manifestations has been estimated to 1% during epidemic outbreaks in Egypt in 1977, and up to 15% both in patients with mild and severe RVF disease during the 2000 outbreak in southwest Saudi Arabia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Unilateral or bilateral symptoms generally occur 5 to 14 days after the RVFV infection, but can be more delayed, and may include decreased visual acuity, scotoma, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis and retro-orbital pain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. The most frequent and most specific ocular lesion is a macular or paramacular retinitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. The funduscopy by indirect ophthalmoscopy usually shows a single well demarcated necrotic lesion with ill-defined creamy-white patchy lesions of macular retinitis with hemorrhages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. The other retinal signs include arterial occlusions, vasculitis (mostly phlebitis and sometimes arteritis) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>], sheathing of the vessels, which are best explored using fluorescein angiography. In series, vitreous reaction with vitreal haze or vitritis occurred in less than one third of patients, optic-nerve head edema or palor were described in 15% of cases with retinal involvement, and no infectious optic neuropathy was reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Anterior uveitis was associated with a posterior uveitis, defining a panuveitis with aqueous flare and fine non-granulomatous keratic precipitates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Fluorescein angiography performed during the active phase of the disease may show early hypofluorescence with delayed filling of the arterioles and venules, associated with late staining of the lesions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. It also helps for the diagnosis of vasculitis, showing vessels sheathing and staining, and vascular occlusions when present. Follow-up fluorescein angiography performed several months after RVF diagnosis have revealed window defect in the area of the retinitis, vascular occlusions and obliterated macular vessels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. However, ophthalmoscopic and angiographic features of the RVFV associated retinitis are not specific and can be encountered in several viral or bacterial infections (Table
