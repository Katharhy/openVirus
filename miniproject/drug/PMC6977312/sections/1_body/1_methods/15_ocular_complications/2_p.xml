<p id="Par66">Ocular active lesions resolve spontaneously in 10 to 12 weeks. Macular or paramacular scarring, vascular occlusions and post-infectious optic atrophy associated to the central scarring lead to poor visual acuity outcomes. Retinal complications may cause 40–50% of permanent vision loss, and up to 71% of the affected eyes reached the criteria for legal blindness [

Post-mortem examination suggested the presence of focal areas of retinal necrosis and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) degeneration with round cell inflammatory infiltration and perivascular cuffing but the presence of the virus in the ocular tissues has not been proved. Most of animal models for RVF do not show any ocular disease [
