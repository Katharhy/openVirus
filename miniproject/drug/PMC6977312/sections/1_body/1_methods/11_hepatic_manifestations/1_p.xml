Acute hepatitis may complicate with prolonged blood coagulation times and may occur together with or precede fatal hemorrhages or neurologic complications. Autopsy studies and pathogenesis characterization in mouse model found evidence of liver necrosis with RVF viral antigens identified within hepatocytes and Küpffer cells, arguing for a direct virus-induced cellular necrosis [
