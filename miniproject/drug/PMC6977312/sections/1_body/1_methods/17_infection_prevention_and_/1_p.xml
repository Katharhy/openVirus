<p id="Par68">Importantly, hemorrhagic complications require high cautious infection control measures, following the CDC guidance on infection control precautions for hemorrhagic viral fevers (HVFs), while waiting for the exclusion of other HVFs such as Ebola virus disease or Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. Standard precautions with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) were reported sufficient to prevent from nosocomial transmission of RVFV during the outbreak in Arabian Peninsula [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>], to care any suspected case regarding the theoretic risk of RVFV transmission through contact with infected blood, tissues, or other body fluids, secretions and excretions. Considering RVF is also mosquito-borne disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], we recommend for all-day preventive measures against vectors using physical (long clothing and bed nets), chemical (topical repellents and insecticide impregnations) barriers in the environment of viremic patients. Considering the mean length of the viremia, these measures could be reasonably stopped 1Â week after the illness onset, but there is no evidence-based cut-off time to allow donation of blood and removal of tissue or organs for transplantation from a RVFV-infected patient.
