<p id="Par70">According to WHO a confirmed RVF infection relies on (i) detection of RVFV RNA by reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on sera or plasma; (ii) IgM and IgG detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Viral isolation is also an assay for laboratory confirmation of RVFV infection but this assay needs to be done on BSL3 and is less sensitive than detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR. Interestingly, RT-PCR for RVFV was reported positive for a prolonged period in urines, semen [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The RVFV RNA load in blood usually decreases between days 1 to 4 and may be detectable until day 8 after the onset of symptoms [

Thus, testing of serial patient specimens collected 24 to 48 h apart may have prognostic value in determining patient outcome. The decrease in viral loads coincides with a rise in RVFV specific IgM and IgG antibodies that may be testing using ELISA. The presence of IgM antibodies appears as an early transient response (day 4 to 60) and protective IgG antibodies persist for several years [
