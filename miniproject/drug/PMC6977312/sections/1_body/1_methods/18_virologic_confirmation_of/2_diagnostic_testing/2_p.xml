<p id="Par71">In case of delayed-onset of encephalitis or ocular complications, imputation to RVFV may be difficult if only IgG are identified in blood at this stage. In human cases with encephalitis, specific IgM and IgG can be detected in CSF [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. No positive RVFV cultures or RT-PCR have been reported in CSF, or on aqueous or vitreous samples and should be further tested.
