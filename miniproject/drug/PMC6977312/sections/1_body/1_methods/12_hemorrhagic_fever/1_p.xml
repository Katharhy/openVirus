<p id="Par59">Soon after the onset of flu-like illness or acute hepatitis, patients may present bleeding from the nose or gums (gingivorrhagia being a key early warning sign) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], hematemesis or melaena, petechial/purpuric rash or ecchymoses, menorrhagia, hematuria, or bleeding from venipuncture sites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Yellow fever-like expression were also reported with a first improvement at day 3 followed by a rebound of fever [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Epistaxis is not considered a reliable sign of how serious the illness is [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Thrombocytopenia is invariably present. Hepato-renal failure with jaundice, disseminated intravascular coagulation and encephalitis can be associated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Overall prevalence is estimated 1%, but prevalence was rather 10% in hospital cohorts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. A population-based survey during the 2007 outbreak in Kenya even reported 26% of hemorrhagic RVF disease with a mortality of 23% in this group of cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Indeed, the mortality rate associated with bleeding manifestations is the highest, up to 65% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Viral load could play an important role in the hemorrhagic expression. In humans studies, it exhibited positive correlation with markers of inflammation (IP-10, CRP, Eotaxin, MCP-2 and Granzyme B), markers of fibrinolysis (tPA and D-dimer), and markers of endothelial function (sICAM-1), but a negative correlation with P-selectin, ADAMTS13, and fibrinogen, which are associated with coagulation pathways occurring on the endothelial surface [
