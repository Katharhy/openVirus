<p id="Par75">Based on the clinical and biological scoring system for the prognosis of RVF established by Adam et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], the CDC definitions of suspected severe RVF cases during the major epidemic in Saudi Arabia in 2000 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], the updated guidelines for health workers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and clinical series in literature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], we propose an algorithm to help clinicians at the bedside in the classification and referral of patients during a RVF outbreak (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Using the dengue model for case management, we identified clinical and biological warning signs defining complicated cases at risk of severe illness and requiring hospitalization for medical supervision, as we already proposed for chikungunya [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. Severe illness included hemorrhagic fever, neurological disorders or hepatic/renal failures requiring intensive cares. Ocular signs were classified as complications. Ophthalmologic examination should be prospectively performed in all confirmed cases to detect early asymptomatic RVFV ocular signs and evaluate their potential ability to predict the occurrence of neuro-ophthalmologic complications. This should at least include visual acuity determination, intra-ocular pressure measurement, slit-lamp biomicroscopy and funduscopy by indirect ophthalmoscopy. In case of RVF signs, a fluorescein angiography should be performed as well as fundus photography if available. Indocyanine Green angiography has not been evaluated yet in FVR ocular manifestation but could possibly bring arguments for a choroidal involvement since a delayed peripapillary choroidal filling in the arteriovenous phase of fluorescein angiography has been described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Optic Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a recent technique that is yet to be evaluated in the retinal complications of RVF. OCT could be helpful to describe the retinal lesions and their evolution through time, and could help elucidate the nature of the macular exudate-like lesions described before [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>]. We recommend to follow-up RVF patients for at least 1 month after the onset of symptoms to monitor for possible delayed neurological and/or ocular complications. In the lack of adequate medical support, considering the diversity and time course of RVF complications, medical evacuation of confirmed cases may be considered, except if hemorrhages because this presentation is a highly contagious vital emergency.
