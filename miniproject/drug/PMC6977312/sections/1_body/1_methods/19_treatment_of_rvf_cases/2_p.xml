<p id="Par73">In 2000, the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health evaluated the feasibility of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial using intravenous ribavirin in patients with suspected severe RVF, but no official result was published. In a WHO report of the Emerging and Dangerous Pathogens Laboratory Network in 2016, it was briefly mentioned that ribavirin was used without efficacy in Saudi Arabia [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>], but it failed to prevent from neuropathology in mice infected by RVFV by aerosol exposure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Ribavirin is recommended for the treatment and the prophylaxis of hemorrhagic fever due to arenaviruses and bunyaviruses [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>]. To date, its use is not indicated when RVF diagnosis is confirmed [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Antiviral drugs are under development including favipiravir T-705, 2′-fluoro-2′-deoxycytidine (2′-FdC), and benzavir-2 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]. Molecules targeting viral components, host cellular components or pathways, such as the ubiquitin proteasome system, autophagy system, kinases and oxidative stress responses, have demonstrated in vitro efficacy against RVFV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. The use of polyclonal immunoglobulins or serum of recovered patients has not been reported. Specific monoclonal neutralizing antibodies could be developed in the coming years [
