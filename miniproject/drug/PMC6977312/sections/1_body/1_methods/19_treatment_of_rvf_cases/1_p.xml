<p id="Par72">Management of RVF human cases comprises IPC measure implementation and general supportive therapy. No specific treatment is currently available. Iatrogenic use of medications such as hepatotoxic analgesics (acetaminophen), aspirin or non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, which enhance the risk of hemorrhagic complications, must be avoided in the early stage. Co-infections or alternative diagnosis with parasitic, bacterial, fungal or viral pathogens must be considered and treated as early as possible to improve the outcome. Severe patients should be treated empirically with broad spectrum antibacterial drugs and antimalarial molecules according to the local epidemiology.</p>
