<p id="Par46">We did a literature search for English and French language studies published in electronic databases for an unlimited period until December, 2019: PubMed Central, Embase, Medline and Scopus. We used the keywords “rift valley fever” and “human”. Along with this, we conducted targeted search within the online archives of journals of tropical medicine, which published the first clinical reports of RVF in humans since 1930s, i.e. “South African Medical Journal” and “Transaction of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene”. We contacted editorial office of other journals to get relevant articles published between 1930s and 1990s. If available, we reviewed citations in PubMed of these first articles in literature. Besides, we consulted the databases, datasets and official reports of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) on their official websites and the mentioned references.</p>
