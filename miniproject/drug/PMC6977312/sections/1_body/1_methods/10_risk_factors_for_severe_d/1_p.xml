<p id="Par56">Determinants for severe RVF outcome are poorly known. A number of retrospective studies suggest that touching, handling, living close to, and consuming animal products are factors associated with increased likelihood of RVF virus infection and possibly more severe outcomes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. This is probably linked with a significant exposure to the virus that results in higher inoculation rate. Indeed viremic loads have been reported correlated with severe RVF diseases [
