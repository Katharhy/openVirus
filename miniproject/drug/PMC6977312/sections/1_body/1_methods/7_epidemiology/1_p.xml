<p id="Par51">Human cases have been reported from many African countries following the virus introduction via infected livestock trade [

During the twenty-first century, outbreaks also occurred in Egypt, Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania, Sudan, Madagascar, the Republic of South Africa, Namibia, Mauritania, Uganda, Niger, and Mayotte (Fig.

The number of secondary cases arising from a single primary case infected with RVFV in an entirely susceptible population, the so-called
