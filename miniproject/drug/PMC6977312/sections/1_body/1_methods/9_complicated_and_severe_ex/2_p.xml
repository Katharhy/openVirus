<p id="Par54">Morbidity, as well as mortality, varied from one to another outbreak. For example, in South Africa in 1975 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and in Tanzania in 2007 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] most of RVF severe cases presented with encephalopathy (respectively 71% and 89%), whereas hemorrhagic manifestations predominated in Mauritania in 2015 (81%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and Madagascar in 2008 (88%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In Saudi Arabia in 2000, hepatic insufficiency (75%) and renal failures (41%) were the most frequent complications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Moreover, during the epidemic in Madagascar, highly fatal associations of two or more complications were highlighted. These occurred in 11/16 (69%) severe cases, of whom 5 (45%) had encephalitis with hemorrhagic symptoms which were lethal in 2/5 (40%), representing half of the deaths (4/16) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Variations in the RVFV tropism and virulence are hypothesized according to the lineage involved and the possible accumulation of genetic mutations or genomic reassortments [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], despite a low overall genomic diversity (∼ 5%) at the nucleotide level [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Genetic, ethnic or epidemiologic factors in the population exposed to the virus, as well as access to care also play a role [
