<p id="Par53">Incidences of complications are uncertain because RVFV infection can go unrecognized or be misdiagnosed considering the unspecific symptoms of suspected cases, which overlap with many other co-circulating pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. No standard definition of suspected cases exists. Rates of complications measured in studies depend on the definitions and methods of recruitment. Indeed, the use of clinical or biological criteria specific to RVF complications to define suspected cases could lead to underestimate the mild forms [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Globally, since the first description of the spectrum of RVF in humans by Laughlin et al. during the major outbreak in Egypt in 1977, it is considered that less than 5% of symptomatic cases will present complications including ocular, neurologic and hemorrhagic symptoms, while favorable outcome will occur within 1 week for the others [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this historical series, the different known complications occurred in equal proportions (30–35%), but hepatic or renal failures were not identified. During the 2007 Kenyan outbreak, Kahlon et al. described a clinical syndrome suggestive of severe RVF, characterized by fever, large-joint arthralgia, and gastrointestinal complaints, later followed by jaundice, right upper-quadrant pain, and delirium, often coinciding with hemorrhagic manifestations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Complicated forms could have represented up to 20% of symptomatic cases during recent epidemics [
