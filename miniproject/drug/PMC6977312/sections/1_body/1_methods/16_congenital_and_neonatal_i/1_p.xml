<p id="Par67">In a seroprevalence study, mothers experiencing fetal death or miscarriage had the same RVFV antibody prevalence as those with normal deliveries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. A retrospective study in Egypt in 1980 found no increase in the risk of abortion in humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. However a recent cross sectional study has demonstrated an association between infection with RVFV and miscarriage in Sudanese pregnant women (54% versus 12% of risk in non-infected pregnant women with

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Few symptomatic infections were described in pregnant women [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. The question is remaining whether it is the result of a lack of exposure to infected mosquitoes and infected animals, or if there are differences in susceptibility between animals and humans [
