<p id="Par52">Infection with RVFV is mostly pauci-symptomatic in humans. General signs may occur in 50 to 95% of infected cases after an incubation period of 2 to 6 days. The typical presentation includes headache, fever, backache and generalized aches in muscles and joints, lasting 4 to 7 days [

RVF differs from influenza, dengue and chikungunya as to whether cough, skin involvement (i.e. rash or pruritus) and arthritis are respectively uncommon signs. A slight meningism at the acute stage is not rare, however its prognosis value has never been evaluated [
