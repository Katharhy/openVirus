<p id="Par62">In a mouse model of RVF infection, survivors to primarily hepatitis cleared the virus from liver and blood, but exhibited neuro-invasion and fatal encephalitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Active viral replication in brain leading to necrotizing encephalitis was documented in several animal models [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. The route of transmission and prompt robust immune response could be a determining factor of the RVF neurologic disease course [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Indeed, whatever the routes of inoculation, RVFV RNA was detected in the brain of infected rats confirming the virus neurotropism [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], but aerosol exposure to RVFV caused earlier and more severe neuropathology in the murine model and fatal encephalitis in primates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. In aerosol-infected rats with lethal encephalitis, neutrophils and macrophages were the major cell types infiltrating the CNS, and this was concomitant with microglia activation and extensive cytokine inflammation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Differences in the peripheral blood biomarkers during the course of the neurological disease in African green monkeys were measured with defect in early T-cells, proinflammatory and antiviral responses in lethal encephalitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Other immune disorders and alteration in vascular permeability in the brain could be more involved in delayed forms [
