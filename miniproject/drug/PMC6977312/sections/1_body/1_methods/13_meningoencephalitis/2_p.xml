In a 18-year old woman treated for chronic myeloid leukemia with acute RVFV encephalitis acquired in Saudi Arabia, CSF was documented predominantly with polynuclear leukocytes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed high signal intensity on T2-weighted images in frontoparietal and thalamic regions, with multiple bilateral asymmetrical cortical hyperintense areas consistent with inflammation or ischemia in axial diffusion, while changes in CT-scan of her brain appeared much later [
