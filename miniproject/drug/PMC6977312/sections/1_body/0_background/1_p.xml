<p id="Par41">Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) is an arbovirus, mainly transmitted by mosquitoes, responsible for a zoonosis disease that affects cattle, sheep, camels and goats. It was first identified in 1931 during an investigation into an epidemic among sheep on a farm in the Rift Valley of Kenya [

The virus infects also humans through inoculation after contact with infected animals or through ingestion of unpasteurized or uncooked by-products of infected animals, or also through inhalation of aerosols produced during the slaughter of infected animals. However, human infections occurred also from the bites of infected mosquitoes, mainly
