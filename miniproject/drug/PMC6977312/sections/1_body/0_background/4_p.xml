<p id="Par44">In 2019 RVFV emerged in Mayotte, a French overseas department and region and gave growth to this work [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Besides, the wide clinical spectrum over a long-period of time made very difficult the establishment of standard definitions of human cases and recommendations for their management. We conducted a literature review on the RVF clinical disease and treatments in humans. We identified the state and frontiers of knowledge. Lacking guidelines on the RVF human disease, we proposed an algorithm to assist physicians on the field in the evaluation of cases. This algorithm could help and be improved during next epidemics.
