<p id="Par42">RVFV belongs to the 
 <italic>Phenuiviridae family</italic> (
 <italic>formerly Bunyaviridae</italic>), member of the phlebovirus genus. The enveloped virion contains a tripartite, predominantly negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome, which codes for structural and non-structural proteins the virus needs to replicate both in mammalian hosts and insect vectors. RVFV attach to cells via the interaction between the viral structural proteins Gn and Gc and C-type lectins, DC-SIGN and I-SIGN [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Cells become infected with RVFV by receptor-mediated endocytosis, followed by pH-mediated fusion of virus-endosomal membranes to release nucleocapsids into the cell cytoplasm. Transcription, translation, and genome replication occur in the cytoplasm. The non-structural protein NSs is known to be a major virulence factor allowing the virus to escape host innate immune response. Only one serotype is recognized but strains exist of variable virulence. Moreover, RVFV is classified as a Risk Group 3 agent, and biosafety level (BSL)-3 containment requirements are needed to work with the virus in the laboratory [
