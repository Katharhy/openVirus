<p id="Par43">As other arboviral infections including dengue, chikungunya and zika, RVF is emerging worldwide, due to the globalization of arthropod vectors, mainly mosquitoes, which efficiently transmit an increasing number of old, unrecognized and new viruses. Arboviruses pose a major threat of introduction to several continents, including Europe and North America, with the possibility of co-circulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The widespread presence of competent vectors, the high viral load in infected animals, trade and global travel, all increase the likelihood of RVFV exportation and establishment outside endemic regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Cases have already been imported to Europe and Asia [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and concerns have raised about its potential to extend to other parts of Asia, Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and United States [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Such an introduction would cause significant losses to the livestock industry and substantial human morbidity and mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Clinicians need to consider RVF in the differential diagnosis for febrile illnesses in a suitable context, however manifestations of RVFV in humans are varied and unspecific including hepatitis, encephalitis, hemorrhagic disease, and retinitis with potential dramatic consequences. The overall case fatality rate is estimated from 0.5 to 2% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], but higher mortality rates were recorded, as for example 18% by the Saudi Health Ministry in 2000 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], around 22% in East Africa, West Africa, South Africa and Madagascar from 2006 to 2010 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and 28% in Tanzania in 2007 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].
