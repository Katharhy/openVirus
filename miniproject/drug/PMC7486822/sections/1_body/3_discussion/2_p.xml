<p id="par0070">Age over 65 was one of the variables that increased the probability of having potential interactions in the multivariate analysis. In an aging Spanish cohort (&gt;65 years) of HIV patients, it was observed that the number of potential interactions increases with the number of drugs prescribed and with the use of a PI in the antiretroviral regimen.

 </xref> Furthermore, we observed that admission to the ICU behaves as an independent variable associated with developing potential interactions with a probability of 9 times greater than in a non-serious patient. In a study of potential interactions carried out in the critical care unit, the presence of potential interactions was attributed to age (&gt;60 years) and the number of drugs prescribed.

 </xref> Precisely, the number of drugs prescribed was another predictor variable for the occurrence of potential interactions, coinciding with what was previously reported in the literature.
