<p id="par0065">Our study represents a novel assessment in relation to COVID-19 infection. To our knowledge, no study has been published evaluating the prevalence of potential drug interactions with LPV/r therapy. We are facing a new scenario with a different disease profile, therefore, it is complex to make comparisons between COVID-19 and other infections such as HIV, where there is more experience with LPV/r. Our study shows a high rate of potential interactions, occurring in more than 60% of patients. One of the risk factors related to a higher rate of potential interactions in the HIV population was treatment with a boosted PI, with global prevalence between 27 and 40%.
