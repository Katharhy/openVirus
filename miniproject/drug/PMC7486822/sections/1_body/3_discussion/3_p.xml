<p id="par0075">Inhaled budesonide was the drug with the highest rate of interaction with LPV/r in our cohort. Therefore, respiratory disease was a risk factor associated with developing interactions. Another comorbidity with a high probability of interaction was psychiatric disorder. A group of drugs commonly involved in potential interactions due to their hepatic metabolism (CYP 3A4) in the HIV population were those drugs used in psychiatric disorders.

 </xref> Almost half of the patients in our study had a cardiovascular history. This high prevalence is explained by the fact that we include arterial hypertension within this group. COVID-19 infection is associated with haemostasis abnormalities, which may imply an increased risk of thromboembolic cardiovascular disease.

The appropriate LPV/r-compatible, anticoagulant, or antiplatelet agent, should be selected and in case of contraindication, consider not starting or discontinuing LPV/r (
