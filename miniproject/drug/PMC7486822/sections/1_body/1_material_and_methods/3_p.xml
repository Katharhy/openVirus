<p id="par0040">For the statistical analysis, the IBM SPSS Statistics software, version 26.0 was used. Categorical variables were expressed with absolute frequencies and percentages, while continuous variables were expressed as mean, standard deviation, and range. To assess whether there were differences in the number of interactions between patients of different sex, the Mann-Whitney test was used. To determine the risk factors associated with having interactions, a univariate logistic regression analysis was performed with all demographic and clinical variables. The dependent variable was having ≥1 potential interactions, while the independent variables were age, admission to the ICU, polypharmacy, number of drugs prescribed and previous illness. A multivariate analysis was performed for the variables previously associated in a statistically significant way. A
