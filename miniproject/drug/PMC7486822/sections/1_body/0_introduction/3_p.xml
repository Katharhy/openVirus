 </xref> Lopinavir has antiviral activity, while ritonavir acts as a lopinavir enhancer, increasing its plasma concentrations by inhibiting CYP3A4. A relevant drawback of LPV/r is its high profile of interactions, due to its ability to modify the hepatic metabolism of other drugs, through the inhibition of CYP3A4 or the induction of CYP2C9 and 2C19 and glucuronidation reactions. On the other hand, it inhibits the activity of membrane transporter proteins such as BCR, OATP1B1 and glycoprotein-P, involved in intestinal and hepatic drug clearance.
