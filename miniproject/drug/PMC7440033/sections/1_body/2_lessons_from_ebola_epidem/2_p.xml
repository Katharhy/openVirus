<p id="par0035">However, before Mr Sawyer embarked on a journey from his country to Nigeria, Nigeria's Minister of Information had exaggerated Nigeria's preparedness for potential outbreaks in the country by a false claim in the media that the country had a vaccine stockpile for the virus and was well-prepared to contain its spread should there be outbreaks. Unknown to the politician, no vaccine had been developed against the virus anywhere in the world at the time. It is, therefore, obvious that Mr Sawyer's decision to travel to Nigeria could be a deliberate one in a desperate attempt in search of a life-saving solution against a disease that was somewhat a death sentence at the time, which he knew he had contracted. On confirming Ebola disease in Mr Sawyer as Nigeria's index case, public health officials were put on high alert and contact tracing begun immediately. Moreover, a WHO-supported emergency operations centre was established, a first-rate virology laboratory affiliated with the University of Lagos Teaching Hospital was equipped and staffed for case detection of Ebola, funds were allocated by the government and expeditiously dispatched, isolation facilities were built in the two cities (i.e. Lagos and Port Harcourt) and certain facilities were designated for Ebola treatment.</p>
