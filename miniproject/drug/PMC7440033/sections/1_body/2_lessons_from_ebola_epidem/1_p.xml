<p id="par0030">Nigeria demonstrated strong leadership and well-coordinated response during the Ebola epidemic after the index case arrived Lagos on 20th July, 2014, and was confirmed to have been infected with the virus on 23rd July of the same year. Patrick Sawyer, the index case, was a citizen of Liberia who lost a sister to Ebola before taking a flight to Lagos, Nigeria. On arrival in Lagos, he immediately sought medical attention in a hospital because he already had symptoms onboard flight. Sawyer did not survive. Nine doctors and nurses that had contacts with him got infected and four lost their lives
