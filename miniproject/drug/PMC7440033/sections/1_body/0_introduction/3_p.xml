As the virus started spreading to other parts of the world, at the time an African country such as Ghana and the USA issued travel bans on returning travellers from high-risk countries including China and countries in Europe, Nigeria, like many other African countries, was initially hesitant to toe the line. Consequently, there were unconfirmed reports that some Europe-based returning travellers to the USA who got caught up in the web of travel ban, took flights to the Murtala Muhammed Airport in Lagos, Nigeria, before connecting to their U.S.Â destinations in disguise. Could this explain why Lagos State accounts for close to half of all cases in Nigeria? Or could it be because Lagos State has conducted more tests than any other state in Nigeria or both?
