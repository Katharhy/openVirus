<p id="par0020">The COVID-19 pandemic caught most health systems around the world off guard and initially overstretched and threw an enormous challenge to health systems everywhere including developed countries. It is no surprise, therefore, that in Nigeria and the rest of Africa, the initial reaction was that of panic and confusion thanks to the weak or dysfunctional health systems characteristic of most African countries. Consequently, it was crystal clear that, like most developing countries, Nigeria's health system was ill-prepared for the monumental challenge posed by the ferocious new coronavirus. However, Nigeria has been through similar health emergencies in the past, which necessitated the establishment of a public health institute that is equipped to provide scientific and technical leadership in times of health crises. That institute is the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), which was copycatted from the U.S.Â Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The NCDC has, to a large extent, lived up to a responsibility of serving as a rescue public health institute in times of health emergencies. Importantly, lessons learnt during the Ebola epidemic were to a significant extent leveraged upon for the COVID-19 response.</p>
