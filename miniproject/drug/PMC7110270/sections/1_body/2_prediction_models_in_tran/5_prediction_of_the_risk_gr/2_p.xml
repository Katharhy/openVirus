<p id="Par20">In epidemiological studies, the moving average method is mostly used to provide early warning of infectious diseases (Petukhova 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2018</xref>). The main idea is to calculate based on the data of infectious disease incidence over a long period of time and then establish an early warning line. By comparing the incidence data of a certain period with the early warning line, the epidemic trend of the disease can be judged and the risk of incidence can be estimated. However, this method can only be applied to the outbreak warning of existing infectious diseases. To substitute for it, a moving average prediction limit (MAPL) method was proposed, its standard deviation can be used to establish a prediction limit to predict the epidemic trend, so as to timely predict the epidemic risk grading in the affected area. The data has shown that the number of new cases in the whole country has been moving towards a faster decline zone in the 11 days after February 12, 2020 outside Hubei province, and stabilized near the prediction limit of the faster decline zone in the 5 days up to February 23, which is a low risk level. It indicates that after the nationwide anti-epidemic campaign, the epidemic situation in the country has been reduced as of the end of February. The overall trend of new suspected cases is consistent with the number of new confirmed cases. It is speculated that as long as the previous effective measures for outbreak prevention and control are adhered to, there is a great hope to keep the outbreak at a low risk level, and the risk of the epidemic in Hubei province in the future will be less serious. There is no doubt that understanding the real-time risk levels of the epidemic has a great guiding role in planning measures to gradually lift restrictions and restore normal economic production and social life.
