 <sub>0</sub> and dispersion k (the lower the value of k, the higher the impact of super spreading). After 1000 stochastic simulations for each individual combination, their simulations suggest that very low values of k are less likely, and the establishment of sustained transmission chains from single cases cannot be ruled out (Riou and Althaus
