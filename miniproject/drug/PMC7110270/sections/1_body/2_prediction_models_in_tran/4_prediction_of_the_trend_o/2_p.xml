 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020a</xref>). They estimated that 75,815 individuals (95% CI: 37 304–130,330) individuals had been infected in Wuhan city as of January 25, 2020. And then the SEIR model was extended into a SEIR-metapopulation model to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 across mainland China. Given that public health professionals and the general public have realized the threats caused by virus, the transmissibility of the epidemic might be reduced compared with its nascent stage at Wuhan city. So they assumed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 was reduced by 0%, 25%, and 50% after Wuhan city was quarantined on January 23, 2020 and the rate of transmissibility was similar across all cities. The estimated result was that if there was no reduction in transmissibility, the Wuhan city epidemic would peak around April of 2020, and local epidemics across cities in mainland China would lag by 1–2 weeks. A 50% reduction in transmissibility would push the R
 <sub>0</sub> to 1.3, in which case the epidemic would grow slowly without peaking during the first half of 2020. These analytical data gave us an early warning that SARS-CoV-2 could be about to become an epidemic in the absence of mitigation on its present trajectory.
