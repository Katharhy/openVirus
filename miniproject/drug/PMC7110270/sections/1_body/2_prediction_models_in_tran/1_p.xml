<p id="Par10">In the case of a gradually improved infectious disease surveillance system, the research on forecasting and early warning of epidemics based on models has become the focus of the public health system. The principle aim is to establish a suitable mathematical model based on the dynamic characteristics of infectious disease transmission, and to conduct qualitative as well as quantitative analysis and computer simulations of the transmission process. Currently, the models used for forecasting and warning at home and abroad mainly include the time series model, the linear regression model, the grey dynamics model, the artificial neural network model, the Markov model, the Bayesian model and the Complex network model (Jennings

Practice has proved that in public health emergencies, it is important to establish suitable prediction models to change passive prevention into active prevention. For example, during the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK, the politicians relied heavily on mathematical modeling in their selection of epidemic control measures with great success (Ferguson

In response to the current epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, many researchers have developed mathematical models with varying degrees of complexity, aiming to assess the capacity of pathogen transmission and which interventions are most likely to be effectiveÂ (Fig.
