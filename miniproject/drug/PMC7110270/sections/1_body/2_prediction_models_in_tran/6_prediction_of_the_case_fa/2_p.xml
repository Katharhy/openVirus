 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2020</xref>) estimated the risk of death from confirmed cases (cCFR), while using data from confirmed cases outside mainland China and a right-censored likelihood to model the number of deceased cases and process the determination bias. The estimated cCFR value was 5.3% when the index case onset date was fixed on December 8, 2019 and 8.4% when epidemic exponential growth occurred to fit the data with other model parameters. Although the cCFR of COVID-19 is not high compared to the 17% CFR of SARS in Hong Kong (Donnelly

 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>), the 5%â€“8% risk of death is by no means negligible given the overall scale of the ongoing epidemic. However, the cCFR estimation models also have limitations, such as the cCFR only addressed fatality among confirmed cases. More precise infection fatality risk (IFR) estimates including infected individuals other than confirmed cases. In addition to quantifying the overall risk of death, future studies should identify groups at risk of death such as the elderly and potential comorbidities.
