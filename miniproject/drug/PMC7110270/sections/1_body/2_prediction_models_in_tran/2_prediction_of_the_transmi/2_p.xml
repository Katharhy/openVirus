 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2019</xref>). Since the transmission chain of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear, many researches adopted the Tg information from SARS and MERS, which is similar to SARS-CoV-2. Zhao 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2020</xref>) reviewed the SARS-CoV-2 cases and suggests they might have been under-reported roughly from the 1st to the 15th of January 2020 because the number of cases appeared inconsistent with the following rapid growth of the epidemic curve since the 16th of January 2020. They modeled the epidemic curve of SARS-CoV-2 cases, in mainland China from December 1, 2019 to January 24, 2020 through the exponential growing Poisson process. The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation. As a result, they estimated the R
 <sub>0</sub> of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49–2.63) and the number of unreported cases was 469 (95% CI: 403–540). This study helped us understand what might be happening in the early stages of outbreak. Another algorithm estimated R
 <sub>0</sub> using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with Gibbs sampling and a non-informative flat prior. Wu 
 <italic>et al.</italic> estimated the R
 <sub>0</sub> for SARS-CoV-2 was 2.68 (95% CI: 2.47–2.86) (Wu JT
