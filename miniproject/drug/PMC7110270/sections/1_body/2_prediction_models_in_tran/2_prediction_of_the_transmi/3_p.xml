 <sub>0</sub> values estimated by different methods were different to some extent, it was not difficult to find that the R
 <sub>0</sub> value remained larger than 1 at the early stage of the outbreak indicating the possibility of sustained human-to-human transmission (Li

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2020</xref>). Adam 
 <italic>et al.</italic> estimated that the median daily R
 <sub>0</sub>, declined from 2.35 (95% CI: 1.15–4.77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on January 23 to 1.05 (95% CI: 0.413–2.39), which may have reflected the outbreak control efforts or a growing awareness of SARS-CoV-2 during this period (Kucharski
