<p id="Par11">In the early stages of the outbreak, it is important to gain an understanding of the transmission pattern and potential of SARS-CoV-2. If more than one secondary case is produced for each primary case on average, the chain of transmission events within an outbreak is extended. The basic reproduction number (R
 <sub>0</sub>) is the most important index to measure and directly explain the level of virus transmission (Anderson 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2004</xref>). It refers to the average number of people who will be infected with an infectious disease under natural conditions. Due to the facts that (1) the infected patients might die, (2) some patients may develop immunity after recovering, and (3) that the infected population is of a limited size, the R
 <sub>0</sub> value will decrease with the decrease in the infected population, and the transmission speed is significantly reduced (Anderson 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1992</xref>). Essentially, R
 <sub>0</sub> determines how intensive a policy will need to be to control the epidemic, whereas both the generation time (Tg) and R
 <sub>0</sub> determine the time available to implement suitably intensive controls.
