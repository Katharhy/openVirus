<p id="Par25">But the existing prediction models still have great limitations. First of all, the establishment of the model cannot be separated from the support of a large amount of data. In other words, the key to establish a reliable model is to track the epidemic dynamics and release the clinical information and epidemiological data in a timely manner. However, official data is often uncertain because medical resources are limited. The available data only reports confirmed cases in hospitals and ignores infected people who do not have access to medical services. This makes it difficult to accurately predict the development of the epidemic. Secondly, we need to make it clear that fitting all factors into a model is not easy and models are often built on strong assumptions so the data estimated by the model may be biased in some cases. In this case, simple public health measures are unlikely to be effective, and other measures are needed, such as tighter restrictions on movement, greater availability of antivirals drugs and expanded vaccine development and production facilities. These questions suggest that there is still much room for improvement in rapid risk assessment and accurate early warning of emerging infectious diseases. It is clearly in everyoneâ€™s interest to greatly enhance global surveillance capabilities, especially in developing regions, and concomitantly to improve basic training in infectious disease and molecular epidemiology.</p>
