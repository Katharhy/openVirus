The mNGS methodology used to investigate infectious microorganisms from original clinical samples is currently achievable (Gu

Firstly, they found that a majority of the viral reads (99.9% and 99.7% respectively for sample 1 and 2) were associated with coronaviruses and identified SARS-CoV-2 as the sole pathogen. The genome comparisons indicated that SARS-CoV-2 shared a 98.7% nucleotide identity with bat coronavirus strain BtCoV/4991 while it was quite divergent from SARS-CoV (79.7%). Furthermore, phylogenetic trees were reconstructed based on the nucleotide alignment of key viral genes by using the maximum likelihood method, employing a best fit substitution model and a SPR branch swapping algorithm. An understandable phylogeny showed SARS-CoV-2 has the most recent common ancestor with the neighboring bat coronaviruses, supporting the bat origin.
