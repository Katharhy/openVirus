<p id="Par7">Identifying the origin of the virus can help health authorities carry out accurate health surveillance. Undoubtedly, the development of genome sequencing technology has contributed a great deal to SARS-CoV-2 traceability. Wassenaar and Zou (

Comparing the sequence of the genomic sequence obtained with various mammalian coronavirus sequences suggests that bats may be a natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 (Paraskevis
