<p id="Par6">In order to understanding patterns of viral diversity in wildlife and determinants of successful cross-species transmission, or spillover, Kevin 
 <italic>et al.</italic> created a database of 2805 mammal-virus associations, including 754 mammal species (14% of global mammal diversity) from 15 orders and 586 unique viral species (recognized viruses found in mammals) from 28 viral families. They used generalized additive models to identify and rank host-specific predictors of the number of total and zoonotic viruses in mammals. The model showed that bats are host to a significantly higher proportion of zoonoses than other mammalian orders (after controlling for reporting effort and the other predictor variables). Moreover, the phylogenetic host breadth and other viral traits are significant predictors of zoonotic potential, providing a novel framework to assess if a newly discovered mammalian virus could infect people (Olival
