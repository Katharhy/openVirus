<p id="p0100">Consensus scoring, the combination of multiple scoring functions, is easier to find false positive than a single scoring function. The higher the Consensus scoring, the higher the binding rate of the molecule to the target. The score is greater than 4, indicating a better docking result. In our study, compounds with scoring values greater than 4 were screened for analysis. Therefore, 66 compounds were screened, of which 27 were docked with the 3CL hydrolase target and 48 were docked with the ACE2 target. The screened compounds were distributed in 27 kinds of CMs, among which
