<p id="p0095">The chemical composition of high frequency CMs were obtained from the Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacology Database. There are 40 kinds of high-frequency CMs, five of which are not included in the database. Although a single CM usually contains a large number ingredient, only those with desirable pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties are key compounds for their therapeutic effects. In our current study, OB and DL were employed to screen candidate compounds from these high frequency CMs. In total, 35 high-frequency CMs includes 431 chemicals, which were molecularly docked with the SARS-COV-2 targets 3CL hydrolase and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) using LigandFit.</p>
