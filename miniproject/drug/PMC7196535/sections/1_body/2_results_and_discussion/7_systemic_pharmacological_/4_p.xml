<p id="p0125">The significant targets interacting with the active ingredients were mapped onto the KEGG pathways and the T-P network was generated as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>C. Among the results of KEGG pathway enrichment, we selected the pathways in the basic biological processes of metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, cellular processes and organismal system. There are 20 target-enriched pathways (
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> ), which act on the immune system, inflammation, cellular processes, and endocrine system, respectively. Thus, we postulated that
