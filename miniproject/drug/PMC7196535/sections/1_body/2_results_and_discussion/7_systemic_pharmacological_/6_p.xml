<p id="p0135">We excavated 574 CM prescriptions for treating epidemic diseases through 96, 606 prescription. Among them, 40 kinds of high frequency CMs, 36 high-frequency CMs-pairs and 6 kinds of high-frequency triple-CM-groups were mined by frequency analysis method were used to analyze the collected prescriptions. Among the commonly used CMs beneficial for antiviral, 
 <italic>Gancao</italic> (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) and 
 <italic>HuangQin</italic> (Scutellariae Radix) were given high priority CM pairs for selection used in CM prescriptions against pestilence by mining the compatibility rules of prescriptions with association rules analyses. The molecular docking results implied that 66 compounds in 26 kinds of CMs probably show a potential anti-SARS-COV-2 activity by binding with the ACE2 and 3CL hydrolase. It's worth noting that 
 <italic>Gancao</italic> (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) contained the most potential compounds of 20, followed by 
 <italic>HuangQin</italic> (Scutellariae Radix). Meanwhile, based on network-based computational methods, an integrated system pharmacology approach was used to predict targets, construct networks, and explore the molecular action of high-frequency 
 <italic>Gancao</italic> (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) and 
 <italic>HuangQin</italic> (Scutellariae Radix) (GH) CMs-pair. In present study, 85 and 34 kinds of active ingredients with favorable bioactivities and contents were selected from 
 <italic>Gancao</italic> (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) and 
 <italic>HuangQin</italic> (Scutellariae Radix) by ADME filtering, providing some foundational clues for thorough investigation on this CMs-pair. By analyzing the network topology of targets, 30 kinds of important targets were identified. By using network systematic analysis, GH CMs-pair could regulate the proteins related to immune system, inflammation, cellular processes, and endocrine system. COVID-19 leads to a strong immune response and inflammatory storm, in which a large number of cytokines are activated. GH CMs-pair may regulate the immune-related pathway Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, T-cell and B-cell receptor signaling pathway, as well as cytokine action related pathways such as TNF signaling pathway, NF-ÎºB signaling pathway and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway signaling pathway to inhibit the activated cytokines, relieve the excessive immune response and eliminate inflammation. From perspective of molecular network, GH CMs-pair exerted overall regulation through multi-ingredient and multi-target synergistic effect.
