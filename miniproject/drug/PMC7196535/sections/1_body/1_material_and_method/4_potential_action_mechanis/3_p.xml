 <italic>P</italic>-value was calculated and further corrected by using the Benjamini-Hochberg method, and 
 <italic>P</italic>-value &lt;0.05 was selected as the cutoff criterion. Subsequently, the compound-target network, and target-pathway network were constructed and visualized by using Cytoscape (Version 3.5.0).
