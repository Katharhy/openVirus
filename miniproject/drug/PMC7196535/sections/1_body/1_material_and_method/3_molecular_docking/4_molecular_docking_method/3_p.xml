<p id="p0055">In order to ensure the accuracy of the results, scoring was performed with seven scoring functions: DockScore, LigScore1, LigScore2, PLP1, PLP2, Jain and PMF. Then, consensus score was used to analysis of seven scoring functions selected for Ligandfit docking, which produces a single consensus score value for each ligand rather than for each posed to measure the result. The threshold was set at greater than four.</p>
