 <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Under room temperature conditions, SARS-CoV can survive in feces/sputum for 1–5 d, 10–19 days in urine, 15 d in blood, and 3 d on surfaces; SARS-CoV can survive for around 21 d at 4°C and for a long period of time at −70°C.
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> These viruses are extremely heat-sensitive and can be effectively inactivated by 56°C for 30 min or 70°C for 15 min.
