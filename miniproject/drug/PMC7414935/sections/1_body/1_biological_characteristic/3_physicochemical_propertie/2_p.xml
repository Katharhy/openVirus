<p>In addition, CoVs are sensitive to ultraviolet rays, X-rays, Î³ rays and other ionizing radiation. Ultraviolet radiation can cause RNA to form uracil dimers, while ionizing radiation can cause nucleic acid strand breakage and inhibit viruses. Enveloped viruses are sensitive to lipid solvents and phenols, aldehydes, strong oxidizing agents, and halogenic detergents. Therefore, the CoV can be easily eliminated by 75% ethanol, ether, and chlorine-containing disinfectants. Peracetic acid, chloroform, and other lipid solvents are associated with effective virus destruction.
