<p>The incubation period of SARS-CoV infection
 <xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> is 2–14 days, of which 3–5 days is the most common. Fever is the first symptom to occur, with a temperature of more than 38°C accompanied by headaches, muscle aches, malaise, and diarrhea. Subsequently, pneumonia, frequent coughing, and dyspnea occur. The incubation period of MERS-CoV infection
 <xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> is 2–14 days and normally lasts for 5–6 days. Classical symptoms include fever, coughing, and/or shortness of breath, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal symptoms. The disease rapidly progresses to severe pneumonia and causes respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, and coagulation disorder. MERS-CoV infection tends to lead to renal failure or septic shock in immunocompromised people. The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2
 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> infection is 1–14 days, of which 3–7 days is the most common incubation period. The main symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection include fever, fatigue, and dry cough along with ground-glass opacities and infiltration shadows in both lungs. A minority of patients develop nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, and diarrhea. Severely affected patients will experience dyspnea and/or hypoxemia, and critical patients will develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis, and coagulation disorders. Some SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 patients may be asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms.
