<p>When one or more symptoms are present, the patient should be considered a suspected case for quarantine and clinical diagnosis. This should be combined with the patientâ€™s epidemiological history and clinical symptoms for integrated analysis, and a clinical diagnosis should be made. Respiratory tract samples or blood samples should be used for immunofluorescence assay (IFA), reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or virus cell culture for identification. Additional stool samples can be used for virus isolation and testing to supplement data on digestive tract infection.
