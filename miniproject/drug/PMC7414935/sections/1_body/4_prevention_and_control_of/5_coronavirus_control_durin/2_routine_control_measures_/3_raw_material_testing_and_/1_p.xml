<p>Raw materials should be procured from healthy animals in non-epidemic regions, and the supplier must provide Animal Health Certificates and related documents. Supplies from unknown sources should not be allowed. Effective protection measures should be employed during the transportation of raw materials to ensure against contamination. Raw materials that have passed the acceptance check should be quickly warehoused. In addition, a management system should be established, and designated staff should manage and periodically conduct quality and health checks, clear expired or spoiled raw materials, and prevent cross-contamination between raw materials and finished products.
