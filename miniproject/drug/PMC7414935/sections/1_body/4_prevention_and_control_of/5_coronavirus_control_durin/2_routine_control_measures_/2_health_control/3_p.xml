<p>Meat and poultry processing facilities have been linked to a number of coronavirus outbreaks in many counties, such as Germany and America. Processing facilities and equipment need to be periodically cleaned and disinfected. Processing tools should not touch the ground or unclean surfaces. Tools should be immediately cleaned and disinfected after use by each shift and should be placed in designated clean and well-ventilated zones. Moreover, some plants have implemented thermal scanning and installed plexiglass barriers on production floors and in break rooms.</p>
