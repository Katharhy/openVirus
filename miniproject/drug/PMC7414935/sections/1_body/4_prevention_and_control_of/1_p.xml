<p>CoVs are common zoonotic pathogens. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E may originate from bats,

When there is frequent contact between bats and humans, companion animals, and livestock, the possibility of cross-species transmission increases. Carnivorous bats may acquire other pathogens from insects or birds and may transmit viruses to predators that prey on bats.
