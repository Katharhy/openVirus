<p>It was recently reported, based on a meta-analysis, that the sensitivity of RIDTs, antigen detection tests based on immunochromatography, was as low as 42.6% for influenza A and 33.2% for influenza B in adult patients [

 <xref rid="pone.0231217.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], reporting that the sensitivity and specificity for influenza A+B in adults were 34.1% (95%CI: 14.0 to 54.1) and 99.2% (95%CI:98.2 to 100), respectively.
