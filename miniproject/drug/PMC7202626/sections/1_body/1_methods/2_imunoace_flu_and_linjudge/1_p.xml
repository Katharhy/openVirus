<p>Samples collected by nasopharyngeal swabs were first tested by ImunoAce Flu [
 <xref rid="pone.0231217.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and the results were shown in 5 minutes. If patients were positive for influenza A, then the samples were further tested by Linjudge FluA/pdm [
 <xref rid="pone.0231217.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This is an RIDT that can only detect A/H1N1pdm09, using a monoclonal antibody that is reactive against nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza A/H1N1pdm09, but not NP of A/H3N2 or seasonal A/H1N1. If a patient was found to be positive for influenza A by ImunoAce Flu and the Linjudge FluA/pdm test yielded a positive result, the patient was diagnosed with A/H1N1pdm09 infection (
