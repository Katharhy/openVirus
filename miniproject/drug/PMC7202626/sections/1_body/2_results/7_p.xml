Within 48 hours after the onset of illness, the sensitivity and specificity were 97.9% (95%CI: 94.7–99.4) and 90.4% (95%CI: 85.1–94.3), respectively (n = 368). At more than 48 hours after the onset of illness, the sensitivity of the RIDT did not decrease, remaining at 97.1%; however, there was a slight decrease in specificity, which fell to 89.3%.
