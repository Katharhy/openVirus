<p>Our study demonstrated the high sensitivity (97.6%; 95%CI: 87.4–99.9) and specificity (92.6%; 95%CI: 82.1–97.9) of Linjudge FluA/pdm in the detection of A/H1N1pdm09 (
 <xref rid="pone.0231217.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Thus, by testing patients consecutively with ImunoAce Flu then Linjudge FluA/pdm, we are able to diagnose whether patients had A/H1N1pdm09 infection or A/H3M2 infection within a short time. ImunoAce Flu takes up to 5 minutes to obtain results [

 <xref rid="pone.0231217.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; however, highly accurate results are usually obtained within a total of 10 minutes. Another RIDT kit that is capable of distinguishing between the influenza A subtypes had been on the market until several years ago, Clearline Influenza A/B/(H1N1) 2009 [
 <xref rid="pone.0231217.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; however, it has since been withdrawn due to unstable results. The combination of ImunoAce Flu and Linjudge FluA/pdm is highly useful for distinguishing between influenza A subtypes, in comparison to RT-PCR, although the sensitivity and specificity of the combination of tests is lower. Moreover, this combination of tests obtains results in much less time, and numerous samples can be tested at the same time. The most important point is its cost, which at approximately 10 US dollars per test, is much cheaper in comparison to RT-PCR.
