<p>The sensitivity of RIDT is dependent on the viral load in the upper respiratory tract [

 <xref rid="pone.0231217.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The Clinical Practice Guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) emphasize that clinicians should collect upper respiratory tract specimens as soon as possible, preferably within 4 days after the onset of symptoms [

 <xref rid="pone.0231217.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] included the results of many patients tested with RIDT kits at 4–5 days after the onset of illness. In contrast, in our study, most patients (89.8%) visited the outpatient department of our hospital within 48 hours after the onset of illness. Infectious influenza virus levels in the upper respiratory tract of persons with uncomplicated influenza peak during the first 1–2 days after illness onset, and decline to undetectable levels within a week [
