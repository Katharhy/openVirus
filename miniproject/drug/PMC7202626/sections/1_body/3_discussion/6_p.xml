In that report, the sensitivity of a Japanese RIDT, Prolast Flu AB (Mitsubishi Chemical Medience Corporation, Japan) for H1N1pdm09 was as high as 80–90% during the H1N1 pandemic of 2009. In contrast, RIDTs were reported to show low sensitivity in the detection of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 virus (40–69%) in the H1N1 pandemic of 2009 in the US [
