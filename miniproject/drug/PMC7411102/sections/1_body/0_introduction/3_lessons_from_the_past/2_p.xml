 </xref> It may be speculated, that the children with Congenital heart disease (CHD) may be at a higher risk of complications with COVID 19 similar to adults. Other coronavirus infections in children are usually mild and medical attention is sought in less than 20% cases. Coronaviruses are uncommon cause of Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in children. LRTI after coronavirus infection is more common in younger children (less than 2 years), those with underlying medical conditions (congenital, cardiovascular, genetic or respiratory diseases) and co-infections with rhino viruses. These patients are more likely to be admitted to intensive care units or require respiratory support.
