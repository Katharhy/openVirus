<p id="p0070">Among the subset of patients with congenital heart disease few might be at a higher risk of decompensation than others based on complexity of disease. The severity of CHD depends not only on anatomic complexity but status of surgical repair and physiologic variables like presence of aortopathy, arrhythmia, end-organ dysfunction, exercise capacity, hypoxemia, cyanosis, NYHA functional class, pulmonary hypertension, hemodynamically significant shunt, venous and arterial stenosis etc. The adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) anatomic and physiological (AP) classification
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>36</sup>
 </xref> elaborates the complexity and heterogenity of ACHD anatomy and physiology and gives a fairly accurate sense of prognosis. Patients are classified in anatomic stage 1â€“3 and physiologic stage A to D based on many factors. Patient classified at higher level of severity (anatomic and physiologic stage) are likely to have decreased functional reserve and high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection related complications.
