<p id="p0065">Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) represent a high risk group because of the limited cardiopulmonary reserve. Management of CHD during COVID-19 is gradually becoming more challenging and its being compromised because of many factors. It is difficult to outline the spectrum of cardiovascular presentations of COVID19 in children however with the currently available knowledge it may be speculated that cardiovascular manifestation may be similar to adults, although the numbers will be less. These presentations range from direct or indirect myocardial injury, myocarditis, possible acute coronary syndrome, cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and cardiogenic shock.
