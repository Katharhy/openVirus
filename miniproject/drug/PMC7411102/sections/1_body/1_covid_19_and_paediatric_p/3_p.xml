<p id="p0025">The data on impact of SARS-C0V-2 on foetus, and on potential of perinatal transmission is scanty. In the past severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus were associated with critical maternal illness, spontaneous abortion, maternal death, severe intrauterine growth retardation, but congenital abnormalities were not reported. There is also no evidence of perinatal transmission of the SARS-associated coronavirus in past. In the current pandemic with COVID-19 no evidence of intrauterine or transplacental transmission from infected pregnant women to their foetuses or congenital malformation was found.
