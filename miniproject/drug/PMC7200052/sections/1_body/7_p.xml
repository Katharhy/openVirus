<p id="Par9">The molecular modelling which includes also the surface of molecules is a clearer representation of the overall structural difference between RdRps of positive-sense and negative-sense RNA viruses. In particular, this is clearly evidenced looking at the conformation of the core channel in which the Motif C β-strand-loop-β-strand structure protrudes (Fig.
