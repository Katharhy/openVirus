<p id="Par6">The alignment of RdRp sequences from the three epidemic/pandemic coronaviruses, confirms the high homology and conservation along the sequence (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Such homology and conservation is strongly retained when the analysis includes other positive-sense RNA virus, namely HCV, Dengue, West Nile, Zika and Yellow Fever viruses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). In particular, HCV shows the greatest number of identical residues with the coronaviruses. In Motif C, the DDxVV pattern has a 100% conservation but the three coronavirus are the only ones to show a serine instead of a glycine preceding the two aspartate residues.
