<p id="Par5">SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the Orthocoronavirinae (coronavirus, CoV) family and, in particular, to the genus beta (group 2) together with the other two new human coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Similarly to all RNA viruses, the viral genome replication and transcription processes of SARS-CoV-2 depend on an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is encoded by the RNA virus to catalyze the RNA synthesis from RNA templates. Consequently, RdRp is the key enzyme in the viral biological cycle of all RNA viruses, regardless the polarity of the viral RNA genome [

Although different for each RNA viruses, all viral RdRps are characterized by a 500â€“600 residue catalytic module with palm, fingers, and thumb domains forming an encircled human right hand architecture. Seven catalytic motifs are located in the RdRp palm and fingers domains, comprising the most conserved parts of the RdRp and are responsible for the RNA-only specificity in catalysis. Nevertheless, RdRps from positive-sense and negative-sense RNA viruses show differences with significant implications in the enzymatic mode of action [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In particular, the palm catalytic subdomain (Motif C) is the most conserved region of all monomeric viral RNA polymerases with two aspartic acid residues that coordinate the two metal ions necessary for the phosphoryl transfer reaction [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, while positive-sense RNA viruses show a glycine preceding the two aspartates, negative-sense RNA viruses show a serine, resulting in the alternative interactions with the metal ions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Mutation of the first aspartic residue results in a complete loss of RNA polymerase activity, whereas mutations of the second aspartate diminish the polymerase activity or modify the metal cofactor requirements, but do not inactivate the enzyme [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Negative-sense RNA viruses, have an asparagine instead of the second aspartic acid in Motif C which has been shown to enable viral RNA polymerases to use manganese (Mn
 <sup>2+</sup>) instead of magnesium (Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>) as cofactor [
