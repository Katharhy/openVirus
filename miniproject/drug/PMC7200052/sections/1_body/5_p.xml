<p id="Par7">On the contrary, such homology is very poor when RdRp sequences from the three epidemic/pandemic coronaviruses are aligned with negative-sense RNA viruses, namely Ebola, Influenza, Rabies, Vesicular Stomatitis virus, Measle, LCMV, Respirovirus and Orthopneumovirus (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). As predicted, the DDxVV pattern in Motif C is not present in the negative-sense RNA viruses. The Influenza virus is the only one showing the two aspartates (DDxYY), while the other three show an asparagine substituting the second aspartate (DNxYY), suggesting the use manganese (Mn
 <sup>2+</sup>) instead of magnesium (Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>) as cofactor.
