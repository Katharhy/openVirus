<p id="Par8">The structure modeling confirms the differences between the RdRps from positive-sense (HCV and SARS-CoV-2) and negative-sense (i.e. Influenza) RNA viruses. Indeed, considering the Motif C β-strand structure, only the alignment of RdRp structures from the two positive-sense RNA viruses results in the superimposition of the two Motifs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Furthermore, the highly conserved residues reside all in the inner part of the molecules which are in direct contact with the target genomic viral RNA and are responsible of the elongation of the nascent RNA molecule (Fig.
