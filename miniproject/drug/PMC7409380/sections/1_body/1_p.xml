 </sup> However, the symptoms are not deterministic due to the identification of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers and the overlapping features with other acute respiratory viral infections such as influenza.

 </sup> Therefore, highly sensitive and specific diagnostic methods that can distinguish COVID-19 cases from healthy or other virus-infected individuals are essential for disease management and therapeutics. Currently, various organizations have reported a variety of methods for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, which have different principles, operations, costs, and sensitivities. Here, we thoroughly review current diagnostic techniques for researchers and clinicians to develop appropriate methods for the timely and effective diagnosis of COVID-19 or the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The principles learned from other viral diagnostics will guide the SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics development. The review of other viral particle, nucleic acid, and protein detection methods provides insight into the development of novel SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic techniques.
