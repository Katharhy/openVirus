<p>Different CT learning models have been developed to aid the diagnosis of COVID-19. The UNet++ takes the raw CT scan images as input and the segmented map as output, which is trained in Keras in an image-to-image manner. The sensitivity (true positive/positive), accuracy (true predictions/total number of cases), specificity (true negative/negative), positive prediction value (PPV), and negative prediction value (NPV) of the network were 100%, 92.59%, 81.82%, 88.89% and 100%, respectively. The average prediction time per patient is 41.34 s, and the reading time of the radiologist is reduced by 65%.
