<p>Deep pneumonia can assist the COVID-19 diagnosis in three steps. The first step is to extract the main regions of the lungs, and the second step is to design a Details Relation Extraction neural network (DRE-Net) to obtain image-level predictions. Finally, DRE-Net, which starts with a pretrained ResNet50 and an extra Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), is used to extract top-K details from each image and understand the importance of each detail through the attention module. The image level predictions can achieve 93% diagnostic sensitivity and can distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from bacterial-related pneumonia with 96% sensitivity. Moreover, their models were able to locate the main lesion features in 30 s, especially the ground-glass opacity.
