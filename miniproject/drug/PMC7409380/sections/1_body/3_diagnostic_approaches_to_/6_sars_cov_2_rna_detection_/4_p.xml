<p>With the naked eye or microphone readout, LAMP, RPA, and RCA permit the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in the clinic or at home by minimally trained personnel with a simple temperature control device. However, commonly used LAMP requires a complex design of six primers with significant restrictions on their respective position and orientation. Besides, LAMP is not appropriate for multiplex detection due to primer–primer interactions. RPA is inhibited by genomic DNA (20–100 ng/μL); thus, RNA purification is required. The combination of digital, automatic, quantitative, and droplet microfluidic isothermal amplification and other techniques such CRISPR and nanotechnology represents the vigorous future research direction.</p>
