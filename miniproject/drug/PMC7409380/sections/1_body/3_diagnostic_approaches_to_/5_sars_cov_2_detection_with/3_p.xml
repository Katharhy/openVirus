<p>qRT-PCR requires a 2–4 h turnaround time and a laboratory certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) or a clinical laboratory with trained personnel, whose efficiency is low to satisfy the screening requirements of the COVID-19 pandemic. The automated qRT-PCR instrument, which integrates RNA extraction, concentration measurement, reagent preparation, and target sequence amplification/detection steps, has achieved significant improvements in detection efficiency and assay throughput (

 </xref>). The US FDA has approved five automated PCR-based systems that can return diagnostic results in less than an hour: the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test on Accula dock or Silaris dock (30 min), the BioFire COVID-19 test and BioFire Respiratory Panel 2.1 on the FilmArray system (50 and 45 min), the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel on the QIAstat-Dx Analyzer System (1 h), and the NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2 Assay on the NeuMoDx 288 Molecular System (1 h). The Accula integrates PCR with lateral flow technologies, while the ePlex combines DNA hybridization with electrochemical detection. QIAstat-Dx, and BioFire Respiratory Panel 2.1 (RP2.1) are multiplexed and can distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from other bacteria and viruses (more than 21 types). Fully automated diagnostic devices have a LoD of 125 to 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> copies/mL, which seems less sensitive than nonfully automated diagnostic devices with a LoD of 10 to 5.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> copies/mL.
