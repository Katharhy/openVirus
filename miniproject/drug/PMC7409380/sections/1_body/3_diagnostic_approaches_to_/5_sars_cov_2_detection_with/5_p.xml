<p>Here are the possible reasons that can explain the FNR. First, the mutation leads to the off-target mismatch between the primer and the target sequence. The ORF1a, ORF 8, and N gene contain hot-spot loci such as 28 144 in ORF 8 (30.53%), 8782 in ORF1a (29.47%), and 29 095 in N (11.58%).

 </sup> Second, for asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic, or discharged patients, low viral loads may be insufficient for qRT-PCR detection. Third, the presence of interfering substances may generate “false-positive” results. Furthermore, the conditions of specimen transportation and preservation as well as the quality of the test kits may significantly affect the diagnostic accuracy. The integration of the qRT-PCR with clinical manifestations and imaging examinations is more efficient and accurate in diagnosing suspected COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, microfluidic digital array PCR that provides gene quantification at the single-molecule level may reduce the false-positive rate.
