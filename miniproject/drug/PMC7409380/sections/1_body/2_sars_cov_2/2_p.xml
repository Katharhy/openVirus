<p>The SARS-CoV-2 genome contains five major open reading frames (ORFs), arranged in the order of the 5′ untranslated region (UTR)-replicase complex (ORF1ab)-Spike (S)-Envelope (E)-Membrane (M)-Nucleocapsid (N)-3′ UTR and accessory genes such as 
 <bold>3a</bold>, 
 <bold>6</bold>, 
 <bold>7a</bold>, 
 <bold>7b</bold>, and 
 <bold>8</bold> (

 </sup> The ORF1ab gene encodes the nonstructural proteins that aid viral genome replication and transcription, which has about 90% nucleotide sequence (nts) identity to SARS-CoV-1.

 </sup> The E gene, which encodes the membrane protein involving virus assembly, budding, envelop formation, and pathogenesis,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
 </sup> has the highest (93%) nts identity with SARS-CoV-1. The S gene, responsible for virus binding and cell entry,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
 </sup> shares less than 75% nts identity with other SARS-CoVs, except for RaTG13 (93%).
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
 </sup> Compared to S and E proteins, M and N proteins are more abundant, which bind to the RNA genome and participate in virus assembly and budding, respectively, where the M and N genes share approximately 90% nts identity with SARS-CoV-1.
