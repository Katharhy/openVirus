<p>Lessons learned from the past play a vital role to combat against the COVID-19 pandemic. In comparison with the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak in 2003, artificial intelligence (AI) has played a more important role, including contact tracing, evidence-based policymaking, and detection of COVID-19 infection in medical images (chest X-rays and CT scans). AI-enabled technologies, such as the AI robot, smart toilet, and smartphone, could provide valuable support for tracing, diagnostics, and therapeutics (

 </xref>). The smart toilet, as a noninvasive device that can collect and analyze urine and stool, may become an important strategy for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Systems with cameras, pressure and motion sensors, and urinalysis strips have been used for health monitoring.

 </sup> The robot can work in risky environments, thereby relieving the pressure on the frontline medical staff. The AI robot is capable of collecting throat swabs. The diagnostic and service robots will be deployed in crowded public places, such as customs, airports, ports, railway stations, etc. The mobile robot increases the efficiency and coverage of COVID-19 screening. Hopefully, with the consistent development of AI technologies, smarter and more powerful robotic systems under remote control with the ability to disinfect, deliver medications and food, measure temperature and vital signs, diagnose, and assist in transmission control will revolutionize weapons to fight against future viral epidemic outbreaks.
