<p>Asymptomatic and discharged COVID-19 patients are likely to transmit the virus to persons who are in close contact, making it challenging for the prevention and control of epidemics and requiring long-term monitoring and tracking. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in urine and stool samples of certain confirmed patients, even in asymptomatic cases,

 </sup> indicating the high demand for ultrasensitive diagnostic techniques. A highly sensitive diagnostic platform can be developed by combining fluorescence resonance energy transfer, aggregation-induced emission molecules, and luminescent upconverting nanoparticles with unique optical properties (

 </xref>). The magnetic properties of some nanoparticles, which enable the enrichment of fluorophores, offer the convenience of developing a smartphone-based readout system. The smartphone equipped with different optomechanical accessories, which enable the performance of brightfield, fluorescence, spectroscopy, or phase imaging, is a promising read-out platform. These devices make precise diagnostics possible in remote areas. The miniaturized sequencing devices make it available outside the laboratory for on-site applications. Synthetic biology has created novel molecular functions that can bring new capabilities to molecular diagnostics.
