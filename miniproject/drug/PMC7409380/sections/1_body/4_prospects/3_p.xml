 </sup> According to the available SARS-CoV-2 genome sequenced up to June 1, 2020, globally, 8309 single mutations have been observed in 15 140 SARS-CoV-2 isolates.

 </sup> These mutations might affect the efficiency of oligonucleotide annealing and compromise the sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR assays.

 </sup> The target genes selected for molecular diagnosis should be relatively conserved. Meanwhile, multiple-target detection can minimize the risk of sensitivity loss due to unknown mutations. The kits of the early versions should be used with caution for the detection of prevalent SARS-CoV-2 subtypes. Genomic sequencing guides the design of nucleic acid-based diagnosis. The combination of multiple assays including viral RNA detection, lateral flow immunoassay, NGS, clinical symptoms, and CT imaging will provide a more accurate diagnosis. However, under real clinical conditions, there should be a balance between cost, time, accuracy, and specificity.
