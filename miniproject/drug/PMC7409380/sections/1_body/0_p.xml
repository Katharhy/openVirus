 </sup> SARS-CoV-2 is the pathogen that causes COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is named because of its genetic similarity to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) discovered in 2003. Belonging to the coronavirus (CoVs) clade, SARS-CoV-2 has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome with 30 kilobases in length and is about 80â€“120 nm in diameter.
