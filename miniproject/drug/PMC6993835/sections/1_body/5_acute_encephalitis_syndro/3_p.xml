<p>In most Asian countries, infectious causes are still far more common. In a study on VE in Chinese children, the etiology was confirmed in 52.5% of patients. The most common pathogen was human enterovirus (EV) (27.7%). The etiology of viral meningitis was identified in 42.8% of cases; the leading pathogen again was human EV (37.7%)

 </sup>. In India, JE is probably the commonest form and occurs in epidemics, especially in the south and east. Rabies is another form of VE which poses a public health problem. In the Gorakhpur division of eastern Uttar Pradesh, JE was held to be the main agent responsible for AES. There was a severe epidemic of JE in this region in 2005
