<p>Encephalitis is an important cause of morbidity, mortality, and permanent neurologic disability in both adults and children. The term “encephalitis” literally means inflammation of part or all of the “encephalon” or brain parenchyma. Globally, invasion by a pathogen causing direct neuronal injury is the most common cause of encephalitis. Direct injury by pathogen invasion may result in acute, subacute, or chronic manifestations. Sometimes, the inflammation is not due to invasion but is an indirect immunologically mediated injury.</p>
