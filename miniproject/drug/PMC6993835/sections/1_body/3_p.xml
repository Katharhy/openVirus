<p>The magnitude of the problem of encephalitis is difficult to assess because of a lack of uniform definitions and study populations. Worldwide the prevalence varies. In the US, there were 73 hospitalizations due to encephalitis per 100,000 population (95% confidence interval 7.1–7.6)

 </sup> from 2000 to 2010. In Ontario, Canada, between 2002 and 2013, the crude incidence of all-cause encephalitis was estimated to be about 4.3 cases per 100,000 persons per year

 </sup>. The problem is further compounded by the fact that a wide variety of central nervous system disorders may mimic encephalitis. Infectious encephalitis can occur in epidemic, endemic, or sporadic form. In 2006, the World Health Organization coined the term “acute encephalitis syndrome” (AES) for the purpose of surveillance of JE. This is defined as “an illness in a person of any age and at any time of the year characterized by acute onset of fever with alteration of consciousness, stupor, coma and/or new onset of convulsions excluding simple febrile convulsions”

 </sup>. Basically, this refers to acute illness with fever along with altered sensorium or convulsions or both. This type of presentation can have a very wide etiology.
