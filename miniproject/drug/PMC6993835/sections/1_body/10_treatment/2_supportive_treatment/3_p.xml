<p>3. In the presence of features of raised intracranial pressure, mannitol infusion (0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg every 4 to 6 hours) or intravenous furosemide may be needed. Hypertonic saline (3%) in a dose of 0.1 to 1 mL/kg per hour in order to maintain serum sodium between 145 and 155 mEq/L is another option. Hyperventilation to keep arterial carbon dioxide (CO 
 <sub>2</sub>) tension between 25 and 30 mm Hg may also be used to combat raised intracranial tension. When facilities are available, monitoring of intracranial tension is useful. In the case of rapidly increasing intracranial tension with clinical deterioration unresponsive to medical treatment, surgical decompression can be life-saving
