<p>A large number of viruses are known to cause encephalitis, but virological diagnosis is complex, expensive, and time-consuming. The responsible virus may be detectable only in the brain itself and is either absent or transiently found in blood or CSF. For these reasons, it is not surprising that etiologic diagnosis is not reached in more than half the cases, even at advanced centers

 </sup>. Different centers could make their own algorithms for investigation according to the local etiologic scenarios. Timing of sampling is important as PCR tends to be positive early in the illness whereas IgM takes 4 to 7 days to appear. For JE, IgM capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in CSF is the gold standard for diagnosis. PCR for JE genome/DNA in CSF or serum, if positive, confirms the diagnosis. JE PCR positivity is highly variable (9–77.8%) in different studies, and early samples have a higher rate of positivity

 </sup>. Serum IgM and NS1 antigen are used for diagnosis of dengue encephalitis/encephalopathy. ELISA in serum for detection of rickettsial IgM is used for diagnosis of scrub typhus meningoencephalitis. Multiplex PCR panels for a variety of agents are being developed for etiologic diagnosis of encephalitis. Detection of autoantibodies in CSF or serum confirms a diagnosis of AIE.
