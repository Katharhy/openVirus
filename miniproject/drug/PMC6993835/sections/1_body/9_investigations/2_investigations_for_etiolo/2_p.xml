<p>MRI of the brain with and without contrast using diffusion, T2-weighted, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences is the modality of choice to assess changes consistent with brain parenchymal inflammation. A specific MRI picture may be seen with a few pathogens. Herpes simplex encephalitis classically affects temporal and frontal lobes. Focal edema is seen in the medial aspects of the temporal lobes, orbital surfaces of the frontal lobes, insular cortex, and cingulate gyrus
