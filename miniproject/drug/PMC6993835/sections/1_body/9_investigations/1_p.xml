<p>Diagnostic testing should include lumbar puncture, brain MRI, and EEG in all suspected cases of encephalitis. After assessment for contraindications, a lumbar puncture with opening pressure measurement should be performed to obtain CSF for total and differential cell counts, diagnostic testing, protein, and glucose. Typically, CSF in VE has essentially normal glucose, increased protein, and a mild to moderate mononuclear pleocytosis (predominantly lymphocytic but can be neutrophilic early in the course)
