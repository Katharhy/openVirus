<p>Several factors such as age, geographical location, season, climate, and host immune status affect the epidemiology of encephalitis. Arboviruses or arthropod-borne viruses have their life cycle in insect vectors and vertebrate animals, occasionally infecting humans who are a “dead end “host

 </sup>. Different arboviral encephalitides have their own specific geographical distribution depending on the activity of their insect vectors. For example, arboviral encephalitides prevalent in the US include Western equine, eastern equine, Californian, and St. Louis encephalitis. Venezuelan encephalitis is found in South America, and JE in Asia. These encephalitides tend to occur in epidemics or outbreaks. Occasionally, a fresh pathogen, when introduced into a susceptible population, produces an explosive outbreak. HSVE is the commonest sporadic infectious encephalitis in Western countries. It tends to occur worldwide with little seasonal or age and sex predilection
