 </sup>. Persistent neuroinflammatory cascade due to cytokine load and BBB damage is associated with glial reactivity, synaptic changes, and the generation of hyper-excitable networks with lower seizure threshold which all promote epileptic activity
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>
 </sup>. Epidemiological findings have indicated neuroinfection and systemic infections as one of major cause of acquired epilepsy

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">149</xref>
 </sup>. Viral encephalitis, for example, increases the risk of subsequent seizures
 <sup>

 </sup>. Increased concentrations of IL-1 were detected in plasma and CSF of different epileptic phenotypes, suggesting this cytokine seizure-inducing properties
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">150</xref>
 </sup>. Changes in GABAergic-transmission and reduction of astrocytic glutamate uptake may account for IL-1 dependent increase in susceptibility to epilepsy

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">152</xref>
 </sup>. Similarly, raised levels of IL-6 were reported in both plasma and CSF in patients suffering from a wide range of epileptic presentations, while this increased concentrations correlated with the severity of seizures

 </sup>. Capability of IL-6 to promote epileptogenesis is further corroborated by the evidence that IL-6 overexpression induces abnormal ictogenesis in mice hippocampus

 </sup>. Associations between epilepsy and COVID-19 have not yet been reported
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref>
 </sup>, however, American Epilepsy Society already suggested that COVID-19 could increase the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). There are some reports which indicate that infections, bacterial or viral may increase the risk of SUDEP. At present, there are no data on the association between COVID âˆ’19 and SUDEP
