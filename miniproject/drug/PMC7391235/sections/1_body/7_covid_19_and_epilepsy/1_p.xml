 </sup>. Indeed, psychiatric diseases are more frequent in epileptic subjects than in general population irrespective of the time of seizures onset, which could occur either before or after the appearance of psychiatric disorders, suggesting a mutual relationship and potentially shared aetiology

 </sup>. This intriguing coexistence of psychiatric features in epileptic patients does not represent a coincidence or an ordinary comorbidity but more likely it reflects interconnected pathobiological processes

 </sup>. This makes any rigid separation between epilepsy and some psychiatric disorders less stringent, and hence we included epilepsy in the discussion for the remarkable behavioural alterations and for the role of neuroinflammation in its pathogenesis.
