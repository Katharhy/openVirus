<p id="Par14">In the initial phases of systemic inflammation, antiviral immunity can effectively blunt viral dissemination, since reactivity of neuroglia and influx of surveying T cells can remove infectious elements, preventing spread without any further tissue damage

 </sup>. In severe COVID-19, substantial release of chemokines and interleukins associated with systemic inflammation and the marked lymphopenia allow higher and a more prolonged persistence of a viral load; consequently deficient clearance of the virus together with the reactive gliosis can perpetuate neuroinflammation

 </sup>. Even in mild cases, SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia causes hypoxia, which on its own can trigger or exacerbate inflammatory response of the CNS. Cerebral hypoxia activates key inflammatory transcription factors, including NF-κB and hypoxia inducible factor which stimulate overproduction of pro-inflammatory messengers
