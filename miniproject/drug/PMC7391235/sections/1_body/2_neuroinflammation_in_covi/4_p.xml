Close correlation between pneumonia and delirium in the elderly is a long-standing observation, and delirium, which represents the most common event of acute brain dysfunction, is a frequent complication of COV-19 clinical progression, perhaps due to the neurovirulence, severe peripheral inflammation, profound stress; even “social distancing” and loneliness which elderly experience during pandemic contribute to psychotic episodes
