  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>. This coronavirus, named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) belongs to group 2B of β-coronavirus family
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. The SARS-CoV-2 is recognised as the seventh component of the coronavirus family and has been included in the orthocoronavirinae subfamily
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. Coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses generally related to respiratory illness; they also (albeit less frequently) may instigate gastrointestinal and neurological disorders in a wide variety of mammals and birds. The coronaviruses have high rates of mutation and recombination as well as a propensity of cross-species transmission
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>. The SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell following binding to plasmalemmal ACE2 enzyme with subsequent endocytic internalisation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>. The primary targets for the virus are represented by epithelial cells of the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Endocytosis of the ACE2-virus complex also leads to a depletion of plasmalemmal pool of ACE2 with consequent reduction in conversion of Angiotensin II to Angiotensin 1–7; the latter peptide possesses marked anti-inflammatory properties

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup> and the reduction of Arg 1–7 significantly contributes to lung failure and the massive occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis described in patients with COVID-19
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>. Whether SARS-CoV-2 could penetrate cells through alternative routes remains unclear, although in contrast to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 does not bind to plasmalemmal receptors such as aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl peptidase
