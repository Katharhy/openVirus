<p id="Par11">It seems therefore that SARS-CoV-2, similarly to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infects the brainstem, in which the respiratory neuronal circuits are located, and, by analogy, a similar infection could occur and contribute to the respiratory failure, observed in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Breathing depends on a central pattern generator located in the dorsolateral pons, in the nucleus of the solitary tract, and in ventrolateral medulla; this patter generator is responsible for respiratory rhythms and control of motor neurones innervating respiratory muscles

 </sup>. In a sub-population of COVID-19 patientsâ€™ respiratory failure is manifested by a decreased breathing rate with hypoxia and hypercapnia. Many of these patients remain in a coma for days, despite the suspension of sedative treatment and the absence of apparent metabolic alteration, indicating viral encephalitis, which often is resolved without major sequelae

 </sup>. This is not always the case, however, and when the extent of respiratory failure is overwhelming, patients die before the virus-induced brain damage can become evident

 </sup>. Given the viral load in the brain stem, the subsequent reduction of ACE2 expression associated with the neuronal death, could lead to an alteration in baroreceptors function associated with an increase in the sympathetic tone and a severe, life threatening rise in blood pressure

 </sup>. These aspects have to be taken in account by clinicians dealing with COVID-19 patients displaying severe cardiovascular and respiratory failure. Recognizing that respiratory symptoms may, at least in part, originate from the encephalitic damage to the brain stem, may help to design more effective treatments.
