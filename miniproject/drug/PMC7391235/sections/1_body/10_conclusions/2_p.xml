<p id="Par30">At present, there are few preliminary studies considering neuropsychiatric complications of COVID-19, however, on the basis of the results of the previous epidemics of various respiratory viruses it is possible to assume an increased incidence of mental pathologies as an unwanted sequelae. Not only SARS-COV-2 can penetrate the brain and cause direct damage to neuronal networks, the experience of potentially lethal and untreatable COVID-19 is the cause of a severe distress, which may induce long term behavioural changes or aggravate a pre-existing mental illness. Here we outlined possible neuropsychiatric complications that could arise in subjects infected with SARS-COV-2. Patients with COVID-19 could present with a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms, which result from systemic inflammation, CNS effects of cytokines, infection of neural cells by SARS-COV-2, neuroinflammation, glial dysfunction or aberrant epigenetic modifications of stress-related genes. This review was intended to draw special attention to the psychiatric aspects of COVID-19, because minimizing their relevance by claiming that sometimes “an abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is a normal behaviour”
