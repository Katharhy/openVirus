<p id="p0030">To help curtail the spread of COVID-19, cruise ships were detained to hold passengers onboard in a 14-day quarantine. For example, a Diamond Princess cruise ship harboring infected persons was docked outside California (
 <xref rid="b0360" ref-type="bibr">Saey, 2020</xref>). This Diamond Princess cruise ship had &gt;700 infected crew and passengers onboard a tightly packed vessel harbouring &gt;3700 individuals. Cruise lines create the perfect environment for infection to run rampant, as seen in the past with norovirus outbreaks causing widespread gastrointestinal distress. Unfortunately, passengers not infected had to wait through the same protocol until the ship was able to dock safely. For this reason, the CDC issued a public warning against traveling on any cruise ships for the time being, especially for high-risk individuals (

 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">CDC, 2020c</xref>). The no-sail order was extended on April 9 to continue for a 100-day period unless the CDC Director or Secretary of Health and Human Services declares COVID-19 to no longer be a public health emergency, whereby the order can be terminated early.
