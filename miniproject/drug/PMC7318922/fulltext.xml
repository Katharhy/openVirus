In 2019, a novel virus emerged from Wuhan, China, and resulted in a marked worldwide outbreak of respiratory illness. Prevention and containment became the prioritized intervention against COVID-19, coupled with a continued search for hallmarks of the disease that would allow early detection and provide insight into management and triage. Cutaneous findings associated with COVID-19 include diffuse maculopapular rashes, livedo reticularis, and acro-ischemic &#x0201c;COVID toes.&#x0201d; These skin findings occurred anywhere from days before respiratory symptom onset to weeks after recovery, and predominantly in child and adolescent populations. The role of dermatologists can be expanded during this COVID-19 pandemic to help identify disease through cutaneous presentations.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kg005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Coronavirus</kwd><kwd>Pandemic</kwd><kwd>Cutaneous</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><title>Background</title><p id="p0005">Members of the Coronaviridae (CoV) family are characterized by a single-stranded, positive sense RNA with a helical capsid.

Although this family of viruses is mostly associated with the common cold, there are much more virulent species within the taxa (<xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Brian and Baric, 2005</xref>). Notably, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV epidemic was thought to originate in bats, with the civet cat being the intermediate host prior to human infection (<xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Guan et al., 2003</xref>). In 2007, <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al.

Although the source of this viral outbreak remains elusive, the original 27 cases were linked to Southern China&#x02019;s Wuhan Seafood Wholesale Market (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2020</xref>). This market is known for selling various bushmeat and other wild animals to the public for consumption, which was speculated to include an unidentified intermediate host for COVID-19. As in SARS-CoV, bats are understood to be the main host of the COVID-19 virus.</p><p id="p0015">On January 20, 2020, a 35-year old man residing in Washington state with recent travel exposure in Wuhan, China, was identified as the first case of COVID-19 in the United States (<xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">Holshue et al., 2020</xref>). The reproduction number of the virus is estimated to be an average of 3.28 (mean R<sub>0</sub>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;3.28), indicating that each infected person is likely to pass the disease to &#x0003e;3 people (<xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Fear of an increasing epidemic emerged with the identification of four cases in Thailand, Japan, and South Korea. An extended latency phase was postulated to occur, during which infected individuals remained asymptomatic, as two of four cases reported no contact with the Wuhan Central Hospital or the aforementioned market (<xref rid="b0355" ref-type="bibr">Rothe et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0020">Within 60&#x0202f;days, in response to the surge in medical need overloading medical care capacity in Wuhan, the Chinese government constructed and designated two new hospitals to care for the additional patients. In addition, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and next-generation sequencing tests were made readily available to collect specimens of sputum, blood, stool, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cultures, which lead to the discovery of a novel coronavirus, SARS CoV-2, now known as COVID-19 (<xref rid="b0435" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2020a</xref>). Evolving epidemiologic evidence determined COVID-19&#x02032;s capacity to spread through human-to-human droplet transmissions, with airborne transfer under investigation (<xref rid="b0440" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2020b</xref>). A subsequent study identified the presence of the virus in stool samples of an infected host, suggesting the potential for fecal-oral spread (<xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">Holshue et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0025">A latency period of up to 2&#x0202f;weeks resulted in the rapid spread of COVID-19 through asymptomatic individuals harboring the disease, with international travel hubs playing a vital role in global transmission. Modern Internet infrastructure led to rapid generation of global index cases (<xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2020</xref>). In late January 2020, the first U.S. travel restrictions targeted travel from China, the source of the outbreak. Weeks later, additional travel bans included travel from Europe and the United Kingdom. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, with a global case total of &#x0003e;100,000.

For example, a Diamond Princess cruise ship harboring infected persons was docked outside California (<xref rid="b0360" ref-type="bibr">Saey, 2020</xref>). This Diamond Princess cruise ship had &#x0003e;700 infected crew and passengers onboard a tightly packed vessel harbouring &#x0003e;3700 individuals. Cruise lines create the perfect environment for infection to run rampant, as seen in the past with norovirus outbreaks causing widespread gastrointestinal distress. Unfortunately, passengers not infected had to wait through the same protocol until the ship was able to dock safely. For this reason, the CDC issued a public warning against traveling on any cruise ships for the time being, especially for high-risk individuals (<xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">CDC, 2020b</xref>). As of March 14, the CDC Director issued a no-sail order, and cruise ships remained voluntarily out of service from U.S. ports for the next 30&#x0202f;days (<xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">CDC, 2020c</xref>). The no-sail order was extended on April 9 to continue for a 100-day period unless the CDC Director or Secretary of Health and Human Services declares COVID-19 to no longer be a public health emergency, whereby the order can be terminated early.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Clinical presentation</title><p id="p0035">Clinical symptoms of COVID-19 range from mild respiratory illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome.

When the infection progresses to spread at an unpredictable rate, the disease is classified as an outbreak. Outbreaks evolve into epidemics once the virus spreads over a larger geographic region, and eventually into pandemics when the spread is at a global scale.<fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Six phases of a pandemic timeline (World Health Organization [WHO] pandemic phases; pandemic influenza preparedness and response: A WHO guidance document; License: CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 IGO; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK143061/figure/ch4.f1/%3freport%3dobjectonly" id="ir010">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK143061/figure/ch4.f1/?report=objectonly</ext-link>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig></p><p id="p0095">Pandemics can be broken down into six phases, starting with phases 1 through 3, which are defined as mostly animal infections with a few human cases (<xref rid="b0430" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2020</xref>). Phase 4 is reached after sustained human-to-human transmission. Phases 5 and 6 are defined as meeting the pandemic criteria with progressive global transmission and represent the current global phase of COVID-19, with some regions, including the US, experiencing post-peak transmission rates.</p><p id="p0100">The United States Government has placed level 3 travel precautions on multiple countries, including China, Iran, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and many European nations, and effectively banned nonessential travel. Level 3 travel advisories are issued to discourage travel due to significant risks toward safety, health, and security. U.S. citizens looking to return to the United States are asked to self-quarantine at home for a 14-day period (<xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">CDC, 2020f</xref>). The government is not allowing foreign nationals who have visited Iran or China in the last 14&#x0202f;days to enter the country at this time. In an unprecedented move, the CDC also issued a 14-day domestic travel advisory for New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut on March 30, asking residents of these states to refrain from any travel (<xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">CDC, 2020g</xref>).</p><p id="p0105">Tourism and travel (e.g., trains, airplanes, and cruise ships) are associated with the highest risk of infection because they take place in generally highly concentrated areas with people who have visited multiple countries. Abstaining from visiting airports and cruise ships is recommended by the <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">CDC (2020g)</xref>. In addition, the CDC recommends maintaining household emergency plans. Families should consider alternative options for work and school in case local and federal governments call for a shutdown. A two-headed approach of prevention and containment offers the greatest intervention point with COVID-19. Individuals who believe they have contracted COVID-19 but are clinically stable should remain at home and self-quarantine for 14&#x0202f;days minimum and make a telephone visit to determine if further medical care is required (<xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">CDC, 2020h</xref>)<italic>.</italic> This reduces the risk of infecting the individuals at hospitals with chronic illness who are the most susceptible to severe respiratory failure and alleviates the burden of overwhelming hospital personnel.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><title>Prevention</title><p id="p0110">The greatest intervention in the COVID-19 pandemic is the application of effective preventative measures.

The recommendation calls for handwashing using soap and warm water while scrubbing for a minimum of 20 seconds (<xref rid="b0415" ref-type="bibr">U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2019</xref>). Alternatively, hand sanitizer can be effective in the absence of soap and water, such as in public forums<italic>.</italic> All household and workplace areas are recommended to be frequently disinfected using 75% alcohol products or disinfecting wipes. Examples of places to clean include doorknobs, tables, counters, and computer keyboards. Persons are recommended to avoid touching their face (mouth, nose, or eyes) to prevent fomites from reaching high-risk areas of the body. Additionally, unnecessary travel to overcrowded locations (e.g., amusement parks, sports events, movie theatres, and hospitals) should be avoided to reduce potential transmission burden. Self-awareness and handwashing are critical; studies show that the average human touches their face &#x0003e;200 times per day (<xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">Kwok et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, social distancing practices should be implemented throughout the day (<xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).

Standard surgical masks have been shown to be similarly effective in preventing infection in lower-risk situations, such as outdoor areas, because they provide a direct barrier of the nose and mouth and prevent incidental fomite contact (<xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Derrick and Gomersall, 2005</xref>). Studies from the original SARS CoV-1 epidemic recommend using absorbent (e.g., cotton) over disposable gowns because disposable gowns allowed for longer virus survival (<xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>). Although the CDC&#x02019;s and WHO&#x02019;s original stance did not call for masks for the general public, the recommendation came later from the state level for citizens to wear homemade versions of masks in public to spare medical-grade surgical masks and N95 respirators for health care personnel. These masks should cover the mouth and nose entirely and be washed daily. A tutorial is provided on the CDC website with several creative methods to create a mask with cloth materials at home (<xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">CDC, 2020i</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><title>Treatment and management</title><p id="p0125">Supportive care is the mainstay treatment for respiratory distress in COVID-19, encompassing ventilation support and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, while information is obtained regarding effective treatment for the COVID-19 infection.

This agent provides a similar benefit in systemic lupus erythematous by attenuating the proinflammatory cascade (<xref rid="b0395" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2012</xref>). A nonrandomized clinical trial combining azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine initially showed promising therapeutic potential (<xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">Gautret et al., 2020</xref>). The authors recommended risk stratification because the combination of drugs can potentiate cardiac arrythmias. Most recently, hydroxychloroquine has fallen out of favor as a therapy of choice because of its significant side effect profile and lack of clear clinical benefit, followed by the retraction of a <italic>Lancet</italic> article supporting hydroxychloroquine (<xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Chorin et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="b0290" ref-type="bibr">Mehra et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0145">Additionally, the interleukin-6 human monoclonal antibody tocilizumab is being studied in a clinical trial for COVID-19 treatment (Chugai Pharmaceutical, Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical, Jiangsu Qyun Bio-Pharmaceutical, Jiangsu, China). This novel use of a monoclonal antibody as an antiviral agent is suggested to work through its immunosuppression of acute-phase reactants, which is associated with inflammation and leukocyte recruitment and could potentially reduce respiratory distress.
