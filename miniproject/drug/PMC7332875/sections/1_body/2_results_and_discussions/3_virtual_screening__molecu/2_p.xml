<p>The selection of most probable drug candidates acquired from virtual screening and molecular docking of Asinex and PubChem datasets was obtained by analyzing scoring functions and the binding free energies-MM/GBSA. The top-scored molecules from both the databases were prioritized based on docking score. Out of 100 XP docking molecules, best top 10 docked ligands were selected from each library at Sites 1, 2 and 3. 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Tables 3</xref>(A-1 to A-10), 4 (C-1 to C-10) and 5 (E-1 to E-10) show the results of binding free energies Î”
