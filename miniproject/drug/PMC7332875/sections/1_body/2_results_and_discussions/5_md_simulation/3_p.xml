 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(B)</xref> demonstrates the fluctuations in the region 3.5 Å from 6 to 10 ns and 4.8 Å from 28 to 50 ns. This interaction remained stable and sustained for a longer period. The ligand atom interaction with strong hydrogen bonds were seen in D: ASN75 (86% on NH and 99% on O), C: ALA55 (95%), medium interaction in C: TYR109 (44%) and weak interactions in C: ARG107 (36%) and C: ARG92 (38%). While residues D: ASN77 (38%) and C: ARG 149 (32%) showed water bridges (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(C)</xref> shows the interaction of Zidovudine with the target protein. It shows a very stable interactions and minimal fluctuation. Its increase started to 2.4 Å on 2 ns and remained stable up to 3 Å from 13 to 50 ns. Its interactions are also complex and multiple bond formations. Majority of the residues form the hydrogen bonds and maximum interactions were seen with the residue ASN. Only three residues (D: THR148, D: ASN153, D: ASN77) exclusively forms the water bridges and one residue form the Van der Waals interaction (C: ARG107). All other residues show hydrogen bond interactions with long period of time including three strong, two medium and two weak hydrogen interactions such as C: ARG107 having variable percentage with three oxygen atom and one water linkage, C: ALA55 (71% with N), C: TYR109 (33%), D: ASN75 (95% O and 45% NH), D: ASN 154 (83%, 33% for two different O atom and one water linkage) and D: ASN150 (more than 50% with two O and two water molecules) (
