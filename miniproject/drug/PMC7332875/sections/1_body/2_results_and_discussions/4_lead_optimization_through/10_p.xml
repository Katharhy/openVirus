<p>The ADME/T property values of all the four molecules from Asinex database molecules satisfied the acceptable ranges in term of Lipinski’s rule of five 5 (Lipinski, 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) and other pharmacokinetic parameters such as probable H-bonding atoms, human oral absorption (&lt;25%: poor; &gt;above 80%: good) and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for blockage of human Ether-a-go-go-Related Gene (hERG) K + channels (&lt; −5 satisfactory) (Sato et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Finally, four lead optimized molecules are predicted to have degree of drug likeliness. 
 <xref rid="t0007" ref-type="table">Table 7A</xref> shows that molecular weights of the selected compounds are in the range from 325 to 420 D, hydrogen bond acceptance from 9 to 10 and hydrogen bond donor between 2 and 4. It also shows that the compounds have rotatable bonds in the range of 4–8 while their polar surface areas ranges from 144.664 to 209.137. Furthermore, 
 <xref rid="t0007" ref-type="table">Table 7A</xref> mentions the detailed results including Lipinski rule of 5, Veber’s rule and other pharmacokinetics parameters for these four compounds. Whereas, there is no need of ADMET prediction for three FDA approved drug molecules as they are already approved as anti-HIV as well as anti-Herpes drugs (
 <xref rid="t0008" ref-type="table">Table 7B</xref>).
