<p>There are four structural proteins in CoV, including trimeric spike (S glycoprotein) responsible for attachment, fusion and entry with the help of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) on the human cell (Hasan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). A pentameric small envelope protein (E protein) regulates ion channel activity (Gupta et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The others are matrix protein (M protein) and nucleocapsid protein (N protein) for virion formation and replication (Brian &amp; Baric, 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Along with these some main proteases (M
 <sup>pro</sup>) are also present (Boopathi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In addition to that, unlike other RNA viruses, it has exonucleases to repair mismatches in newly transcribed double stranded RNA and provide resistance to many of the therapies (Shannon et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). So drugs with additional mechanisms are required to target the several viral proteins simultaneously. The nucleocapsid N proteins are present in large amount as structural protein and they are the least variable and highly conserved structure of CoV (Lin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The N-terminal Domain (NTD), the C-Terminal Domains (CTD) and a central Ser/Arg (SR) rich linker are three main domains of N proteins which are capable of binding to the RNA, oligomerization and phosphorylation, respectively (Chang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Lo et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). These bind with the RNA genome to form ribonucleoprotein complex necessary to produce virion core and RNA synthesis for viral replication (Cong et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; McBride et al., 2014). Furthermore, studies have suggested their role in regulating host–pathogen interactions such as reorganizations of actin filaments, progression of the host cell cycle, and finally, apoptosis of their cells (Du et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Surjit et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).
