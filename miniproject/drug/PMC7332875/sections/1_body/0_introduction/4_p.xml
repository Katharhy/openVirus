<p>The structure of nucleocapsid phosphoproteins is just like an overall right hand like fold with an extended central loop divided into an area called palm and fingers (e.g. 6M3M and 6VYO) (Kang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). One of the fingers is having more basic amino acid residues and therefore called as basic finger. So instead of fewer location based on NTD and CTD, the protein binds with the basic amino acid residue moieties significantly with (A50, T57, H59, R92, I94, S105, R107, R149, Y172) which are located in the basic finger and its junction with the palm. The studies suggest that the suitable target is the hot spot located at the interface of basic finger and the palm (Dinesh et al.,
