<p>The Schrodinger’s Protein Preparation Wizard was used for the preparation of three-dimensional structure of target protein (PDB ID: 6VYO). It was done by correcting bond orders, the addition of hydrogen bonds (HBs), creating zero-order bonds to metal atoms, creating disulphide bonds, conversion of selenomethionine to methionine, filling in missing side chains prime, deleting waters from het groups and generating het states using EpikPh 7 to ±2. The optimization of protein HBs was done through renovation by the overlying and minimizing hydrogen using OPLS3e force field (Madhavi Sastry et al.,
