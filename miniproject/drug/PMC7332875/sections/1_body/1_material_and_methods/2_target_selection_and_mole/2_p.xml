<p>Our objective was to design an inhibitor against RNA binding domain (RBD) of structural N protein of SARS-CoV-2. The three dimensional structure of N protein 6VYO of SARS-CoV-2 was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.rcsb.org/</ext-link>) for RBD. The resolution of the selected target protein structure is 1.70 Å and the structure was identified by the X-ray diffraction method. It was selected because of its high resolution value and the latest structure of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 during the study.
