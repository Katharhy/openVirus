<p>Docking study of selected ligands (8722 antiviral drugs, 265 FDA approved drugs for infectious diseases) for high throughput virtual screening (HTVS) against a target protein (PDB ID: 6YVO) was done. The HTVS with flexible docking was performed on Schrodinger’s ligand docking module between ligands and active Site 3 of target protein (6YVO). After HTVS, standard precision (SP) using ligand-docking process filtered out 500 ligands from Asinex database and 200 ligands from PubChem database. Out of those, 100 ligands from each library were selected which had best configuration with highest docking score of virtual screening following extra precision (XP) with flexible docking (Friesner et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Halgren et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). These 100 ligands from each library were docked with Site 1 and Site 2 as well. Finally, the top 10 ligands from both libraries (Lib A and Lib B) were selected which were common against all the three sites for further analysis (
