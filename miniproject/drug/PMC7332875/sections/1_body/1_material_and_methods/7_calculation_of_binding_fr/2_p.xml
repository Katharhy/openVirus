<p>The ligands and receptor complexes were analyzed for their binding free energies by prime MM-GBSA (Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area) module of Schrodinger suite with the OPLS3e force field (Genheden &amp; Ryde, 2015). The prime MM-GBSA approach is used to calculate Î”
 <italic>G</italic> bind of each ligand which is based on the docking complex interactions. However, the prioritization of lead compound was based on rescoring function of MM-GBSA approach and its binding free energies. These calculations along with docking scores were considered to optimize seven final identified ligand molecules.
