<p>TLR3 is the receptor for double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Although IAV does not produce dsRNA during replication [

 <xref rid="B64-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], TLR3 activation can occur during influenza infection [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. However, the specific TLR3 ligand that is produced during IAV infection has not yet been determined. The resulting TLR3 signaling process induces production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I IFN via Toll/IL-1 receptor-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF)-mediated activation of IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) [

Previous research has shown that TLR3 signaling promotes the production of proinflammatory cytokines in the bronchoalveolar airspace and contributes to viral pathology during H3N2 infection, and viral burden is increased in the lungs of TLR3 knockout mice [
 <xref rid="B67-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. However, TLR3 signaling does not seem important for adaptive immune responses against influenza, because T and B cell responses are unaffected by TLR3 deficiency [
