<p>Naïve CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cells recognize the viral antigens presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II proteins on antigen-presenting cells, and subsequently differentiate into several types of helper T cells depending on the cytokine milieu. Activated CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells support the activation and differentiation of antibody-producing B cells and also promote CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells responses. CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses peak at 10 days after influenza infection in the mouse lung [
 <xref rid="B145-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. Adaptive transfer of effector CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from mice infected with influenza lead to increased survival of recipient mice after influenza challenge [
 <xref rid="B145-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. The cytokine milieu generated during influenza virus infection is polarized to support the generation of Th1 cells [
 <xref rid="B146-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Th1 cells produce IFN-γ, IL-2, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). These cytokines activate macrophages, promote B cells to produce IgG2a and IgG3 isotype antibodies [
 <xref rid="B147-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>], and mediate cellular immune responses. Th2 responses are also induced following influenza virus infection. Th2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and promote isotype switching in B cells to produce other isotypes of antibodies such as IgG1 and IgE [
 <xref rid="B146-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. However, Th1 cells are more closely associated with survival after influenza virus infection compared with Th2 cells [
 <xref rid="B148-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. Some CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell populations in influenza-infected mice show evidence of perforin/granzyme-mediated cytolytic activity [
 <xref rid="B146-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>,
 <xref rid="B149-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>,
 <xref rid="B150-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. In addition, IAV infection leads to robust regulatory T cells (Tregs) that mediate immunosuppression and tissue repair via IL-10 and amphiregulin [
 <xref rid="B151-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>,
 <xref rid="B152-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>], among other effector molecules. Notably, Treg depletion results in a reduction of the influenza-specific follicular helper T cell response [
 <xref rid="B153-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. These results indicate that Tregs play an important role in host protection during and after infection with the influenza virus.
