<p>During influenza virus infections, innate signaling and adaptive immune responses both play important roles in protecting against the virus and achieving viral clearance. At the site of infection, infected cells produce chemokines and cytokines such as type I IFNs, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, CCL2 (MCP-1), RANTES, and MIP-1α that recruit immune cells including NK cells, neutrophils, macrophages and DCs to the site of infection where they initiate the innate immune response [
