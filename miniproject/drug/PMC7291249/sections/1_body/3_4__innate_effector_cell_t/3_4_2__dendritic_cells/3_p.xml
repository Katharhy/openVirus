<p>Most studies determining the role of DCs in influenza virus infection have focused on the cDC1 subset. CD103
 <sup>+</sup> cDC1s are well known as specialized cells that initiate CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell activation via MHC class I-mediated cross-presentation of antigens. Lung-migratory cDC1s migrate into the mLNs to prime CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, and this process reaches its peak within 48–72 h after influenza virus infection [
 <xref rid="B130-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. There have been several reports that have suggested that CD103
 <sup>+</sup> cDC1 is the dominant population for activation of effective CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses against the influenza virus [
 <xref rid="B121-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>,
 <xref rid="B127-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>,
 <xref rid="B131-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>,
 <xref rid="B132-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. For example, Batf3
 <sup>−/</sup>
 <sup>−</sup> mice, which lack cDC1s [
 <xref rid="B133-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>], cannot mount efficient anti-influenza virus CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses [
 <xref rid="B127-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>,
 <xref rid="B128-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. Further to this, DT-treated Clec9A-DTR mice, which have been modified to express DTR in C-type lectin receptor-expressing cells such as cDC1, are highly susceptible to influenza virus infection after treatment with DT [
 <xref rid="B129-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. These cDC1-depleted mice were unable to recover from weight loss and had severe pulmonary inflammation and lung damage. In addition to reductions in effector CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell function, the development of effective memory CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses was severely impaired after cDC1 depletion. Indeed, cDC1s are involved in CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell exit from the lymph node and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell survival. Taken together, cDC1s play a crucial role in enabling protective CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses. Surprisingly, there is evidence supporting the capability of cDC1s to induce CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses to IAV. In an in vitro T cell proliferation assay, cDC1s had superior CD4 and CD8 T cell expansion efficacy relative to pDCs and double-negative (CD8
 <sup>-</sup> CD205
 <sup>-</sup>) DCs [
 <xref rid="B132-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. Furthermore, both human CD141
 <sup>+</sup> cDC1 and CD1c
 <sup>+</sup> cDC2 elicited CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation and Th1 responses after stimulation with live-attenuated influenza virus [
 <xref rid="B134-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>], indicating that cDC1 can be responsible for both MHC class I- and class II-mediated antigen presentation.
