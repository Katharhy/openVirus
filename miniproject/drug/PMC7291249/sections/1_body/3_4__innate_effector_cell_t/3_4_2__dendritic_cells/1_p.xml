<p>DCs, which belong to the innate immune response system, are known as professional antigen-presenting cells. Because T cells only recognize foreign antigens that are associated with MHC molecules, DCs play a critical role in the priming and activation of na√Øve T cells. The specialized antigen-presenting function of DCs allows them to serve as the link between innate and adaptive immunity (

 <sup>+</sup> cells [

CD11c-DTR mice have been used to study the function of DCs in vivo. Following influenza virus infection, DT-treated mice experience significantly more severe weight loss than controls with intact DCs [

 <sup>+</sup> T cell populations are significantly decreased in the lung, and viral clearance is impaired, suggesting that CD11c
 <sup>+</sup> DCs are responsible for the activation of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and T cell-mediated viral clearance during influenza virus infection.
