<p>Although the role of MoDCs during influenza virus infection has not been well established, it has been reported that the number of CCR2-expressing MoDCs are increased in influenza virus-infected lungs [
 <xref rid="B124-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. These cells induce the robust production of nitric oxide synthase 2, and deficiency in CCR2 leads to attenuation in weight loss, pulmonary pathology, and mortality after a lethal dose of the influenza virus. While the specific mechanisms remain unknown, these results indicate that MoDCs are associated with influenza virus-induced pulmonary pathology. On the other hand, other work has suggested a protective role for MoDCs during secondary influenza virus infection [
 <xref rid="B142-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. Researchers found that MoDC-deficient CCR2
 <sup>−/</sup>
 <sup>−</sup> mice displayed an impairment of antigen-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell formation following primary influenza challenge, and lack of MoDCs during primary influenza infection reduced host resistance to secondary virus infection, suggesting that MoDCs could be considered as putative targets of influenza vaccine.
