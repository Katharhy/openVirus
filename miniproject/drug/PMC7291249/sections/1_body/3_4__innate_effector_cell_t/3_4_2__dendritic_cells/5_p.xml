<p>pDCs, which are primarily known as producers of type I IFNs [
 <xref rid="B138-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>], seem to play a minor role in the defense against influenza virus infection. Despite the accumulation of pDCs in the lung following influenza virus infection, pDC-depleted mice showed identical survival rate and body weight loss compared to healthy controls [
 <xref rid="B121-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>,
 <xref rid="B139-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. Further to this, depletion of pDCs using the 120G8 antibody did not affect body weight loss, effector CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses, or viral clearance after influenza virus infection in mice [
 <xref rid="B121-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Consistently, both wild-type and pDC-deficient Ikaros
 <sup>L/L</sup> mice showed comparable weight loss, viral burden in lung, influenza virus-specific antibody production, and lung pathology following viral infection [
 <xref rid="B139-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. However, there is some evidence that pDCs may cross-present influenza virus antigens to CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells [
