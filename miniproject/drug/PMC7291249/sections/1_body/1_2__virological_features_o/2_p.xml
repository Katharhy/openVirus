<p>Influenza A and B viruses are the most common causes of seasonal flu epidemics in humans [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Influenza B virus (IBV), which generally circulates later in the season, is responsible for 15–30% of total influenza infections [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. While the disease severity due to both types is comparable [

 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], IBV does not cause pandemics. In contrast, strains of influenza A virus (IAV) are often responsible for seasonal influenza epidemics and pandemic outbreaks due to frequent genetic mutations and inter-subtype reassortment [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The IAV virion is covered by a lipid-protein envelope containing the transmembrane proteins hemagglutinin (HA), NA, and M2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00504-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The genome of IAV consists of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA that is split into eight segments encoding a total of 11 viral proteins: HA, NA, M1, M2, NP, non-structural protein 1 (NS1), non-structural protein 2 (NS2), PA, polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), and polymerase basic protein 1-F2 (PB1-F2). Each segment forms a vRNP complex that is comprised of viral RNA and NP, which then combines with the RNA polymerase PB1-PB2-PA complex. The M1 protein, which exists only on the inside of the viral envelope, interacts with vRNPs [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The viral envelope of IAV consists of a lipid bilayer with viral transmembrane proteins called HA, NA and M2. HA recognizes the sialic acid (SIA) receptors expressed on the surface of host cells in the respiratory tract and is responsible for viral attachment and entry. M2 is a proton-selective ion channel that is activated by the drop in pH that occurs after virion endocytosis and endosomal acidification. It mediates the acidification of the viral core via the introduction of protons and results in the release of vRNP into the host cell’s cytoplasm. NA is essential for the spread of newly synthesized viruses from host cells. It cleaves the SIA residues of glycoproteins to allow viral release and to prevent aggregation of individual virions [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. At present, 18 subtypes of HA and 11 subtypes of NA have been documented [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and IAVs are divided into subtypes based on the combination of HA and NA. Antigenic drift and antigenic shift, the primary mechanisms behind the antigenic variation of the influenza virus, occur in both HA and NA. The accumulation of random mutations (antigenic drift) in HA and NA, and new combinations of sequences from two or more flu strains (antigenic shift) can generate novel viruses that are different from pre-existing subtypes, and are capable of bypassing pre-existing adaptive immunity, to cause influenza pandemics [
