<p>To achieve successful infection, the influenza virus must first pass through the respiratory mucus layer that forms a primary physical barrier. Mucus in the respiratory tract contains sialylated glycoproteins. Previous research has demonstrated that sialylated decoy receptors expressed in the airway mucus protect the underlying cells from infection by inhibiting viral entry [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, the influenza virus cleaves sialylated mucins using NA, which disables the inhibitory functions of the mucus, thus allowing penetration into the mucus layer. Next, virions bind to the SIA-containing receptor using HA and enter the host cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis. However, SIA-independent influenza infection has also been reported [

 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. C-type lectin receptors are thought to act as alternative receptors that allow infectious entry of the influenza virus in a manner independent of SIA. The macrophage’s galactose-type lectin and mannose receptors play important roles in influenza infection [

 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. DC-SIGN (DC209) and L-SIGN (CD209L) have been identified as influenza attachment receptors [

 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and the blocking of DC-SIGN decreases the rate at which the virus infects dendritic cells (DCs) isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These results suggest that C-type lectin receptors can act as specific receptors for IAV infection. M2 proton channels mediate endosomal acidification, resulting in the fusion of viral and endosomal membranes and the release of vRNPs into the cytosol [

 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Released vRNPs are then translocated into the host nucleus via nuclear pore complexes, where they transcribe and replicate viral RNA (vRNA). RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) is responsible for both transcription and replication of the viral RNA genome. The influenza RdRP protein consists of three subunits: PB1, PB2, and PA. Specifically, a “cap-snatching” mechanism is required for the transcription of viral mRNA. PB2 recognizes the 5′ cap of host pre-mRNA, and PA cleaves host mRNA to generate 5′-capped RNA fragments that are then used as primers to initiate viral mRNA transcription [

 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. PB1 carries out viral mRNA synthesis using these short fragments [

 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In contrast, vRNA replication, which occurs through a complementary RNA intermediate, is primer-independent [

 <xref rid="B46-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. NS1 plays an important role in the inhibition of host antiviral immune responses. Previous studies have shown that NS1 suppresses the expression of host mRNAs that enable interferon (IFN)-induced antiviral phenotypes [

 <xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Further, NS1 restricts nucleocytoplasmic export of host mRNA by targeting nuclear RNA export factor 1–nuclear transport factor 2-related export protein 1 [
