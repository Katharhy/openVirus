<p>Therapeutics targeting various stages of the influenza virusâ€™ replication cycle have been developed. There are three classes of FDA-approved anti-influenza drugs: M2 inhibitors (Amantadine, Rimantadine), NA inhibitors (Oseltamivir, Peramivir, Zanamivir), and a cap-snatching inhibitor (Baloxavir marboxil). M2 inhibitors block the release of vRNPs into the cytosol. However, most circulating viruses are now resistant to the existing M2 blockers, and they are no longer recommended for treatment or prophylaxis of influenza. NA inhibitors prevent virions from budding from host cells, and the cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor targets influenza polymerase to prevent viral replication. While these drugs are currently effective, constant changes in the viral genome cause drug resistance and reduce therapeutic efficacy (
