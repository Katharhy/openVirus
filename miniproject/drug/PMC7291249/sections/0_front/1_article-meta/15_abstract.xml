 <p>Influenza viruses cause infectious respiratory disease characterized by fever, myalgia, and congestion, ranging in severity from mild to life-threating. Although enormous efforts have aimed to prevent and treat influenza infections, seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks remain a major public health concern. This is largely because influenza viruses rapidly undergo genetic mutations that restrict the long-lasting efficacy of vaccine-induced immune responses and therapeutic regimens. In this review, we discuss the virological features of influenza A viruses and provide an overview of current knowledge of the innate sensing of invading influenza viruses and the protective immune responses in the host.</p>
