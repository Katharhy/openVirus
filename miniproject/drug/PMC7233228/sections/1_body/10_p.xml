<p id="p0060">The lower incidence of symptomatic and severely symptomatic COVID-19 in children compared to adults seems counterintuitive and is puzzling. There has been speculation that it could be due to childrenâ€™s younger immune systems and/or to a lower expression of ACE2 receptor cells [

Thus, essentially all adults already have immunity. Parenthetically, systemic viral diseases with a respiratory component, such as measles and varicella, are also often more severe in non-immune adults than in children. The three recent severe coronavirus epidemic diseases (SARS, MERS, and COVID-19) are new viruses to the human race, and they may derive at least some of their age-related severity from the fact that they are new.
