<p>Three patients with atopic dermatitis treated with azathioprine developed multiple verrucae and 
 <italic>molluscum contagiosum</italic>. Due to treatment resistance, azathioprine was switched to leflunomide (100 mg loading 3 days, then 20 mg/day). All the lesions subsided in three patients within 2 months of leflunomide treatment.
