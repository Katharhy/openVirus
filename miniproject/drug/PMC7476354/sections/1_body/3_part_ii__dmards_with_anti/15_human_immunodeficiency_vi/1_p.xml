 <italic>In vivo</italic>, macaque monkeys treated with minocycline showed less destruction of axons and less replication of viruses in the central nervous system. The experiment suggested that the antiviral effect of minocycline was through reducing the activation of monocytes and hence, viral replication was blocked.
