 </sup> Another HIV patient with HSV-1/HSV-2 pseudo-tumors on the perineum and scrotum only slightly improved with valacyclovir, foscarnet, and imiquimod. After 9 months of leflunomide, complete regression of the lesions was noted. Leflunomide has both immunomodulation and antiviral activities in the HSV pseudotumors because pseudotumor formation is an immune reconstruction phenomenon in HIV patients.
