<p>BK polyomavirus is widespread (80% of the population has the latent form), and often causes mild diseases except in immunocompromised patients, especially kidney-transplant recipients. The virus disseminates to the urinary-tract system and lives there persistently. A sudden increase of BK-virus-associated nephropathy is related to the administration of potent immunosuppressants such as MMF and tacrolimus. Leflunomide is now generally accepted as a second choice after reduction of immunosuppressive agents. However, in a phase II RCT (
