 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies demonstrated the antiviral modes of hydroxyurea. First, hydroxyurea depletes deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools, which impedes DNA synthesis and in turn slows down the production of viral DNA. Second, hydroxyurea enhances NRTI phosphorylation and reduces resistance to NRTIs. This may partially explain the benefits of adding hydroxyurea to NRTI for viral control. Finally, cytotoxic effect of hydroxyurea makes cellular division of CD4+ T cells decline. This enables hydroxyurea to block HIV proliferation, because HIV could only replicate in dividing CD4+ T cells.
