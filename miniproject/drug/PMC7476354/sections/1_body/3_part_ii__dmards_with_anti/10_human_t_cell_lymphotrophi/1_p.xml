<p>HTLV-1, a retrovirus, has been linked to diseases such as adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATLL), HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM), and uveitis. 
 <italic>Ex vivo</italic> and animal studies revealed positive results of tofacitinib for ATLL and HAM.

 </sup> HTLV-1-encoded tax protein activates IL-2, -9, -15, which further trigger JAK3-STAT5 pathway. Accumulating data demonstrated a major role of JAK3 in the pathophysiology of ATLL.

 </sup> As a result, tofacitinib targeting JAK3 has been suggested as a therapeutic strategy in future studies.
