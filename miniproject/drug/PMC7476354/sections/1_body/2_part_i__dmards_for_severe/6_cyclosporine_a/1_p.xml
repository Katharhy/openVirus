<p>Cyclosporine A (CsA) is indicated for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, organ transplants to prevent injection, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca. It is also used in severe atopic dermatitis, chronic urticaria, pyoderma gangrenosum Kimura disease, acute systemic mastocytosis, and ulcerative colitis. CsA inhibits lymphocyte function, mainly T cells, by forming a complex with cyclophilin. Cyclophilinâ€“CsA complex binds on the calcineurin, which blocks the dephosphorylation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT). This interferes with entry of NF-AT into the T-cell nucleus and further suppresses cytokine production such as IL-2.</p>
