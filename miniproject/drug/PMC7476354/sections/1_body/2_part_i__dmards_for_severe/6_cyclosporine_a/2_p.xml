 <bold>Proposed antiviral mechanisms:</bold> Betacoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, replicate in cytosol, where RIG-1 like receptor (RLR) helicases bind on virus RNA and activate mitochondrial antiviral proteins (MAVs). MAVs then promote the production of IFNs and cytokines to defend against viral infections. Thus, mitochondria appear to play a vital role for protection; in other words, mitochondrial failure could lead to severe COVID-19. Experimentally, CsA targets cyclophilin D to inhibit mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening and rescues mitochondria from apoptosis.
