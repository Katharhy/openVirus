 </bold> MMF showed low EC50 (0.47 μmol/l) in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells, while the EC50 of remdesivir, as a positive control, was 0.77 μmol/l. Besides, MMF probably inhibited SARS-CoV-2 through IMPDH and especially dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). DHODH is another essential enzyme for pyrimidine synthesis, and MMF might control viral infection by depleting the intracellular pyrimidine pools.
