<p>Mycophenolic acid (MPA), an active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), an essential enzyme in the 
 <italic>de novo</italic> purine synthesis pathway. IMPDH inhibition especially influences T and B lymphocytes because they use almost a 
 <italic>de novo</italic> pathway to synthesize (minimally use a salvage pathway). MMF and MPA are utilized in organ transplantation, Crohn’s disease, and as steroid-sparing agents for conditions such as pemphigus, Behçet’s disease, and lupus erythematosus. Although they were associated with higher risk of opportunistic infections including herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and BK virus (BKV) nephropathy, literature also revealed its possible benefit for HIV and influenza virus.
