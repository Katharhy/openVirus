 <bold>Case report:</bold> A 45-year-old woman with critical symptoms of COVID-19 was treated by thalidomide 100 mg every 24 h. After the first day use of thalidomide, clinical conditions including oxygen index improved. Cytokines such as IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ all decreased to normal range.

 </sup> Proposed mechanisms are as follows: thalidomide inhibits NF-κB, which further suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and IL-8, and prevents the cytokine surge. It also regulates immune function by activating T cells and T-cell receptors. Moreover, the sedative and antiemetic property of thalidomide helps anxious patients calm down, which reduces oxygen consumption.
