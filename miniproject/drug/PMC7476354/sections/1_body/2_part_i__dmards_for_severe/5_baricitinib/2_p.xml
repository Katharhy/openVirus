<p>SARS-CoV-2 binds on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and enters lung cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Some of the numb-associated kinase (NAK) family members, AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) and cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK), are hypothesized to regulate the ACE2-mediated endocytosis. Baricitinib demonstrated high affinity to AAK1 and GAK and was identified as a potential treatment for COVID-19 by artificial intelligence. Intriguingly, other JAK inhibitors such as tofacitinib and upadacitinib did not illustrate affinities to NAKs.
