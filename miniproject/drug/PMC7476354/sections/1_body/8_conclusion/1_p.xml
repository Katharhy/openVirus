<p>The treatment of immune-based diseases has been revolutionized by the introduction of target therapy, mainly biologics. Compared with biologics, conventional synthetic DMARDs exert broad-spectrum functionality. DMARDs work through immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects with the possibility of higher infection risk. However, many none-biologic DMARDs demonstrate antiviral activities instead. Although in most instances, the antiviral activity of DMARDs is based on

Also, the combinational use of antiviral drugs and DMARDs has been shown to be more effective and less resistant in the control of some viral infections. Furthermore, in the face of novel viral infection, such as SARS-CoV-2, screening of existing chemicals, including DMARDs, may prove to be fruitful.
