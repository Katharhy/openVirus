<p>To date (10 May 2020), over 4 million laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide with more than ~279,000 deaths in 187 countries [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In most countries, increases in the number of confirmed cases are following an exponential growth trajectory during the early and peak stages of the outbreak. At present, the global case fatality rate of COVID-19 laboratory confirmed cases is ~6.9% ranging from ~0.1% in Singapore to ~16.3% in Belgium [

Whilst it is difficult to compare case fatality rates between countries when they are at different stages of the outbreak, variations are most likely due to the scope of population testing, the age structure, and health status of the population, and the health systems within each country. Clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 patients from China [

 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] have recently been reported with fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath being the most common clinical presentations. Although the outbreak is evolving, the global data suggest that the number of cases doubled every four days, with ~20% of confirmed COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization (median hospital stay of 12 days), and 25% of hospitalized patients (~5% of all cases) needing intensive critical care [

 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The severity and outcome of the disease seem to be highly correlated with the age of onset where more severe forms of COVID-19 were observed for adults ≥ 55 years [

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Additionally, an age-dependent fatality rate has been demonstrated with the lowest risk observed among those under the age of 19 (0–0.1%) and 20–54 years (0.1–0.8%); however, the risk of mortality increases incrementally, affecting 1.4–4.9% in the 55–74-year age group, 4.3–10.5% among those aged 75–84 years, with the highest fatality rate of 10.4–27.3% in those aged ≥85 years [

 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Individuals with underlying health issues such as cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, liver, and kidney disease, malignant tumors, or a suppressed immune system, seem to have the severe form of the disease and increased fatality rate [
