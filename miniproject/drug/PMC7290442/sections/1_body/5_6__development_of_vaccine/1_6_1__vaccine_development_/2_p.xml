<p>Among the four structured proteins of the virus, the spike protein is considered the most promising for vaccine development since: (i) it is common to different coronaviruses encountered, and (ii) it is exposed to an individualâ€™s immune system, allowing the body to make an immune response against it and remember it for future protection. Furthermore, such a vaccine can prevent infection since it would inhibit virus entry into susceptible cells. Due to previous experience with vaccine development for SARS in 2003 (against SARS-CoV), scientists have had a head start in using the S protein for vaccine development and some vaccines have entered human clinical trials, while others are on their way [
