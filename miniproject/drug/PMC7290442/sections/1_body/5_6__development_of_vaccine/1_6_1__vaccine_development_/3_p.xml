<p>So far, the first vaccine to enter into clinical trials is the mRNA-1273 vaccine (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04283461). It is a novel RNA-based vaccine which uses part of the spike protein genetic code embedded in special lipid-based nanoparticles for injection into the body [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It has been developed at lightning speed (within 45 days of publication of the first viral genome) by Moderna Therapeutics (Cambridge, MA, USA) who was already working on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccines which were adapted to SARS-CoV-2. After having shown potential in animal testing, the first phase I clinical trial of this vaccine started on 16 March 2020 in collaboration with the NIH on 45 healthy individuals between the ages of 18–55 years [

However, in addition to the novelty of this vaccine, even if the clinical trials are successful, it will be quite some time before it can be available to the population due to pipeline, capacity building, and regulatory issues. Several other mRNA-based vaccines (e.g., by CureVac (Tübingen, Germany), BNT162 by BioNTech (Mainz, Germany) and Pfizer (New York, NY, USA)) are in different stages of development. For instance, the BioNTech mRNA vaccine (Mainz, Germany) encapsulates the nucleic acid in special 80 nm ionizable, glycol-lipid nanoparticles and clinical testing is expected commence shortly [
