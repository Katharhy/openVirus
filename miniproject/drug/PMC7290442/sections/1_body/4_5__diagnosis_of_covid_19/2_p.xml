<p>To detect newer mutated viruses, it is essential to apply next generation sequencing to identify the viral genome with specific mutations. Currently, “sequencing by synthesis” technique (by Illumina Inc. San Diego, CA, USA) and “long read sequencing” (by Oxford Nanopore Technology, Oxford, UK) are being used to identify viral genomes at single-base resolution levels [

 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Although nanopore sequencing technology has a higher error rate, this flaw can be complemented with the use of other sequencing techniques, such as sequencing by synthesis. However, nanopore sequencing technology might have an advantage over other sequencing platforms due to its small and compact size, allowing flexibility of conducting RNA sequencing in the field in remote locations that lack full-fledged accredited reference laboratories.
