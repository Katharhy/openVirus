   <bold>a</bold>) Illustration of the full-length genome of SARS-CoV-2 showing the location of open reading frames 1a and 1b encoding the Non-structural proteins, Nsp (blue), structural proteins (brown), and accessory factors (green). The numbers on top refer to the genomic RNA; (
   <bold>b</bold>) schematic representation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus particle and its interaction with its host cellular receptor, ACE2. The infection pathway is shown where after docking of the virus particle on cell surface, the TMPRRSS2 cellular protease activates the viral protein S allowing entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. The protein coded by the viral genes and some of the notable interactions (dashed line) with other host proteins are shown that can potentially be targeted by drugs (blue circles).
