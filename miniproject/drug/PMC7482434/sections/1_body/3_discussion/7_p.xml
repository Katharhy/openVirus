<p id="para320">Our model predictions are inherently limited by the available data to inform them. Although data on HIV and effects of programmes implementing interventions are available, some key uncertainties exist. One of these uncertainties is the magnitude of the effect of interruption of ART on death rates. Other uncertainties that might also be important include that we did not model any interaction between HIV and COVID-19â€”eg, that people with HIV were not assumed to be more or less likely to acquire or die from COVID-19, although any excess COVID-19 risk is likely to be small in absolute terms compared with risk of death directly due to HIV. We also note that several models address excess mortality due to disruption of services for HIV and tuberculosis, malaria, and other communicable diseases

 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and all of these models point to similar levels of excess death and we recognise that overlaps can exist in people counted as having died separately of tuberculosis and HIV. However, taken together, our models highlight the real risk of substantially increased mortality among the most susceptible and at-risk populations in sub-Saharan Africa and could quickly erase years of public health gains if action to mitigate these effects are not swift and coordinated.
