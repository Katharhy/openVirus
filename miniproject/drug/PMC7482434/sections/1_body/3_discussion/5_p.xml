<p id="para300">Although the largest effect of disruptions to HIV programmes would occur as a result of ART interruption, effects on prevention, testing, and other aspects of treatment and care could be clinically significant. These programmes are generally highly effective and cost-effective, so any loss to their functioning will lead to adverse health consequences for many people. Some short-term changes to HIV programmes could have further long-term ramifications not represented in the 5-year timeline. For example, reductions in peer support might result in suboptimal treatment adherence and retention in care. Health-care provisions of all types, for HIV and other diseases and conditions, should be prioritised for maintenance, with modifications if needed, in so far as can be safely attained during the period of threat from COVID-19. Multi-month dispensing for PrEP and ART users and extra emergency provision of supplies are probably required to safely provide existing levels of health care at the same time as responding to COVID-19.</p>
