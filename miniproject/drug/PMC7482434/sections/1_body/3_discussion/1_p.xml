<p id="para260">A 6-month interruption in ART supplies for 50% of people would be expected to lead to an approximately 1·63 times (range 1·39–1·87) increase in HIV-related deaths over 1 year. In sub-Saharan Africa, this increase amounts to a median of 296 000 (range 229 023–420 000) excess HIV deaths over this period. This substantial number of excess deaths can be explained by the fact that CD4 lymphocyte cell count recovery, which takes years to achieve on ART, is rapidly lost after viral replication resumes in the absence of ART.</p>
