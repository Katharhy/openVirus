<p id="para290">While some uncertainty exists around the magnitude of the effect that programme disruptions would have on the HIV epidemic, which is reflected in the range of predictions across the models, interruption of ART is generally agreed to be the greatest threat to HIV mortality and incidence. The differences across models in predicted consequences of ART interruption result largely from differences in how interruptions are modelled, and the consequent death rate assumed. Two of the models (Optima HIV and HIV Synthesis) directly consider the CD4 cell count decrease after interruption. The Goals model assumes an immediate return to the pre-ART death rate after interruption, and the Imperial College London model calculates the death rate on the basis of the mean time to progress to AIDS in the absence of ART. Although data are available on changes in CD4 cell count after interruption,

 </xref> little direct data exist on death rates because no large scale studies of effects of complete interruption of ART for substantial periods have been done in which people have been observed longitudinally after interruption of ART because of the known harmful effects of stopping ART. All the models predict that ART interruption, in the absence of changes in sexual behaviour, will lead to increases in HIV incidence. The EMOD model predicts that this increase would be particularly large, perhaps due to transmission during acute HIV infection causing a synchronous wave of secondary spread, which might be more pronounced in a network model.
