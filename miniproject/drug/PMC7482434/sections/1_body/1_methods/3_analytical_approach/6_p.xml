<p id="para190">The Imperial College London Model assumes that no new VMMCs occur during the disruption period, and that when the disruption ceases, circumcisions resume at the pre-disruption rate. For interruption of condom availability, condom use is assumed to be reduced by 50% for the duration of the disruption. ART initiation is assumed to be suspended such that no new individuals are initiated on ART for the duration of the disruption period and scale-up continues at pre-disruption rates after the disruption period ends, such that those who would have been initiated on ART during this period are allowed to start but might have progressed to a later stage of infection before starting. Viral load testing, enhanced adherence counselling, and switches are assumed to stop, and an additional 10% of individuals on ART are assumed to have an unsuppressed viral load. The death rate among people with AIDS-defining illnesses is assumed to increase due to overstretched health systems, such that the death rate for those with AIDS doubles for the duration of the disruption. A break in the supply of ART drugs, leading to ART interruption, is assumed to happen for 100% of individuals on ART, hence they stop using ART for the duration of the disruption period and are then re-initiated. If an individual has progressed to AIDS during this interruption, ART re-initiation is assumed to be too late for them to recover. Reduction in sexual contacts is assumed such that all sexual contacts across all risk groups decrease by 10% for the duration of the disruption period, and then return to pre-disruption levels immediately after the disruption period.</p>
