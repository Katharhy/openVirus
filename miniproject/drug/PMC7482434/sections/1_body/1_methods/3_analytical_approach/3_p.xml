<p id="para160">In the Optima HIV model, new VMMCs were assumed to stop over the disruption period. Change in sexual behaviour was represented by a 50% reduction in casual and commercial sexual contacts for applicable risk groups for the duration of the disruption, which return to pre-disruption levels immediately after the disruption period ends. Average values include results for 12 countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Botswana, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, eSwatini, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe). Regional values are sums of country values located in the given region. The mortality rate for those on ART whose treatment is suspended was applied on the basis of data from Grund and colleagues.

 </xref> As a result, CD4 cell counts decrease rapidly and then gradually return to pre-ART levels after interruption ends. Once ART is resumed, the mortality rate for those on ART by CD4 cell count was applied. The impact on ART drug resistance as a result of disruption of HIV treatment and additional COVID-19-related deaths among people living with HIV were not included.
