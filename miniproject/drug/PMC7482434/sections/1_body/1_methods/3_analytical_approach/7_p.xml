<p id="para200">In the EMOD model, the scenario of VMMC interruption was assumed to apply only to in-clinic circumcisions provided by HIV prevention programmes; traditional male circumcision was assumed to continue at the pre-disruption rate. A disruption in condom availability was assumed to increase per-coital-act transmission probabilities, and after the disruption period transmission probabilities were assumed to return to their pre-disruption rates. A proportion of individuals who would have tested or initiated ART during the disruption period are unable to do so but might re-attempt testing and ART initiation after the disruption period ends at rates equivalent to pre-disruption rates among ART-naive individuals. Disruption of viral load testing, enhanced adherence counselling, and switches are assumed to increase the proportion of individuals with unsuppressed viral load during the disruption period.

 </xref> A break in supply of ART drugs leading to ART interruption is assumed to interrupt a proportion of ART use during the disruption period and resume ART use for those who survived the interruption to their ART or attempted to initiate ART during the disruption period. Survival during and after the disruption period depends on CD4 cell count and age, with older adults having more rapid decreases in CD4 cell count and increased risk of mortality. Viral load suppression after ART initiation, including re-initiation after a treatment interruption, is assumed to take an average of 3 months and up to 6 months. For scenarios with reduction in risky sexual behaviour during the service disruption period, we assumed a 50% reduction in risky sexual behaviour for commercial, informal, and transitory sexual contacts.
