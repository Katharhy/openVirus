<p id="para170">We used the HIV Synthesis model to generate a range of setting scenarios (n=300), with an aim to collectively represent the diversity of HIV epidemic and programme characteristics across and within countries in sub-Saharan Africa (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 11–12</xref>). For the effect of ART interruption, to generate country-specific estimates, we considered the association between the proportion of people with HIV who have viral suppression at the start of 2020 and the relative increase in death rate across setting scenarios. For this model, we present data for adult mortality only. Suspension of PMTCT services is not considered separately from interruption of all ART, which affects MTCT. We implemented the increase in the death rate among people with AIDS-defining illnesses due to overstretched health systems as a doubling in the death rate during the 3-month period in which an AIDS-defining illness occurs. Estimates of disruption of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) programmes are in the context of only 0·2% of women aged 15–25 years overall being on PrEP in the model. The assumptions in the model on changes in CD4 cell count during ART interruption result in a mortality rate of 1·7% in the first 3-month period of interruption due to disruption of ART availability and 5·0% during the second 3-month period. This model included effects of co-trimoxazole use for prevention of opportunistic infections, in addition to antiretroviral drugs. We also present the age breakdown of HIV deaths from this model.
