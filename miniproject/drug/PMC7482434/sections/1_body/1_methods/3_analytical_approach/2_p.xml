<p id="para150">A summary of key aspects of each model is shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. Additional details on the approach we took for this analysis by each model are as follows. In the Goals model, coverage of all interventions except voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) were assumed to remain at 2019 levels, and VMMC coverage to increase according to current trends in recent years. Interruption of condom availability is modelled like all other behaviour change interventions, being suspended for the 3-month or 6-month periods, including community mobilisation, condom promotion, school-based programmes, and outreach services to key populations. The result is an increase in the number of sexual partners and a reduction in condom use. Modelling a reduction in sexual activity, as in the sensitivity analysis (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 6</xref>), means that during the disruption period no casual or commercial sex occurs between heterosexual individuals or men who have sex with men (MSM). For suspension of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), the disruption means no mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) prophylaxis services are offered during the disruption period.
