<p id="para140">All models simulate disruptions that last for 3 or 6 months starting from April 1, 2020, with 20%, 50%, or 100% of people who would otherwise benefit from a given service being affected, with our primary focus being on the 50% scenario. The potential disruptions to services are broadly grouped as prevention programmes, HIV testing, and treatment and care (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). At the end of the disruption period, service use is assumed to return to levels during the pre-disruption period. We considered the impacts on HIV mortality and incidence over 1-year and 5-year periods (

 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 4–5</xref>). We express results as the relative change in HIV deaths over the period of interest due to service disruption relative to the predicted annual number of such deaths in the relevant time period if no COVID-19 disruption or epidemic occurred. We used similar methods to describe the relative change in incidence of new HIV infections. We also considered the possibility that sexual activity will be decreased during the disruption period due to physical distancing measures (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 2–7</xref>). Using the results on the relative change in mortality due to interruption of ART, we calculated the predicted excess number of HIV deaths over 1 year in various example countries and sub-Saharan Africa as a whole.
