<p id="para120">The features of each model are summarised in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. Each model is based on information provided by a wide array of previous studies, as has been described previously.
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Importantly, the models make assumptions relating to effects of ART interruption that account for the fact that immune recovery during ART tends to be lost quite rapidly after interruption of treatment. These assumptions are based on, for example, empirical observations
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> that showed a median loss of 187 CD4 cells per μL after ART interruption and 25% of people have a loss of more than 317 cells per μL in 2 months.
