   <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
  </p>
  <p id="para50">The COVID-19 pandemic could lead to disruptions to provision of services for people with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, but the relative consequences for HIV mortality and incidence of disruptions of different activities is not widely appreciated, and neither is the potential absolute magnitude of impact. We searched Web of Science on April 24, 2020, with no date or language restrictions, using the terms (COVID* AND model* AND HIV* AND Africa) and found no studies that predict the effects of disruption due to COVID-19 on HIV outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

   <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
  </p>
  <p id="para70">Our study provides a robust assessment of the potential effects of HIV service disruptions in sub-Saharan Africa resulting from COVID-19 and informs those organising programmes of the area of greatest priority, which is to maintain the supply of antiretroviral drugs for people with HIV. The consistency of the main findings across multiple models adds weight to the findings.</p>
  <p id="para80">
   <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
  </p>
  <p id="para90">During the COVID-19 pandemic, the primary priorities for governments, donors, suppliers, and communities to avoid additional HIV-related deaths and HIV incidence should be to maintain constant supply of antiretroviral drugs for people living with HIV. Provision of other HIV prevention interventions should also be carefully maintained to prevent an increase in HIV incidence.</p>
