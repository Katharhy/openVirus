<p id="para100">We aimed to explore the effects of HIV service disruptions using existing mathematical models of HIV epidemiology and intervention programmes in sub-Saharan Africa. In this Article, we consider the predicted effects of temporary disruption to different individual HIV services for periods of 3 or 6 months over 1-year and 5-year periods on HIV mortality and incidence. We also considered disruptions that affect 20%, 50%, or 100% of the population. The primary analysis considered effects over 1 year of a 6-month disruption for 50% of the population.</p>
