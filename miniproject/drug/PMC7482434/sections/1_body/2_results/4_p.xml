<p id="para250">A suspension of PMTCT activities for 3 months could lead to large increases in the number of new child infections according to the Optima HIV and Goals models. For example, in the Goals model, suspension of these activities leads to relative increases in child infections of 1·81 times in Malawi, 1·41 times in Mozambique, 1·70 times in Uganda, and 1·53 times in Zimbabwe because PMTCT coverage is quite high in most countries. The HIV Synthesis model identified the impact on MTCT of interruption of ART, with 1·64 times more babies born with HIV in 1 year as a result of a 6-month disruption in 50% of people.</p>
