<p id="para230">A disruption in VMMC programmes is predicted to have only a very small effect on HIV incidence (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). Disruption to outreach and condom programmes for 50% of people could lead to increases in the number of new infections of up to 1·19 times over 1 year. If reductions in sex with non-regular partners also occurred as a result of physical distancing, then the net effect could be a reduction in new infections (

 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 4–5</xref>). PrEP programmes are generally small in most settings, but a 6-month disruption in 50% of people is predicted to lead to a 1·005 times relative change in HIV incidence over 1 year (HIV Synthesis model; data not shown).
