<p id="para220">Results for predicted effects of disruptions on various HIV services from the five models are shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref> for 20%, 50%, and 100% of people being affected by the disruption, and predicted effects for the 50% scenario are shown in the 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure</xref>. Disruptions to care and treatment services for people living with HIV are associated with increases in mortality risk, most notably disruption to the supply of ART drugs to people already on treatment resulting in discontinuation of ART. 6 months of such interruption to 50% of people is expected to lead to a 1·63 times (median over models; with the lowest estimate predicted using the Optima HIV model [1·39] and the highest by the HIV Synthesis model [1·87]) increase in HIV-related deaths over a 1-year period compared with no disruption. Although the effect in the first year is greatest, a substantial effect was also seen up to 5 years after the start of the disruption, such that a 6-month period of ART interruption for 50% of people is predicted to lead to an increase of 1·15–1·29 times the current annual number of deaths for each of the next 5 years (

Although an interruption in the supply of ART drugs would have the largest impact of any potential disruptions, effects of poorer clinical care due to overstretched health facilities, interruptions of supply of other drugs such as co-trimoxazole, and suspension of HIV testing would all have a substantial effect on population-level mortality, with an up to a 1·06 times increase in HIV-related deaths over a 1-year period due to disruptions affecting 50% of the population compared with no disruption (
