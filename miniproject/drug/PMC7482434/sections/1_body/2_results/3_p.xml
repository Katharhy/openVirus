<p id="para240">In 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref> we compare the predicted excess number of HIV deaths across models in countries and regions of sub-Saharan Africa resulting from a 6-month interruption of ART for 20%, 50%, and 100% of people on ART. For a 50% disruption, the median number of excess deaths in sub-Saharan Africa, across models, is estimated to be 296 000 (range 229 023–420 000). The proportion of such HIV deaths that occur in people younger than 65 years is estimated to be 95% (HIV Synthesis model; data not shown).
