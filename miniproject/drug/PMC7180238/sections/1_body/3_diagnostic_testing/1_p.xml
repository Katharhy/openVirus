<p>Diagnostic testing for the SARS-CoV-2 is primarily done in public health laboratories. Delays in testing result from the need for administrative oversight of testing at the national or regional level, as well as the time needed to transport specimens and the high volume of testing needed in some regions. More rapid testing should be widely available in the event of epidemics. High-level testing facilities at regional hospitals and commercial laboratories are needed, in addition to the commercially available tests that have undergone regulatory approval. Several tests have been validated by public health authorities, including those in China, Germany, Thailand, Japan, and the United States (WHO, COVID-19, technical guidance, Feb 12, 2020). These tests are reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) tests that use primers and probes designed to detect a variety of targets in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Although these have been designed and validated, there is currently very limited information available related to the performance of these tests. The sensitivity and specificity of the tests are not widely known, and some of them might detect other related coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV. In addition, the utility of different specimen types for detection of the viruses is not known. As a result, testing of multiple specimen types is recommended by some agencies, including the CDC (
