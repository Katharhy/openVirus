<p>The CDC and WHO have both issued recommendations for laboratory safety when testing specimens from patients suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Both guidelines recommend that manipulation of potentially infectious specimens should be done in a biosafety cabinet if there is potential for splashes or generation of droplets or aerosols. Viral isolation (culture) should be done only in BL-3 laboratories. Testing in chemistry and hematology laboratories can be done following routine laboratory precautions recommended for such work.
