<p>SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were reported to originate from recombination within bat viruses before their introduction into Guangdong province through civets and the Middle East through camels, respectively. Some of the SARS-CoV strains became epidemic after several independent spillovers to humans during the outbreak of 2002 in Guangdong, China (

However, unlike the continuous propagation of the MERS-CoV epidemic, the SARS-CoV outbreak was successfully controlled in 2003. Based on the origin of other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to have originated in bats and have been introduced to Wuhan, China through an unknown intermediate. Until now, no effective clinical treatments or prevention strategies are available to be used against human coronaviruses.
