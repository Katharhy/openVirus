<p>Testing drugs against coronaviruses requires suitable animal models prior to their use in humans. The currently established models are not very promising for the studies of pathogenesis and treatment of highly pathogenic coronaviruses. For instance, nonhuman primates were unable to reproduce the characteristics of the severe human disease and mortality was not observed (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). However, some small animals have developed clinical symptoms of disease (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), such as transgenic mice expressing human ACE2, and mouse-adapted SARS-CoV strains are one of the most suitable models (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Additionally, transgenic mice expressing human DPP4 are a suitable small animal model for MERS (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Like the animal models for SARS-CoV, transgenic animal models may also be standardized for SARS-CoV-2. The development of clinical drugs for coronaviruses is challenging because of the repeated emergence of novel coronaviruses with diverse features, thus requiring specific drugs for each newly emerged virus. Moreover, only a limited number of animal models are available and most of them can only be used in highly demanding biosafety level 3 labs (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). From the perspective of the current outbreak, designing effective therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 is yet another challenge for scientists. Although a large number of antiviral treatment options for SARS and MERS have been reported with potent
