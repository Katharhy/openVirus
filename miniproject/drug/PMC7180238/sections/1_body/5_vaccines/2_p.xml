Given the importance of the current outbreak in Wuhan, further studies are needed to deepen understanding of replication, pathogenesis, and biological properties using reverse genetics and related molecular techniques. These investigations will help the control and prevention of SARS-CoV-2-mediated pneumonia disease and novel emerging diseases in the future.
