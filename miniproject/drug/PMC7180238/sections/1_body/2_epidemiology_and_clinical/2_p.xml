<p>Clinical features associated with patients infected with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 range from mild respiratory illness to severe acute respiratory disease (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The period from infection to appearance of symptoms varies. Generally, it is thought to be 14 days, however, a research group at Guangzhou Medical University reported the incubation period to be 24 days. In a family cluster of infections, the onset of fever and respiratory symptoms occurred approximately 3 to 6 days after presumptive exposure (
