<p>After the emergence of SARS-CoV in the Guangdong province of China, it rapidly spread around the globe (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). During November 2002, an epidemic of pneumonia with a high rate of transmission to other people occurred in Guangdong, China (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), followed by subsequent outbreaks in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, a total of 138 people contracted the infection within 2 weeks after the exposure to an infected patient in the general ward of a hospital (

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Overall, SARS-CoV infected 8,098 people and caused 774 fatalities in 29 different countries by the end of the epidemic (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Later, during June 2012, a patient infected by MERS-CoV developed severe pneumonia and died in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Analysis of cluster of nosocomial cases in Jordan during April 2012 confirmed that MERS-CoV caused the outbreak (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The spread of MERS-CoV continued beyond the Middle East, causing further reports of infected individuals (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Until 2020, 2,468 cases and 851 fatalities had been reported globally (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). During December 2019, clusters of patients with atypical pneumonia were reported by local health facilities in Wuhan, China. On December 31, 2019, a rapid response team was dispatched by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) to conduct an epidemiologic and etiologic investigation (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The patients were found epidemiologically linked to the wet animal wholesale seafood market in Wuhan, China. Later, the infectious agent responsible for this atypical pneumonia was confirmed and reported as coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which caused the first fatality in early January 2020 (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). During the first 6 weeks of the outbreak, several cases were reported in more than 37 countries, including the USA, Japan, Iran, and South Korea (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The infection rapidly spread across the globe from Wuhan, China. Therefore, the Chinese authorities implemented several strategies, including massive lockdown in Wuhan and suspension of transport to and from Wuhan to control the spread (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). According to Situation Report 35, published on the WHO website, SARS-CoV-2 caused 79,331 confirmed cases and 2,618 deaths around the globe. However, COVID-19 caused 77,262 confirmed cases and 2,595 deaths inside mainland China alone (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Through February 24, WHO had reported 8 deaths in Iran. It is now the second country after China, bearing the highest fatalities due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Iran poses a higher risk of pandemics in the Middle East and South Asian countries. Between December 10 and January 4, analysis of the growth rate of the epidemic gave a basic reproductive number (R
 <sub>0</sub>) of 2.2, meaning each patient has been spreading the infection to 2.2 other individuals (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The estimated R
 <sub>0</sub> value for SARS was around 3, however, SARS was successfully controlled by isolation of patients (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Moreover, the R
 <sub>0</sub> for MERS ranged from 0.45 in Saudi Arabia to 8.1 in South Korea (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Considering the lower R
 <sub>0</sub> value, the rapid increase in suspected as well confirmed cases of COVID-19 may be inferred via viral transmission through the fecal-oral route and aerosol formation. Moreover, asymptomatic persons are thought to be potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), which may have caused the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2. This asymptomatic spread may be one reason that the control strategy based on the isolation of patients has not been fully successful. To overcome these problems, a complete quarantine is necessary, allowing all of the infected individuals to develop symptoms without spreading the virus randomly. Thus, the direct and indirect contacts of infected individuals can be easily identified and isolated.
