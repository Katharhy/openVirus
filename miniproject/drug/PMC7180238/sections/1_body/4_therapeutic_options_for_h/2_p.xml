<p>Broad-spectrum antivirals, such as dsRNA-activated caspase oligomerizer (DRACO), which selectively induces apoptosis in virus-containing host cells, provide another class to evaluate for effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). However, this class does not provide a promising strategy alone, as they cannot block virus entry or disrupt viral nucleic acid. In contrast, thiopurine compounds, naphthalene inhibitors, protease inhibitors, zinc, and mercury conjugates target 3CLpro (3C-like protease) and PLpro (papain-like protease) enzymes in coronaviruses and have been shown to block their pathogenicity (

 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Therefore, combinational therapy of these antiviral agents with DRACO may enhance the overall impact on the recovery of patients. Despite the higher rate of infectiousness, coronaviruses are thought to have the ability to suppress counteracting responses from host innate interferons. This response can be augmented by the utilization of interferon inducers or recombinant interferons (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Recombinant interferons such as interferon alpha and interferon beta that have been tested against SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) might be utilized either alone or in combination with other potential antiviral drugs, including remdesivir. Both interferon alpha and beta inhibit viral replication (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), in combination with antibiotics and traditional Chinese medicines, could also be evaluated for activity against SARS-CoV-2.
