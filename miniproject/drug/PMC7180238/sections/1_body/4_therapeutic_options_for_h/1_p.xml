<p>Currently there are no promising antiviral treatments available, however, numerous compounds have been proven effective against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but have not been tested widely for the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir and chloroquine were found highly effective 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> for the control of 2019-nCoV infection (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Treatment with remdesivir alone or in combination with chloroquine or interferon beta was found effective against COVID-19 infection. This strategy has not caused any obvious side effects yet (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). However, more investigations are necessary to confirm the impacts of remdesivir. As coronaviruses share key genomic elements, common therapeutic targets are likely to be of greater importance. Therapeutic agents targeting nucleosides, nucleotides, viral nucleic acids, and enzymes/proteins involved in the replication and transcription of coronaviruses can be promising strategies to treat coronavirus diseases (

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The surface spike glycoprotein (S) is an important potential target for antiviral agents, due to its vital role in the interaction between the virus and the cell receptor. S consists of two subunits: S1, the amino-terminal receptor binding subunit, and S2, the carboxy-terminal membrane fusion subunit (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). In addition, activation of membrane fusion and virus entry requires the cleavage at the junction of S1-S2 (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Hence, S1 subunit-targeting monoclonal antibodies and S2 subunit-targeting fusion inhibitors may be effective therapeutic agents for coronaviruses (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Furin (a serine endoprotease) cleaves off S1/S2 (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) could thus be a suitable antiviral agent. Further, the helical nucleocapsid interacts with S protein, envelope proteins, and membrane proteins to form the assembled virion (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Therefore, targeting the structural genes using small interfering RNAs could be an effective therapeutic strategy against coronaviruses (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The host receptors are also associated with the viral entry into host cells, thus agents targeting these receptors also inhibit coronaviruses (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Inhibitors of endosomal cysteine protease and transmembrane protease serine 2 can partially block viral entry into the cell (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). K22 targets membrane-bound RNA synthesis in coronaviruses and inhibits double-membrane vesicle formation (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), and thus could be effective against SARS-CoV-2.
