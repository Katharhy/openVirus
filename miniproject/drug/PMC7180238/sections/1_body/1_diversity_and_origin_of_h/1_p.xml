<p>Coronaviruses are members of the subfamily 
 <italic>Coronavirinae</italic> (family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>; order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic>), which contains four genera: 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Gammacoronavirus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Gamma- and deltacoronaviruses generally infect birds, although some of them can cause infection in mammals, whereas, alpha- and betacoronaviruses are known to harm humans and animals. The viruses SARS-CoV (betacoronavirus), 229E (alphacoronavirus), HKU1 (betacoronavirus), NL63 (alphacoronavirus), OC43 (betacoronavirus), and MERS-CoV (betacoronavirus) can all cause infections in humans (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, betacoronaviruses are the most important group because they comprise the most highly pathogenic viruses against humans, including SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The highly pathogenic MERS and SARS coronaviruses originated in bats (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), however, the origin of the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 remains debatable. Investigations have revealed that the SARS-CoV strains detected in market civets (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) were transmitted from horseshoe bats (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). These viruses were found to be phylogenetically related to SARS-CoV in bats from China, Europe, Southeast Asia, and Africa (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In addition, the genome sequences of SARS-CoV strains isolated from humans were highly similar to those in bats (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). However, some variations were found among the 
 <italic>S</italic> gene and 
 <italic>ORF3</italic> and 
 <italic>ORF8</italic> gene sequences, which encode a binding and fusion protein and dispensable proteins for replication, respectively (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Nevertheless, clade2 of the 
 <italic>S</italic> genetic region (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), 
 <italic>ORF8</italic> (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and 
 <italic>ORF3b</italic> in SARS-CoV from bats contain major variations compared to SARS-CoV from humans (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).
