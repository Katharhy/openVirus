<p>Different strains of MERS-CoV obtained from camels were found to be similar to those isolated from humans (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) except for variations among the 
 <italic>S</italic>, 
 <italic>ORF4b</italic>, and 
 <italic>ORF3</italic> genomic regions (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Furthermore, genome sequencing-based studies have revealed that MERS-CoV strains from humans are phylogenetically related to those from bats. The strains have identical genomic and protein structures except for the S proteins (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In addition, recombination analysis of genes encoding orf1ab and S revealed that MERS-CoV originated from the exchange of genetic elements between coronaviruses in camels and bats (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).
