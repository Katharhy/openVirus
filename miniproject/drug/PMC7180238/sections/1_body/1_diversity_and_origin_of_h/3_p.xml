<p>Although the zoonotic source of SARS-CoV-2 is not confirmed, its genome sequence exhibits close relatedness (88% identity) with two bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21). Phylogenetic analysis reveals that SARS-CoV-2 is genetically distinct from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. However, homology modeling reveals that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have similar receptor-binding domain structures, despite amino acid variation at some key residues, including the absence of the 8a protein and the fluctuation in the number of amino acids in the 8b and 3c proteins in SARS-CoV2 (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In contrast, the primary protease is highly conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, with a 96% overall identity (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). These observations suggest that bats are the source of origin, while an animal sold at the Wuhan seafood market might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans (
