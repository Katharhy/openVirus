<p>Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses with a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Coronaviruses have been widely identified as causing respiratory and intestinal infections in humans after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Guangdong, China in 2002 and 2003 (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). SARS was determined to be caused by SARS-CoV and emerged in a market where civets were sold (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Only a decade later, the world witnessed another outbreak in the form of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV in the Middle East (

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). While the researchers were still investigating the underlying mechanisms of pathogenicity and developing effective therapeutic strategies against MERS, the world witnessed the deadliest outbreak in the form of COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The causative coronavirus of this outbreak was named SARS-CoV-2 due to its resemblance to SARS-CoV (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The SARS-CoV infects ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type-II pneumocytes through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). MERS infects unciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type-II pneumocytes by using dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), also known as CD26, as a receptor (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The mechanisms associated with the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 are not clear, however, structural analysis suggests it is likely entering human cells through the ACE2 receptor (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). This newly emerged virus has much greater similarity to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV, thus both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 may cause pathogenesis through similar mechanisms. The transmission of SARS-CoV to humans was reported from market civets, while that of MERS-CoV was from dromedary camels (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Similarly, the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 also appears to be transmitted to humans from markets where wild animals are sold (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, the zoonotic source of its transmission is not yet clear. According to previous reports, the aforementioned three coronaviruses are thought to have originated in bats (
