<p>Since the first epidemic of SARS, the pathogenic coronaviruses have harmed thousands of people worldwide (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Considering the adverse outcomes of the current COVID-19 epidemic, developing effective therapeutic strategies is necessary to cope with the lack of effective drugs, high mortality rate, and the potential of the virus to cause further epidemics. In this review, we focus on the origin, evolution, and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. We also discuss the therapeutic options for SARS-CoV-2 given its importance in the current scenario of COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. This review will be useful in preparing against future outbreaks and continuing pathogenic infections by this class of novel coronaviruses virulent to humans.
