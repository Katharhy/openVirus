<p>In December 2019, a new betacoronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]), thought to originate in Wuhan, China, emerged as a novel human pathogen for viral pneumonia (coronavirus disease [COVID-19]), resulting in an ongoing pandemic.

 </sup> The number of cases worldwide now exceeds five million, with more than 350,000 associated deaths, triggering a global effort to understand the predictors of disease severity for rapid triage, and the pathology of disease for rational therapeutic development and clinical trials. A consistent finding in early case series in China and New York City is an association between elevations in D-dimer and fibrin(ogen) degradation products (FDPs) and increasing COVID-19 severity and mortality.
