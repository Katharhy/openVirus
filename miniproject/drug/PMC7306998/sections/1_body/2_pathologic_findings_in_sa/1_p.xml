<p>Although there are only a few published pathologic reports of patients with COVID-19, histopathology of lung specimens from patients with early disease shows characteristic findings of ARDS and evidence of small vessel occlusion.

 </sup> There are several mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in microvascular and macrovascular thrombosis, including cytokine storm with activation of leukocytes, endothelium and platelets resulting in upregulation of tissue factor, activation of coagulation, thrombin generation and fibrin formation,

 </sup> deranged coagulation with imbalances in PAI-1, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, and activated protein C that promotes fibrin generation and limits fibrinolysis,

 </sup> hypoxic vaso-occlusion, and direct viral effects with cell activation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1358863X20932640">Figure 1</xref>). It remains an active area of investigation whether these are specific to SARS-CoV-2 infection or a final common pathway in the thromboinflammatory response to viral infections and a marker of disease severity. Early COVID-19 autopsy reports have also identified a possible role for neutrophils as microvascular thrombi contained numerous neutrophils, which in some cases were partially degenerated, consistent with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).

 </sup> NETs are tangles of DNA released from neutrophils, and are decorated with antimicrobial and nuclear proteins that propagate intravascular thrombosis.

 </sup> NETs initiate both the extrinsic and contact pathways by augmenting presentation of tissue factor, activation of factor XII (FXII), as well as trapping and activating platelets.

 </sup> Consistent with these observations, patients with severe COVID-19 have elevated serum markers of neutrophil activation and NET formation.

 </sup> In one study, neutrophil activation measured in serum correlated with, and sometimes preceded, VTE in patients with COVID-19.
