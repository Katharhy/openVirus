<p>Current expert recommendations, including interim guidelines from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC), recommend use of prophylactic dose LMWH or unfractionated heparin in all COVID-19 patients requiring hospital admission; for patients with a contraindication to pharmacologic prophylaxis, mechanical prophylaxis should be used.

 </sup> While a number of VTE risk stratification tools exist for hospitalized medical patients, these have not been validated in patients with COVID-19. Extended VTE prophylaxis with LMWH or direct oral anticoagulants after hospitalization for acute medical illness reduces the risk of VTE with an associated increased risk of bleeding.

 </sup> There are currently no data regarding extended prophylaxis in patients with COVID-19; however, the ACC expert opinion statement recommends consideration of extended prophylaxis in patients with elevated risk of VTE, such as patients with cancer or prolonged immobility who have low bleeding risk. Given early reports and ongoing concerns of high rates of VTE, randomized trials of empiric therapeutic anticoagulation or antifibrinolytics are ongoing, and there are reports of empiric therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with significantly elevated D-dimer both in Italy and in the US. While heparin offers both anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant effects, the benefit of therapeutic anticoagulation remains uncertain, with a risk of bleeding complications in critically ill patients with respiratory failure.

 </sup> Clinical trials will help define the role of heparin in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Outside of a trial setting, we advocate universal standard-dose pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis in patients without a contraindication. In patients with a high suspicion of VTE where access to confirmatory or serial imaging is limited, clinicians may consider empiric anticoagulation, although there is a paucity of evidence to provide guidance in this context. There are currently no randomized data to recommend empiric therapeutic or intermediate-dose anticoagulation in patients without documented VTE, or an other indication for anticoagulation, or outside the context of a clinical trial. A recent retrospective, observational study in New York City showed therapeutic anticoagulation was associated with decreased mortality in patients with COVID-19 who required mechanical ventilation, but not in all hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Although these findings are provocative, interpretation is limited by their observational nature.
