<p>Given the laboratory and clinical findings in patients with severe COVID-19, several repurposed and novel therapies are under investigation in clinical trials to prevent the hyperinflammatory response or mitigate uncontrolled coagulation. As elevations in D-dimer and FDPs likely reflect ongoing lung injury and microvascular thrombi, possible therapeutic targets include inflammatory cytokines, activated platelets, neutrophils, or microparticles that may propagate thrombosis; or anticoagulants and fibrinolytics that could limit thrombosis. Supporting this enthusiasm was a recent retrospective study in China in which VTE prophylaxic dose heparin was associated with a survival benefit in patients with severe COVID-19 and evidence of sepsis-induced coagulopathy.

 </sup> The study found no benefit among patients with milder COVID-19 illness; however, the study did not control for other markers of disease severity nor other therapies, such as antivirals. The study raises the possibility that prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation may benefit patients with severe infection. Heparin may alter the biology of the disease not only through its anticoagulant properties, but also due to its anti-inflammatory effects that promote a quiescent endothelium.
