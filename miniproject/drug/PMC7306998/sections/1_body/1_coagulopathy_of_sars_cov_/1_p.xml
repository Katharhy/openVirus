<p>There is particular interest in the coagulopathy in patients with COVID-19 as abnormal coagulation parameters, most consistently elevations in D-dimer and FDPs, are associated with disease severity.

 </sup> An elevated D-dimer, the most common coagulation abnormality in COVID-19 (found in up to 45% of patients), is an independent risk factor for death,

 </sup> and patients with D-dimer greater than 1000 ng/mL are almost 20 times more likely to die from their infection than patients with lower D-dimer values.

 </sup> In contrast, most patients with COVID-19 have a normal or mildly prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and a normal or shortened activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) on presentation and these labs are not reliably associated with disease severity.

 </sup> Both initial and longitudinal monitoring of coagulation parameters can predict disease severity, as elevated D-dimer and FDP levels on admission and decreased levels of fibrinogen and antithrombin III during the admission are associated with death.

 </sup> Although changes in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels and activity have not been studied, an increase in the PAI-1/tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) ratio would not be unexpected. These findings may be due to uncontrolled activation of coagulation with ongoing consumption and widespread microvascular thrombosis.
