  <p>Immune activation and mechanisms of coagulopathy in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).</p>
  <p>Multiple processes may contribute to COVID-19-associated coagulopathy including direct infection of type II pneumocytes and endothelial cells, leading to barrier dysfunction and increased permeability; inflammatory responses characterized by activation of T cells, neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and platelets resulting in exuberant inflammatory cytokine release (including IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α), monocyte-derived TF and PAI-1 expression; and culminating in the development of microvascular and macrovascular thrombi composed of fibrin, NETs, and platelets.</p>
  <p>IL, interleukin; NETs, neutrophil extracellular traps; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; TF, tissue factor; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-alpha.</p>
