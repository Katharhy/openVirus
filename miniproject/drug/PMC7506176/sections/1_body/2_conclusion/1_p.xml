<p>Although the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in West Africa is relatively slow compared to European, North American or Asian countries, vigilance must remain. West Africa has already registered more than 131Â 049 cases confirmed by PCR with 2102 deaths. This figure, however, falls far short of those recorded by European countries such as France, Spain, UK and Italy. The West African's population way of life and the large number of people working in the informal sector make it difficult to apply preventive measures, namely physical distancing and confinement. In order to be able to effectively combat the spread of the virus, it is essential to develop a strategy based on the protection of people at risk, namely the elderly and people living with chronic diseases. Mass screening targeting mainly people at risk and their entourage would allow early detection of cases and quarantine to breaking the chain of transmission and protecting the more vulnerable ones. A local production of protective masks could also be an alternative to the shortage of masks that the world is currently facing. Experiences from past epidemics (such as Ebola, dengue, yellow fever and Lassa fever) have increased laboratory and surveillance capabilities across the African continent which allows West Africa to be better prepared to face the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in Burkina Faso, the epidemic of Ebola virus disease has led to the creation of a national reference laboratory for viral haemorrhagic fevers and the training of several health workers in the management of epidemics. It is to be hoped that this epidemic will boost care and detection capacities in the near future.</p>
