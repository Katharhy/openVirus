<p>West Africa's population is predominantly young. Out of a population estimated at 371 159 562 in 2017, over 64% are under the age of 24 (

Indeed, the epidemiological situation of COVID-19 infection in China and Italy supports the hypothesis that the age factor plays an important role in the occurrence of severe forms of the disease [
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The fatality rate higher in Italy than in China could be explained in particular by the fact that the Italian population is one of the oldest in the world with approximately 22% of the population aged 65 and over [

In the African context, intra-family transmission of SARS-CoV-2 may be linked to the fact that several families and several generations live and interact under the same compound. In addition, the youngest live with the oldest within the extended family unit, making the risk of contamination of the elderly by the young higher.
