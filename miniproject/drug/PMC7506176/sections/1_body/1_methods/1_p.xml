<p>We conducted reviews for a broad range of public health topics related to SARS-CoV-2 focusing on the epidemiology, clinical manifestations and mode of transmission, factors that may influence the circulation of the virus. Initially, we conducted a systematic literature search of electronic databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and EMBASE) and pre-print servers (medRxiv and bioRxiv). In addition to the articles, we also searched data from WHO, some international organisations and SitReps on COVID-19. Then we used all this information to describe the situation in West Africa based on demographics, lifestyles, climate, chronic diseases and availability of resources. The research was conducted from March to July 2020. A total of 531 articles were reviewed and all articles that were deemed irrelevant to our review were excluded. These exclusion criteria mainly concerned the geographic location of the study, the epidemiological aspects addressed and the language of publication. The selection was made in three stages: a first stage of selection based on titles, then based on summaries and finally one based on full text. Thus, 40 articles were selected for this review. We have combined the search terms ‘SARS CoV-2 and climatic factors’, OR ‘SARS CoV-2 and chronic diseases’, OR ‘SARS CoV-2 and West Africa’ OR ‘SARS CoV-2 and Africa’. We used data from the COVID-19 Dashboard, a dataset hosted by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University to plot

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref> and

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1a</xref> and

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figures 2a, b</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref> were generated by Excel 2013.
