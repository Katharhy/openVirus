<p>There has not yet been any scientific evidence that people living with HIV are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 or developing severe forms of the disease. However, HIV-infected people are at higher risk of cardiovascular and/or metabolic disorders, as a consequence of chronic immune activation and ARV drugs exposure.
