<p>SARS-CoV appeared in China in Foshan, Guangdong province, in November 2002, while SARS-CoV-2 appeared in Wuhan, Hubei province in December 2019 [

 <xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In China, November and December are the coldest months of the year [
 <xref rid="ref68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Low rainfall was also noted in these two regions during both of these periods of SARS outbreaks. Low temperatures generally constitute conditions favouring the circulation of viruses [
 <xref rid="ref68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Cold accompanied by dry winds would be even more favourable to the survival of viruses compared to cold alone. Indeed, under these conditions, viral particles dried in the air, survive for a long time in the circulating air [

 <xref rid="ref72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Low humidity would reduce the ability of cell lashes in the airways to remove viral particles [
 <xref rid="ref72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. It can also cause drying of the nasal mucus, thus weakening the nasal cavity; which will make the entire upper respiratory tract vulnerable to viral infection [
