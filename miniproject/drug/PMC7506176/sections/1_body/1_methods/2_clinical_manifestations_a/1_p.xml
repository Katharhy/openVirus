<p>Transmission of coronavirus disease occurs mainly through the inhalation of infectious droplets and aerosols [
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and the incubation period is approximately 3–14 days. The clinical picture of SARS-CoV-2 infection is wide. It can range from an asymptomatic infection to a mild upper respiratory infection or even severe viral pneumonia that can lead to death [
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Seniors are most likely to develop severe forms [
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Other non-specific symptoms have been reported, such as fever, cough, myalgia, dermatological damage, dyspnoea with or without diarrhoea and neurological manifestations such as hypogeusia and hyposmia were described [
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A hyperinflammatory phenomenon called ‘cytokine storm’ is thought to be involved in the occurrence of severe forms [
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Cytokines are small proteins naturally produced by immune cells to promote ant-inflammatory reaction in order to protect the body from infection [
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. During SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is an excess production of cytokine causing a hyperinflammatory reaction that can lead to death by cytokine shock [
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. All patients should be quarantined and mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit is mandatory for the management of severe cases. Secondary bacterial infections can also occur, which can lead to pneumonia [
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. There is little data on the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in West Africa. However, according to a study of 32 COVID-19 patients in Nigeria, no patient presented to hospital under critical conditions. In total, 75% were in moderately severe condition while 16% were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms were fever (59%) and dry cough (44%). Anosmia (loss of smell) and ageusia (loss of taste) were present in 19% of patients [
