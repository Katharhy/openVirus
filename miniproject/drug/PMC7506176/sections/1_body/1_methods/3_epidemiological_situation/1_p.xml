<p>The epidemiological situation of SARS-CoV-2 disease in West Africa is marked by a continuous increase in the numbers of confirmed cases with rather disparate situations (

 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. After a first case notified on 27 February 2020 in Nigeria, West Africa, had on 29 July 2020, 131 049 cases confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 88 305 recoveries and 2102 deaths [

Nigeria is the most affected country in terms of registered death with 41 804 confirmed cases and 868 deaths followed by Ghana (34 406 confirmed cases and 168 deaths) and Cote d'Ivoire (15 713 confirmed cases and 98 deaths). Among the least affected countries we can cite Gambia (326 confirmed cases and 8 deaths), Togo (896 confirmed cases and 18 deaths) and Chad (926 confirmed cases and 75 deaths) (

If we analyse in more detail the situation in Burkina Faso, the first two cases were highlighted on 9 March 2020: a couple returning from France, precisely in the city of Mulhouse, where they participated in an evangelist event gathering several tens of thousands of people from 17 to 24 February 2020 and which constitutes the main cluster of COVID-19 in France. In this country young people under 15 are the least affected with only 14 confirmed cases (

 <xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the death rate of SARS-CoV-2 by age group in Burkina Faso as of 21 June 2020. If we take the case of Nigeria, the most affected country in West Africa, a study described that 94% of patients had a recent travel history or contact with a confirmed case and 53% of patients were over 40 years old [
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Another study reported a case fatality rate from COVID-19 of 2.8%. Lagos State was the most affected with more than 50% of positive cases. In a survey conducted among the population, only 29.0% would agree to be vaccinated if a vaccine against COVID-19 was available [
