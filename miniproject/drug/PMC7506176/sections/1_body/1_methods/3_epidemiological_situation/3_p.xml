<p>The low population density in West African countries could probably limit the spread of COVID-19. Indeed, with the exception of Nigeria (220 people/km
 <sup>2</sup>), the population density of West African countries is relatively low (Burkina Faso: 72 people/km
 <sup>2</sup>, Niger: 16 people/km
 <sup>2</sup>, Mali: 15 people/km
 <sup>2</sup>) compared to European countries (France: 105 people/km
 <sup>2</sup>, Italy: 207 people/km
 <sup>2</sup>, United Kingdom: 267 people/km
 <sup>2</sup>) and Asians countries (China: 144 people/km
 <sup>2</sup>, Republic of Korea: 516 people/km
 <sup>2</sup>, Hong Kong: 6510 people/km
 <sup>2</sup>) [
