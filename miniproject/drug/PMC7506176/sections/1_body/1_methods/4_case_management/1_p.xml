<p>The health situation in West African countries is difficult, in particular due to the extremely poor access of populations to health services. This weakness was exposed by the 2014/2015 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa. This epidemic has revealed significant gaps in the capacity and preparedness to respond effectively to critical health events in affected countries [

Most African countries do not have enough of these essential care materials. It is difficult to obtain exact numbers for all countries but some are nevertheless available. For instance, there are only 15 resuscitation beds in Burkina Faso, 40 in Mali and 80 in Senegal. There are only 4 respirators in Togo, 5 in Niger, 11 in Burkina Faso, 20 in Côte d'Ivoire, 56 in Mali, 80 in Senegal and around 400 in Nigeria [

Certain non-specific symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 such as fever and headache resemble that of malaria, hence the need for a differential diagnosis with malaria so as not to miss certain cases of SARS-CoV-2.
