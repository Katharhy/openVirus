<p>In the strategy implemented to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, there is the quarantine of contacts of cases. All people who have been in contact with a confirmed case are quarantined and followed up for 2 weeks. During these 2 weeks, everyone who develops symptoms is tested and managed; and anyone who does not show symptoms after 2 weeks is released from quarantine without being tested as is the case of Burkina Faso. Among these asymptomatic people out of quarantine, there could be asymptomatic carriers of the disease. The literature reports that people with asymptomatic forms of the disease can infect others and this transmission is estimated to be approximately 10% of transmission events [

It should therefore be wise to test all contacts of cases without exception after quarantine but this need is faced with the limitation of diagnostic tests available. For example at the beginning of the epidemic, there was only one laboratory (National Influenza Reference Laboratory) for confirmation of the cases for all the Burkina Faso, located in Bobo-Dioulasso, the second city in the country, located 365Â km from the capital. Today, four other laboratories have been equipped in Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso to carry out diagnostic tests, thereby improving diagnostic capacities.
