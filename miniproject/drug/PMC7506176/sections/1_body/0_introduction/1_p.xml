<p>On 31 December 2019, the city of Wuhan (Hubei Province, China), reported the emergence of an atypical pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus, later known as SARS-CoV-2 [

 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Coronaviruses are a large family of RNA viruses that can cause a wide variety of diseases in animals and humans, from the common cold to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), [
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Coronaviruses are divided into four genera according to phylogeny: alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV [
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were first described in the 1960s in patients with cold [
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Since then, six HCoVs have been discovered: 229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Similar to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus beta-CoV (beta-coronavirus) [
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. On 7 January, Chinese researchers isolated the new SARS-CoV-2 from patients with pneumonia. From 13 January, the epidemic began to spread outside of China [
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and on 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General declared the COVID-19 epidemic a public health emergency of international concern [
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As of 29 July 2020, WHO has reported 16 558 289 confirmed cases and 656 093 deaths worldwide [
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. On 14 February 2020, the first case of COVID-19 on the African continent was registered in Egypt [
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Since then, the disease has spread to several other African countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, Nigeria was the first country to report a case of COVID-19 on 27 February 2020 [
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Nowadays, all the countries of the sub-Saharan zone have been affected by the pandemic. As of 29 July 2020, Nigeria is the most affected country by the coronavirus pandemic in West Africa followed by Ghana [
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Previous studies have shown the circulation of MERS-CoV in camels in some West African countries (Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali) [
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, no case of HCoVs has been reported until the appearance of SARS-CoV-2. Although the African continent is, for the moment, less impacted than the rest of the world, it still faces the risk of a spread of COVID-19. Even though most African countries repeatedly face epidemics and health crises which allowed them to learn from past outbreaks, many gaps remain in the patient care systems of many countries. The WHO therefore ‘fears Africa may not be able to face this pandemic, and calls on states to make their arrangements timely’ [
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The transmission and spread of viruses can be influenced by a number of factors, including climatic conditions (such as temperature and humidity), population density and the quality of medical care [
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this study we have conducted a systematic review of the information available in the literature in order to provide an overview of the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 pandemic in West Africa and the impact of risk factors such as comorbidities, climatic conditions and demography on the pandemic. We focused our attention on Burkina Faso as it is one of the countries of West Africa with the most data available. Otherwise the way of life, the demography and the climate are comparable to most countries in West Africa.
