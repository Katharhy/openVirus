<p>In the presence of a neuropathic component, specific therapy needs to be instituted. The Douleur Neuropathique 4, a questionnaire for neuropathic pain should be applied (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>); this comprises two questions asked per interview and two questions based on physical examination for a total of 10 answers. If four or more answers are positive, the patient probably presents with neuropathic pain. In these cases, tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline) or anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin, carbamazepine) should be used. The onset of action is slower, occurring after 2 weeks of use. In older patients, amitriptyline may lead to sedation, therefore, gabapentin is often preferred starting at low doses. Patients with a history of arrhythmia should also be administered gabapentin instead of amitriptyline. Approximately 30% of CHIKV patients may present with a neuropathic pain component associated with joint pain that fails to respond to the usual analgesics, making it necessary to associate this therapeutic class with the treatment after clinical confirmation of the condition.
