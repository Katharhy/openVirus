<p>Some authors suggest including other indices to evaluate the therapeutic response of the patient, such as a global evaluation by the patient and by the physician and a count of the joints with pain and edema, to calculate the index of activity and other scales commonly applied by rheumatologists. The BMH suggests a broader approach when a high number of cases are identified following an epidemic and where patients are not likely to have access to a specialist. In addition, there is no evidence that these approaches are more effective in managing cases; hence, the general practitioner must be able to manage these cases to control symptoms in the initial treatment stages. </p>
