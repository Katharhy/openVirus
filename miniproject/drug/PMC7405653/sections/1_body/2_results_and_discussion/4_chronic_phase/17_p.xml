<p>It is important to remember that this chronological division of therapy in phases is ideal, but some patients may not visit a doctor until they have reached the chronic phase (after 3 months of onset of symptoms) and thus, may never have been offered post-acute phase therapy. In this case, despite when symptoms were experienced, the previous phase therapy can be offered. </p>
