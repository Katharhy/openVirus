<p>Arthralgia has been described in more than 90% of adult patients in the acute phase, with a polyarticular and symmetrical pattern, mainly affecting the joints of the hands, wrists, shoulders, knees, ankles, and feet. The pain can be incapacitating and makes it difficult for patients to perform daily activities such as walking, brushing their teeth, and picking up objects. Edema (periarticular and/or articular), as well as tenosynovitis and joint stiffness, is frequently observed at this stage. </p>
