<p>Data on the literature of specific therapies for chikungunya at different stages of the disease are limited. There are no high-quality randomized clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of different therapies. Moreover, few prospective studies have evaluated drug efficacy, and these studies have several limitations, including the use of different methodologies, the lack of adequate randomization in some studies, different therapeutic doses, short follow-up times, and sometimes, a small number of cases or heterogeneous comparison groups, that make comparisons difficult. There are also other case-series studies and reported experiences of pain management experienced in epidemics
