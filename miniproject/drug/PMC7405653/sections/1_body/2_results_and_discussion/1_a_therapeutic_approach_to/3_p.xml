<p>Chronologically, the clinical spectrum of the disease involves three phases: acute (up to 14 days), post-acute (15-90 days), and chronic (after 3 months). Musculoskeletal disease represents the most frequent clinical manifestation, and its management is related to these different phases. In addition, in the post-acute and chronic phases, the therapeutic approach depends on the identification of the pattern of joint manifestation, which may be predominantly non-inflammatory/musculoskeletal (mechanical) or inflammatory with arthritis and periarticular manifestations (tenosynovitis), which may also present tendonitis, enthesitis, fasciitis, capsulitis, and periostitis. </p>
