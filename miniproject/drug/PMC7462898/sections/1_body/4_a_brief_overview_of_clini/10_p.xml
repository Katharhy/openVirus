<p id="para0021">Coagulopathy, represented by increased D-Dimer levels, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and thrombocytopenia, and thrombotic events, is a common manifestation of COVID-19 [

 <xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Increased coagulopathy is in part because of the so-called “cytokine storm” manifesting with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines; such as IL6 and TNF-a, and in part because of endothelial dysfunction, and increased levels of prothrombotic factors 
 <xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Approximately, 5% of the hospitalized patients experienced venous thromboembolism, and the overall thrombotic complication rate is about 10% 
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Because of multiplicity of the prothrombotic factors in COVID-19 patients, the conventional preventive anticoagulation is often insufficient, and an intense anticoagulation regiment might be needed. However, there is no consensus on the proper anticoagulation approach, and the risk of bleeding is relatively high 
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Nevertheless, the patients are commonly treated with the low molecular weight heparin, adjusted according to body weight and renal function (reviewed in
