<p id="para0015">The majority of the infected individuals (&gt;80%) who are diagnosed with COVID-19 are minimally or mildly symptomatic. Viral shedding may occur about 3 days before development of symptoms and continues for a week after the onset of symptoms. In those who become symptomatic, the incubation period varies from 2 days to 14 days (average ~ 5 days). The most common symptoms are fever or chills, cough, dyspnea, fatigue, myalgia, headache, new loss of taste (dysgusia) or smell (anosmia), sore throat, rhinorrhea, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The disease is self-limiting in the majority of patients but about ~15% of the patients require hospitalization primarily because of hypoxia, particularly in those with comorbid conditions. About 5% of the infected symptomatic patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome and require oxygen supplementation through intubation and other invasive procedures. Lungs are the primary organ involved but involvement of other organs, mostly indirectly because of cytokine storms is not uncommon. The heart is involved in about 20% of the cases, as evidenced by elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and cardiac troponin I (TNNI3) as well as regional and global wall motion abnormalities with reduced ejection fraction on echocardiography. Direct cardiac involvement is less certain. Cardiac involvement is a major determinant of clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. In advanced cases multi-organ failure, including coagulopathy and lymphopenia, develops and progresses to death. The overall case-fatality of symptomatic patients with COVID-19 varies with age and is highest in the elderly

It is less (about 3.5%) in those diagnosed by testing alone (reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain testing alone), which includes symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The overall mortality varies from less than 3% in the young to ~30% in the elderly hospitalized patients, and to more than 70% in those requiring endotracheal intubation [
