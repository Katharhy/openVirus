<p id="para0018">The sexual dimorphism in the clinical outcomes, which is more pronounced in the older individuals, likely, reflects sexual dimorphism of the immune system. In general, there is a progressive decline in the adaptive immunity in men in response to pathogen as opposed to women [

The molecular basis of differential adaptive immunity between the two sexes has been attributed to the effects of the sex hormones on expression of genes involved in immunity, Y- and X-linked genes involved in immunity, nonhomogenous X-chromosome inactivation, and cell type-specific differential gene expression [
