<p id="para0011">SARS viruses utilize a number of mechanisms to evade detection by the host-immune response, including suppression of host interferon response, mimicking host 5â€™ cap on the mRNAs, and inhibition of signaling pathways that mediate host's cell gene expression 
 <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Despite such evasive mechanisms, host's antigen presenting cells, such as the macrophages and the dendritic cells utilize their pattern recognition receptors, including the Toll-like receptors to recognize the pathogen-associated molecular pattern on viral proteins and instigate the host-immune responses. The recognition, through a series of signaling cascades, activate transcriptional factors and effectors of gene expression, including NFkB, IRF3, and MAPKs, and lead to expression of the proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IL6 and tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) and MCP1 (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>). The host-immune cells express and release over a dozen cytokines and chemokines that induce a hyperinflammatory state, often referred to as the cytokine storm. The events predominantly occur in the lungs but largely because of systemic effects of the cytokines and chemokines, other organs, including the heart are also involved. In accord with the important role of proinflammatory cytokines, expression levels of several cytokines and chemokines have been associated with the severity of the disease and the clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19
