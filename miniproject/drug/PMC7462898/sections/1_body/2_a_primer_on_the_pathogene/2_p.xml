 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 1</xref>). The S protein is a homotrimeric protein comprised of S1 and S2 functional domains. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein is located within the S1 domain. It recognizes the human ACE2 protein, which cleaves angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 1-9 and angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7, the latter with potential beneficial effects on cardiovascular system
