<p id="para0010">Upon release into the host cell cytoplasm, the viral RNA recruits the host's translational ribosomes to synthesize various viral proteins necessary for its replication. Two large polypeptide chains are expressed from the viral RNA, which are then cleaved into NSPs, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. A combination of viral and host proteins, referred to as the replicase-transcriptase complex, is formed, which mediates synthesis of the new viral RNA and expression of the structural proteins, including the nucleocapsid. The newly synthesized viral RNA and the structural proteins are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi apparatus to form new virions. The ER-Golgi system also processes formation of the secretory viral vesicles and subsequent export of the newly formed viruses from the host cell through exocytosis.</p>
