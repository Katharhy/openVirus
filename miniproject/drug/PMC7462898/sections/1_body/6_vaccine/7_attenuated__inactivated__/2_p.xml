<p id="para0047">Attenuated and inactivated pathogens are the classic antigens for vaccine generation, dating back to vaccination against smallpox by Edward Jenner who coined the term vaccination. The virus is typically inactivated upon treatment with formalin or other chemicals or upon exposure to ultraviolet light. In the case of live attenuated virus, viral genome is deoptimize to reduce its pathogenicity while maintaining its immunogenicity against multiple viral antigen. The use of live attenuated or inactivated virus for vaccination is somewhat compounded by the potential pathogenicity due to an inadequate inactivation or attenuation. There is also the risk of live attenuated virus evolving into a more pathogenic strain due to mutagenesis or recombination with the wild type virus.</p>
