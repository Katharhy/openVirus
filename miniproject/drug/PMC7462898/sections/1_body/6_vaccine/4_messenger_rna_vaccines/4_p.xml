<p id="para0041">An RNA vaccine that codes for the S protein is considered an efficient approach to produce neutralizing antibodies that prevent binding of the virus to the ACE2 receptor and its entry into the host cells. The choice of the S protein as a target would have an inherent shortcoming, if SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell via a mechanism independent of ACE2, an issue that has not been totally resolved. There are a number of additional technical issues with the RNA-based vaccines, which pertain to stability of the mRNA, efficiency of its uptake by the host cell, and its release from the encapsulated nanoparticles into the cell cytoplasm to code for the intended protein. To increase stability of the mRNA and prevent rapid degradation by host ribonucleases, the mRNA is encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles or various compounds and injected intramuscularly into the host (reviewed in
