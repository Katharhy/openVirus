<p id="para0042">Given the transient nature of mRNA-induced immunogenicity, repeated injection is often necessary to induce a sufficient immune response. A potentially superior approach is the use of self-amplifying mRNA (SAM) constructs, whereby a replicase mediates prolonged transcription of the viral mRNA and hence, persistent presentation of the antigen to the immune system (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="bib0074" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>). The SAM approach enables generation of a large amount of antigen from a small amount of mRNA vaccines because of continuous generation of the antigen. A major limitation of the SAM platform is size constraints of the inserts used to produce antigen.
