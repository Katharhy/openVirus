<p id="para0034">Lopinavir/ritonavir, a combination of a protease inhibitor and P450 inhibitor, respectively, used for treatment of HIV, is also candidate to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 proteases and therefore, its replication. Small sample size studies, however, have not shown beneficial clinical effects in patients with COVID-19 [
