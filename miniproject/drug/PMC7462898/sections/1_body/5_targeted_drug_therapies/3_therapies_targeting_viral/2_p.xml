<p id="para0023">Entry of the SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells could be simplified into a multistep process comprised of proteolytic cleavage of the S1 subunit and ACE2, binding of the viral S proteins through the RBD in the S1 subunit to the ACE2 receptors on the host cells, fusion of the viral S protein with the host cell membrane, and endocytosis (
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 1</xref>). This is then followed by release of the viral RNA into host cell cytoplasm and synthesis of viral proteins. The newly synthesized viral proteins and viral RNA are assembled into virions in the ER/Golgi apparatus followed by excretion from the host cells by exocytosis. A number of interventions are pursued to target specific steps involved in viral entry, which are discussed briefly.
