<p id="para0027">The prevailing data suggest that proteolytic cleavage of the S protein and ACE2 receptors are an essential step for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells 
 <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In support of the critical role of this protease in viral entry, data in mice show that deletion of

 <xref rid="bib0048" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Camostat mesylate and nafamostat mesylate are serine protease inhibitors, which are commercially available and are currently being used for treatment of chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis, respectively. Preclinical studies show treatment with camostat mesylate blocks entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the epithelial cells 
 <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Likewise, nafamostat has been reported to reduce TMPRSS2-dependent fusion of MERS-CoV with host cell membrane in an in vitro assay 
 <xref rid="bib0049" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Clinical evidence in COVID-19 patients is limited to case reports suggesting clinical efficacy 
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Potential efficacy of camostat and the more potent nafamostat in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 is being tested in several randomized clinical trials.
