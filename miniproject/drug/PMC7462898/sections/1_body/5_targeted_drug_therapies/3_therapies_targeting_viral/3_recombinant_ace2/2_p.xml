<p id="para0024">The rationale for the use of recombinant ACE2 is to occupy the ACE receptors and hence, attenuate its availability for binding to SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, administration of the recombinant ACE2 by increasing circulating levels of ACE2 is expected to competitively bind and neutralize the ability of viral S protein to bind to the cellular ACE2 receptors. Consequently, the approach is expected to reduce viral entry into the host cell and attenuate the phenotypic consequences. Studies in cultured cells and organoids have shown efficacy of the recombinant human ACE in inhibiting cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2

A phase 2 clinical trial is designed to test effects of intravenous injection of recombinant ACE2 on a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, invasive mechanical ventilation and hospital discharge (NCT04335136). Two other studies are also registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.
