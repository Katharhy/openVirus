<p id="para0025">The rationale for the approach is self-evident, as convalescent plasma, containing neutralizing antibodies, has been used for treatment of infectious diseases for decades. A neutralizing antibody functions by binding to a specific domain of the viral protein or host receptor for the virus, blocking viral entry into the cell. The main target of neutralizing antibodies is the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible, after conformational changes and proteolytic modifications, for viral entry into the host cell through binding to the ACE2 receptors. The sera of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 contains several potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that effectively block binding of the S protein to the ACE2 receptors 
 <xref rid="bib0043" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In the COVID-19 patients, the host B cells produce multiple neutralizing antibodies that target multiple epitopes on the viral proteins. These antibodies have been extracted, purified, and used for therapeutic purposes. The availability of multiple antibodies enables using a cocktail of antibodies to prevent possible loss of efficacy of a single antibody. The loss of efficacy is typically due to loss of antigenicity of the target due to replication mutagenesis, which by affecting protein structure and function, leads to a loss of antigenicity of the targeted epitope. Overall, the main function of the neutralizing antibodies is prevention of viral entry. This is in contrast to nucleoside analogues and inhibitors of viral proteases that target viral replication and virion formation within the host cell, respectively.
