  <p>Various steps (numbered) involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, which might serve as targets for specific therapy and vaccine development.</p>
  <p>1. Attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 receptors on host cell membrane</p>
  <p>2. Integration of viral S protein with host cell membrane</p>
  <p>3. Viral entry through endocytosis</p>
  <p>4. Release of the virus from endosome to host cell cytoplasm</p>
  <p>5. Formation of replicase-transcriptase complex</p>
  <p>6. Synthesis of viral RNA</p>
  <p>7. Translation of viral RNA into large polypeptides</p>
  <p>8. Proteolytic cleavage of viral proteins into non-structural proteins</p>
  <p>9. Translation of viral mRNAs into structural proteins</p>
  <p>10. Assembly of viral RNA and proteins into virions at endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus</p>
  <p>11. Formation of secreted vesicles</p>
  <p>12. Exit of the newly formed virion from the host cell by exocytosis.</p>
