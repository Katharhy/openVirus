<p>Solid tumors are genetically characterized by a strong immune-suppression which at first involves tumor microenvironment, then in a more advanced phase the whole organism. This immune-suppressive status is strongly due to the over production, mainly by the tumor cells, of cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-alpha and TGF-beta (

Moreover, patients affected by solid tumors often suffer from blood coagulation disorders because of chemotherapy, surgery, hormone therapy, biological agents (e.g., anti-VEGFR drugs), and bedding. In addition, cancer cells are capable of producing the “cancer pro-coagulant” which is a cysteine proteinase able to induce a thrombotic diathesis, mainly in very advanced tumors (
