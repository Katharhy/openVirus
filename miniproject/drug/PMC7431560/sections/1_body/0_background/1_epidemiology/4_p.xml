<p>A report from the Italian Superior Institute of Health based on 3,200 patients who died of SARS-CoV-2 related mortality to old age and comorbidities including cancer (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Patients suffering from oncologic or onco-hematologic pathologies, as well as other diseases associated with immunosuppression (e.g., congenital immunodeficiency, solid organ transplants or hematopoietic stem cells, autoimmune diseases following immunosuppressive treatment), are particularly at risk for morbidity and mortality from respiratory viral infections such as influenza for which the risk of hospitalization of cancer patients is approximately four times higher than in healthy subjects of comparable age (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Although the data are currently extremely limited, it seems that patients with oncologic or onco-hematologic diseases are exposed either to greater risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection or to have a worse prognosis. In fact, these patients are characterized by a greater risk of events such as hospitalization in intensive care unit and/or exitus.
