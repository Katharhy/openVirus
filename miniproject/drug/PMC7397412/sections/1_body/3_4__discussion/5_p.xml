<p>We found that patients detected with Flu A and Flu B received significantly lower antibiotic prescriptions and more anti-influenza prescriptions than those who had a positive result for non-Flu A/B viral pathogens or had a negative result for all pathogens. The detection of a positive result for viral pathogens contributed to a decrease in the usage of antibiotics in patients with RTIs in ED, which suggested that the use of the FilmArray RP panel may be helpful in reducing antibiotic prescriptions in outpatients with RTIs. However, there was no evidence for a significant decrease in anti-influenza prescription usage between non-Flu A/B viral pathogen detected patients and nonpathogen detected patients. For those without influenza A or B virus identified, the clinicians were more likely to prescribe anti-influenza drugs for outpatients in the winter season, suggesting the prevention of inappropriate prescriptions of anti-influenza medications needs further attention [

As for the effects of respiratory viral pathogen results on antimicrobial prescription rates, including antibiotics and anti-influenzas, mixed findings have been reported by previous studies. In our study, the multiplex pathogen PCR system of the FilmArray showed the potential ability to reduce unnecessary antimicrobial prescriptions.
