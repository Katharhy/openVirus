<p>More than one respiratory pathogen was codetected in 16.7% of the 270 specimens in this study. Li et al. reported a rate of 25.5% codetected patients from among children aged 19 days to 15 years with RTIs when using the FilmArray Respiratory Panel [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, in adults, studies have mostly reported lower rates of approximately 10% to 15.9% [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In terms of codetected respiratory pathogens, the largest proportion includes RSV (17.3%) and 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>pertussis</italic> (17.3%), while Flu A was the second most common pathogen with a lower positive rate (16.3%) than in the analysis of signal detected pathogens. Because there was no laboratory testing for respiratory viral pathogens (except for Flu A and Flu B) at our hospital, the detection of multiplex respiratory organisms may be the most unexpected result for the clinical staff in our ED, fully illustrating the value of the FilmArray RP panel as a tool for POC testing in clinical departments.
