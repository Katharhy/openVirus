 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> is reported as one of the most common pathogens of patients with CAP, and it was an unexpected result in our study that few cases were found [

 <italic>pertussis</italic> cases were detected only in the group ≤16 years with a positive rate of 7.9% in 114 patients; at present, the use of culture and serology methods in the diagnosis of pertussis is the only choice in China. The FilmArray RP panel may therefore help to manage patients with suspected pertussis, since it is difficult to identify other respiratory pathogens which often cause similar clinical symptoms to pertussis [
