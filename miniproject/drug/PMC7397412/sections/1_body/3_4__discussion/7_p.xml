<p>However, there are a number of limitations in this study. First, our study was a single-center study, and results from multicenter need to be reported for verifying. Second, another possible limitation of our study is the bias from age among participants, as we all know, young children in which infected with RTI have a totally different percentages of respiratory pathogenic spectra. Third, because of the high cost of the FilmArray RP panel, we choose to implement our study only in a single winter season and we do not have access data covering a complete year. Fourth, the study was conducted in an ED which is specialized for infectious diseases, rather than general ED that included clinical staff facing a range of diseases. Finally, the utility of the FilmArray respiratory panel in the emergency department needs further evaluation in multicenter studies and with more patients in EDs.</p>
