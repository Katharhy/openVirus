<p>We also note here differences in the detected number of respiratory pathogens in results where a signal pathogen was detected. Flu A was the most detected viral pathogen in all three groups; Liu et al., Qian et al., and Jin et al. similarly observed that Flu A was the most detected pathogen in RTIs in winter in their studies [

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Rhino/Entero and RSV were the predominant viruses for all age groups, but far less were detected than the most detected Flu A [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Rhinovirus is a common virus in all seasons; however, peaks of rhinovirus infections are well documented around September, and a low positive rate of rhinovirus may be associated with that reason [
