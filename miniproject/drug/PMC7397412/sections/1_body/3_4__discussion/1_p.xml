<p>This pragmatic clinical trial is the first, to our knowledge, to report on the performance of the FilmArray RP panel for direct use in an ED for outpatients by clinical staff, in terms of outcomes including the analysis of the signal pathogen detected, analysis of copathogens detected, and antimicrobial prescription rates. After clinical staff training and personnel training, 271 specimens were detected over the winter season using the automated nested multiplex PCR system for pathogen detection, yielding a detection rate of 72.6% and a positive result in 270 specimens. Although the PCR instrument was operated by clinical staff, only one sample failed. When the three groups were divided by age in the analysis of signal pathogen detection, the group ≤16 years had the highest positive rate of 81.6%, followed by the group ≥50 years (66.7%), and the group aged 16–49 years had the lowest positive rate of 65.8%. The trend of low detection rates of respiratory viral pathogens in adults is consistent with previous studies; Christine et al. showed that with increasing age, the positive rates obtained with the FilmArray RP panel decrease, and other studies using multiplex respiratory pathogen PCR have also reported lower detection rates in adults [

However, the overall detection rate in this study, which resulted from clinicians operations, was higher than that found in other studies of diagnosis with the FilmArray RP at tertiary care medical centers (aged 5 days to 91 years), EDs, in the urgent care of pediatric patients, or in ward-based operations with inpatient and outpatient medical areas [

This finding may also relate to the differences in time and sample size, or the characteristics of the age distribution of the participants.
