<p>Compared to traditional tests such as direct fluorescence assays (DFA) and cell cultures, laboratory-developed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests have high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of respiratory pathogens, with shorter turnaround times (TAT) [

The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (BioFire Diagnostics; Salt Lake City, UT, USA) is an automated multiplex molecular system for the detection of 17 viruses, 2 atypical pathogens, and a bacterium in 65 min. Improved influenza detection and antimicrobial prescriptions and reduced length of stay for this system have been widely proven by many clinical trials [

As an automated multipathogen detection system, the FilmArray RP is an integrated diagnostic system which is rapid, accurate, and reproducible, and in addition, the system minimizes the need for professional laboratory facilities and trained technicians [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Though defined as a multipathogen molecular detection of point-of-care (POC) test, the operators of this system, from pouch preparation to data analysis, tend to be experienced laboratory staff who have participated in previously published articles, and general laboratories or microbiology laboratories in hospitals are the only places currently using this multipathogen test. Thus, understanding the direct utility of the FilmArray RP as a POC test for use with outpatients is important.
