<p>Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly during the winter months due to seasonal respiratory epidemics [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition to the morbidity and mortality associated with RTIs, the infections also represent a huge impact on emergency department (ED) visits, outpatient medical visits, hospital admissions, and the burden of antimicrobial prescriptions, especially in developing countries because of the absence of rapid and accurate laboratory-dependent testing for respiratory pathogens [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The majority of RTIs are caused by respiratory viruses, followed by infections of bacterial pathogens [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A principal challenge for clinical staff is to distinguish among RTIs with similar symptoms and clinical signs, such as discriminating influenza from the “common cold” or bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Empiric treatment with antibiotics is frequently initiated in patients despite the likelihood of viral infection being the etiology of a patient's symptoms, the potential challenge of bacterial resistance, and even environmental pollution [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Definitive etiological diagnosis based on rapid testing and the ability to distinguish multiple respiratory pathogens may improve this situation.
