<p>We tested respiratory pathogens in patients with RTIs in an ED using the FilmArray respiratory panel undertaken by clinical staff, for the first time in China. We found that the FilmArray, an automated nested multiplex diagnostic PCR system, was a rapid and simple tool for clinical staff to utilize in a nonspecific test setting. The multiplex diagnostic system significantly increased the rate of respiratory pathogen detection, and clinical staff from the ED performed the FilmArray RP testing without too many “Invalid” results, suggesting that this diagnostic system has potential for use in many divergent clinical settings. Based on the results of the FilmArray RP panel, the unnecessary usage of antibiotic prescriptions and anti-influenza prescriptions in patients with nondetected pathogens may be reduced when they present to an ED.</p>
