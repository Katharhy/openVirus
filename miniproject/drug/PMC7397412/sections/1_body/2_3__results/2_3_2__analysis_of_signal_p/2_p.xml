<p>The highest prevalence of targeted pathogens in the three age groups was Flu A: the prevalence of Flu A in the groups ≤16 years, 16–49 years, and ≥50 years was 22.8%, 32.4%, and 31.1%, respectively. More specifically, the highest rate of Flu A from three distinguishable subtypes was FluA/H3 in all three age groups, with a rate of 26.7% in the group ≥50 years, followed by 19.8% in the group aged 16–49 years and 14.0% in the group ≤16 years.
