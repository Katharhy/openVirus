<p>Between 15 October 2016 and 31 February 2017, the study assessed 315 patients for eligibility, of whom 271 were eligible to participate. None of the participants withdrew from the study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Forty-four (24.0%) of the patients were excluded as 19 declined to give consent, 12 had fever that lasted for longer than 7 days, 7 patients refused the nasopharyngeal swab, 4 had a high level of CRP (&gt;50 mg/L), and HIV was positive for 2 patients. Grouped by the results of the FilmArray RP assay, the characteristics of the pathogen detected group and nonpathogen detected group are shown in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. One hundred and ninety-six (72.6%) patients were detected as having one or more pathogens. A total of 93 (47.4%) patients were &lt;16 years, but those aged between 16 and 49 accounted for the larger proportion in the nonpathogen detected group. There were high percentages of the clinical characteristics of fever (81.1%) and coughing (83.8%) in the nonpathogen detected group versus the pathogen detected group (60.7% and 61.7%, respectively). The median levels for the white cell count and C-reactive protein were higher in the nonpathogen detected group compared to the pathogen detected group (nonpathogen detected group 9.28 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L (IQR: 4.05–11.86) and 28.86 mg/L (IQR: 7.40–34.83); pathogen detected group 8.5 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L (IQR: 4.52–9.40), 16.70 mg/L (IQR: 2.40–19.30)).
