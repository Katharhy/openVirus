<p>This single-center, open, observational study took place between October 2017 and February 2018 in Beijing Ditan Hospital (BJDH), affiliated with Capital Medical University, China. BJDH is a teaching hospital with 800 beds. As a specialized hospital for infectious diseases, we have a separate ED for patients with infectious diseases, and a large proportion of patients come to this ED for RTIs in winter. Participants were enrolled from the ED in BJDH, including patients with a fever or feeling feverish, or experiencing a cough, runny nose or stuffy nose, and fatigue or tiredness, who could be recruited directly from their first arrival at the ED, and possibly also presenting with vomiting or diarrhea. Patients were excluded if patients had experienced a fever for longer than 7 days or prescribed with antibiotics during the last 2 weeks, and we also excluded patients who presented in a state of unconsciousness, as well as those known to be HIV-infected. Written informed consent was obtained by the emergency department staff from the participants, or for children from the child's parents or guardians. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of BJDH.</p>
