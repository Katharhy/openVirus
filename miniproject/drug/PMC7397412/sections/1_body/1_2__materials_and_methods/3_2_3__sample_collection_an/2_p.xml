<p>In this study, the FilmArray assay (FilmArray RP panel, BioFire Diagnostics, LLC, Salt Lake City, Utah) detected 20 targets of viral and atypical pathogens present in respiratory samples, including 17 respiratory viruses from the rhinovirus/enterovirus family (Rhino/Entero), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (AdV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), influenza B virus (Flu B), influenza A virus unsubtyped/H1/H3/2009H1 (Flu A/unsubtyped, Flu A/H1, Flu A/H3, and Flu A/2009H1), coronavirus 229E/HKU1/NL63/OC43 (Cov 229E, Cov HKU1, Cov NL63, and Cov OC43), parainfluenza 1/2/3/4 (PIV 1, PIV 2, PIV 3, and PIV 4), the bacterium

 <italic>Chlamydia pneumoniae</italic> (

 <italic>pneumoniae</italic>) and 
 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> (

 <italic>μ</italic>l) were loaded into the testing pouch by clinical staff under a ventilation hood. After scanning the sample identity document, automatic nucleic acid extraction, RNA reverse transcription, and the first-stage and second-stage multiplex PCR amplification were started successively, and the results were available in 65 min. For each target, the second-stage PCR amplification was undertaken in triplicate wells. The FilmArray assay automatically created the melting curve of the second-stage PCR to provide a positive or negative result. If internal control amplifications reported a negative result, the assay was defined as “Invalid,” with no pathogens.
