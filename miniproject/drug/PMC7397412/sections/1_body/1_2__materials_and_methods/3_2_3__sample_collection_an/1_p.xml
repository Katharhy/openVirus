<p>For the FilmArray RP assay, a nasopharyngeal swab for the respiratory sample was collected using a nylon flocked swab (Copan Diagnostics, Italy) at midturbinate, which was then placed in a viral transport medium (VTM, Copan Diagnostics) immediately. If respiratory virus detection was needed, the clinicians would take the nasopharyngeal swab from the patient' nasopharynx for more than 5 seconds directly, and all results from the FilmArray RP assay were recorded in the statistics records. The clinicians performed the FilmArray could then give an antibiotic prescription according to the patient's clinical manifestation, based on the results of the laboratory examination and the FilmArray RP assay. A trained assistant collected all clinical data and etiological information using a standard case report form and input this information into an electronic study database.</p>
