All analyses in this study used IBM SPSS Statistics software v22.0 (StataCorp; USA) or Prism v6.0 (GraphPad Software; USA). The categorical variables of demographic and clinical characteristics and the clinical outcomes were shown in percentages and compared with Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for differences. The white cell count, level of C-reactive protein, and lymphocytes were presented as a median (interquartile range). The differences in antimicrobials among groups with different pathogens detected were compared using Student's
