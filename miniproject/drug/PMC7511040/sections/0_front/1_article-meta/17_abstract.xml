 <title>ABSTRACT</title>
 <p>Evidence of cardiovascular complications associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic continues to evolve. These include direct and indirect myocardial injury with subsequent acute myocardial ischemia, and cardiac arrhythmia. Some results from a limited number of trials of antiviral medications, along with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, have been beneficial. However, these pharmacotherapies may cause drug-induced QT prolongation leading to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Mitigation of the potential risk in these susceptible patients may prove exceptionally challenging. The Saudi Heart Rhythm Society established a task force to perform a review of this subject based on has recently published reports, and studies and recommendations from major medical organizations. The objective of this review is to identify high-risk patients, and to set clear guidelines for management of patients receiving these pharmacotherapies.</p>
