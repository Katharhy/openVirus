<p>As part of infection control mechanisms for patients with established or suspected COVID-19 infection, continuous ECG monitoring is often used to monitor patients. This reduces the number of clinical staff interacting with the patient, thereby reducing the risk to health care workers and preserving personal protective equipment. The QT interval can be manually calculated from lead II in the continuous monitor as a replacement of the 12-lead ECG in such conditions.</p>
