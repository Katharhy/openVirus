<p>On-therapy QT assessment for high risk patients (QT ≥500 ms) should include a QT interval obtained 2-4 hours after the first dose, then again after 48 hours, then 96 hours. In low-risk patients, on-therapy assessment should be obtained at 48 and 96 hours.

 </sup> If on-therapy QT increases by ≥60 ms or is ≥500 ms, then the QTc prolongation countermeasures need to be reviewed, and the medications possibly stopped.
