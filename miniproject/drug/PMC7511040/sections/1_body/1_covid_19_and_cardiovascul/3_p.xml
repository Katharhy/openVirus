<p>A multifactorial mechanism of cardiac injury in COVID-19 infection is suggested by previous studies on MERS and SARS epidemics and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

 </sup> As a part of an acute systemic inflammatory response, there is a surge of cytokine levels, which can result in direct injury to multiple organs, including cardiac myocytes. Studies show elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in patients with severe COVID-19 disease.

 </sup> SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 receptors as an entry point to the cell. ACE2 receptors are expressed in both type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes as well as other types of cells, including endothelial cells. Acute injury to the heart, lung, and endothelium results from the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 receptors.

 </sup> Additionally, patients with COVID-19 infection are known to have a hypercoagulable state that in turn may trigger acute coronary syndromes, resulting in further myocardial injury.
