<p>The most fearful outcome of drug-induced long QT is sudden death due to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. While on such therapy, patients should be advised to report any new symptoms, especially palpitations and syncope. Patients presenting with hemodynamically unstable TdP should be treated according to the Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS) protocol. Infusion of magnesium is the only antiarrhythmic therapy proven to stabilize TdP (

 </sup> Patients with short runs of polymorphic VT that is hemodynamically stable can be closely monitored. In those patients, correction of underlying electrolyte imbalances and elimination of drugs with potential QT prolongation may be sufficient. Polymorphic VT is more likely to occur in the setting of bradycardia or frequent pauses; therefore, discontinuing medications causing bradycardia is important. Patient with AV nodal block or signifi-cant sinus node disease may require temporary pacing or isoproterenol infusion.
