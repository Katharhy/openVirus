<p>Drug-induced QT prolongation occurs more commonly in females than in males and is seen more frequently in older patients (&gt;65 years of age).

 </sup> Patients with long QT syndrome (LQTS) are known to be high risk. Electrolyte abnormalities are known to cause QT prolongation, especially hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia.

 </sup> Patients with underlying cardiac disease such as myocardial ischemia, dysfunction or bradycardia are also at risk. These effects are more pronounced in hospitalized patients who have renal or hepatic dysfunction, hypoglycemia, hypothermia or those already on QT-prolonging medications.

 </sup> Hence, TdP is more likely to be induced with administration of a given drug in a hospitalized patient than in an outpatient setting.

 </sup> It is also safe to assume that severe cases of COVID-19, especially those with cardiac involvement, would be more predisposed to QT prolongation. Several clinical stratification tools that may be used to determine QT-prolongation risks are published in the literature.
