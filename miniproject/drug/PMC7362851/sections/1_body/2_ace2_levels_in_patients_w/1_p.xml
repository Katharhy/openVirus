<p id="para0005">Angiotensin 1-7, the product of ACE2 action, has a wide range of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Infusion of angiotensin 1-7 resulted in the attenuation of vascular dysfunction and atherosclerosis in mice through the activation of Mas and angiotensin type 2 (AT2) receptors. The imbalance between angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of vascular diseases. Lower levels of ACE2 are implicated in several conditions such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, heart failure, diabetic nephropathy, and lung injury.
