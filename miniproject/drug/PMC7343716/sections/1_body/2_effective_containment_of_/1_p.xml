<p>After the initial case reports during late January and early February, the Kerala government took numerous steps to strengthen the guidelines, emergency preparedness, diagnostics, and categorization of risk involved in reducing the transmission of the virus in any outbreak. Notably, this state had previously experienced endemics, which helped to deliver a more rigorous action plan during the COVID-19 epidemic as compared to other states in India. Due to its previous epidemic experience, the state immediately declared a health emergency in the first week of February. With no new case reports, the health emergency was withdrawn on February 12, 2020. During this period, all travelers, including student returnees from Wuhan, China, were quarantined, and registrations were initiated to keep a record of travelers entering the state from SARS-CoV-2 affected countries. In mid-February 2020, the number of positive cases gradually increased as many Kerala natives returned from the affected countries. With the recurrence of cases, in mid-March 2020, the state implemented additional precautionary measures, including the immediate shutdown of non-medical educational institutes, surveillance at airports, and the use of sanitizers in public places such as salons, malls, and shopping centers. Further, an immediate fund was released from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) to tackle the outbreak after the identification of COVID-19 as a notified disaster. These precautionary and state lockdowns were more advanced than the national curfew, which was declared 1 week later (March 25, 2020). Despite the severe measures, the entire state was declared to be COVID affected on March 25, 2020. The number of active cases in the state peaked at 266 on April 6 2020. Subsequently, the number of active cases has gradually decreased to date. During the period of lockdown, rigorous testing was performed for symptomatic COVID-19 cases, and contact tracing was carried out for infected people. To date (May 1, 2020), 27,150 samples were tested, out of which 26,225 were found to be negative (data available at

This was followed by geographical tracking and mapping of confirmed cases, which helped to enable contacts of positive cases to report to the health system and seek advice regarding quarantine. In addition, nearly 82 hotspot regions in Kerala were spotted, and these containment zones are referred to as “LSG Needing Special Attention” (

In addition, the daily address of the state's Chief Minister helped to instill confidence among the residents. Moreover, the state had deployed many officers from various departments to monitor activities related to containing COVID-19, such as household surveys during the quarantine period. This surveillance at a grassroots level was conducted by local self-government and primary health care workers. As of May 1, 2020, the details of people under surveillance have been provided by the Kerala government. Of these, 21,894, 21,484, and 410 were kept under observation and kept under home isolation, respectively, and 410 symptomatic persons were hospitalized (
