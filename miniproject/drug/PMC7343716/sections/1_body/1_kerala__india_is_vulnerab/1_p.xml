<p>The state of Kerala, with a total area of 15,005 sq km, is located in the southwestern coastal region of India. According to Census 2011, Kerala has a population of ~36 million, with a literacy rate of 94%, which is the highest in India. The comparatively higher allocation of funds by the Kerala government to primary level education, health care, and the elimination of poverty has resulted in the state being number one in the Human Development Index (HDI) (
