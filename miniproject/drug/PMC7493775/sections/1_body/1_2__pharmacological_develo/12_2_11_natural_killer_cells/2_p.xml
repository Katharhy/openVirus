 </sup> Hence, Celularity, a New Jersey-based therapeutics company declared that, “CYNK-001, a cancer treatment is under clinical trial against COVID-19 awaiting for FDA permission.” However, several challenges exist such as novel viral evading mechanisms of immune system including N protein of SARS-CoV.

 </sup> Another important challenge is cytokine storm, a characteristic developed by some COVID-19 patients. Therefore, the clinical testing should proceed with extreme caution and carefully monitor the clinical status to see whether it over-activates immune system and further harms healthy lung cells.
