<p>Until now, no well-established evidence has been revealed for the details of the immunological response in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. However, we can initially glean some information from previous CoV studies such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. After virus entering the host cell, it activates several receptors such as RIG-I-like receptor, NOD-like receptor, toll-like receptor, and C-type lectin-like receptors. Subsequently, it stimulates the expression of several inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and synthesis of type I IFNs which can control the viral spread and eliminate virus via phagocytosis by macrophages.

 </sup> Learning to recognize the virus and raising a defense immune system may take several days to weeks. During this period, natural killer (NK) cells might initially be an important gate keeper for exogenous virus.
