<p>The usage of monoclonal antibodies for infectious disease is a new area, which addresses many concerns related to serum therapy and intravenous immunoglobulin medication in terms of better specificity, purity, safety, and reducing risk of contamination. Like the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also targetd ACE2 for its attachment and entry into host cells. Hence, several neutralizing monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV by recognized S1 and S2 subunits, and amino acid residues might be applied to SARS-CoV-2.

 </sup> A recent study showed that CR3022, a neutralizing antibody from a recovered SARS patient, might have the cross-reactive activity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV through structural modeling with highly conserved distal epitope from the RBD.

 </sup> Nevertheless, evidence showed that even SARS-CoV-2 spike protein displayed high (about 75%) homology with SARS-CoV, the novel epitopes only contributed to about 85% of the RBD antibody epitopes, implied concerned alterations in their antigenicity.

 </sup> This result might explain the reason for failure of some anti-SARS-CoV spike protein antibodies against for SARS-CoV-2 and indicate that the developments of new antibody and specific vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 are necessary and urgent.
