 </sup> SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells might be dependent on interacting with the S protein and host cellular receptor. Subsequently, cathepsin L and cathepsin B (CTSL/CTSB), the host cell proteases responsible for cleavage of the spike protein, play an important role in the de-enveloping process. It provides potential target for COVID-19 therapy development. Recently, amantadine was screened for the possibility to downregulate the expression of CTSL/CTSB through high-throughput drug screen gene expression analysis (doi:

 </sup> At present, the amantadine and its analog are not recommended for influenza due to influenza A resistance and side effect on lactation due to decrease of serum prolactin.

 </sup> Although amantadine and its analog are not commonly discussed, this aspect whatever used for adjuvant or single treatment might be worthy to reassess in the future development for anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
