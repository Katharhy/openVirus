<p>Ribavirin is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent that has previously been used for hepatitis C patients treatment. It is a guanosine derivative and can target RdRp enzyme to inhibit the synthesis of viral RNA and capping of mRNA. During the previous SARS epidemic, ribavirin was widely used for patients in China.

 </sup> However, evidence showed ribavirin might have no significant antiviral activity against SARS-CoV

 </sup> Hence, ribavirin usage for SARS-CoV is questionable and has been criticized.

 </sup> Earlier evidence demonstrated that the combination of ribavirin and IFN-Î² had a synergistic effect for inhibiting the replication of SARS coronavirus in animal and human cell lines.

 </sup> Regarding the adverse reactions and absence of the
