<p>To date, despite the fact that the sequence information of SARS-CoV-2 has been revealed, Modernaâ€™s mRNA-1273 is the pioneer vaccine candidate on the market that has stepped its foot into clinical trials.

 </sup> If the synthetic strand of mRNA could prove its safety in humans and pass through the phase I trial, evaluation of its clinical benefits would be subsequently executed. It is highly expected for its antiviral response against SARS-CoV-2 through targeting S protein (NCT04283461). Numerous potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are being developed, including viral-like particles, nucleic acid-based vaccine, adenoviral vector-based vaccine, recombinant subunits vaccine, recombinant influenza viral vector vaccine, inactivated vaccine, and so on.

 </sup> Upon current development progress, further work is needed to develop safe and effective vaccines for the control of the SARS-CoV-2 ongoing epidemics.
