<p>IFNs are a group of cytokine mediators that are induced in response to virus infection. IFNs are classified into subtypes I and II, both of which are involved in innate immunity and adaptive immune response. Several effector antiviral mechanisms of IFN are known, such as mRNA translation inhibition, enhancement of RNA degradation, RNA editing, targeting viral nucleocapsids, and inhibiting RNA synthesis.

 </sup> Among the type I IFN, IFN-α is quickly stimulated in innate immune response to initial virus infection. IFN-α and β inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV.

 </sup> However, IFN-γ was identified to lack antiviral activity against SARS-CoV.

 </sup> Previous study demonstrated that SARS-CoV inhibited IFN transcription in infected cells and the additional IFN could partly resume innate immunity against SARS-CoV.

 </sup> Pegylated IFN-α2b, a licensed drug for chronic hepatitis B and C, showed the anti-SARS-CoV activity by decreasing viral replication and lung damage.

 </sup> IFN-α is a candidate medication for SARS and MERS treatment.

 </sup> Therefore, the current clinical evidence showed that IFNs might be used for the development of novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
