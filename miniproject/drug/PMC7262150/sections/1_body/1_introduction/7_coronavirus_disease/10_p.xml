<p>The deleterious SARS‐CoV‐2 infection myocardial effects could also be perpetuated by the prompt and severe downregulation of myocardial and pulmonary ACE2 pathways, thereby mediating myocardial inflammation, lung edema, and acute respiratory failure.

 </xref> ACE2 is widely expressed not only in the lungs but also in the cardiovascular system and, therefore, ACE2‐related signaling pathways might even have a role in heart injury. Other proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury include a cytokine storm triggered by an imbalanced response by type 1 and 2 T‐helper cells,
