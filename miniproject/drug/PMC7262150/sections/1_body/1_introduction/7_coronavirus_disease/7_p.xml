 </xref> In the epicenter of the current Italian epidemic, SCD likely occurred in many nonhospitalized patients with mild symptoms who were found dead home while in quarantine. Myocardial biomarkers should be evaluated in all patients with COVID‐19 for risk stratification and prompt intervention. Even after hospital discharge, we should consider that myocardial injury might result in atrial or ventricular fibrosis, the substrate for subsequent cardiac arrhythmias. The extent of myocardial scar, as assessed with cardiac magnetic resonance, might be a powerful tool to better stratify the arrhythmic risk in patients recovered from COVID‐19 who had evidence of myocardial injury at the time of infection.
