<p id="p0025">One problem is the very uneven worldwide distribution of not just R&amp;D on WBE, but also the uneven adoption of WBE for existing purposes such as community-wide illicit drug monitoring. Some countries, such as the U.S., have less experience with the implementation of WBE. For this reason, it will be important to encourage international research collaborations. This would be the best way to ensure adoption of WBE worldwide for monitoring pandemics.</p>
