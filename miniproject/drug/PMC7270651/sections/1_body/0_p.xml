<p id="p0005">Given the continuing concerns surrounding the lack of adequate diagnostic testing for Covid-19 (caused by SARS-CoV-2), even less attention is being paid to what could become an even more urgent need - - the ability to quickly determine the status and trends of Covid-19 within and across communities nationwide. The existing Covid-19 clinical diagnostic tests will prove woefully inadequate for rapidly monitoring (at comparatively low cost) the incidence of Covid-19 community-wide. It is simply not feasible to do repeated individual testing at very large scales.</p>
