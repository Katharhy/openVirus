<p id="p0035">Virus particle loadings in sewage can be quantified by targeting virus functional or structural motifs. Since the half-life of viable SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater seems to be very short, any detection method should account for both viable and non-viable particles. Degradation products (such as RNA fragments) from the virus could also be selected as targets. Detection approaches could include RT-PCR (or allied approaches) and ELISA, coupled with the Most Probable Number (MPN) method for quantifying sewage loadings of combined viable and non-viable virus particles.</p>
