<p>Without first understanding the dynamics that sustain transmission of HIV, prevention and control efforts can only be limited in effectiveness [

 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00067" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Major reductions in incidence have been demonstrated as a result of universal antiretroviral therapy [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00067" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. However, randomized trials demonstrate that implementing such efforts at population levels has shown insignificant differences in HIV incidence [

 <xref rid="B56-viruses-12-00067" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The impact of human mobility on such trials is not well understood and may pose a risk for lowering the measured effectiveness of control efforts. To some degree, migration may be acting as an effect modifier. Studies of prevention efforts that do not acknowledge and measure the role of human mobility in HIV and viral migration on outcomes are unlikely to provide accurate results of their impacts. In fact, the influence of mobility and migration may be so significant that the impact of the intervention may be lost [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00067" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A recent trial found that universal testing in tandem with antiretroviral treatment had the potential to lower HIV incidence, but the authors also recognized that the benefits may be compromised if HIV transmission is concentrated in subgroups [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00067" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Phylogenetic studies that assess the impact of mobile populations are needed to provide a more explicit understanding of the impact of viral migration on HIV prevention and control efforts.
