<p>Since the virus can be transmitted by a person with HIV (PWH) when traveling, or acquired by a traveler who is engaging in risky behavior, it is evident that dissemination and transmission of HIV is bidirectional [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00067" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], indicating that the virus does not discriminate based on direction of movement. Considering the high rate of human mobility at border regions, this would suggest that border populations should be classified as at-risk populations, even if only side of the border has what the WHO considers a generalized epidemic (≥1.0% HIV prevalence) [
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-12-00067" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Allocation of resources and prevention efforts directed to border populations and across borders, may have a greater impact than the disbursement of such resources among non-mobile populations. Furthermore, with the constant influx and outflux of new infections into a regional epidemic, there is a need for consistent vigilance of these patterns to keep incidence rates low on all sides of a border. Epidemiological studies have illustrated the possibility of high frequency of extra-community HIV introductions, and suggest that that repeated introductions of HIV play a significant role in sustaining HIV incidence [
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-12-00067" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Some experts suggest that regulation of cross-border travel is necessary to halt the introduction of diseases and infections into regions and ensure minimal risk of an epidemic occurring or expanding [
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-12-00067" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. However, such approaches would be nearly impossible to enact in today’s age of globalization. Evidence suggests that infection control is optimized when efforts are coordinated across borders [
