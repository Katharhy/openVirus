  <p>Biologically contained IAV reporters exhibit antiviral drug sensitivities similar to those of authentic IAVs. Oseltamivir and zanamivir sensitivity of WSN/33 and WSN/33-
   <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV particles (A and B) or Neth/09 and Neth/09-
   <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV particles (C and D) was measured using the NA-Star influenza virus neuraminidase inhibitor resistance detection kit. Values from three independent replicates, each performed in duplicate, were normalized to the respective untreated control, plotted, and used to calculate IC
   <sub>50</sub>s with GraphPad Prism 7.05. The data line represents the best-fit curve. Statistical significance was determined for each concentration by unpaired two-tailed 
   <italic>t</italic> test and marked where thresholds were reached (*, 
   <italic>P &lt; </italic>0.05; **, 
   <italic>P &lt; </italic>0.01). (E to G) MDCK-HA cells expressing the respective HA were infected with WSN/33-
   <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV, Neth/09-
   <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV, or Viet/04-
   <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV and treated with different concentrations of baloxavir, together with the EnduRen substrate, at 1 h postinfection. Luminescence (in RLUs) was determined directly in live cells every 3 h and normalized to the value obtained under mock-infection conditions. Area-under-the-curve (AUC) values from three independent experiments were plotted and used to calculate IC
   <sub>50</sub>s with GraphPad Prism 7.05. The data line represents the best-fit curve.
