  <p>Generation of a biologically contained H5N1 IAV reporter with gain-of-function HA amino acid substitutions. (A) Previously described crystal structure of the transmissible Viet/04 HA mutant (PDB ID: 4N5Z) highlighting the four amino acid substitutions that confer mammalian transmissibility to H5 HA (H3 numbering) (
   <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). (B) Western blot analysis of MDCK cells stably expressing Viet/04-T-HA and control MDCK cells. Specific antibodies were used to detect HA and actin. (C) Indirect immunofluorescence analysis of the above-mentioned cell lines. HA is stained green, while DAPI was used to stain cell nuclei (blue). Bars, 25 μm. (D) Plaque formation assay for the Viet/04-T-
   <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV on MDCK and MDCK-Viet/04-T-HA cell lines. Each cell line was infected with the same number of PFU, and assays were fixed and stained 36 h later. (E and F) MDCK cells (E) or MDCK-Viet/04-T-HA cells (F) in a 96-well format were infected with Viet/04-T-
   <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV at different MOI (1, 0.1, 0.01, or 0.001 PFU/cell) or mock infected. After 1 h adsorption, EnduRen substrate was added to the overlay medium, and luminescence (in RLUs) was determined directly in live cells every 3 h and normalized to the value obtained under mock-infection conditions. Mean values from three independent experiments are plotted, with error bars representing standard deviations.
