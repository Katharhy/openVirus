<p>Biologically contained viruses, where an essential viral gene is deleted from a pathogen and is expressed in 
 <italic>trans</italic> by a complementing cell line to allow propagation, represent a safe means to study fundamental 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> aspects of pathogen biology and could constitute a risk mitigation strategy for some gain-of-function experiments. Biological containment methods have previously been applied to study highly pathogenic viruses such as Ebola virus and Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus safely at lower containment levels than their usual biosafety level 4 (BSL4) facility requirements (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), thereby opening up a range of valuable experimental activities due to the lower associated operating costs, increased equipment availability, and number of laboratories that can use them. Often, in these methods, the essential viral gene is replaced with a convenient reporter gene, such as one encoding a fluorescent protein or luciferase, in order to simplify subsequent studies such as high-throughput screening of large compound libraries with antiviral potential.
