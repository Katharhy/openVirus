<p>Seasonal influenza A viruses (IAV) can cause an acute respiratory illness in humans, with symptoms including fever, dry cough, headache, muscle pain, and malaise. The disease is typically mild and self-resolving, but it can be more severe and lead to death, particularly in high-risk groups, such as young children, the elderly, and those with chronic underlying health conditions or an immunosuppressed state. Therefore, annual seasonal IAV epidemics remain a major threat to public health and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, including an estimated 290,000 to 650,000 deaths globally (

Moreover, IAVs found in nonhuman hosts (e.g., avian reservoirs) have the potential for sporadic zoonotic transmission to humans and can cause critical disease, such as severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and significant fatalities, even in young, otherwise healthy adults (

The fear is that one of these novel avian IAV strains will eventually adapt to replicate and transmit efficiently in humans, thereby sparking a devastating new influenza pandemic similar in scale to one of the three that occurred in the 20th century: the 1918 H1N1 pandemic, with &gt;40 million deaths; the 1957 H2N2 pandemic, with 1 to 3 million deaths; and the 1968 H3N2 pandemic, with ∼1 million deaths (
