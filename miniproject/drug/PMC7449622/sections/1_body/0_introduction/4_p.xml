<p>Recent efforts in the development of biologically contained IAVs for different applications have been reviewed extensively (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Most previous studies have focused on using common laboratory IAV strains, such as PR8 or WSN, and studying concepts such as (bivalent) vaccine or vector design, drug resistance or screening, host factor dependencies, and RNA packaging. In this study, we sought to assess the applicability of a biologically contained IAV concept, with viral deletion of HA (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), to strains such as highly pathogenic H5N1 and subsequently derived gain-of-function mammalian-transmissible variants that would otherwise require BSL3 or higher biocontainment facilities. Our specific aim was to understand the feasibility of using these tools as a safe risk mitigation strategy to assess antiviral drug susceptibility and antigenicity of new variants without having to generate fully infectious, replication-competent IAVs.
