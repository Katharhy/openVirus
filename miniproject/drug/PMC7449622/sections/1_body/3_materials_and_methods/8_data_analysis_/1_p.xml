<p>For 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase assays, raw luminescence values were averaged from technical replicates within the same experiment, normalized to mock (background) values, and made relative to the initial value of the MOI = 1 condition. Each independent replicate was processed separately. Where necessary, the area under the curve (AUC) of the replication kinetics was determined and used to calculate half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) from the resulting nonlinear regression curve. For analysis of the NA activity assay, raw luminescence values were normalized to background, averaged, and made relative to the untreated control. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated from the resulting nonlinear regression curve. These analyses, and all statistics, were performed using GraphPad Prism version 7.05.
