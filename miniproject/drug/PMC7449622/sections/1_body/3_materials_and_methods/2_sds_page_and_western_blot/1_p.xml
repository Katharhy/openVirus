<p>Cell or virus lysates were prepared in 2× urea disruption buffer (6 M urea, 4% SDS, 1 M β-mercaptoethanol, bromophenol blue), sonicated, and heated to 95°C for 7 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4 to 12% NuPAGE bis-Tris gradient gels (Life Technologies) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare, Amersham). Proteins were detected using antibodies specific for WSN/33-HA (1:5) (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), Viet/04-HA (1:1,000; no. 200-301-976; Rockland), Neth/09-HA (1:500; 19D3 [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]), or β-actin (no. sc-47778; Santa Cruz). The secondary antibody used was a fluorochrome-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin (no. 35519; Thermo Fisher Scientific). A Li-Cor Odyssey scanner was used for detection and quantification.
