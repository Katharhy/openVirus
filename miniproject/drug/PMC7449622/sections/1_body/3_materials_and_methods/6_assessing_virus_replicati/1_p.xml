<p>Cells in 96-well plates were washed once with PBS prior to infections with the different viruses at the appropriate MOI in PBS supplemented with 1 mM Ca

 <sup>2+</sup>, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 1% P/S. After 1 h at 37°C, the inoculum was removed, cells were washed once with PBS, and postinfection medium was added: DMEM supplemented with 0.1% FBS, 0.3% BSA, 20 nM HEPES, 1% P/S, and 1 μg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin, together with 6 μM

Where noted, the virus inoculum was preincubated with the indicated concentrations of monoclonal anti-H5 antibody (no. 200-301-976; Rockland) or polyclonal anti-H5 serum (no. 2705; BEI Resources) at 4°C for 1 h before infection of cells. Also where noted, the indicated concentrations of baloxavir acid (no. HY-109025A; MedChemExpress) or S20 fusion inhibitor (

Real-time luminescence measurements were taken at various time points using an EnVision multilabel reader (Perkin Elmer) or a Dynex MLX luminometer (Dynex Technologies). All experiments included infection of multiple wells for technical replicates, and each experiment was independently performed at least 3 times. Mock-infected wells, otherwise treated identically, acted as negative controls for background luminescence from the reagents.
