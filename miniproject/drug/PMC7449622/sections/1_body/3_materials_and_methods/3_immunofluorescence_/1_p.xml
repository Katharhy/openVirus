<p>Cells were seeded on glass coverslips in 24-well plates and the next day fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min at room temperature (RT), followed by permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. After blocking with 2% FBS for 1 h, staining was performed in 2% FBS for 1 h at RT using antibodies specific for WSN/33 HA (1:5) (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), Viet/04 HA (1:1,000; no. 200-301-976; Rockland), or Neth/09 HA (1:500; 19D3 [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]). The secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and -rabbit IgG antibodies (no. A21202 and A21206; Life Technologies). Cell nuclei were stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 1:1,000), and images were analyzed using a Leica TCS SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope system.
