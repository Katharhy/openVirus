<p>Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and human embryonic kidney (293T) cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (P/S) at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. To generate cell lines stably expressing HA, the respective HA cDNAs were first cloned into pLVX-IRES-Puro (Clontech Laboratories) using XhoI and BamHI (Viet/04) or XhoI and NotI (Neth/09 and WSN/33) restriction sites. HA cDNAs were obtained either from existing vectors (WSN/33, Neth/09, and Viet/04) or by commercial gene synthesis (Viet/04-T; GeneArt; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Both Viet/04-derived HA constructs lacked the sequence encoding the polybasic cleavage site (and were therefore termed HALo), and all constructs were validated by sequencing prior to use. To generate lentiviral particles, 293T cells were cotransfected with pCMVdR8.91, pMD2.G, and the respective pLVX-HA-IRES-Puro construct for 48 h before harvesting of supernatants, filtration through a 0.45-μm filter, and transduction of MDCK cells in the presence of Polybrene (final concentration of 8 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Two days later, transduced cells were selected with puromycin (3.5 μg/ml; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and subcloned by limiting dilution. Clonal cell colonies were expanded, and HA expression was assayed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence.
