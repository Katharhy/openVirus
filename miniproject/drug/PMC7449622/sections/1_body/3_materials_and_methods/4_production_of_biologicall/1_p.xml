<p>WSN/33-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV has been described previously (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Briefly, a pPolI-based plasmid (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>) was constructed harboring the 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase open reading frame (ORF) (REN) flanked by the WSN/33 HA 3′ and 5′ noncoding regions (32 and 45 nucleotides, respectively) and 45 (3′) and 80 (5′) nucleotides of the HA ORF packaging signals. The original HA ORF ATG (in positive sense) was mutated to GTG (pPolI-HA-REN-HA) (

 <italic>Renilla</italic> and Viet/04-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV-like particles, 293T cells were cotransfected with 7 ambisense pDZ plasmids encoding each segment of the respective IAV strain (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, NA, M, and NS but not HA), pPolI-HA-REN-HA, and a pCAGGS vector expressing the respective complementing HA protein. Plasmids to rescue recombinant Neth/09 IAVs have been described previously (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>), and plasmids to rescue recombinant Viet/04 HALo IAVs were kindly provided by Adolfo García-Sastre, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Strain-matched MDCK-HA cells were coseeded together with the transfected 293T cells, and the medium was supplemented with 1 μg/ml tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, MO). Forty-eight hours posttransfection, supernatants were harvested, single clones were plaque purified on fresh MDCK-HA cells, and virus stocks were grown and titrated using standard methods on the respective MDCK-HA cell line. To generate Viet/04-T-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV-like particles, Viet/04-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV was grown on the MDCK cell line expressing Viet/04-T-HA. All virus stocks were sequence verified by full genome sequencing using previously described protocols and primers (
