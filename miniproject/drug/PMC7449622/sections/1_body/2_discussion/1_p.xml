<p>Herein, we describe the application of a biologically contained IAV reporter system to clinically relevant strains, including 2009 pdmH1N1 and highly pathogenic H5N1. We show that by incorporating 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase as the reporter of choice, and by using a stable, cell-permeable substrate (EnduRen), the high dynamic range of luciferase can be combined with real-time live-cell kinetic measurements to track virus replication in a single sample without excessive liquid-handling steps. The biologically contained system relies on the in 
 <italic>trans</italic> expression of HA in a complementing cell line to achieve multicycle replication; thus, the use of appropriate cell lines allows ready comparisons between single-cycle and multicycle replication. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these systems are fully amenable to assessment of antiviral drug sensitivity, with inhibitory effects aligning well with those of wild-type nonreporter viruses. Given that these safe, clinically relevant reporter viruses are already optimized for BSL2 use in multiwell formats, such as 96-well plates, they could be useful for conducting large-scale high-throughput compound screens to identify new antivirals.
