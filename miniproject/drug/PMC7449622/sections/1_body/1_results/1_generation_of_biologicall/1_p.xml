<p>Previous studies have described the construction of a recombinant IAV (A/WSN/33 strain [referred to here as WSN]) in which the HA coding sequence is replaced with sequences for either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase, but 3′ and 5′ packaging regions of the HA segment are maintained (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). In MDCK cells engineered to stably express WSN HA, such reporter IAV-like particles can undergo multicycle replication (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) but are restricted to single-cycle infections in cells lacking expression of a complementing HA molecule (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). While WSN is a commonly used strain in many laboratories because of its high-growth properties and has been used to identify important aspects of IAV replication, we sought to expand use of this technology to more clinically relevant strains, such as 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pdmH1N1) and highly pathogenic H5N1 IAVs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">B</xref>). To this end, we generated MDCK cell lines stably expressing either the HA protein from pdmH1N1 (strain A/Netherlands/602/2009 [Neth/09]) or a modified HA protein from H5N1 (A/VietNam/1203/04 [Viet/04]), which lacks the polybasic cleavage site (termed HALo) (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), and verified their stable expression by Western blotting (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Indirect immunofluorescence also revealed that each engineered MDCK cell line exhibited homogenous expression of the respective HA and that all HAs predominantly localized to the cell surface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Using these cell lines, we were able to successfully rescue and grow recombinant Neth/09-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> and Viet/04-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV-like particles that incorporate a segment expressing 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase and lack the coding and noncoding sequences for their own HAs but are otherwise authentic. Importantly, these Neth/09-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> and Viet/04-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV-like particles, like the original WSN/33-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV, are biologically contained, as they do not undergo multicycle replication to form plaques on MDCK cells but readily form plaques in MDCK cells stably expressing the cognate HA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>). In addition, passaging experiments confirmed that biologically contained IAV-like particles do not propagate in MDCK cells even to low levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1F</xref>), and functional experiments indicated that the IAV-like particles (at least for the WSN strain) can have levels of HA and NA similar to those of authentic virus particles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1G</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">H</xref>).
