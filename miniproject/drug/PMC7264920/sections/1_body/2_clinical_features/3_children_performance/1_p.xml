<p id="Par20">Although the current statistical analysis shows that the infection rate of children is low, it does not mean that children are not susceptible to disease, perhaps because children have less contact with the outside environment and most families pay more attention to the health protection of children, which need to be taken into account. Some studies have found that the average incubation period of children is longer than that of adults, the clinical manifestations of infected children are relatively mild, cough and fever are also common manifestations, symptoms tend to subside, slightly infected people or even no symptoms, just positive nucleic acid test [

The symptoms of infection in children are relatively mild and not easy to be found, but the imaging examination often shows patchy infiltration, if not timely treatment, childrenâ€™s growth and development is seriously affected [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Therefore, children who may contact with high-risk groups should be closely monitored and isolated for early detection and intervention [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Since the symptoms of infected children are mild, treatment with large doses of antiviral drugs or empirical antibiotics is not necessary, unless the condition is severe and no other specific treatment options are available [
