<p id="Par19">The clinical symptoms of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are mainly fever, fatigue and cough, but more than 50% of the infected patients even have no obvious symptoms, which is easy to cause missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In addition to respiratory symptoms, some people who are infected also experience digestive symptoms such as loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Some severe cases can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome or even multi-organ failure (ECMO plays an important role in the treatment of critically ill patients) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Diarrhea, a common symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection, also accounts for a high proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In addition, the total number of white blood cells in adult infected patients is normal or slightly decreased in general laboratory examination, in which the decline of lymphocytes is more obvious, C-reactive protein (CRP) can have a slight increase, and there is a slight increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In obese patients, aspartate aminotransferase, LDL cholesterol and lymphocyte counts decreased significantly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Meanwhile, a retrospective study found statistically significant reductions in eosinophil levels in patients with poor prognosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Imaging finding suggested that most of the infected patients had pneumonia. Chest CT is usually characterized by ground-glass opacity (GGO). Progressive chest CT indicated increased lesions, the accumulative range of lesions was expanded, and in severe cases, diffuse consolidation of both lungs presented as “white lung” [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. So far, most of those infected have mild symptoms and a good prognosis, but the mortality is as high as 17% for the elderly or those with chronic disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. According to the statistical analysis of the current infected data, the infected age is mainly between 40 and 60 years old, among which the male patients are slightly more than the female patients, the infected children are rare, and most of the families of infected children have other family members infected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In addition to the typical clinical manifestations of the respiratory and digestive systems, many patients were treated for obvious skin manifestations (mainly red rash on the back of trunk, urticaria, etc.). Therefore, it is necessary for our clinicians to find such patients in time to avoid misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis [
