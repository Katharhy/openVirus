<p id="Par29">In addition to early detection and early diagnosis of the disease, early treatment is crucial to the prognosis of the disease. Since the outbreak, many research institutions around the world have been conducting clinical trials, using existing potential drugs for in vivo and in vitro research. At present, there are mainly antiviral drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, and some drugs have achieved significant effects, but it is still some time before the treatment of COVID-19 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Studies have shown that ACE2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells, and ACE2 is present in large quantities in human lung and small intestinal epithelial cells, which is essential for the spread of the epidemic. Similarly, ACE2 is a potential therapeutic target [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. It has been found that recombinant human soluble ACE2 can inhibit the growth of SARS-CoV-2 and significantly block the early stage infection of novel coronavirus, which is an important discovery for the treatment of patients with new crown disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. In addition, the use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) can provide protection to the cardiovascular and renal systems of COVID-19 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. There are many similar therapies that inhibit the action mechanism of S protein and ACE2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. A combination of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir has been recommended for clinical trial in the latest guidelines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. In addition, Remdesivir, also a broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus drug, has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 cell infection in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. The first SARS-CoV-2 patient in the United States showed a marked improvement in symptoms after being treated with RDV, which opened the possibility for further clinical application [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Clinical trials of the drug have also been carried out in China, which has a large number of infected people. Favipiravir was approved for the treatment of influenza virus infection in 2014. Through the clinical comparison of 200 COVID-19 patients, it was found that the pneumonia symptoms of the patients receiving favipiravir were significantly improved, with no obvious side effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. With the increasing number of studies on confirmed cases, some drugs with immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory effects have also been used in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Studies have found that the hypercoagulable state of blood is related to the severity of the disease. An anticoagulant drug dipyridamole (DIP) can inhibit the replication of novel coronavirus, significantly improve the condition of severe patients, and play a positive role in the treatment of patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Chloroquine, originally used to treat malaria, was found to inhibit the activity of the SARS virus in vitro during the SARS epidemic, mainly by altering the glycosylation of the viral receptor ACE2, thereby affecting the virus to invade cells. Recent studies have shown that the combined application of ridsivir and chloroquine can effectively inhibit the in vitro activity of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. In addition, chloroquine also has immunomodulatory effects, can inhibit the emergence and progression of viral diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. Abidol has a broad spectrum antiviral effect on respiratory virus and can also inhibit the activity of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Currently, the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia by abidol has entered into phase 4 clinical trials, and is likely to be applied in treatment in the future. Many studies have shown that steroids can effectively suppress lung inflammation, but they can also inhibit the body’s immune response and pathogen clearance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. Steroids were widely used during the SARS and MERS outbreaks, but their side effects also had a huge impact on patients’ health. In the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the WHO on clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection recommend against the use of steroids unless specifically requested. If steroids are used, it is necessary to pay attention to monitor blood sugar, electrolytes during use, and may even appear symptoms of central excitation, such as insomnia, etc., can be symptomatic treatment. In general, steroid therapy is not recommended in the clinical treatment of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. Fibrinolytic enzyme levels and increased activity were found in blood tests of confirmed patients. In vitro experiments, it was found that the serine protease inhibitor TMPRSS2 could prevent novel coronavirus from entering cells, significantly improving the clinical prognosis of patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>]. Vaccines are essential for preventing and treating infectious diseases. In addition to protecting healthy people from infection in an outbreak, vaccines can also help those infected rebuild their immune systems to control or cure the disease. Currently, many research teams are developing new coronavirus vaccines. The university of Pittsburgh study found a vaccine against SARS-Cov-2, which in animal studies has shown to make mice produce antibodies against SARS-Cov-2 and neutralize the virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>]. In addition, some medical teams in China are using plasma from infected patients and traditional Chinese medicine treatment regimens. A study using convalescent plasma therapy found that in four of five infected patients, body temperature returned to normal after the infusion of convalescent plasma, and in three patients, mechanical ventilation was not required after 2 weeks. Although the number of cases in the study is small and the effect of convalescent plasma therapy still needs to be further verified, the effect is quite significant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. At present, there are successful cases of patients with new crowns all over the world, but it is difficult to carry out these protocols on a large scale due to the lack of systematic control analysis. Therefore, we look forward to the early development of effective treatments [
