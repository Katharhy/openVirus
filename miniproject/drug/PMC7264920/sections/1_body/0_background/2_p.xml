<p id="Par12">In early 2020, a case of novel coronavirus was confirmed in Wuhan, China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Within a short period of time, the number of confirmed cases was increasing, and those infected could develop fever, cough, and even severe respiratory syndrome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which quickly drew the attention of the Chinese government [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Researchers found that 27 of the 41 initially confirmed cases had had direct contact with a local seafood market in Wuhan, initially assuming that the new coronavirus might have come from wild animals sold in the market [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Gao et al. collected alveolar lavage fluid from three infected patients and successfully isolated the new coronavirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Electron microscopy has showed that the virus has an envelop, the particles are round or oval with the diameter of about 60–140 nm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Whole genome sequencing analysis has showed that the virus belongs to a new type of coronavirus of the β genus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, Shi et al. obtained almost identical genome-wide sequences in virus samples from 5 patients. The sequence of the new coronavirus was 79.5% similar to SARS-CoV and 96% similar to the coronavirus carried by bats, which might be the potential source of infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Another study found that the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was the closest to the coronavirus carried by pangolins. Thus, the origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be determined [
