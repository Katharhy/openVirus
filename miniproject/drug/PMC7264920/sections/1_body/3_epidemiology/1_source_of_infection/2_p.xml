<p id="Par22">Most of the original SARS-CoV-2 infections came from a local seafood market in Wuhan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The internal environment of the market was similar to the place where SARS-CoV was discovered in 2003 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The wet and dirty environment provides favorable conditions for the virus to survive and reproduce. In addition, a variety of seafood was sold in the market, and there was also illegal trafficking of wild animals, the pathogen was likely to be one of the intermediate hosts or some wild animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. According to the latest research, the virus strain isolated in pangolins is 99% similar to SARS-CoV-2 in sequence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. It is suspected that pangolins may be the potential intermediate host of the virus. Pangolins were also sold in the market [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. It was likely that the first infected people ate the infected pangolins, causing human-to-human transmission. After the outbreak, the local government moved quickly to close the market and conducted a thorough disinfection. Of course, pangolins may not be the only intermediate host, as coronaviruses have been found in many animals, such as camels, pigs, goats, and pangolins. With further research, it is believed that more potential intermediate hosts will be found [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. In addition to wild animals, the researchers found that chickens, ducks, pigs and dogs were less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, while cats were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, providing important information for future animal management [
