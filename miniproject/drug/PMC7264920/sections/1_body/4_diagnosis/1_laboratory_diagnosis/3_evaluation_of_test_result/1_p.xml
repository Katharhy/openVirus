<p id="Par27">Due to the sudden outbreak of the epidemic, there are not enough clinical samples of the detection kits developed by various companies or scientific research insitutions for complete performance confirmation. Therefore, the stability and reliability of various nucleic acid detection kits need to be further verified. Here, it is recommended to use the detection kit containing the control, and it should match with the laboratory equipment, and extract virus samples in strict accordance with the standard operating procedures of the kit, and set up detection procedures. The detection personnel should also analyze the situation of the whole amplification curve and the individual amplification curve after amplification, and the amplification curve is required to present a single peak specific smooth curve, followed by adjusting the detection procedure according to the dissolution curve. In addition, a reasonable indoor quality control scheme is of vital importance. We suggest that one weak positive quality control and three negative quality controls should be set up for each batch of test. All three negative quality controls should be negative, and weak positive quality control should be positive, which is considered as the control of this batch of test. Otherwise, it is out of control and cannot issue a test report. If necessary, it should be retested. For positive results, we should ensure that the fluorescence quantitative PCR results of at least two targets (1ba/N/E) in the test are positive. When only one target is positive, rechecking and even resampling should be requested as much as possible. For the negative results, the infection cannot be completely excluded, and comprehensive analysis of the patientâ€™s symptoms, medical history and imaging findings is also needed [

With the spread of SARS-CoV-2, countries all over the world need rapid and effective methods to detect their own people. A rapid detection method of CRISPR-cas12 was found, which was mainly used to detected SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory throat swab, with a sensitivity of up to 95% and specificity of 100% [
