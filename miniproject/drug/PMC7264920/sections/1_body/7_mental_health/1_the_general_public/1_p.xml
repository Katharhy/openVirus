<p id="Par31">To prevent outbreaks during epidemics, it is usually necessary to isolate high-risk groups and areas, restrict travel and movement of people, and try to avoid transmission between people. Since the outbreak, some measures have been taken all over the world, especially in China, where there has been a massive quarantine. For those who have experienced isolation, it is often an unpleasant experience. For uninfected people, during the period of isolation, they lose their freedom, lose their security, and tend to be impulsive and angry. During the period of isolation in various areas, there will often be conflicts between residents and epidemic prevention personnel. For those who are infected or may be infected, they will lose their freedom during the period of isolation, be separated from their families, and have insufficient understanding of their own illness. As a result, they are more likely to have psychological problems. In severe cases, they even give up their lives and commit suicide. Therefore, for large-scale isolation, it must be implemented on the basis of adequate measurement. In response to the outbreak, tens of thousands of infected people in China, where quarantine measures were first introduced, did not experience mass unrest. Instead, everyone was very cooperative with medical workers. People living in isolated homes and interacting with each other have been reported in the global media. Good mental attitude is also crucial for the recovery of the disease.</p>
