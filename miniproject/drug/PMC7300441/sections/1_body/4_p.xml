<p>Most of the current knowledge about the biology of COVID‐19 in NHP is currently in pre‐prints, published in online repositories, and consists of experimental inoculation studies. The animals targeted in these studies were primarily rhesus (
 <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) and cynomolgus macaques (
 <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>), widely used in clinical research worldwide. Preliminary data indicate that these monkeys, on the 1st day after infection, show changes in breathing pattern, being accompanied by pulmonary infiltrate that remains for at least a week. Although fever is a common symptom in humans, in rhesus monkeys it appears to be a mild symptom (Munster, Feldmann, &amp; Williamson,
