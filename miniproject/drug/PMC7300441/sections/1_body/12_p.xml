<p>Filling in this knowledge of the subject would help the scientific community to understand other possible impacts related to NHP coronavirus infection. Conflicts and interactions between humans and monkeys are constantly reported in Africa and Asia (Karanth, Gupta, &amp; Vanamamalai,

 <xref rid="ajp23158-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), and tourists frequently interact with these animals (Sabbatini, Stammati, &amp; Tavares, 
 <xref rid="ajp23158-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). It is known that NHP are susceptible to several human diseases, such as measles (Jones‐Engel et al.,

Despite this, until more studies are developed focusing on coronavirus, mainly being published in peer‐reviewed journals, we must extrapolate the previous data obtained with other diseases to the current situation.
