<p>A lot of studies on SARS and MERS focus on NHP as good models to study vaccines (Gao, Tamin, &amp; Soloff, 
 <xref rid="ajp23158-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>; Xu, Jia, &amp; Zhou, 
 <xref rid="ajp23158-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). These studies can guide the scientific community to the development of vaccines and drugs against the COVID‐19. Our intention is precisely to alert the scientific community to the need for attention to NHP that are found in zoos within large urban centers. Even though many of those places were closed to visitors, the internal circulation of employees who work directly with these animals cannot be ignored, because there is at least a 50% chance that someone infected will be asymptomatic (Day Michael, 
 <xref rid="ajp23158-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Nishiura et al., 
 <xref rid="ajp23158-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; WHO, 
 <xref rid="ajp23158-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2020c</xref>). In addition, the participation of NHP in the maintenance of the virus in the environment is unknown so far, and whether only Old World primates are susceptible to be infected by COVID‐19 (since they were the only animals used in these studies) or New World primates can also get infected and how the disease would develop on these animals are still unknown.
