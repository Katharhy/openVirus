<p>The positive results for viral RNA in the nasal and oropharyngeal swabs of these animals, especially in the 1st days of infection, is similar to what is observed in humans. This may indicate the high possibility of spread through close contact with infected animals. It is not yet possible to state that humans can directly infect the NHP, as well as the opposite, but these experimental studies that used viral cultures from human patients strongly indicates that SARS‐CoV‐2 can naturally infect these animals.</p>
