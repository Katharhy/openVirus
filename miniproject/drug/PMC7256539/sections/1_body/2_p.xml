<p id="p0020">Briefly, SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell via the angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE-2) receptor, which is expressed by pneumocytes, and leads to the down-regulation of ACE-2 levels. Angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 is normally responsible for converting angiotensin II (Ang II) into vasodilatory and less immune augmenting variants of angiotensin. Angiotensin II binds type 1 angiotensin receptors (AT1Rs) in the lung to induce vasoconstriction and inflammation via activation of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway, which increases cytokine synthesis.

 </xref> Low levels of ACE-2 and high levels of Ang II lead to increased pulmonary vessel permeability, which subsequently results in inflammatory damage to the lung tissue.

 </xref> The proposed primary culprit of severe COVID-19 is the cytokine storm resulting from an unchecked inflammatory response that damages the lung tissue, rendering some patients’ condition severe enough to require assisted ventilation and causing death in a substantial percentage of cases.

 </xref> A study of patients with influenza found that high cytokine levels and low T-lymphocyte levels were predictive of high pharyngeal viral loads and increased mortality.

 </xref> These findings are consistent with COVID-19 laboratory findings, which support the hypothesis that the augmented immune response resulting in the circulation of tissue-damaging cytokines is the primary mediator in pulmonary viral infection.

 </xref> It is also possible that SARS-CoV-2 directly activates mast cells, which are found in the respiratory tract submucosa, with the subsequent release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1.
