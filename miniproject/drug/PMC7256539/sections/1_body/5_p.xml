 </xref> it is important to assess why—among men infected with SARS-CoV-2—younger age is strongly protective against adverse outcomes. It is possible that testosterone has a protective anti-inflammatory effect in younger men, analogous to the effect of estrogen in younger women. Testosterone is reported to have anti-inflammatory functions via suppression of both the cellular and humoral immune systems. In fact, testosterone was found to lower IL-6 and TNF-α levels via inhibition of the NF-κB proinflammatory pathway, analogous to estrogen.
