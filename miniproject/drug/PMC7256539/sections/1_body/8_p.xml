<p id="p0050">In evaluating sex and age case-fatality rate disparities of all 3 recent coronavirus epidemics, it is also important to consider the following potential confounders. First, menâ€™s higher mortality rate may be driven, in part, by their higher rates of smoking, which increases vulnerability of lung tissues to viral infection and other lifestyle factors, which increase their rates of underlying cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

 </xref> Second, it is important to acknowledge that the increased mortality in older adults with COVID-19, both men and women, may be partly attributable to concurrent morbidities, especially cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. In addition, there is concern that these associations are driven by specific antihypertensive medications, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and Ang II receptor blockers drugs, both of which increase the expression of ACE-2 receptors if taken long-term, which could increase the risk of COVID-19 adverse outcomes.

 </xref> suggested that patients chronically treated with an AT1R blocker (eg, losartan) should have a better prognosis after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. This viewpoint is supported by the finding that once SARS-CoV-2 infects the lung, ACE-2 is down-regulated, increasing the availability of proinflammatory Ang II, which leads to lung damage by binding the AT1R. Thus, AT1R blockers (ie, reducing Ang II effects) could protect the patient from excess inflammation and lung damage due to the cytokine storm. Furthermore, a recent study of 5700 patients with COVID-19 treated in New York reported that the mortality rate was modestly higher for patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (32.7%) and/or Ang II receptor blockers (30.6%) than for those not taking these medications (26.7%).
