<p id="p0060">In view of the well-documented role of sex hormones in immune response, specifically the anti-inflammatory effects of estrogen and testosterone and the anabolic effect of testosterone, it is important to consider their potential role in developing treatment strategies for patients with COVID-19, particularly older adults and those with hormone deficiencies. Assessing the disease progression and outcomes of such patients, with particular attention to the underlying mechanisms, may provide important clinical insight. Future research is needed to examine whether hormone replacement therapy may have a pharmacotherapeutic role in treating older adults diagnosed with COVID-19.</p>
