 </xref> First, researchers who infected male and female mice with SARS-CoV reported that male mice had a worse prognosis than did female mice. Specifically, after SARS-CoV infection, male mice had higher viral titers, more pulmonary vascular permeability and/or alveolar edema, and more inflammatory monocytes and macrophages in their lungs than did age-matched female mice.

 </xref> Second, SARS-CoV–infected female mice that were estrogen depleted by oophorectomy or estrogen receptor blocker had a worse SARS-CoV prognosis.

 </xref> Although patients with COVID-19 suffer from lymphopenia, which might cast doubt on the estrogen anti-inflammatory effect, these findings were independent of T- or B-lymphocyte action.
