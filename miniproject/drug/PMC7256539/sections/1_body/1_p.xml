 </xref> In general, the female immune system responds more efficiently to pathogens, producing higher amounts of interferons and antibodies; however, this protective effect, mediated primarily by estrogen, is attenuated in postmenopausal women.

 </xref> For coronaviruses in particular, women have demonstrated a consistent survival advantage over men. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, as well as in both the 2003 SARS-CoV and the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemics, women have substantially lower case-fatality rates than do men.

 </xref> Among the theoretical pathways through which SARS-CoV-2 is hypothesized to damage the tissues, the inflammation and cytokine storm mechanisms are the most widely accepted.

 </xref> It is likely, given the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2, that the anti-inflammatory pathways hold particular relevance for developing therapeutic strategies against COVID-19. Moreover, the anabolic effects of testosterone may have clinical relevance for older male patients with COVID-19. In this article, we explore the effects of estrogen and testosterone and their possible therapeutic role of hormone replacement therapy in older patients with COVID-19.
