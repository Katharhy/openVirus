<p id="p0145">Much of the early information on COVID-19 treatment was derived from experience in SARS. Data on the use of antiviral therapy for COVID-19 in pregnancy are limited.

 </xref> In SARS, ribavirin and corticosteroid showed possible harm with inconclusive clinical data, whereas studies on convalescent plasma, interferon, and lopinavir were inconclusive.

  <sup>51</sup>
 </xref> In the first randomized controlled trial on COVID-19 treatment, 400-mg/100-mg lopinavir-ritonavir twice daily was found to be similar to the standard of care in time to clinical improvement, mortality, and viral shedding.
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>52</sup>
 </xref> This may be due to differences in viral proteases between HIV and coronavirus.

 </xref> An in vitro study on repurposed drugs for COVID-19 reported effective concentration 50 (EC50) of 0.77 for remdesivir, 1.13 for chloroquine, 61.88 for favipiravir, and 109.50 for ribavirin.

  <sup>54</sup>
 </xref> EC50 for hydroxychloroquine was significantly higher than chloroquine.

 </xref> In a French nonrandomized study,

  <sup>56</sup>
 </xref> 26 patients received 200-mg hydroxychloroquine thrice daily for 10 days, 6 of whom also received azithromycin 500 mg on day 1 and 250 mg daily for the next 4 days. Compared with 16 untreated patients, there was significant reduction in viral load at day 6 and shorter duration of viral shedding, with additive effect from azithromycin. In a Chinese nonrandomized study,

  <sup>57</sup>
 </xref> 35 patients were treated with favipiravir 1600 mg twice daily on day 1 and 600 mg twice daily from days 2 to 14 and 45 patients were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir; patients in both arms received aerosolized interferon alfa (IFN-α) 5 million units twice daily. Compared with control, favipiravir was associated with shorter viral shedding and faster radiologic improvement.
