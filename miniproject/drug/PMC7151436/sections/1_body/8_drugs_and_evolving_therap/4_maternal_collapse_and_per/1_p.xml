<p id="p0170">In the unfortunate event of maternal collapse, it can be challenging to regulate and adapt all aspects of infection prevention. The delivery suite is overwhelmed when many personnel simultaneously attempt to resuscitate the collapsed patient, perform a perimortem cesarean delivery, and resuscitate the newborn.
