<p id="p0040">Imaging of the lungs is important in assessing the extent of COVID-19 pneumonia and in follow-up. Evidence on ultrasonographic imaging of the lung in patients with COVID-19 is evolving. In up to 85% of patients, abnormalities are found on imaging during the acute phase.

 </xref> Radiologic features of COVID-19 include patchy infiltrates on chest x-ray (CXR) and ground glass opacities (GGOs) on chest computed tomography (CT) scan.

 </xref> CXRs can be rapidly performed at bedside but may have reduced sensitivity in the early stages of infection. Chest CT scan is more sensitive than CXR (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A and 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B), but its widespread use is limited by availability, the practical but no less important consideration of the need for terminal cleaning to prevent nosocomial transmission, and acceptance by pregnant women. On chest CT, multilobar GGOs are most commonly seen, whereas lower lobe consolidation is more frequently observed in patients with severe and prolonged disease (
