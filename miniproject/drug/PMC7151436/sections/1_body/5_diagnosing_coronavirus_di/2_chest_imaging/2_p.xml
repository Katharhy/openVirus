<p id="p0045">In an epidemic setting where there is very high pretest probability of COVID-19 infection, a positive result on chest CT scan may precede RT-PCR and chest CT may have higher sensitivity for diagnosis.

 </xref> In a case series of 15 pregnant patients with COVID-19 who were exposed to ionizing radiation between 2.3 and 5.8 mGy, all were found to have CT findings of mild disease, which did not worsen with pregnancy.

 </xref> In some circumstances when an earlier diagnosis of COVID-19 would alter the management of an obstetric patient, particularly if the patient is in respiratory distress raising concerns about significant pneumonia or concomitant pathology (eg, pulmonary embolism), CXR, and thereafter chest CT if needed, could be considered. A diagnostic workflow detailing the application of RT-PCR and chest imaging in the assessment of suspected patients with COVID-19 is described (
