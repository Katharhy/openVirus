<p id="p0110">If there is absence of maternal and/or fetal compromise, and emergency cesarean delivery is not indicated, further plans for management of patients are then made (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>). When parturients are acutely ill, it may be challenging to differentiate etiologies based on the presence of tachypnea and tachycardia. The percentage saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen (SpO
 <sub>2</sub>) is a noninvasive continuous monitoring that provides real-time information on peripheral oxygen saturation. It also provides indirect information on adequacy of pulmonary gas exchange, cardiac function, and intravascular volume status. There is a correlation between oxygenation measured by SpO
 <sub>2</sub> and invasive arterial blood gas. An arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO
 <sub>2</sub>) of less than 60 mm Hg corresponds to SpO
 <sub>2</sub> of less than 90%.

 </xref> Delivery units need to be equipped with and use continuous SpO
 <sub>2</sub> monitoring. Disposable low-cost SpO
 <sub>2</sub> finger probes are commercially available and need to be considered when multiparameter monitoring is not available. Moreover, knowing the PaO
 <sub>2</sub>/FiO
 <sub>2</sub> ratio is useful in predicting the degree of lung compromise.
