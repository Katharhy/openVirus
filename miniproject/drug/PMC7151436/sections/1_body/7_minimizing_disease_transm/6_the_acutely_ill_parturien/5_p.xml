<p id="p0125">Cardiovascular causes of desaturation in COVID-19 include systolic failure from viral myocarditis, congestive cardiac failure, and pulmonary edema. The SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of the respiratory epithelial cells of the host. The predominant pulmonary features are from the ACE2 expression in type 2 alveolar cells. Elevated blood pressure is known to occur from interaction between the virus and ACE2.
