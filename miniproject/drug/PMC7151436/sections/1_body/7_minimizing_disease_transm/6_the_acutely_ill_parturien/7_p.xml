<p id="p0135">Pressurized air enriched with oxygen is needed for improving oxygenation in acutely ill patients with respiratory compromise. It can be administered via nasal masks, full face masks, and helmets. Simulation-based experiments have shown the effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with tight fitting oronasal mask and noninvasive ventilation with well-sealed helmets, posing negligible risk of exhaled air dispersion.

 </xref> Similar studies have shown that exhaled air dispersion distance during application of high-flow nasal cannula is shorter than CPAP that tends to be applied less tightly.

 </xref> Hence, centers that are experienced and equipped with negative-pressure rooms could consider noninvasive ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula, and CPAP, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when facilities with full mechanical ventilatory support are overwhelmed.
