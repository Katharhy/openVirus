Although anticoagulation is needed to prevent clotting in the extracorporeal circulation, this complicates hemostasis at the placental site if ECMO is used in the peripartum period. ECMO setup requires multidisciplinary planning and is best done in tertiary institutions. Maternal and child health facilities without cardiac surgical ICUs might not be able to acquire this service. The transfer of critically ill patients to tertiary institutions needs meticulous planning.
