 </xref> A poorly contractile left ventricle signifies cardiac pump failure. In this case, fluids should be restricted and the use of inotropes should be considered. Hyperdynamic cardiac activity as evidenced by “kissing” ventricular walls is suggestive of distributive shock such as in sepsis. This requires fluid resuscitation and the use of vasopressors. To assess the patient’s intravascular volume status, TTE probe can also be used to image the inferior vena cava (IVC). Avoidance of fluid mismanagement is crucial; fluid loading in cardiomyopathy can precipitate congestive cardiac failure that worsens lung oxygenation.
