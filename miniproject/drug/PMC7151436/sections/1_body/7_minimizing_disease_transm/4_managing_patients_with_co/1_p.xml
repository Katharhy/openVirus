<p id="p0070">A pregnant woman presenting to the delivery suite or emergency department needs to be triaged based on the presence of maternal and/or fetal compromise (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>). When there is imminent risk, emergency cesarean delivery must be performed. When there are other maternal and fetal conditions requiring early operative delivery, a coordinated team response is initiated for assessment and optimization of maternal oxygenation and infection control measures. Cesarean delivery is advised for maternal indications, such as worsening condition of the mother related to COVID-19 and fulminant preeclampsia, or fetal indications, such as nonreassuring fetal status. When an operative delivery is not planned, pregnant mothers need to be admitted into the delivery suite for detailed assessment, labor pain management, stratification of infection control precautions, and plans for safe delivery of the fetus. In the presence of COVID-19, the threshold for cesarean delivery should be lower than usual so that infection control procedures can be more readily adhered to and disease transmission minimized.
