<p id="p0065">In a simulated experiment where aerosols were generated using a 3-jet Collison nebulizer and fed into a Goldberg drum, SARS-CoV-2 could survive on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for 72 hours, cardboard 24 hours, and copper 4 hours. The median half-life of the virus in this simulated aerosol was 2.7 hours (95% confidence interval, 1.65â€“7.24 hours).

 </xref> In contrast, in a real-world experiment conducted in Singapore, 3 patients in different rooms had surface environmental samples taken at multiple sites, which revealed that bleach disinfection was highly effective in 2 rooms and fomite contamination was common in the third room. Notably, air, PPE, anteroom, and corridor samples were negative.
