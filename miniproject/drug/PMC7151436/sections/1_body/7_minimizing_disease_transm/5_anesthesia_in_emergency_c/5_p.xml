<p id="p0100">The disposition for patients with COVID-19 after unplanned cesarean delivery should be decided at the earliest instance. Transferring these patients toÂ the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) might compromise and cross-contaminate other postoperative patients. Provisions should be made for suspected and confirmed patients to recover in the operating rooms where cesarean deliveries were performed. Patients should subsequently be transferred directly to isolation wards after recovery.</p>
