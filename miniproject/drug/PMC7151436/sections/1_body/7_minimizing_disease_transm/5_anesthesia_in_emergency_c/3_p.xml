Where there is a working epidural catheter in place for continuous labor analgesia, administering a top-up with potent local anesthetics (eg, 10–15 mL of 1.5% lignocaine, alkalinized with 8.4% sodium bicarbonate) achieves surgical anesthetic plane with a rapid onset of 3.5 minutes.

The time required for surgical readiness is comparable with that for general anesthesia, and neonatal outcomes are better.
