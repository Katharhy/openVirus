<p id="p0175">The number of cases of COVID-19 continues to rise exponentially in many parts of the world. Pregnant women at all gestational ages are counted among this increase, and the gravida in labor and the acutely ill parturient are at the greatest risk. When the woman in labor needs an emergency cesarean delivery or the plan is to achieve a vaginal birth, she and the health support team face many unique challenges. We present here the best evidence available to address many of these challenges, from making the diagnosis in symptomatic cases to the debate between nucleic acid testing and chest imaging and to the management of ill patients in labor. There is reasonably good evidence that vertical transmission is unlikely, and efforts must be taken to prevent infection of the neonate. Given the limited knowledge about this novel coronavirus, which has both similarities and differences to SARS and MERS, the management strategies provided here are a general guide based upon current available evidence and may change as we continue to learn more about the effect of COVID-19 in pregnant women.</p>
