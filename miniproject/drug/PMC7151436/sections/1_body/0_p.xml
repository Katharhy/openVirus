<p id="p0010">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 are the largest group of RNA viruses.

 </xref> A case series of 9 pregnant women at term and late preterm (36 weeks and above) reported good maternal and fetal outcomes.

 </xref> However, all these cases had short time intervals between the diagnosis of COVID-19 and cesarean deliveries, and the true impact of the disease on pregnant women should not be extrapolated from this descriptive study. Moreover, when a larger cohort of 147 pregnant patients was evaluated (WHO-China joint mission report),
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>6</sup>
 </xref> up to 8% of the cohort were either severely ill (respiratory rate ≥30 breaths/min, oxygen saturation ≤93% at rest, or PaO
 <sub>2</sub>/FiO
 <sub>2</sub> &lt;300 mm Hg) or 1% critically ill (respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, or other organ failure that requires intensive care). This rate of severe illness in pregnancy was less than that observed during the influenza (H1N1) pandemic.

 </xref> These statistics came from a country that is now recognized globally to be dealing admirably with the COVID-19 outbreak, having gained experience from the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. It is uncertain whether other health systems would experience severe maternal morbidity below 10% or instead severe illnesses in pregnant women closer to 25% as observed in other coronavirus infections such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and SARS.
