  <p>Chest imaging in patients with COVID-19</p>
  <p>Imaging of 2 patients with COVID-19. 
   <bold>A,</bold> Contrast-enhanced CT of 1 patient in the axial plane across the lower lobes of the lungs shows patchy GGO in a lobular distribution. Early changes of consolidation are present in the posterior segment of the right lower lobe (arrow). 
   <bold>B,</bold> Corresponding chest radiograph does not reveal significant abnormality other than a small focus of consolidation in the medial right lower zone (
   <italic>arrow</italic>), which would have been easily missed owing to projection adjacent to the right cardiophrenic angle and overlapping rib shadow. 
   <bold>C and D,</bold> CT pulmonary angiogram of a different patient with severe pneumonia in the axial and coronal planes showing extensive multilobar GGO (
   <italic>arrows</italic>) with areas of confluent consolidation (
   <italic>arrowheads</italic>) mostly distributed in the posterior and basal regions of the lower lobes. No pulmonary embolism was detected. These findings are not specific to COVID-19 and may be seen in other viral and atypical pneumonias.
