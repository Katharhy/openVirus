As the pandemic evolves rapidly, there are data emerging to suggest that pregnant women diagnosed as having coronavirus disease 2019 can have severe morbidities (up to 9%). This is in contrast to earlier data that showed good maternal and neonatal outcomes. Clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 include features of acute respiratory illnesses. Typical radiologic findings consists of patchy infiltrates on chest radiograph and ground glass opacities on computed tomography scan of the chest. Patients who are pregnant may present with atypical features such as the absence of fever as well as leukocytosis. Confirmation of coronavirus disease 2019 is by reverse transcriptase-polymerized chain reaction from upper airway swabs. When the reverse transcriptase-polymerized chain reaction test result is negative in suspect cases, chest imaging should be considered. A pregnant woman with coronavirus disease 2019 is at the greatest risk when she is in labor, especially if she is acutely ill. We present an algorithm of care for the acutely ill parturient and guidelines for the protection of the healthcare team who is caring for the patient. Key decisions are made based on the presence of maternal and/or fetal compromise, adequacy of maternal oxygenation (SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e;93%) and stability of maternal blood pressure. Although vertical transmission is unlikely, there must be measures in place to prevent neonatal infections. Routine birth processes such as delayed cord clamping and skin-to-skin bonding between mother and newborn need to be revised. Considerations can be made to allow the use of screened donated breast milk from mothers who are free of coronavirus disease 2019. We present management strategies derived from best available evidence to provide guidance in caring for the high-risk and acutely ill parturient. These include protection of the healthcare workers caring for the coronavirus disease 2019 gravida, establishing a diagnosis in symptomatic cases, deciding between reverse transcriptase-polymerized chain reaction and chest imaging, and management of the unwell parturient.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Key words</title><kwd>ACE2</kwd><kwd>acute respiratory distress syndrome</kwd><kwd>acutely ill</kwd><kwd>ARDS</kwd><kwd>coronavirus</kwd><kwd>coronavirus disease 2019</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>maternal morbidity</kwd><kwd>MERS</kwd><kwd>obstetric management</kwd><kwd>pandemic</kwd><kwd>pregnancy</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>SARS</kwd><kwd>severe acute respiratory syndrome</kwd><kwd>vertical transmission</kwd><kwd>virus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="p0010">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

When parturients are acutely ill, it may be challenging to differentiate etiologies based on the presence of tachypnea and tachycardia. The percentage saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen (SpO<sub>2</sub>) is a noninvasive continuous monitoring that provides real-time information on peripheral oxygen saturation. It also provides indirect information on adequacy of pulmonary gas exchange, cardiac function, and intravascular volume status. There is a correlation between oxygenation measured by SpO<sub>2</sub> and invasive arterial blood gas. An arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) of less than 60 mm Hg corresponds to SpO<sub>2</sub> of less than 90%.<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> Delivery units need to be equipped with and use continuous SpO<sub>2</sub> monitoring.

This requires fluid resuscitation and the use of vasopressors. To assess the patient&#x02019;s intravascular volume status, TTE probe can also be used to image the inferior vena cava (IVC).

Pregnant women at all gestational ages are counted among this increase, and the gravida in labor and the acutely ill parturient are at the greatest risk. When the woman in labor needs an emergency cesarean delivery or the plan is to achieve a vaginal birth, she and the health support team face many unique challenges. We present here the best evidence available to address many of these challenges, from making the diagnosis in symptomatic cases to the debate between nucleic acid testing and chest imaging and to the management of ill patients in labor. There is reasonably good evidence that vertical transmission is unlikely, and efforts must be taken to prevent infection of the neonate. Given the limited knowledge about this novel coronavirus, which has both similarities and differences to SARS and MERS, the management strategies provided here are a general guide based upon current available evidence and may change as we continue to learn more about the effect of COVID-19 in pregnant women.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref
