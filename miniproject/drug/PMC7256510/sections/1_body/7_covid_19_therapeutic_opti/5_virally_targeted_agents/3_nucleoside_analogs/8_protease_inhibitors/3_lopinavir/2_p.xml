<p id="p0230">Lopinavir was primarily supposed to inhibit the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease of SARS and MERS. Although it improved the clinical outcomes in SARS patients in a non-randomized open-label trial 
 <xref rid="b0355" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, it is questionable whether HIV protease inhibitors could effectively inhibit the 3-chymotrypsin-like and papain-like proteases of SARS-CoV-2 or not. This is because the molecular design of HIV protease inhibitors was explicitly optimized to fit the C2 symmetry in the catalytic site of the HIV protease dimer, however, this C2-symmetric pocket is absent in coronavirus proteases 
 <xref rid="b0400" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>. In contrast to previous studies that showed after administration of Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Î²-coronavirus the viral loads were significantly reduced, and coronavirus titers were low or absent 
 <xref rid="b0405" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>, it has been shown that the combination of Lopinavir and Ritonavir is not effective in treating patients with severe COVID-19
