<p id="p0410">Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be obtained from COVID-19 patients or by laboratory preparation. They are characterized by high specificity and purity, high safety, and a low rate of blood-borne infections that can overcome the limitations of intravenous immunoglobulins and convalescent plasma therapy. mAbs can be chosen to target the specific epitopes of surface SARS-CoV-2 proteins and could inhibit the virus entry into host cells (including receptor binding, membrane fusion, and sialic acid-binding sites), and reduce replication and infection progression.</p>
