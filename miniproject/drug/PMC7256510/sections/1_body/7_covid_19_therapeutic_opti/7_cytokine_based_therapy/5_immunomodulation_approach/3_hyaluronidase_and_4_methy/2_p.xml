<p id="p0290">It has been demonstrated that the increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1, and TNF-Î± in the lungs of COVID-19 patients, can result in the production of hyaluronan or hyaluronic acid (HA) by inducing the expression of HA-synthase-2 (HAS2) this may contribute to ARDS and death
