<p id="p0305">Interferons regulate the innate immune system, which is vital for killing viruses by regulating gene transcription 
 <xref rid="b0630" ref-type="bibr">[126]</xref>. IFNs regulate the transcription of genes through activating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway after binding to their receptors on the cell surface. IFN type1 is composed of IFN‐β and IFN‐α, and IFN‐α2b has been shown to rapidly suppress the replication of animal and human coronaviruses 
 <xref rid="b0635" ref-type="bibr">[127]</xref>. SARS-CoV-2 can inhibit the activity of IFN type1 through the suppression of the STAT-1 intracellular signaling pathway 
 <xref rid="b0640" ref-type="bibr">[128]</xref>. So, IFN-based therapies could be useful for treating COVID-19.
