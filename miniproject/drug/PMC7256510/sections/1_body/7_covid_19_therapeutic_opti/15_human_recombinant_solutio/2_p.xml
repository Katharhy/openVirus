<p id="p0450">The hrsACE2 solution, previously clinically tested in phase one and two clinical trials (2017), could significantly inhibit COVID-19 infection in the early stage and prevent the virus from attaching to the cell. It reduced SARS-CoV-2 levels in Vero-E6 cells (cells used for virus isolation) up to 1000â€“5000 times (in terms of viral load) in laboratory studies 
 <xref rid="b0845" ref-type="bibr">[169]</xref>. It must be mentioned that this study had some limitations, for example, lung organoids were not tested, and the experiment only simulated the early stages of COVID-19. So, because SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect human blood vessels and enter the kidneys, and hrsACE2 could prevent this occurrence, it might be used in the clinic. However, further investigations are needed.
