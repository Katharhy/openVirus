<p id="p0180">It should be mentioned that the panel of National Institutes of Health (NIH) does not recommend the application of any agent for pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 outside the setting of a clinical trial 
 <xref rid="b0305" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Except for the clinical trials, some medications are not recommended for use in the clinic, like the combination of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin because of the potential for toxicity. Other conceivable treatments are not recommended such as Lopinavir/Ritonavir or otherÂ protease inhibitors (used for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)) because of unfavorable pharmacodynamics and negative clinical trial data, Interferons because of lack of efficacy in the treatment of SARS and MERS, Janus kinase inhibitors (e.g., Baricitinib 
 <xref rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>) because of their broad immunosuppressive effects, and systemic corticosteroids during the treatment of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 without ARDS.
