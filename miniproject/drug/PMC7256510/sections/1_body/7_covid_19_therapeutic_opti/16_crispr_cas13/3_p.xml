<p id="p0460">CRISPR Cas13 is a type VI CRISPR-associated RNA-guided ribonuclease, which targets a specific sequence of RNA. Three protein families have been recognized, including Cas13a (formerly known as C2c2), Cas13b, and Cas13c

 <xref rid="b0855" ref-type="bibr">[171]</xref>. Cas13a enzymes can also be a suitable tool for nucleic acid sequence detection 
 <xref rid="b0860" ref-type="bibr">[172]</xref>. In addition, since Cas13 and inactive Cas13 target specific RNA sites for cleavage and inhibition, respectively, they could be used as an effective COVID-19 therapy. However, further investigations are essential.
