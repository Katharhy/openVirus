<p id="Par33">Collectively, in this review we summarized the current state of knowledge on FDA-approved drugs with potentials for treating SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic. Most importantly, given that patients affected by this disease commonly have cardiovascular comorbidities, a careful evaluation of the possible cardiovascular complications of these drugs is crucial. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> summarizes the updated drugs with anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential, pharmacologic mechanisms, preliminary results of studies, ongoing clinical trials, drug metabolism, and the possible cardiovascular complications. Most of the drugs are based on repurposing therapeutic agents previously designed for other applications. These agents can be divided into two categories, including those with antiviral or immune-modulating effects. We reviewed several drugs with updated information until the middle April 2020. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows that among the aforementioned drugs, remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, and interferon-Î²1 have been less reported with cardiovascular complications. We believe that this review provides additional cardiovascular concerns along with the aggressive exploration of candidate drugs with anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential.
