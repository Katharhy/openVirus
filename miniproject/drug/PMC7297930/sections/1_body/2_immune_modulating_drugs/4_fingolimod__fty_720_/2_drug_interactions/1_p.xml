<p id="Par31">Fingolimod is primarily metabolized by CYP4F2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Since few drugs are metabolized by CYP4F2, fingolimod is expected to have a relatively low potential for drug-drug interactions. However, it should be used with caution when combined with class Ia and III anti-arrhythmic agents and beta-blockers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. CYP4F2 genotypes were observed contributing to both warfarin clearance and sensitivity differences [
