<p id="Par27">Type 1 interferons (IFN-I) play a major role in antiviral immunity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Because of their immunomodulatory properties, IFN-Î² is used to treat many diseases, including multiple sclerosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. When used alone or in combination with other drugs, IFN-I exerts a broad-spectrum antiviral effect against HCV, RSV [
