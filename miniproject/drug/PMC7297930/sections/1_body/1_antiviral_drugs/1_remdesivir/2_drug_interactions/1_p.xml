<p id="Par4">As a prodrug, remdesivir is predominantly metabolized by hydrolase activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It is also a substrate of CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 in vitro but given its rapid distribution, metabolism, and clearance, coadministration with inhibitors of these CYP isoforms is unlikely to increase remdesivir levels.
