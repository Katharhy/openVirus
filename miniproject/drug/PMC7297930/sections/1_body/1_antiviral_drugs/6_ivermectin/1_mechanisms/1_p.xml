<p id="Par18">Ivermectin causes an influx of Cl ions through the cell membrane that results in hyperpolarization of ion channels, leading to muscle paralysis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Notably, studies on SARS-CoV proteins have revealed a potential role of importin α/β 1 during infection [
