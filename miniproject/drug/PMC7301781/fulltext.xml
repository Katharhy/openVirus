Those who accepted the invitation and confirmed they were residents of New Delhi, were above 20 years of age and had a minimum graduate level education received the questionnaire. The study population consisted of 992 participants (out of the 2876 invited) of which 11.2 % were aged between 21&#x02013;35 years, 46.3 % between 36&#x02212;50 years, 6.5 % were over 65 years of age and the remaining 35 % were between 51&#x02013;65 years. Ethical clearance and consent were obtained for the same. The data was subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS 20.0. Shapiro-Wilk test indicated the data to be normally distributed.

This could be associated with high levels of anxiety and stress because of isolation, indicating adverse mental health. (<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Rajkumar, 2020</xref>)</p><p id="par0045">Nutritional factors are interlaced with human behaviour, and emotions while playing a critical role in not just the initiation, but also the severity and duration of depression. Numerous reports support the view that stress can either increase or decrease caloric intake, and chronic stress exposure can lead to either obesity or anorexia (<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Sathyanarayana Rao et al., 2008</xref>). Variations in eating patterns were observed in the present study in 79.5 % of participants, with people aged 35&#x02013;50 years experiencing maximum alterations in diet patterns that were positively correlated with the practice of social distancing and fear of acquiring the disease on meeting someone. Though not significant, 26.3 % of respondents stated that they started consuming more alcohol/drugs/tobacco, raising an alarm, as isolation might lead to an escalation in alcohol misuse and probable development of alcohol use disorder in high-risk persons during and after the pandemic (<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Clay and Parker, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="par0050">It has been reported that during quarantine, inadequate basic supplies can cause resentment. 35.4 % of the participants commented that they could sustain lockdown; however majority of the respondents could not manage either due to lack of basic amenities and medical needs (31.8 %) or due to emotional reasons (32.8 %) Blendon RJ also stated that lack of regular medical care was a concern for participants (<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Brooks et al., 2020</xref>). Financial hardships are often experienced by individuals during quarantine. Lockdown majorly affected the work and income of 63.4 % of the population that was positively related to people aged 35&#x02013;50 years, followed by 50&#x02013;65 years, impacting their financial status. Even though 49.7 % of the study population claimed to have sufficient funds to manage the lockdown situation, remaining were either uncertain about it or did not have the resources to sustain it. Monetary loss is a stressor during and post isolation because people are unable to work and professional activities are interrupted unprecedentedly; the effects appear to be long lasting. Financial loss due to quarantine created severe socio-economic distress (<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Pellecchia et al., 2015</xref>) and was established to be a contributing factor for symptoms of mental health disorders, anger and anxiety (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Mihashi et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p id="par0055">Although stigma has aggravated the anguish from many major epidemics in the past, with various studies suggesting that patients were being treated differently, being avoided, treated with fear and suspicion and received critical comments (<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Wilken et al., 2017</xref>), in the current study 71.7 % believed that acquiring COVID-19 was not a social taboo.</p><p id="par0060">The present lockdown which was initially proposed for 21 days was eventually extended for another 3 weeks. Longer quarantines have a direct correlation with the mental health outcomes and the duration of the lockdown is a predominant stressor affecting the mental health of individuals (<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Brooks et al., 2020</xref>).During the SARS outbreak, many studies investigated the mental health impact on the non-infected community, revealing significant psychiatric morbidities (<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Sim et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p id="par0065">Even when people adhere to the lockdown, rather than comply, various moral and mental health issues are raised, creating a debate about individual rights versus such public health interventions during a crisis. However, if authorities are strategic in their planning, lockdowns may become more effective and with fewer effects on the mental health of people.</p><sec id="sec0005"><title>Author contributions</title><p id="par0165">
