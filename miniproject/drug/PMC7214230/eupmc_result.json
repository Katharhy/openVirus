    "Human coronaviruses are known as respiratory pathogens mainly associated with a range of respiratory diseases. In the past 18 years, the beginning of severe acute respiratory syndrome human coronavirus (SARS-HCoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and now the (COVID-19) have driven the HCoV into the platform of the scientific community due to their high pathogenicity in humans. Our study about the HCoV has contributed extensively to the understanding of HCoV pathogenesis its outbreak and precautionary measurements mainly COVID-19. By the 16-February 2020, total existing diagnosis cases of COVID-19, in china now numbered around 57,255, total cumulative diagnosis is about 68,592, total existing suspicion is about 8228, a total severe existing disease 11,272, the total cumulative cure is about 9671 with more than 1666 cumulative deaths have been reported. The purpose of the review is to summarize the present knowledge on the viral diversity, reservoir hosts, and geographical distributions of Human coronavirus (COVID-19) in China."
