<p id="Par5">CoVs are a group of large enveloped RNA viruses of the family Coronaviridea family. Together with Coronaviridae, Roniviridae and Artierivirdae are classified under the Nidovirale order [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. According to the International Committee for the taxonomy of viruses, CoVs are further divided into four main genera, 
 <italic>Alpha, Beta, Gemma</italic> and 
 <italic>Delta</italic> coronaviruses based on the sequence comparison of the entire viral genome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The number of species will continue to increase as there are still many unclassified CoVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, among these, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are identified to be either in the 
 <italic>Alpha</italic> or 
 <italic>Beta</italic> coronaviruses, HCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and 2019-nCoV.
