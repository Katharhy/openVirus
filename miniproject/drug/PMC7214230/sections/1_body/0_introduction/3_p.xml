In 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV causes mild to severe fever, cough, diarrhea and shortness of breath (De Wit et al., 2013. Both viruses; MERS and MERS-CoV are zoonotic. Nevertheless, both viruses can be transmitted from human to human (de Wit et al., 2016). In contrast, a few other human CoVs of zoonotic origin only cause mild infections of the respiratory tract, such as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 (Gaunt et al. 2010). In 2004–2005, two more human coronaviruses were discovered (HCoV-NL63) causes mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections and sever lower tract infection and (HKU1) causes acute respiratory distress and pneumonia [
