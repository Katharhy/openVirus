<p id="Par25">Human coronaviruses have been identified as mild respiratory pathogens that affect the human population. However, it was the emergence of COVID-19 that thrust these HCoV into the spotlight of the research field. The outbreak of COVID-19 is considered more severe than the previous SARS-CoV and MERS. Therefore most of the HCoV research today is concerned towards 2019-nCoV which has been recently named COVID-19. More emerging HCoVs might likely surface to threaten global public health. As the high mortality rates of the two past outbreaks i.e. SARS-CoV 10%, and MERS-CoV 35%. Therefore, the study of the pathogenesis of all HCoVs especially COVID-19 would gain more insights for the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines.</p>
