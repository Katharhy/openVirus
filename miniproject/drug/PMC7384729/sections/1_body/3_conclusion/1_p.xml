<p id="Par50">Hypertension is strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection possibly due to the proinflammatory state of this chronic illness in addition to the hypercytokinaemia that occurs in COVID-19. Myocardial injury is a prevalent complication in hospitalized patients, with or without previousÂ CV disease, and presents a significant association with in-hospital mortality and a worse evolutive prognosis. It is worthy to highlight the importance of serial troponin dosage as a prognosis marker.
