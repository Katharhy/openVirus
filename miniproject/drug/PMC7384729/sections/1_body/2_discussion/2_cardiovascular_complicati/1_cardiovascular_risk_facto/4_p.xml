<p id="Par16">A retrospective cohort study included 126 patients with COVID-19 and pre-existent hypertension, and 125 age- and sex-matched patients with COVID-19 without hypertension. Among hypertensives, 21.3% had more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and higher death rate, 10.3% vs. 6.4%, when compared withÂ the non-hypertension group, indicating that hypertension is a critical risk factor associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Also, hypertensives with COVID-19 presented higher concentrations of high-sensitivity CRP, procalcitonin, and IL-6 when compared to controls, indicating that hypertension enhances inflammation in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, hypertensive patients undergoing anti-hypertensive therapy with RAAS blockers presented a less profound inflammatory profile when compared with non-ARBs/ACEi treatment [
