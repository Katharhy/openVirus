<p id="Par48">Therefore, ACEi/ARBs are possibly potential drugs for COVID-19 treatment in patients with pre-existing hypertension, due to their capacity of reducing the hyperinflammatory state particularly observed in patients with critical SARS-CoV-2, although a less significant reduction in 1L-6 serum levels suggests that RAAS blockers alone might be inefficient towards inflammation control [

Hence, authors are postulating a possible beneficial synergic effect between a ACEi/ARB combination with IL-6R inhibitors towards inflammation attenuation in patients with hypertension and COVID-19, requiring more robust evidence through randomized controlled trials [
