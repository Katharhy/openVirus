<p id="Par45">Nevertheless, despite preserving 8 of the 14 amino acid residues that make up the coronavirus binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV, a three-dimensional analysis of the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2-binding site reveals that enhanced ACE2 receptor-binding affinity, along with the presence of a novel polybasic furin cleavage site inserted at the boundary of the S1/S2 subunits of the spike S-protein, may account for the increased infectivity and virulence of the SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with SARS-CoV [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. It is important to highlight that, despite the structural homology between ACE2 and ACE, its enzymatic active sites are different and, as a result, ACEi in clinical use do not directly affect ACE2 activity. In addition, ACE2 plays a well-known role in the ventricular function recovery of patients with myocardial injury, because it inhibits angiotensin II activity [
