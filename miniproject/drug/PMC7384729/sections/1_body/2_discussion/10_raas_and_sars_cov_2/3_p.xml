<p id="Par44">Preliminary studies showed that SARS-CoV-2, through its surface protein 
 <italic>Spike</italic>, is capable of binding to ACE2-anchoring receptor in host cells, facilitating its entry in cardiac and lung cells, specially deregulating RAAS and causing a downregulation effect of ACE2, which leads to the accumulation of angiotensin II with proinflammatory effect. The SARS-CoV-2 surface features the multiple spike glycoproteins (S) displayed in a crown-like appearance (corona) which, after being primed by the host’s TMPRSS2 membrane protease, are used by the virus to engage its main internalization receptor: ACE2, the same functional receptor of the earlier SARS-CoV [
