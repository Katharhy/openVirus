 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] reported that the increase of serum troponin in patients with or without previous CV disease has been directly related with an increase of plasmatic NT-proBNP levels, increasing mortality, being characterized as a marker of poor prognosis. Nonetheless, the increase of troponin in individuals with previous CV disease characterized more severe clinical outcomes and higher mortality when compared to patients without previous heart disease and increased troponin values [
