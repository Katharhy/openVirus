 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In a pathophysiological standpoint, this phase is characterized by hyperactivity of inflammatory immune response, promoting a cytokinetic storm, resulting in hypercytokinaemia, mainly at the expense of interleukin 6 and 2 (IL-6 and IL-2), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Hypercytokinemia causes endothelial damage and tissue factor exposure with consequent activation of the coagulation cascade, generating a state of hypercoagulability, thromboembolic events, and increased risk of bleeding by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In addition, this phase is characterized by cytopenias and increased D-dimer [
