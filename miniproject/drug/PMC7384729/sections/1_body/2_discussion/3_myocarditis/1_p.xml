<p id="Par18">The SARS-CoV-2 infection, mainly in its severe forms, apparently induce an aggression to the myocardium resulting in myocarditis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Shi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] reported that patients with myocardial injury, defined by the increase of troponin levels, presented mortality greater than those without myocardial injury (51.2% vs. 4.5%;

In addition, myocardial injury was associated with a higher incidence of ARDS (58.5% vs. 14.7%), higher need of non-invasive (46.3% vs. 3.9%) or invasive ventilation (22.0% vs. 4.2%), and complications such as acute kidney injury (8.5% vs. 0.3%) and coagulopathy (7.3% vs. 1.8%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, troponin seems to be a marker of worse prognosis and mortality in patients with COVID-19. In addition, patients with an increase of troponin present higher levels of leukocytes, D-dimer, CRP, ferritin, and IL-6, portraying an important correlation between myocardial injury and inflammatory hyperactivity triggered by the viral infection [
