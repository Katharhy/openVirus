<p id="Par21">On physical examination, the presence of hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, signs of low cardiac output, and a third heart sound have been reported. It is noteworthy that the electrocardiogram (ECG) may show diffuse ST segment elevation with concave morphology in association with a significant increase in troponin, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)/NT-proBNP, and evidence of inflammatory activity [
