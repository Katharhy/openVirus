<p id="Par19">The pathophysiology regarding myocardial damage caused by COVID-19 infection is not completely elucidated. However, studies highlight that the pathogenesis may reflect a process of viral replication and dissemination within the cardiomyocytes themselves. Moreover, it should be noted that hypercytokinaemia triggered by SARS-CoV-2 with consequent systemic inflammation may induce myocardial damage [
