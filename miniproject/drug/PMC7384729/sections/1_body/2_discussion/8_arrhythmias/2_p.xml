<p id="Par36">Supporting this hypothesis, some reports describe a strong correlation between high troponin levels and increased CRP with a higher incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and greater need of mechanical ventilation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Guo et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] also correlated the increase in NT-ProBNP levels with the onset of malignant arrhythmias, suggesting the relationship between acute myocarditis and arrhythmias. However, it is necessary to keep in mind that these patients who evolve with a severe inflammatory phase develop severe hypoxemia and hydroelectrolytic disorder, causing arrhythmias potentially related to potassium disorders [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Moreover, transient complete atrioventricular block was also described in critical patient, raising the possibility of myocarditis or due to increase of pulmonary artery pressure [
