<p id="Par41">Ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir are also under investigation in numerous clinical trials for COVID-19 and they also may result in QT interval prolongation, through IKr blockade, especially in patients with baseline QTc abnormality. In a randomized, controlled, open-label trial with 199 patients, investigating lopinavir/ritonavir efficacy for SARS-CoV-2 infection, only 1.1% of the patients in the lopinavir/ritonavir group developed QT interval prolongation and no clinical benefit was observed with lopinavir/ritonavir treatment beyond standard care [
