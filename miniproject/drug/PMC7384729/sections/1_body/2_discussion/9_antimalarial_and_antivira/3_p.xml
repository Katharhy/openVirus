<p id="Par39">Macrolides, such as azithromycin, are antibiotics with immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects that also carry the risk of QT interval prolongation and/or torsade des pointes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].Â In a pathophysiological perspective, it is known that both antimalarial drugs and macrolides produce a QT interval prolongation via a blockade of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr), encoded by the human-ether-a-go-go-related gene, causing a delay in phase 3 rapid repolarization of the action potential. This mechanism lengthens ventricular repolarization and the duration of ventricular action potential, leading to after depolarizations, due to activation of depolarizing currents, and resultant ventricular extrasystoles. Moreover, recurring ventricular extrasystoles associated with areas of slow conduction optimizes electrical re-entry circuits, increasing the risk of torsades des pointes and sudden cardiac death [
