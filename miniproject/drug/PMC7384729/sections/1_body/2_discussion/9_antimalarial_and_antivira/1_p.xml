<p id="Par37">The ECG plays a key role in monitoring the corrected QT interval (QTc) in hospitalized patients using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin. It is noteworthy that this drug association is being used, by some centers, in hospitalized patients because of their potential ability to interfere in the cell endocytosis of the virus. However, both drugs are correlated with the prolongation of the QT interval and consequently with an arrhythmogenic potential for malignant ventricular arrhythmias, especially polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with enlarged QT interval (Torsades des Pointes) [
