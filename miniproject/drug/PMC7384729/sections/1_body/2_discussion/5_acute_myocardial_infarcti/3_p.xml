<p id="Par29">Bioinformatics studies suggested that some binding proteins and viral envelope glycoproteins may bind to both porphyrin and the β-chain of hemoglobin. This association may lead to a decrease of available serum hemoglobin and, consequently, to hypoxemia, with pulmonary and cardiac consequences. The inability to perform gas exchange may precipitate an intense inflammation of lung tissues [

Type-2 AMI, which occurs due to a myocardial oxygen demand disproportionate to the supply, is explained by hypoxemia associated with increased cardiac demand due to systemic infection. It is estimated that ~7% of patients have myocardial ischemia or myocarditis [
