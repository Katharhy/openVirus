<p id="Par33">There is evidence that infection by COVID-19 predisposes to a prothrombotic state by direct mechanisms (microvasculitis due to viral damage), indirect mechanisms (downregulation of ACE2 receptor, hypoxia, and DIC), and even behavioral mechanisms (bed restriction due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and decreased deambulation due to social isolation) [

According to recent studies, this prothrombotic state could increase the risk of arterial thrombosis but also of venous thromboembolism, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) described in patients with severe infection by SARS-CoV-2 [
