<p id="Par34">A Chinese study with 449 patients, of whom 99 used low-molecular-weight heparin for at least 7 days, demonstrated that D-dimer levels, prothrombin time, and age were positively associated with a 28-day mortality. The mortality was similar between those who used or did not use heparin, but it was lower among those who used heparin in the subgroup with D-dimer six times greater than the upper limit (40.0% vs. 64.2%,
