We provide a broad review of the clinical evolution of COVID-19, emphasizing its impact and implications on the cardiovascular system. The pathophysiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by overproduction of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;) leading to systemic inflammation and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, acutely affecting the cardiovascular system. Hypertension&#x000a0;(56.6%) and diabetes (33.8%) are the most prevalent comorbidities among individuals with COVID-19, who require hospitalization. Furthermore, cardiac injury, defined as elevated us-troponin I, significantly relates to inflammation biomarkers (IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP), hyperferritinemia, and leukocytosis), portraying an important correlation between myocardial injury and inflammatory hyperactivity triggered by viral infection. Increased risk for myocardial infarction, fulminant myocarditis rapidly evolving with depressed systolic left ventricle function, arrhythmias, venous thromboembolism, and cardiomyopathies mimicking STEMI presentations are the most prevalent cardiovascular complications described in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 tropism and interaction with the RAAS system, through ACE2 receptor, possibly enhances inflammation response and cardiac aggression, leading to imperative concerns about the use of ACEi and ARBs in infected patients. Cardiovascular implications result in a worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of precocious detection and implementation of optimal therapeutic strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Cardiovascular diseases</kwd><kwd>Diseases</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Currently, the world is facing a pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), etiological agent of COVID-19 disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The first signs of the new virus began to show up in December 2019 in China. In this century, two coronavirus epidemics&#x000a0;occurred, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 presents a transmissibility ten times faster than 2002 SARS-CoV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Due to its fast dissemination, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization&#x000a0;(WHO). By the end of June 2020, the world had already registered more than 9 million individuals contaminated, with more than 450,000 deaths.</p><p id="Par3">The coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses, with great capacity for fast mutations and recombination, causing respiratory or intestinal infections in humans and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs through the coupling of S-protein located on the surface of the virus with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which acts as a receptor for the virus. ACE2 is mostly present in the lungs and seems to be the main gateway for the virus. It is also present in great amounts in the heart, which can lead to cardiovascular&#x000a0;(CV) complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">The main clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are respiratory, varying from a mild presentation to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), being potentially fatal.&#x000a0;Moreover, as in other respiratory infections, pre-existing CV diseases and risk factors can increase the severity of COVID-19, leading to the aggravation and decompensation of chronic underlying cardiac pathologies as well as acute-onset of new cardiac complications&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], highlighting&#x000a0;that myocardial injury can be present in approximately 12% of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Within the&#x000a0;CV manifestations of COVID-19, we can highlight four different aspects: (a) CV risk factors and established CV disease is associated with a worse prognosis, (b) appearance of acute CV complications in previously healthy individuals, (c) promising therapies with antimalarials and antivirals present important CV side effects, and (d) questioning the safety of the use of renin&#x02013;angiotensin&#x02013;aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors regarding&#x000a0;an increased risk of COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].

Approximately 80% of the cases are resolved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">The second phase, or moderate pneumonia, occurs approximately in 15% of the patients and from the tenth day the symptoms begin to worsen with dyspnea, cough, and oxygen saturation decrease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], with signs and symptoms&#x000a0;suggesting progession for lower respiratory tract infection.&#x000a0;Laboratory evaluation reveals an increase of inflammatory reagents such as C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, and D-dimer,&#x000a0;evidencing an important inflammatory activity and a prothrombotic component of the disease. Additionally, a chest computed tomography (CT) may demonstrate a bilateral peripheral pulmonary infiltrate in a well-defined ground-glass pattern,&#x000a0;indicating the development of viral pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">About 5% evolve to the third phase, or severe pneumonia, with worsening of the respiratory condition, hypoxemia, and fever [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].

Hypercytokinemia causes endothelial damage and&#x000a0;tissue factor exposure&#x000a0;with consequent activation of the coagulation cascade, generating a state of hypercoagulability, thromboembolic events, and increased risk of bleeding by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Also, hypertensives with COVID-19 presented higher concentrations of high-sensitivity CRP, procalcitonin, and IL-6 when compared to controls, indicating that hypertension enhances inflammation in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Shi et al.

In addition, myocardial injury was associated with a higher incidence of ARDS (58.5% vs. 14.7%), higher need of non-invasive (46.3% vs. 3.9%) or invasive ventilation (22.0% vs. 4.2%), and complications such as acute kidney injury (8.5% vs. 0.3%) and coagulopathy (7.3% vs. 1.8%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, troponin seems to be a marker of worse prognosis and mortality in patients with COVID-19.

The potential mechanism seems to be viral myocarditis caused by SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Fulminant myocarditis associated with cardiogenic shock may be associated with the development of both ventricular and atrial arrhythmias, as myocardial inflammation itself with severe necrosis may develop re-entry points in the electrical circuit, evolving with ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">Supporting this hypothesis, some reports describe a strong correlation between high troponin levels and increased CRP with a higher incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and greater need of mechanical ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Guo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] also correlated the increase in NT-ProBNP levels with the onset of malignant arrhythmias, suggesting the relationship between acute myocarditis and arrhythmias. However, it is necessary to keep in mind that these patients who evolve with a severe inflammatory phase develop severe hypoxemia and hydroelectrolytic disorder, causing arrhythmias potentially related to potassium disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

It is noteworthy that this drug association is being used, by some centers, in hospitalized patients because of their potential ability to interfere in the cell endocytosis of the virus. However, both drugs are correlated with the prolongation of the QT interval and consequently with an arrhythmogenic potential for malignant ventricular arrhythmias, especially polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with enlarged QT&#x000a0;interval (Torsades des Pointes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

This mechanism lengthens ventricular repolarization and the duration of ventricular action potential, leading to after depolarizations, due to activation of depolarizing currents, and resultant ventricular extrasystoles. Moreover, recurring ventricular extrasystoles associated with areas of slow conduction optimizes electrical re-entry circuits, increasing the risk of torsades des pointes and sudden cardiac death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Antiviral drugs, such as remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin, are also being administered in patients with more severe COVID-19 due to their potential benefit in viral RNA synthesis inhibition, diminishing RNA translation and viral exocytosis in host cells. In a cohort of 61 patients who received remdesivir therapy, 12% of the patients evolved with hypotension, being one of the most common serious adverse event, particularly in patients undergoing invasive ventilation.

We know that these drugs are among the most commonly prescribed for the treatment of hypertension, diabetes, and heart failure worldwide, clinical conditions that are strongly associated with an increased risk of an unfavorable evolution of COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">Some studies suggest that the cardiac damage secondary to SARS-CoV-2 may be linked to ACE2, present in the cell membrane of&#x000a0;CV, lung, and kidney tissues. The physiological role of ACE2 is to perform the conversion of angiotensin II in a molecule of angiotensin 1&#x02013;7, causing vasodilation and decrease of hydric retention, through Mas receptor, acting as counter-regulator of the blood pressure elevation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">Preliminary studies showed that SARS-CoV-2, through its surface protein <italic>Spike</italic>, is capable of binding to ACE2-anchoring receptor in host cells, facilitating its entry in&#x000a0;cardiac and lung cells, specially deregulating RAAS and causing a downregulation effect of ACE2, which leads to the accumulation of angiotensin II with proinflammatory effect. The SARS-CoV-2 surface features the multiple spike glycoproteins (S) displayed in a crown-like appearance (corona) which, after being primed by the host&#x02019;s TMPRSS2 membrane protease, are used by the virus to engage its main internalization receptor: ACE2, the same functional receptor of the earlier SARS-CoV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">Nevertheless, despite preserving 8 of the 14 amino acid residues that make up the coronavirus binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV, a three-dimensional analysis of the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2-binding site reveals that enhanced ACE2 receptor-binding affinity, along with the presence of a novel polybasic furin cleavage site inserted at the boundary of the S1/S2 subunits of the spike S-protein, may account for the increased infectivity and virulence of the SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with SARS-CoV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Studies demonstrate that ACE2 deactivation may play a harmful role in the development of respiratory failure and its progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. It is important to highlight that, despite the structural homology between ACE2 and ACE, its enzymatic active sites are different and, as a result, ACEi in clinical use do not directly affect ACE2 activity. In addition, ACE2 plays a well-known role in the ventricular function recovery of patients with myocardial injury, because it inhibits angiotensin II activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">Likewise, individuals with hypertension would have a higher expression of ACE2 secondary to the use of RAAS inhibitors, which would potentially increase the susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV-2. In animal models, the use of these drugs can generate an upregulation effect, producing a greater number of ACE2 receptors in the myocardium and lung cells, inferring a facilitated entry of the virus into the host cells consequently enhancing SARS-CoV-2 virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Nonetheless, evidences initially deducing that the use of RAAS blockers during the COVID-19 might be deleterious were not confirmed.</p><p id="Par47">In a large population-based case&#x02013;control study, the impact of RAAS blockers use on COVID-19 severity was assessed in 6,272 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection; the use of ACEi/ARBs was not associated with an increased COVID-19 risk or a worse prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Likewise, in a retrospective study with 12,594 individuals evaluating the relation between previous hypertension treatment with ACEi, ARBs, &#x003b2;-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, or thiazide diuretics and increased severe illness and contamination risk, no substantial association between the use of these drugs and more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection was demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">Therefore, ACEi/ARBs are possibly potential drugs for COVID-19 treatment in patients with pre-existing hypertension, due to their capacity of reducing the hyperinflammatory state particularly observed in patients with critical SARS-CoV-2, although a less significant reduction in 1L-6 serum levels suggests that RAAS blockers alone might be inefficient towards inflammation control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Hence, authors are postulating a possible beneficial synergic effect between a ACEi/ARB combination with IL-6R inhibitors towards inflammation attenuation in patients with hypertension and COVID-19, requiring more robust evidence through randomized controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">Initial concern regarding RAAS blockers during the COVID-19 pandemic impelled international societies to issue positions advocating the importance of RAAS therapy maintenance in patients with formal indication during the pandemic.
