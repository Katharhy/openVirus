<p id="para0007">It is essential to consider the potential risk of morbidity and possible mortality for each MS patient, who may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and develops COVID-19. The individual's risk profile is multifactorial; their DMT and consequent immune response is one of the factors. Other aspects to consider, when assessing a respiratory viral infection include: smoking practices (increased cigarette smoking increases risk); ambulatory status (less mobility increases risk, especially if the patient is in a wheelchair); age (increasing age increases risk); weight (increasing weight impacts on ambulation and respiratory function); underlying respiratory illnesses, such as asthma or COPD. Also, the frequency of necessary attendance at a hospital or healthcare facility for laboratory or MRI testing, but also for infusions may place the patient at a higher risk of exposure. In the context of these factors the health care professionals should weigh the potential risks of SARS-CoV-1 exposure and manage their DMT accordingly. Visits for MS care should preferably be done by telemedicine or phone.</p>
