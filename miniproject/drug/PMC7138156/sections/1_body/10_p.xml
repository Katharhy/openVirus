<p id="para0011">The sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) modulators (fingolimod, siponimod, ozanimod, ponesimod) work by reducing the egress of lymphocytes from secondary lymphoid organs into the circulation (

 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Luna et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, the vast majority of patients on S1P modulators do not have a problem dealing with community acquired viral infections. Patients on fingolimod who are exposed to and acquire exotic viral infections such as dengue fever seem to deal with them without complications (
 <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">Fragoso et al., 2016a</xref>). This is why patients on S1P modulators should be at relatively low risk of complications from COVID-19 infection and why it may be safe to continue these treatments during the epidemic. Fingolimod does however blunt vaccine responses (
 <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">Kappos et al., 2015</xref>) indicating that both the priming and effector arms of the immune system are affected, whether this will impact on COVID-19 outcomes is at present unknown.
