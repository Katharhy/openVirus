<p id="para0004">It is clear that COVID-19 is a pandemic and global health crisis with the potential to kill millions of people, particularly the elderly and people with comorbidities such as hypertension, smoking and lung disease. At present we do not know if people with MS are at increased risk acquring SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 or developing severe COVID-19. Individuals with MS are not unique in their requirement to be treated with immunosuppressive therapies. We discussed the COVID-19 epidemic with our renal transplant team who informed us that at present they are not taking any specific action about the levels of immunosuppression for their transplant patients during the epidemic. Basic measures are recommended namely: to improve hand and home hygiene, to avoid high-risk travel and unnecessary contacts, to self-isolate if necessary and to reduce contact with the hospital and other medical institutions as much as possible, because they are more likely to be sources of COVID-19. It is business as usual. Nor are they necessarily halting their transplant programme. Their argument is that transplanted kidneys and other transplanted organs are too precious not to protect them with relevant immunosuppressive drugs. Why would we not have the same attitude about the brains and spinal cords of our patients with active multiple sclerosis?</p>
