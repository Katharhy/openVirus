<p id="para0003">In an uncertain world, where we do not have a clear evidence-base, you often have to default to scientific principles, rather than using the wisdom of the crowd. Not surprising, with Italy being one of the epicentres of the COVID-19 epidemic, the Italian society of neurology or SIN (Società Italiana di Neurologia) broke cover first producing recommendations on the management of patients with MS during the COVID-19 epidemic (see 
 <xref rid="box1" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 1</xref>). The SIN guidelines provide relatively straightforward, and one could argue arbitrary, advice on how to manage patients with MS in the short-term, but do not address supervision of these patients in the intermediate or long-term especially those with highly active MS. If the public health measures being taken flatten the peak of the epidemic, but extend its tail, the problem of community-acquired SARS-CoV2 infection and COVID-19 may be with us for many months and potentially years. Are the SIN guidelines compatible with the best interests of our patients or a knee-jerk response to an undefined problem that may not be a problem at all?
