<p id="para0013">Another human coronavirus HCoV-OC43, which is generally associated with mild upper respiratory tract infections, has been shown to have neuroinvasive properties. Studies in mice have shown that HCoV-OC43 can infect neurons and cause encephalitis and cause persistent infections in human neural-cell lines (
 <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">Arbour et al., 1999</xref>). There are case reports identifying HCoV-OC43 RNA in the cerebrospinal fluid or brain of children with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (

 <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">Morfopoulou et al., 2016</xref>). Coronaviruses mutate very rapidly and hence may produce neurotropic strains quite quickly. The latter is a potential issue in the context of natalizumab, which creates an immune privileged site that may allow for the selection of these neurotropic mutants. Another aspect that needs to be considered is what happens in the gut. SARS-CoV-2 infects the gastrointestinal tract, with about 3–4% of people with COVID-19 developing diarrhoea (

 <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">Ghosh et al., 2003</xref>). Will patients on natalizumab and other DMTs have increased viral replication in the gut and shedding in the stool? Will patients on natalizumab and other DMTs infected with the virus become superspreaders? Despite these questions the current science indicates that patients on natalizumab should be able to deal with a novel viral infection such as dengue (
 <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">Fragoso et al., 2016b</xref>). Reassuringly, five patients on natalizumab infected with dengue virus cleared the virus without complications similar to those on fingolimod (
