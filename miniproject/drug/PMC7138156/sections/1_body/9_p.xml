<p id="para0010">Of the immune reconstitution therapies, cladribine (Mavenclad) is classed as intermediate risk, because it is a relatively poor T-cell depleting agent (
 <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">Stuve et al., 2019</xref>). T-cells are only depleted post-cladribine by an average of 50% with the CD4+ population being more sensitive than the CD8+ population. In the phase 3 CLARITY study, viral infections were uncommon post-cladribine and apart from herpes zoster, infections were no more frequent in cladribine-treated subjects compared to placebo (
 <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">Cook et al., 2011</xref>). When viral infections occurred post-cladribine they tended to be mild or moderate in severity. Similarly, anti-CD20 therapies such as ocrelizumab have a minor impact on T-cell counts and are not associated with severe viral infections (
 <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">Mayer et al., 2019</xref>). In the phase 3 relapsing-remitting and primary progressive trials, infections were slightly more frequent on ocrelizumab compared to comparator arms (interferon-beta-1a or placebo) (

 <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">Montalban et al., 2017</xref>). Most of these infections were mild and moderate with the severe infections being bacterial in nature (pneumonia, urinary tract infections and cellulitis). We therefore feel that both cladribine and anti-CD20 therapies are relatively safe to use during the COVID-19 pandemic based on their profiles defined in phase 3 trials.
