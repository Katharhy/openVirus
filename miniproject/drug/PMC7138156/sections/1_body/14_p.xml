   <p id="para0016">Given the lack of knowledge or data on the COVID-19 disease course in MS patients receiving DMTs, at present there is no recommendation to stop the different DMTs and therefore expose MS patients to the risk of MS exacerbations. We, therefore, recommend continuing the current DMT specifically with:

This decision should be made according to individual factors such as disease severity and activity. For anti-CD2O DMTs it is recommended to delay the next dose even beyond 6 months if CD19+ and CD20+ lymphocyte counts are severely decreased at the time the next dose is due.</p>

   <p id="para0024">Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection: Withhold any first or second-line DMT until clinical resolution and/or approval to continue treatment by an infectious disease specialist. Note: given the potential antiviral activity of beta-interferons, the decision to continue this treatment rests with the treating neurologist.</p>
