<p id="para0012">Although most neurologists consider natalizumab relatively safe there is a small increased risk of upper respiratory tract infections on this medication (

It is clear that natalizumab blocks immune surveillance of the CNS, hence a person on natalizumab who develops a COVID-19 encephalitis could be in danger of major complications of this infection. The latter is analogous to PML, which is also a viral encephalitis, and similar to herpes-simplex and varicella -zoster encephalitis resulting from natalizumab exposure (

Coronaviruses are potentially neurotropic and there has been one online case report of a 56-year old Chinese man developing COVID-19 encephalitis. He developed a decreased level of consciousness with a normal CT scan of the brain. Spinal fluid analysis revealed SARS-CoV-2. He subsequently made a recovery and was discharged (
