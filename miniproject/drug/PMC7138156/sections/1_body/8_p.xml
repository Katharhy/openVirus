<p id="para0009">Assuming that antiviral responses are driven mainly by T-cells, in particular CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, and natural-killer cells and less so, at least initially, by B-cells, allows one to construct a hierarchy of immunosuppression of DMTs. The highest risk are the immune reconstitution therapies during the depletion phase of the treatment, i.e. haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), alemtuzumab (Lemtrada), mitoxantrone (Novantrone) and cladribine (Mavenclad). After immune reconstitution, once the total lymphocyte counts have returned to normal or near normal the risk of severe viral infections are probably no higher than expected for the background population and would be associated with age and other comorbidities. Please note, immune reconstitution takes months to years, so if the patient's last course of treatment was in the previous 6–12 months they may still be immunocompromised. A total lymphocyte count less 1.1 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L or 1100/mm
 <sup>3</sup> is associated with an increased risk of infection and infection-related mortality (

 <sup>3</sup> (&gt;50% risk) (
 <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">Warny et al., 2018</xref>). As a rough guide, pwMS with a lymphocyte count above 800/mm
 <sup>3</sup> (WHO grade 2) are able to deal with viral infections reasonably well provided they have no other comorbidities and are relatively young.
