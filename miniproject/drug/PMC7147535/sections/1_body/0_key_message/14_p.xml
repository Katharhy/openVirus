<p>Interleukin-17 plays a crucial role in enhancing antiviral immune responses, but it may also promote and exacerbate viral illnesses, especially through antagonism of regulatory T-cell function, which is of paramount importance in viral infections of the respiratory tract [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In SARS-CoV-2, a Th17 response appears to contribute to the “cytokine storm”, resulting in tissue damage and pulmonary edema. Extremely high numbers of CCR6þ Th17 cells in the peripheral blood of a patient with severe COVID-19 support the role of the Th17 pathway in this disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Many psoriasis treatments inhibit the IL-17 pathway directly (IL-17A and IL-17R inhibitors) and indirectly (IL-23 inhibitors). Low levels of type I IFN seem to be common to COVID-19, SARS, and MERS, and may suppress Th1 and favor Th2 responses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], thus providing some rationale for the use of dupilumab, an IL-4/IL-13 inhibitor used in the treatment of atopic dermatitis, to mitigate the “cytokine storm” seen in some patients with COVID-19.
