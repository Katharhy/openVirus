<p>Highly pathogenic human CoV infections suppress type I interferon (IFN) production and signaling, the key component of host antiviral defense in the early phase of viral replication, thus exacerbating disease progression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In line with SARS and MERS, SARS-CoV-2 infection in severe cases involves the host response as an important contributor to the disease process and tissue damage, mainly due to dysregulated and excessive innate immune responses. The primary immune response leads to viral clearance in most cases. However, for reasons that are still unclear, in a subgroup of patients, the secondary immune response may be exaggerated, leading to inflammatory-induced lung injury and complications including pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, shock, organ failure, and potentially death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This exaggerated response is considered a “cytokine storm” similar to that of secondary hemophagocytic histiocytosis, which leads to an hyperinflammation state, with unremitting fever, cytopenias, hyperferritinemia, and pulmonary involvement (including acute respiratory distress syndrome) in 50% of cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The cytokine profile associated with COVID-19 is characterized by elevated serum levels of multiple cytokines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], probably produced by highly inflammatory macrophages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α surge during illness and decline upon recovery; overproduction of IL-6, IL-10, soluble IL-2 receptor, and TNFα is inversely correlated with CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts, is associated with decreased IFN-γ expression in CD4+ cells, and correlates with the disease severity of COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In severe cases, marked decreases in memory helper T cells and regulatory T cells have been observed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].
