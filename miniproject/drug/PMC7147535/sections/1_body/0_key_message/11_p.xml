<p>In rheumatology, poor control of rheumatoid arthritis might imply an even greater infectious risk factor than continuation of treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and the use of systemic corticosteroids might contribute to viral replication in the event of SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Immunosuppressive medications in transplanted patients increase the risk or duration of infections caused by viral agents, such as adenovirus, influenza, norovirus, rhinovirus, or respiratory syncytial virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]; the same effect does not seem to be observed for infections caused by the coronavirus family. Similarly to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], immunosuppressed status (due to transplantation, chemotherapy, or other conditions requiring immunosuppressive treatment) has not been found to be a risk factor for an adverse outcome, such as death or admission to an intensive care unit, in patients with COVID-19 compared with the general population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Data from a large European center for pediatric liver transplantation located in Lombardy demonstrated that for patients in the follow-up for cirrhosis, transplantation, autoimmune liver disease, or chemotherapy for hepatoblastoma, despite some testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, none developed clinical pulmonary disease [
