<p id="Par27">Our study described the epidemiology of TB patients from CPHMC and evaluated the factors associated with DR-TB and TB/HIV co-infection. Results showed that most TB patients in Chongqing were young and middle aged, which is consistent with the reports in other regions of China [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. TB cases are more likely to cluster among disadvantaged groups such as the poor, hungry, and ethnic minorities, and most TB patients were farmers, unemployed, and those living in county/district areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], which were considered as the populations with relatively poor social economic status, great financial pressure, and non-ideal living conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This study consistently found that farmers and unemployed individuals who lived in county/district had higher susceptibility to TB in Chongqing. In 2015, the WHO proposed a core principle, included in the End TB strategy, focusing on social protection in the context of TB, particularly poor and vulnerable populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, the WHOâ€™s 2019 Global TB Report also recommended providing social support for vulnerable people, such as transport, food packages, and cash-transfer schemes to avoid catastrophic costs for TB patients and their households [
