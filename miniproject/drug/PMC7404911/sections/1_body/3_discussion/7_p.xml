<p id="Par33">Previous studies reported that HIV and DR-TB were the risk factors for each other [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. However, this study found no association between HIV-positive and DR-TB patients among TB patients in Chongqing. This result may be explained by the high mortality and default rate reported among TB/HIV co-infection patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Patients living in the central urban areas of Chongqing had higher risks of acquiring HIV because the prevalence of HIV existed mainly in central urban areas, and the incidence of HIV was high among men who had sex with men living mainly in the central urban areas of Chongqing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Therefore, this might explain why male TB patients had a higher risk of HIV co-infection in our study. Patients aged 21–60 years had higher risks of being HIV positive than those aged less than 21 years and more than 60 years. This may also be attributed to less sexual behaviours and non-intravenous drug use reported by previous studies in recent years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The younger population engaged in more HIV risk activities. In addition, unemployed patients were more likely to have HIV than farmers, as the unemployed population may perform more HIV risk behaviours with more free time and poorer economic conditions. Besides, patients who received retreatment had a lower risk of being HIV positive, which may be due to the high mortality and default rate of HIV-positive TB patients. A low retreatment rate was observed among HIV-positive TB patients.
