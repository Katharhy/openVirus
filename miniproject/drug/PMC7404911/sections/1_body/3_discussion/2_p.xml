<p id="Par28">Students are vulnerable to TB; hence, more TB control and preventive efforts should be made to protect students in schools [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. TB prevalence among Chinese students (1520/100,000) is much higher than that (459/100,000) among the general population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Chongqing was one of the regions with the highest TB burden among undergraduate students in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Several TB outbreaks among students have been recently reported in Chongqing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This study also observed that almost 10% of the patients were students in this region. Previous studies have shown that students in this region have poor knowledge of TB [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. TB programmes in this region need to make more efforts to protect students, particularly those living in school. These efforts include health education and behavioural interventions.
