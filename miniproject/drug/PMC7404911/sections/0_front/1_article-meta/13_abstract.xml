  <title>Background</title>
  <p id="Par1">China ranks second in the world in terms of numbers of tuberculosis (TB) cases and is one of the top three countries with the largest number of multidrug-resistant and rifampicin-resistant TB (MDR/RR-TB). It also has high mortality and low cure rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive TB patients. This study aimed to analyse, under the integrated TB control model, the characteristics of TB patients seeking healthcare in the largest designated TB hospital in Chongqing.</p>

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2">This was a retrospective study of TB registers in a health facility. Record data of 1827 TB patients who had attended the Chongqing Public Health Medical Center (CPHMC) from 1 January to 31 December 2018 were included. The Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS 18.0; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) was used to analyse the data. Counting data were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher’ s exact test. Among the results of the univariate analysis, the variables with statistical significance were included in the binomial stepwise logistic regression, with odds ratio and 95% confidence interval calculated. A two-tailed probability level of 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par3">The majority of registered patients were men (1197), of Han ethnicity (1670), aged 21–60 years (1331), farmer/unemployed (1075), and living in county/district (1207). Approximately 24.9% of patients (455/1827) contracted DR-TB, 6% (110/1827) were co-infected with HIV, and 41.0% (749/1827) had drug-related hepatotoxicity. Among those patients, DR-TB was more likely to develop among farmers who received retreatment and had drug-related hepatotoxicity (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Women who received retreatment and lived in county/district were less likely to be HIV positive (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Compared with farmers, patients who were unemployed were more likely to be HIV positive, and those aged 21–60 years had a higher risk of being tested as HIV positive (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p id="Par4">Farmers who received retreatment and had drug-related hepatotoxicity are more susceptible to DR-TB; young unemployed men have a higher risk of contracting HIV-positive TB. The demographic and clinical characteristics of TB patients should be taken into consideration in DR-TB and HIV-positive TB screening in the future.</p>
