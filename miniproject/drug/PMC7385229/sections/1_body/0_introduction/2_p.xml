<p>The first outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) occurred between November 2002 and July 2003, originating from China and then spreading worldwide (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Although the symptoms of SARS-CoV-1 infection were in most cases non-specific, including lethargy, myalgia, and headache, the high mortality rate of 10% in case series was mostly related to respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The physiopathology underlying the severity of SARS-CoV-1 infection remained unclear after the epidemic due to insufficient sampling. A second CoV epidemic occurred in 2012 with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, which has mostly led to small-size outbreaks in the years ever since (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Although it did not reach a pandemic status, MERS-CoV continues to infect humans, and the World Health Organization identified more than 850 patients who have died of related complications since its discovery (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Indeed, MERS-CoV has a higher mortality rate in case series (case fatality rate of ~30%), mostly from respiratory failure, which has led to the identification of unique strategies of CoV infections to escape the immune response. Due to the ending of the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic and the somewhat limited number of cases of MERS-CoV in the recent years, understanding the mechanisms of CoV infections in humans has proven to be complex, and the conclusions drawn from
