Although the mortality rates of this new COVID-19 are still being debated, ranging between 0.3 and 1.5%, it is still lower than those associated with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infections. Patients suffering from severe SARS-CoV-2 infection could be healthy or only have mild comorbidities such as hypertension or diabetes (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Studies on COVID-19 have progressively stressed its similarities with previous CoV infections, mostly SARS-CoV-1, with the same unanswered questions regarding its physiopathology. One notable feature of this disease, already observed in previous CoV infections, is the high prevalence of obese patients among the most severe cases.
