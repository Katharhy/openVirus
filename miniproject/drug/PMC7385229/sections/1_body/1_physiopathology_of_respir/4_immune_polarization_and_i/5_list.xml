  <p>- First, hiding viral RNA from cytoplasmic PRR. After entering the cell, SARS-CoV-1 shields its RNA by forming, inside the host's endoplasmic reticulum, a large network of double-membrane vesicles isolated from the cytosol (
   <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
   <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The modified capping of the viral RNA 2â€²-O-methylation also prevents the binding to an important cytosolic PRR (
   <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).

  <p>- Next, direct tampering of the PRR-related enzymes. For example, the papain-like protein in CoV can modify the ubiquitinylation profile of TLR7 (
   <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) or other antiviral-related PRR (
   <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Moreover, S protein triggers IL-1R-associated kinase and peroxisome proliferator-associated receptor gamma, subsequently downregulating interferon regulatory factor 7 activity (
   <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). In addition, the jamming of TLR3 phosphorylation reduces the PRR activity, while blocking most of the INF-1 production pathways.

  <p>- Lastly, the non-structural protein 1 in both MERS and SARS-CoV-1 can selectively degrade host RNA via endonucleolytic activity against which the viral RNA is protected (
   <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
   <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).
