<p>INF-1 is produced by infected cells and innate immune cells after recognizing the viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS), such as single-strained or uncapped RNA, using cytoplasmic pattern-recognition receptors (PRR). In particular, toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) induces Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-Î² (TRIF). Hosts deficient in either TLR3 or TRIF are more susceptible to viral injuries and thus more at risk of developing ARDS during CoV infections (
