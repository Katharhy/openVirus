<p>The association of severe outcome and inappropriate cytokine environment in CoV infection suggests a link with immune polarization, as a result of the “cul-de-sac” of antiviral response induced by the CoV escaping strategies. The resulting inefficient immune profile leads to a sustained viral exposure and persistent inflammatory state. In addition to the pro-inflammatory signals mediated by ACE2 inhibition, this sustained and inappropriate immune activation might be strongly involved in the development of ARDS.</p>
