<p>However, this sustained inflammation without LTh polarization might not be the only profile to bypass the antiviral cul-de-sac. Some patients infected by MERS-CoV demonstrated a polarization of the immune profile toward a LTh17-mediated response. Faure et al. compared two cases of MERS with different outcomes (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>); the patient with a fatal outcome had an early increase in IL-17 and IL-23 titers (hallmarks of LTh17 polarization), whereas the surviving patient had a spike in INF-1 but no indication of LTh17 polarization. LTh17 are effective actors in the clearance of extracellular microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria, but poorly effective against viral pathogens (
