<p>The many mechanisms used by CoV probably leave the infected cells in a defensive cul-de-sac where they are incapable of developing an efficient antiviral response. On the one hand, viral PAMPS do not result in INF-1 production. On the other hand, non-viral PAMPS such as debris from cell lysis still stimulate the immune response. This could lead to inappropriate cytokine environments that lack INF-1 and are thus less effective against viruses, as seen in COVID-19 (
