<p>In general, an efficient antiviral response is driven by T-helper lymphocytes (LTh) with a specific polarization such as LTh1 and LTh2. LTh1 refers to a polarization in which LTh primarily promotes cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killers (NK) for the control and destruction of infected cells as well as the release of specific cytokines, such as type 1 interferon (INF-1) by innate immune cells.</p>
