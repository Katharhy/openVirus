<p>Indeed, during COVID-19 infection, most patients exhibit a specific cytokine profile, associating innate immunity chemokines (such as monocyte chemoattractant protein 3 and interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), which are suggestive of macrophage activation and epithelial suffering), and pro-inflammatory macrophage-produced cytokines such as IL-6 (

Moreover, CoV infections can directly induce the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB), notably by tampering with the TNF receptor-associated factor 3 pathway (TRAF3) via its open reading frame 3a. Activation by ubiquitination of TRAF3 also promotes the

This cytokine production promotes macrophage activation and INF-3, although it does not salvage a deficient polarization of the adaptive immunity toward LTh1 and its subsequent efficient antiviral response. High plasma levels of IL-6 and the absence of INF-1 have been noted in severe patients (
