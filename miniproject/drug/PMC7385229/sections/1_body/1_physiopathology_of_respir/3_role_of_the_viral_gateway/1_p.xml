<p>The membrane protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is used as an entry receptor by SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater affinity for ACE2 than SARS-CoV-1 due to the specific amino-acid composition in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). ACE2 is expressed at varying levels by most cells in the body but primarily in the small intestine, testis, kidney, heart, thyroid, and adipose tissue cells (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The expression of ACE2 in adipocytes seems to be promoted by high fat diets (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In the lungs, it is expressed by 2% of epithelial cells, increasing with cell differentiation, and it is mainly located on the apical (or luminal) pole, serving as an accessible anchor point to airborne contaminants (
