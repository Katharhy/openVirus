<p>ACE2 is a key enzyme of the renin-angiotensin system, converting angiotensin 2 (Ang2) into Ang1-7. Ang2 binds to a receptor, the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R), a transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor, which is found in a large variety of cells, ranging from smooth muscle cells, endometrium, and myocardium to blood cells, renal interstitial, and glomeruli. The activation of AT1R has several effects: for example, vasoconstriction, vascular permeability, macrophage maturation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine release. During the resolution phase of the inflammation, Ang2 promotes tumor growth factor beta production and fibroblast proliferation, leading to fibrosis and inadequate healing of the wounded tissue (
