<p>An antagonistic pathway of the Ang2-derived effects results from the binding of Ang1-7 to the mitochondrial assembly (MAS) receptor. MAS receptor is a ubiquitous G-protein-coupled receptor, implicated, among others, in retina development (

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and benign prostate hyperplasia (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Activation of the MAS receptor by Ang1-7 induces vasodilatation by a nitric-oxide-dependent mechanism (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and reduces oxidative stress induced by Ang2 in vascular injuries (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In macrophages, it promotes an anti-inflammatory profile (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), for example, by lowering pro-inflammatory cytokine production, notably IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±). Ang1-7 has also shown beneficial effects in inflammation resolution and fibrosis, notably in kidney and myocardial disease (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The binding of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 prevents it from exerting its enzymatic activities, resulting in decreased anti-inflammatory Ang1-7 production and the accumulation of pro-inflammatory Ang2 (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). This results in high cytokine titers, neutrophil infiltration, and endothelial dysfunction in the lungs, potentially predisposing for ARDS.
