<p>The nature of COVID-19-induced ARDS is still under discussion. Interleukin (IL) dosages are usually very high, and hypoxemia is severe in COVID-19-induced ARDS, which matches the hyperinflammatory profile described by Calfee et al. (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). SARS-CoV-1-induced ARDS was associated with vascular leakage and neutrophilic alveolitis (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), both of which are compatible with a hyper-inflammatory profile. In COVID-19, some experts observed ventilatory abnormalities suggestive of microcirculatory involvement such as hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction or distal thrombosis (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). This points to the contribution of several factors in respiratory failure, with experts also citing the possible involvement of genuine viral pneumonia as well as capillary thrombosis by neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The reason for this respiratory outcome is most likely a complex interplay of multiple factors, which derive directly from CoV virulence.
