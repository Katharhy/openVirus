<p>Thus, obesity appears to be a risk factor for presenting a severe form of COVID-19. It should be mentioned that once in ICU, obesity is known to confer a survival advantage, termed the “obesity paradox” (

 <sup>2</sup> seem to survive mechanical ventilation and severe septic states significantly better than patients with a normal or low BMI (

 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), presumably due to their elevated muscle mass, which represents a metabolic reserve in the hypermetabolic state of ICU patients (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). It is not yet known whether once admitted to ICU, obese COVID-19 patients also present a better prognosis than patients of normal body weight.
