<p>Besides suffering from a pro-inflammatory environment, which favors macrophage activation and neutrophil production, obese patients exhibit abnormal responses to viral infection. As summarized by Honce et al., during influenza infections, obese patients tend to have greater neutrophil activation and NET development, contributing to capillary damage and thrombosis. Such phenomena have been extensively found in COVID-19 patients (

Their inflammatory response is also characterized by a lack of INF-1 production as well as a strong cytokine production, notably IL-6, IP-10, and type 3 INF, which are elevated in severe COVID-19. Interestingly, patients with visceral fat accumulation also tend to have a lower TLR3 expression in adipocytes, muscle cells, and adipose tissue-resident macrophages, as well as a concomitant lower production of cytokines following exposure to viral PAMPS (

 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). This suggests that their baseline profile resembles that found in severe CoV infections, in which the antiviral response is less efficient, but the overall inflammation is higher than in other viral infections.
