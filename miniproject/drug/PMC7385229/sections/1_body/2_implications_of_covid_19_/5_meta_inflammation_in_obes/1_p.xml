<p>Adipocyte dysfunction in visceral fat is correlated to low-grade persistent inflammation, known as meta-inflammation, which is suspected to be the starting point or an early factor in metabolic disorders associated with severe obesity (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). This meta-inflammation is mostly driven by the leptin-activated M1 macrophages in WAT. WAT-resident macrophages exhibit pro-inflammatory behavior, producing IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα. The precursor of IL-1β is cleaved into bioactive IL-1β by the NLRP3 inflammasome, as a result of the NFkB pathway activation, which is induced by both pro-inflammatory and hypoxic signals originating from the adipocytes (
