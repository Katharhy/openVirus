<p>Unlike subcutaneous fat, visceral fat accumulation, also described as “abdominal obesity,” is characterized by a dysfunctional profile of adipokines associated with a rise in pro-inflammatory signals. The triggers of this dysfunction is believed to be a metabolic stress in the presence of nutrient excess and a hypoxic stress caused by hypertrophic visceral adipocytes, due to an increase in cells' size and low neovascularization, via a mobilization of Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 (

In severe abdominal obesity, the adipokine profile is unbalanced in favor of leptin production and low-grade inflammation at the expense of adiponectin, or lipocalin-2. This deregulation of the adipokine profile links various disorders associated with metabolic diseases, such as insulin-resistance, to inflammatory manifestations, as described in rheumatoid arthritis (
