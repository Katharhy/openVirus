<p>White adipose tissue (WAT) is now recognized as an independent endocrine organ, whose main role is to regulate and store the energy provided by food. However, the hormones released by WAT, specific to the adipocyte and known as adipokines, reach a large variety of organs and modulate an extensive range of functions, from appetite control to inflammatory response (

Leptin levels in blood are proportionate to the amount of WAT and increase with BMI. Interestingly, the leptin receptor (LEPR) on immune cells mostly activates JAK-STAT and NFkB dependent pathways, except in neutrophils, macrophages, and antigen presenting cells, which all express a particular form of LEPR. Leptin promotes migration in the WAT of resident macrophages and induces their polarization toward a pro-inflammatory profile or a classical activated macrophage (M1) profile, and unbalances the LTh profiles, by reducing regulatory T-cells and promoting LTh17 polarization (

Other adipokines, such as lipocalin-2, down-regulate inflammatory LTh altogether by promoting regulatory lymphocytes. Adipokines form a large family regularly counting new members over the last few years, all of which reveal complex and multiple implications in the regulation of energy storage and release, adipose tissue regulation and rather ubiquitous cellular metabolism (
