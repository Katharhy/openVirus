<p>Ang1-7 takes an active role in regulating the effects of adipokines. Its involvement was reviewed by Lelis et al., with an exhaustive approach and emphasis on other adipokines that will not be described here, such as sirtuin and resistin (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). A strong interest in Ang1-7 has already arisen from these observations, particularly in the field of atherosclerosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, in which Ang1-7 seems beneficial. In a concise article, Mori et al. hypothesized that the disruption of the renin-angiontensin system by the virus could impair the energetic functions of these pathways during SARS-CoV infections (
