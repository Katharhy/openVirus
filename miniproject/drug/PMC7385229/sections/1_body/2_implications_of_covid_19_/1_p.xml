<p>Obesity is a common condition, affecting up to 30% of adults in Western countries. It is defined by a body mass index (BMI) &gt;30 kg/m
 <sup>2</sup>, irrespective of the location of the adipose tissue. However, all profiles of obesity are not equivalent in terms of their consequences. Indeed, abdominal (or visceral) obesity (estimated by the waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio), in which visceral fat predominates, is more associated with metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes or hypertension, compared to “metabolically healthy” obesity, in which subcutaneous fat predominates.
