<p>COVID-19 is a viral disease with remarkable characteristics given its high severity in obese patients and its ability to tamper ACE2 metabolism. We believe that more than being just an incentive to accelerate research on viral infection, COVID-19 also presents an opportunity to respond to questions that were previously considered to be too intricate or complex, such as non-septic inflammation or the immune system communication underlying metabolic disorders. Understanding the multiple and interrelated factors linking SARS-CoV-2 infection, angiotensin metabolism, global inflammation, and metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and obesity should provide us with a better insight into the way in which these conditions and physiological states interact outside of an acute aggression.</p>
