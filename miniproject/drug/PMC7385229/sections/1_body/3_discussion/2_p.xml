<p>When comparing the effects of Ang1-7 and the inflammatory environment of patients with adipocyte dysregulation and metabolic disorders, an interesting pattern emerges. All the immunological features arising from the adipocyte dysfunction—(i.e., M1 macrophage polarization with IL-6 and TNFα production), and neutrophil promotion—may contribute to the development of ARDS and thus be countered by the activation of the Ang1-7/MAS receptor axis. Ang1-7 also favors a strong capillary barrier and a beneficial oxidative profile, which are altered in patients with visceral fat activation and could help to prevent ARDS. This leads us to two hypotheses: either patients with metabolic disorders, primarily visceral fat accumulation, have a constitutional lower titer of Ang1-7, as suggested by some observations (

In the first case, the inappropriate inflammatory response, added to the diminished activation of TLR3 in obese patients, leads to unrestrained inflammation. However, if Ang1-7 is present in these patients and limits the meta-inflammation, acting as a guardrail, the antagonization of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-1 and 2 in addition to the lack of
