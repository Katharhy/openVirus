<p>ACE2 deficiency has already been explored by some research teams to better understand the potential metabolic benefits of conversion enzyme inhibitors used in hypertension, among others. Their studies highlighted the association between ACE2 deficiency and higher titers of pro-inflammatory cytokines in obese mice, as well as in mice with glucose intolerance (

 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). Other studies correlate ACE2 deficiency with epicardial inflammation (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). This suggests that the Ang1-7/MAS axis allows a better control of inflammation in obese patients.
