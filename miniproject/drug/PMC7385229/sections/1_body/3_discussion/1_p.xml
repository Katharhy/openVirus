<p>Patients with visceral fat accumulation, type 2 diabetes (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>), and hypertension are not the only subjects at a higher risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. When considering metabolic disorders separately, diabetes, non-alcoholic liver disease, and obstructive sleep disorders have been recently reported as risk factors for a severe outcome (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). This suggests that the metabolic dysfunction associated with these disorders more than obesity alone might be involved in the severity of the disease in these patients.
