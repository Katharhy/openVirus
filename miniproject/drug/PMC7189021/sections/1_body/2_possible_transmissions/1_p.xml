<p id="Par9">After the first cases of the COVID-19 disease were linked to direct access to Wuhanâ€™s Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, it was suspected that the main mechanism was a transmission from animal to human. The cycle of adaptation was not associated with subsequent incidents, however. It was also known that the virus could also be transmitted from human to human and that the most frequent cause of COVID-19 spread is symptomatic individuals. The probability of transmission appears unlikely before symptoms arise, but it cannot be ruled out. There are also indications that the virus can be transmitted by people who remain asymptomatic.</p>
