<p>Future HIV‐related studies and public health goals require a new COVID‐19‐informed paradigm for the collection and use of observational cohort data. HIV cohorts must capture pandemic‐driven changes in data sources, clinic activities and local policies to inform analyses. Our ability to leverage epidemiologic evidence to inform clinical, programmatic and public health practice is only as strong as the inferences derived from these analyses are valid and robust to the challenges in HIV care and research that we now face due to the pandemic. Healthcare organizations and public health agencies should revise HIV care continuum measures and analytic strategies. Funding for such work is critical, even in times of economic crisis, so that COVID‐19 does not derail the global fight to End the HIV Epidemic.</p>
