<p>In addition to changes in data collection and measurement during study design and conduct, we will also need to use analytic approaches that address the potential for artifactual temporal changes in HIV indicators due to COVID‐19, selection biases and measurement errors in the data‐generating mechanisms of the care continuum. If patients attending telehealth visits are not representative of the entire cohort, if outcomes are unreliably ascertained among those lost to care, if certain measures are self‐reported remotely instead of being collected on‐site, or if discontinuities such as disruptions in care persist, appropriate epidemiologic and biostatistical methods such as inverse probability weighting, multiple imputation, double‐sampling and regression calibration should be considered [
