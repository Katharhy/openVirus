<p>Both improved data capture and alteration of care continuum metrics may therefore be required to assess the extent of care/service disruptions and reduce measurement error and misclassification [

Many current retention metrics require clinical interactions every three to six months, but individuals successfully managed on ART and virally suppressed may need less frequent visits [

 <xref rid="jia225627-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>]. A conditional retention measure, based on ART receipt and viral suppression prior to clinic service disruption or upon return to clinic, may therefore be more informative about the care continuum than attended or even missed visit counts alone. For example we could redefine retention status such that an individual would be successfully retained if they were virally suppressed and receiving ART both before local social isolation measures were imposed and after return to the clinic. Such a measure would be a more meaningful indication of the current state of a patient's engagement in the HIV care continuum, even if their recorded HIV care visits were not frequent enough to meet current retention definitions.
