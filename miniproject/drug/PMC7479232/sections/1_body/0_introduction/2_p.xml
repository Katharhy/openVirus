<p>The COVID-19 outbreak started in December 2019 in Wuhan China. It subsequently spread to other continents, so that on January 30
 <sup>th</sup> the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a warning of public health emergency of international concern. This statement was followed by the declaration of a COVID-19 pandemic on the 11
 <sup>th</sup> of March 2020. Currently, COVID-19 has been recorded in over 200 countries and territories. As of July 20
 <sup>th</sup>, 2020, the number of cases due to COVID-19 exceeded 14,000,000 cases and 600,000 deaths. The rapid spread and high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 as well as its potentially lethal and unpredictable course has led to an extraordinary collective effort of researchers to characterize the virus and to identify efficient treatments and prophylactic alternatives. Hence, an impressive armamentarium of molecules was proposed for the SARS-CoV-2 treatment in a very short period of time and the list of molecules is still increasing. Multiple investigational drugs with potential antiviral activity, have been administered since the start of the outbreak either off-label or as part of clinical studies, through programmes of compassionate use. Nevertheless, currently, none of these therapeutic agents proved to be efficient and completely safe. Still, recently there has been a significant progress. As of June 2020, remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue has gained an authorization for emergency use in hospitalized patients with severe forms of COVID-19 in the United States and Europe, while dexamethasone is also recommended in specific situations and umifenovir, Î±-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, and chloroquine phosphate has been added to the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 in China (
