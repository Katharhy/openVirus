<p>SARS-CoV-2 triggers the innate immune response immediately after the endosomal receptors recognize the viral RNA. Consequently, Toll-like receptors 7/8 and RIG-I-like receptors RIG-I/MDA-5 activate transcription factors and trigger a type I IFN response. In turn, the IFN-I response stimulate infected cells to control the early stage of the viral infection through the release of proinflammatory cytokines and Th1 immune response stimulation. An imbalance of the innate immune response can potentially trigger an uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines which accompanies the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or other lethal organ failures (
