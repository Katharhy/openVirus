<p>SARS-CoV-2 is a large, enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus with a positive-sense. It entails 16 non-structural proteins (Nsp) which are essential for viral replication and 4 other structural proteins namely the spike, membrane, envelope and nucleocapsid, which mediate the cell invasion and immune response (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>). Certain structural proteins are highly conserved among coronaviruses such as the Nsp12-RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) involved in viral replication, while others such as CoV-2 Spike (S)-protein, the main SARS-CoV-2 antigenic structure, express a limited genetic variability.
