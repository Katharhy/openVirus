<p>The viral invasion of the target cells implies genomic RNA translation and the synthesis of polyproteins which are further cleaved by two viral proteases, namely 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and Papain Like protease (PLpro), in order to mature the Nsp (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Macchiagodena et al., 2020</xref>). Certain protease inhibitors frequently used in the treatment of HIV such as lopinavir/ritonavir have already been tested to verify their ability to block these proteases but showed a debatable efficiency (RECOVERY trial). Viral RNA synthesis involves two stages: genome replication and subgenomic mRNAs transcription, both of which mediated by the replication/transcription complex (RTC), a membrane-bound structure encoded by the virus. Of these two processes, Nsp12-RdRp plays a central role and is targeted by various experimental molecules (favipiravir). The final stages of the viral cycle cover the viral translation of the structural proteins, the assembly of all viral components into the endoplasmic reticulum, the recreation of the virions in the Golgi apparatus and their elimination through exocytosis (
