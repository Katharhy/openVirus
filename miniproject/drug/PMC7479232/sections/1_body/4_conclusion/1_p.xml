<p>The current therapeutic options in COVID-19 combine a diverse armamentarium of drugs targeting both the virus and the immune response to avert this unexpected and extremely dangerous pandemic (

 </xref>). The number of experimental molecules proposed against SARS-CoV-2 is continually rising in an attempt to offer short-term solutions, especially for patients with a severe disease (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Tu et al., 2020</xref>). As a result, it has become clearer that these options should be weighted with responsibility and should be tailored to the complex pathogenic context of COVID-19. Thus, molecules which could be beneficial in a certain stage of the disease could be devastating in another. Hence, the best treatment option appears to be a molecule which would restrict viral entry and to impede an unpredictable immune response. On the long-term, this would be ensured only by the production of a vaccine, while on the short-term the best treatment option requires further in-depth studies on the cellular invasion and immune dysregulation.
