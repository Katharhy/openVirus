<p>Despite the barriers which impede the development of a rapid treatment, current therapeutic approaches represent a stepping stone for the handling of future epidemics. The SARS-CoV-2 infection proved once again that viruses leave a very short window of opportunity, far too short for adequate antiviral options. This unfortunate prospect is now even more relevant and further similar scenarios can occur at any time with other types of pathogens, potentially reaching a global scale as in the case of SARS-CoV-2. Hence, this also serves as a brutal warning that our current therapeutic agents are insufficient against infectious agents and that non-etiologic medications could potentially play an important role in the future.</p>
