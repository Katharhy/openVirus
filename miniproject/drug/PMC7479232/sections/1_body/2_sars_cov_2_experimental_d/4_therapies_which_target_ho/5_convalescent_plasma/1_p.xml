<p>Antibodies from convalescent plasma of COVID-19 patients can favour clinical remission and help reach temporary immunity (

 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">Zhou and Zhao, 2020</xref>). Currently WHO ICTRP and Clinical Trials.gov database has recorded 51 studies on convalescent plasma, (Recovery, NCT04381936, NCT04373460, ISRCTN50189673, NCT04348656, etc. There are several caveats to this alternative, mostly related to the variable humoral response (
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">Wu F. et al., 2020</xref>) or to the absence of certain information regarding the effective dosing size or the administration regimen, as well as the side effects. Convalescent plasma has already been used in critical COVID-19 patients through compassionate care programmes and as of April 2020, this treatment is considered an “emergency investigational new drug” authorized by FDA in clinical trials. The benefits of convalescent plasma have been reported in small COVID-19 study groups only, so that presently there is only limited data on this therapy (

 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Rygård et al., 2018</xref>). In this respect, a recent assessment on the administration of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 patients has raised a series of question marks related to its safety and efficacy (
