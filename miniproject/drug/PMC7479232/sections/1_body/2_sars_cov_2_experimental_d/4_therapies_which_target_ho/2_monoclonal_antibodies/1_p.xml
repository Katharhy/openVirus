<p>SARS-CoV-2 is one of the most potent viruses to initiate the sepsis cascade and to induce pulmonary lesions with theÂ development of ARDS (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2020a</xref>). The upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and especially of IL-6 was observed in all severe forms, correlated with the incidence of the plasma viral load (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2020</xref>) or other endogenic factors such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease or their associated treatments (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Qu et al., 2014</xref>). Antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs acting in monotherapy or in combination could potentially alleviate pulmonary inflammation and could be indicated in severe respiratory forms such as ARDS. Such examples include tocilizumab, a humanized IgG1 anti IL-6 receptor mAb commonly used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and also approved in the treatment of cytokine release syndrome. Tocilizumab has already reached multiple Phase 2 (NCT04317092, NCT04315480) and phase 3 trials (COVACTA, NCT04320615) and preliminary data are encouraging (
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). In China, tocilizumab has already been approved in COVID-19 critical patients with severe respiratory failure. Other mAb which could mediate the release of cytokines in patients with severe/critical COVID-19 lung injury include the anti-IL6 receptor mAbs sarilumab and siltuximab (NCT04324073, NCT04315298, NCT04329650) or anti-VEGFA mAb bevacizumab (NCT04275414). Gimsilumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting Granulocyte Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) is the most recent monoclonal antibody proposed for the treatment of COVID-19 and will be assessed through the US BREATH clinical trial for the ARDS induced by SARS-CoV2 (
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">Zhou Y. et al., 2020</xref>). GM-CSF is a myelopoietic growth factor with an immunomodulatory role for which it is used in autoimmune diseases. Although GM-CSF plays a central role to coordinate the cytokines which intervene in the inflammatory tissue distruction (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Bhattacharya et al., 2015</xref>), there is no data to support that this process also occurs during the SARS-CoV-2 inflammatory reaction. Taking into account the complex role of GM-CSF (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">Zhan et al., 2019</xref>), therapeutic trials on GM-CSF require a solid theoretic basis and unfortunately preliminary results are not expected in a close future. The same argument can be made with other clinical trials using immunomodulatory drugs with scarce data on their efficiency in viral or autoimune diseases, such as thalidomide (NCT04273529, NCT04273581) or fingolimod (NCT04280588). Additionally, experimental data on the efficiency of these molecules in COVID-19 are missing.
