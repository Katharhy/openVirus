<p>Endosomal fusion can be enzymatically inhibited by certain molecules through mechanisms which are not well understood. Such an example is umifenovir (arbidol), a broad-spectrum antiviral agent used in the treatment of COVID-19 patients across China, Russia, as well as in studies performed in Iran or India (IRCT20151227025726N15), with controversial efficiency (
