<p>Other nucleosidic analogues were recently disproved by clinical studies. These include ribavirin (ChiCTR200002938) and protease inhibitors targeting PLpro and 3CLpro, such as darunavir/ritonavir (Phase 3 NCT04252274) and lopinavir/ritonavir (Phase 3 NCT04251871, NCT04255017, ChiCTR2000029539 NCT04252274, ChiCTR2000029308, NCT04295551). Moreover, the latter studies on protease inhibitors received negative reviews even before the ending of these studies (
