<p>Early in the COVID-19 outbreak, Asian countries with relatively lower environmental temperature (e.g. South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, and Iran) had more severe outbreaks than warmer countries (e.g. Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Thailand). In the further spread of COVID-19 also, other countries with low environmental temperature were severely affected in Europe (including Luxembourg, Italy, Spain, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the UK). Our study demonstrated a significant correlation between environmental temperature and attack rate, where a higher environmental temperature is correlated to a lower COVID-19 attack rate. However, the relatively low

Individuals in temperate regions spend the majority of their time indoors where the temperature is managed and does not correlate well with outdoor temperatures. Nevertheless, temperature may affect the timing of influenza epidemics through mechanisms independent of virus survival; for example, low outdoor temperatures may promote indoor crowding, thereby increasing person-to-person contact rates. As the temperature is now increasing in temperate countries in the Northern Hemisphere, and decreasing in the Southern, it will be interesting to follow SARS-CoV-2 transmission over time.
