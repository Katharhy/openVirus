<p>SARS-CoV-2 which caused the COVID-19 pandemic originated in China, but interestingly, the neighboring countries with relatively high environmental temperature (Taiwan, Thailand, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh) were relatively less affected than the neighboring countries with low environmental temperature (South Korea, Iran, and Japan). Understanding the stability and transmissibility of viruses in different environmental temperature conditions is critical to recognize the transmission dynamics of a novel infectious agent including SARS-CoV-2 which caused the COVID-19 pandemic. Temperature along with other environmental factors including humidity and ultraviolet radiation is known to affect the transmission of infectious diseases (including viruses) within the community [
