<p>Emerging infectious diseases, including infections caused by coronaviruses, continue to pose a threat to public health globally in recent years. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are two coronaviral diseases with demonstrated potential to generate significant outbreaks [

 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, which likely originated from bats and is now transmitted between humans. It emerged in late December 2019 in Wuhan in China and causes COVID-19 pandemic which is the first coronavirus pandemic causing global challenges. SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019. A cluster of patients reported and presented with a common link in a seafood wholesale market (fish market with live animals of different species, including wildlife being sold) in Wuhan (Hubei, China), with pneumonia of initially unknown origin, and the etiologic agent was quickly identified as a novel coronavirus [

 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which was later designated as SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 causes Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), an acute respiratory disease, and represents the most recent introduction of a high pathogenic coronavirus into the human population. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as a human coronavirus came after the emergence of MERS-CoV in less than a 10-year period. This recent emergence of a previously unknown coronavirus in China has led to huge impacts on humans globally. SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent COVID-19 pandemic resulted in devastating health and economic impacts on humans [
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than twelve million reported and confirmed cases and more than 500 thousands fatalities in 216 countries around the globe, with more than three million reported cases in the USA as of 9 July 2020 [
