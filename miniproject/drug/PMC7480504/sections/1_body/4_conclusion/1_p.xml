<p>In our study, the lower environmental temperature of a country was correlated to a higher attack rate of SARS-CoV-2. This may explain some of the variations of COVID-19 burden seen in different countries. The environmental temperature had no significant correlation to case fatality rate in our study, suggesting that environmental temperature affects transmission rather than disease severity. As the environmental temperature is not possible to affect transmission, other public health measures are imperative to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Public awareness including personal interventions (movement restriction, social and physical distancing, and hygiene) and increased public health response including case detection, isolation, and contact tracing may help reduce the spread of the virus and decrease the fatalities due to this pandemic.</p>
