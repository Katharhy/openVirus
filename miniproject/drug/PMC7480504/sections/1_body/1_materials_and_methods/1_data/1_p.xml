<p>We extracted population data (total population in 2019) for the affected countries from the world population review database. We extracted COVID-19 data regarding new cases, total cases, and total deaths from the World Health Organization (WHO) database [
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We included WHO data from January 2020 (beginning of the outbreak) until 21 March 2020. Furthermore, we extracted weather data (temperature) from the Trading Economics (monthly average temperature data by country). We used the mean temperature of January and February 2020 for each country as a measure of environmental temperature during the study period. There are variations in data recording and disease-tracking systems in different countries, which we consider a limitation of the study.
