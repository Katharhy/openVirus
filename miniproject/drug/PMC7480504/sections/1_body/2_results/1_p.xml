<p>The environmental temperature varied markedly by country based on their geographical location. Some of the Asian countries and most of the European countries and North America experienced low environmental temperatures during the study period. The attack rate (in 100,000 population) of COVID-19 in China was 5.67. However, outside of China, there were countries with markedly higher attack rates: 78.60 in Luxembourg followed by 77.65 in Italy, 56.33 in Switzerland, 42.75 in Spain, 32.38 in Norway, 29.58 in Austria, 23.69 in Iran, 21.93 in Germany, 21.74 in Denmark, 19.55 in Belgium, 19.36 in France, 17.51 in the Netherlands, and 17.17 in South Korea. It was found that the attack rate decreased significantly with increased temperature (
