The first phase features virus spread and proliferation in lung tissues with initial innate immunity including recruitment of monocytes and macrophages, characterized by mild constitutional symptoms. Some early phase symptomatic patients suffer from mild respiratory symptoms and may require supportive care like supplemental oxygen followed by an adaptive immunity stage with falling titers of the virus and resolution of symptoms. The second stage includes several mechanisms leading to pulmonary tissue injury, vasodilation, endothelial permeability and leukocyte recruitment that cause further pulmonary damage, hypoxemia, and cardiovascular stress. Ten percent of patients in the second stage may experience further exacerbation of immune response (hyperinflammation stage) become critically‐ill, and they may suffer from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, multi‐organ failure, secondary bacterial infections, sepsis and require intensive care .
