<p>The renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) is a complex hormonal system that is comprised of the interactions of renin, angiotensinogen, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), angiotensin II, and aldosterone. In summary, RAAS is a system that responds to a physiologic state of hypovolemia, hyponatremia, adrenergic activation and hypotension and activates a system that increases vasoconstriction and fluid retention.

 </xref> ACE2 plays a role as a negative regulator in this system. The spike (S) protein of SARS‐CoV‐2 enables the virus to enter into the host cells by binding to ACE2 protein on the cell membrane. This is similar to the mode of entry of the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS‐CoV which caused an epidemic in 2002/2003. The ACE2 receptor is found in the cells of the upper respiratory tract and the alveoli of the lung and is the primary site of entry of the virus in the body.
