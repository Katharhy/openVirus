<p>The involvement of the RAAS system in viral entry makes it pertinent to consider the effects of medications that modulate the system. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are common medications that are used to treat hypertension. In a large study of a cohort of COVID‚Äê19 patients, it was shown that there is an excess prevalence of hypertension in severe cases with poor outcomes suggesting that these medications might play a role in the pathology of the infection.
