<p id="Par8">After an introduction on the chances and challenges encountered in the development of novel antivirals (Brancale—MBDC-2018-GO1), a discussion on the current conditions in UK/EU research networks, obstacles at the interface between research and industry, and preparedness for the treatment of infections with biodefense-related viruses followed. Further contributions outlined the methodical approach to antivirals design and biological evaluation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Using examples from chemists present at the meeting, the structural approach (Step 1; Bassetto—MBDC-2018-GO1), based on in silico dynamic models of antivirals targets, i.e., small-molecule inhibitors of polymerases, proteases, methyltransferases, and ProTide-based improvements of antiviral nucleosides [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>], were explained in detail. The dynamic models are based on solved NMR structures of protein targets. The preselection of virtual candidate antiviral compounds in in silico models against viral protein targets reduces the number of compounds by four magnitudes (10
 <sup>6</sup> library → 10
 <sup>2</sup> selected candidates). The compounds are then synthesized, shipped and compared at a standard concentration (10 μM at IMB) for comparative effectiveness and toxicity in organotypical cell lines against a panel of viruses of interest for the biodefense community, including alpha-, bunya-, filo-, flavi-, ortho-/paramyxo-, and poxviruses. Hit compounds with high efficacy and low toxicity are identified (Step 2). This is followed by IC

 <sub>50</sub> evaluation (Step 3) of emerging hit to lead compounds, aiming for selective indices &gt; 30 in sensitive (e.g., Huh-7 hepatoma cells) and organotypical cell lines selected for the pathogenic traits of the viruses of interest (e.g., U138 glioblastoma cells for encephalitis viruses). This usually results in another reduction of candidate numbers by one to two magnitudes. To confirm drug targets, target validation is then carried out, either by the use of enzymatic assays for viral enzyme targets (Silvestri—MBDC-2018- GO3) or by induction of resistant virus strains showing resistance mutations in the antiviral target areas, as shown with tecovirimat (ST-246) for orthopoxviruses. This concludes the classical in vitro evaluation of antiviral drug candidates. The winnowing process up to this point leads to a reduction ratio of six magnitudes (10
 <sup>6</sup> to 1). If in vitro toxicity is minimal, the compounds go straight into pharmacokinetics testing (rodent models), and into animal models of viral infections (Step 5). Here a dramatic rate of attrition leads to only one out of ten compounds tested in animal models making it into phase I clinical studies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Functional models of virus infection at barriers, and the effect of antivirals on the virus passing the barrier, give an indication of antiviral effects on typical viral pathogenesis, e.g., encephalitis viruses that are being tested on models of the blood brain barrier (Step 4; Hurler—MBDC-2018-GP1). A successful prediction by in vitro functional models of antivirals efficacy in vivo, particularly using primary human organotypic cells, would also result in a significant reduction of unsuccessful drug testing in animal models. The evaluation cycle described above follows the general considerations as outlined by Huggins et al. for Ebolavirus (EBOV) in 1999 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], with the addition of in silico design with dynamic models for compound preselection, which had not yet been available at that time, and represents a methodical approach to antivirals design and development. This approach is used by groups active in the field and is also the basis of the ‘Antivirals Platform’ collaboration between Cardiff University and IMB into prophylaxis and treatment of infections caused by viral biothreat agents, which is funded by SER CYMRU/MRC and IMB’s basic funding. The platform established comprises all steps from molecular design to in vitro testing in complex infection models. Talks at MBDC 2018 included different examples of this approach towards antiviral drug discovery: in silico design of small nucleosidic antivirals and prodrugs against arboviruses (Bassetto-MBDC-2018-GO2), Cima-4, Den-12, MB-124, tick borne encephalitis (TBEV) polymerase inhibitor nucleoside analogues with superior activity in the central nervous system (CNS) cells compared to sofosbuvir (Bugert-MBDC-2018-GO3), novel protease inhibitors for Zika virus as surrogate virus for other flaviviruses using an enzymatic assay for target validation as well as a Zika mouse model (Silvestri-MBDC-2018-GO4), and BB4-D9, a dandelion natural extract antiviral against poxviruses (Zanetta-MBDC-2018-GO5). FDA approval of oral TPOXX® (Tecovirimat/ST-246®), a F13L morphogenesis inhibitor of orthopoxviruses, was reported in the poxvirus session (Grosenbach-MBDC-2018-HO2). Posters provided meaningful examples of the evaluation cycle, with contributions on live cell imaging of virus-infected cells for antivirals testing in a model of the blood brain barrier (Hurler-MBDC-2018-GP2), a novel polymerase-inhibiting CHIKV antiviral (MB-70, Hucke-MBDC-2018-GP4), a NS4a autophagy testing system for flaviviruses (Tscherne-MBDC-2018-GP5), and MoA studies on Cf2642 inhibiting macropinocytosis of measles and poxviruses for use as synergistic cell-targeting antiviral along with virus-specific compounds (Narayan-MBDC-2018-GP6).
