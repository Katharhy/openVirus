<p id="Par22">There are only a small number of antivirals with regulatory approval to treat virus infections, some of which have already been described to select for drug resistant strains. A number of drugs with antiviral activities which are approved for other conditions are being evaluated for repurposing, but the number of compounds currently in the experimental pipeline for clinical testing is small. Consequently, while there are treatment options, they may not be available in sufficient quantity in a biological threat situation. Therefore, research in identification, development, clinical testing and the stockpiling of approved antivirals in sufficient quantities must be a priority for the government actors put in charge of a credible response to deliberate releases of some of the biological agents discussed here. It is well known that even the threat of a biological attack would cause mass hysteria with concomitant economic disruption. Only timely preparation underlined by visible infrastructure, stockpiles of drugs and vaccines, and well-considered emergency plans will allow governments to give the necessary assurances when needed, to avoid negative outcomes [

As long as this is not the case, government funding and research in government-funded laboratories in collaboration with specialized university research groups organized in antiviral platforms have to step into the breach, when considerations of market performance and public health priorities are focusing resources elsewhere.
