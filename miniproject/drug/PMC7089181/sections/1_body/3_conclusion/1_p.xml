<p id="Par21">Antiviral drug development is determined by the virus life cycle, both the steps of viral replication per se and the cellular processes supporting viral replication. The action of antivirals targeting a viral replication step may be augmented by an antiviral hitting a different viral target or a cell process, or secondary effects via drug metabolism, resulting in synergy. Most antivirals in the experimental pipeline are either small molecules designed from scaffolds, mostly nucleoside analogues, or natural extracts/complex organic active compounds derived from extracts. The stages of antiviral drug development begin with in silico design and go via testing in single cell types (organotypic cell lines or primary cells) to determine IC50/CC50 = SI, and complex infection models to animal models, clinical trials, and eventually regulatory approval/market. A major hindrance to antivirals development is that of many compounds that show activity in vitro only very few are effective in animal models. Development may also stop for lack of interest and funding. Human organoids/complex in vitro infection models (e.g., barrier models) may provide a bridge to predict activity in clinical trials.</p>
