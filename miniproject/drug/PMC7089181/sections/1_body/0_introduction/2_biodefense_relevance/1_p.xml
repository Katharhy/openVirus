<p id="Par3">While infections with arthropod-borne and tropical viruses are fairly common in nature, severe outcomes are, with a few exceptions, very rare. Therefore, countermeasures against such unlikely events, especially in the developed world, are regarded as giving little or no return on investments and are sidelined by grant driven research and manufacturers. While this is a legitimate point of view for academia and the pharmaceutical industry, governments have to consider countermeasures against rare agents released, or threatened to be released deliberately by individuals or groups aiming to cause maximum societal disruption and chaos. For such events governments have to prepare credible countermeasures in order to be able to provide prophylaxis, isolation, and treatment for large numbers of exposed and infected individuals. The basis of all considerations on countermeasures and biothreat preparedness is an agent-related risk assessment, which includes numerous criteria like availability of stocks or samples for potential perpetrators, ease of handling, pathogenicity, transmission pathways, tenacity, availability of vaccines, antivirals, and others. This requires research into these countermeasures, including the development, testing and stockpiling of vaccines and antiviral drugs, particularly for dangerous biological agents. This review will focus on viral agents that fit into this category, briefly discussing their relevance for public health and biodefense, mode of action, and give an overview of treatment options available or in the pipeline.</p>
