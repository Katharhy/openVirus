<p id="para0051">Further, patent application US20060002947 disclosed the fabrication of hybrid peptides comprised of three elements: (1) invariant chain; (Ii) essential peptide; (2) chemical structure linking the Ii to the antigenic epitope; (3) antigen epitope binding MHC II molecule. This theory was harnessed to produce Ii-Key/MHC II SARS hybrids. In this respect, Generex reported that they will employ its Ii-Key immune system activation biotechnology to generate a COVID-19 viral peptide vaccine for human clinical practice
