<p id="para0043">In terms of controlling the epidemic aroused by emerging viruses, rapid diagnosis and effective vaccines serve as a complementation to antiviral therapy. Preventive and therapeutic SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will be of fundamental value as the most conspicuous way to mitigate the pandemic crisis 
 <xref rid="bib0133" ref-type="bibr">[133]</xref>. Fortunately, published data on the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence has sparked a global campaign to inaugurate a vaccine against the infections. The scope of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on humanitarianism and the economy is also prompting the assessment of the next-generation vaccine technology platform through new paradigms. On March 16th, 2020, the first trial of COVID-19 vaccine candidate was launched in record speed. Besides, recently, Chen and her team developed and assessed the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine 
 <xref rid="bib0134" ref-type="bibr">[134]</xref>. Their clinical data further revealed that the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was tolerable and immunogenic at 28 days post-vaccination
