<p id="para0048">DNA vaccines provide a precise and flexible tactic to deliver antigens to the immune system and can contain additional sequences of coding molecules to manipulate the results 
 <xref rid="bib0147" ref-type="bibr">[147]</xref>. So far, a variety of DNA vaccine platforms have been exploited to enhance the vaccine efficacy through electroporation to deliver plasmids and addition of adjuvants, yielding improved the immune responses 
 <xref rid="bib0148" ref-type="bibr">[148]</xref>. Inovio Pharmaceuticals have begun pre-clinical trials of a DNA vaccine (named as INO-4800) against COVID-19 
 <xref rid="bib0149" ref-type="bibr">[149]</xref>. This vaccine can induce T cell activation via transferring DNA plasmids that express the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins 
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[150]</xref>. This vaccine platform holds the preponderance of producing therapeutic antibodies and activating immune cells to deliver the vaccine to patients through the skin. Recently, Yu and colleagues developed a series of DNA vaccine candidates expressing different forms of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and assessed them in 35 rhesus macaques 
 <xref rid="bib0151" ref-type="bibr">[151]</xref>. Vaccinated animals developed humoral and cellular immune responses, including neutralizing antibody titers in comparison with those found in convalescent humans and macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2. Surprisingly, all animals were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 after vaccination, and the vaccine encoding the full-length S protein resulted in over 3.1 and over 3.7 log
 <sub>10</sub> reductions in median viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal mucosa, respectively, as compared with sham controls 
 <xref rid="bib0151" ref-type="bibr">[151]</xref>. Their data indicated vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman primates 
 <xref rid="bib0152" ref-type="bibr">[152]</xref>. Hence, in the near future, with the support of CEPI, these findings will boost the vaccine development and the corporation is making provision for the first phase of trials in the United States and China
