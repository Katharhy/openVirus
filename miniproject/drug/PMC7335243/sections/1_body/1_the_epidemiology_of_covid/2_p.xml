<p id="para0003">Spread mainly through respiratory droplets or close contact, SARS-CoV-2 induced diseases has been growing dramatically in accordance with the published data from the World Health Organization (WHO) 
 <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Although the number of confirmed cases in China has decreased a lot from late February 2020, and there is no report of COVID-19 deaths on 6th April, the confirmed cases of CoVs worldwide are still expanding with a vengeance. The spectrum of illness presentation or severity profile also affects triage and diagnostic decision-making, along with the therapeutic options and prognostic expectations 
 <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Till now, the exact source of the current outbreak of COVID-19 remains unclear, but the dynamic model is similar to the classic zoonotic emergence to human-to-human transmission 
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 (âˆ¼3.8%) is lower compared to that of MERS-CoV (37.1%) or SARS-CoV (10%), but the number of infections is more than ten times higher 
 <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. With respect to the lack of evidence that companion animals might be a source of infection, patients with COVID-19 are the prime source of infection, and those with severe conditions are more infectious than those with mild conditions. Intriguingly, asymptomatically infected persons or patients in incubation has also been demonstrated to shed the infectious virus, serving as a potential infection source to drive the transmission of the COVID-19 
 <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In addition, researches focused on the follow-up of recovered patients revealed that the tested samples of rehabilitees continuously showed a positive RT-PCR result, implicating that asymptomatic infection during incubation or recovery from COVID-19 may pose a daunting challenge to disease control and prevention
