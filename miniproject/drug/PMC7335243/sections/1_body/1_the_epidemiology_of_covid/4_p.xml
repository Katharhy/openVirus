<p id="para0005">The early outbreak data of COVID-19 largely follow exponential growth. Disparate models based upon the clinical progression of the disease had been proposed to assess the basic reproductive ratio R
 <sub>0</sub>. A retrospective analysis of the first 425 identified cases demonstrated that in the early stages of COVID-19, the R
 <sub>0</sub> was assessed to be 2.2 
 <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Nevertheless, deterministic compartmental models based upon the likelihood and a model analysis revealed that the control reproduction number R
 <sub>c</sub> might be as high as 6.5 due to the estimation of four generations of viral transmission and serried social contacts 
 <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In this regard, it is noteworthy that R
 <sub>0</sub> estimates may vary in the light of numerous biologics, social behavior, and environmental factors 
 <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In general, the basic R
 <sub>0</sub> assessed by the majority of researches ranges between 2 and 4 
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. According to the WHO data updated on May 28, 2020, more than 215 countries have reported 5593,631 confirmed cases, including 353,334 deaths (

 <xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The US had also recorded the largest number of coronavirus deaths in a day, with more than 1810 deaths reported on April 7th, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Given the condition that the population of all races and ages is generally susceptible, there is an urgent need to further implementing the timely diagnosis, along with efficient isolation of patients, to cut down the R
 <sub>0</sub> of SARS-CoV-2 and control the epidemic outbreak.
