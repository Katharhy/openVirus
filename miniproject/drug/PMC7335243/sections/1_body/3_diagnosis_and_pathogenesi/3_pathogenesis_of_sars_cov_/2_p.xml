<p id="para0012">With regard to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, primary viral replication is assumed to occur in the mucosal epithelium of the upper respiratory tract and further multiplicated in the lower respiratory tract and gastrointestinal mucosa, inducing a mild viremia

 <xref rid="bib0051" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Specifically, the S protein plays a critical role in determining the cell tropism and hence interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 since it hitches the virus to a cellular receptor and subsequently prompts virus entry via membrane fusion 
 <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. After binding to the receptor, the spike protein can catalyze the viral fusion process, allowing the viral genome to enter the cytoplasm. A prerequisite for this procedure is the division of S to subunits, a process known as priming (
 <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The work of Hoffmann et al. unraveled that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the ACE2 receptor for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming 
 <xref rid="bib0052" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Hence, TMPRSS2 inhibitors approved for clinical use may block the entrance and may give rise to an underlying treatment option. Notably, the ability that S can readily obtain new protease cleavage sites and the fact that miscellaneous proteases can perform the same task suggests that this virus can easily adapt to the proliferation in several cell types

Further, a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against SARS-CoV-S1/receptor-binding domain (RBD) had been reported to be unable to interplay with S protein, implicating conspicuous discrepancies in antigenicity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV
