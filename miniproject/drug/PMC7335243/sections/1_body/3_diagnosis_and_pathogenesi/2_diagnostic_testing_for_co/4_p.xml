<p id="para0011">Most of the COVID-19 cases shared similar characteristics on CT images, presenting bilateral distribution of patchy shadows and ground-glass opacity, sometimes presenting a circular shape and peripheral lung distribution 
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Some of the data published from China showed that in 21 primal chest CT scans, a large proportion of patients (86%) developed frosted glass opacity, affecting more than one lung lobe (71%) (bilateral involvement) 
 <xref rid="bib0046" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. It is also worth noting that lung cavitation, pleural effusions, discrete pulmonary nodules, along with lymphadenopathy were absent 
 <xref rid="bib0046" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. In addition to imaging technology, a recent study displayed that the Cas13-based SHERLOCK (specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking) platform can be harnessed for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 
 <xref rid="bib0047" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. In this system, RNA-targeting Cas13 enzyme is deployed to identify specific genetic targets. The Cas13 can cleave nearby RNAs, a ‘collateral’ feature useful for amplifying a reporter signal in the diagnostic test. However, such a system needs to be further verified in clinical tests. Overall, combined with immunochromatography, colloidal gold, and other biotechnologies, associative detection strategies have been progressed swiftly.
