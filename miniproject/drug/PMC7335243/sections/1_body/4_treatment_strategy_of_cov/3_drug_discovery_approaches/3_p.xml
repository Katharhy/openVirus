<p id="para0021">In addition to the test of existing broad-spectrum antiviral agents, another anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery approach might be the chemical libraries screening, which involves a good deal of existing compounds or databases with the information on transcriptional signatures in disparate cell lines 
 <xref rid="bib0068" ref-type="bibr">[68</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0069" ref-type="bibr">69]</xref>. Such a method holds the potential of offering a prompt, high-throughput screening of many off-the-shelf composites, which can thereby be further assessed via antiviral detection test. Importantly, a variety of different types of agents have been discovered among these agent repurposing programs, incorporating many that with significant physiological and immune effects (

It is noteworthy that this method has the main drawback that most agents are not clinically useful in virtue of their underlying immunosuppressive effects or anti-SARS-CoV-2 half-maximal effective concentration values that significantly surpass the peak serum concentration levels that are obtainable at the therapeutic dose
