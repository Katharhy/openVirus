<p id="para0022">The most critical method for anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery includes the de novo development of new, specific drugs based upon the genomic and biophysical understanding of this virus. For instance, the determination of key SARS-CoV-2 targets may bring about the production of siRNA molecules or inhibitors against specific viral enzymes correlated with viral replication. Additionally, mAb targeting host receptors, inhibitors of host cell proteases, host cell endocytosis viruses, along with humanized mAb targeting the RBD, and antiviral peptides targeting the S2 subunit offer various methodology and options for the design and development of possible therapeutics. With the emerging outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the above-mentioned methods are critical for identifying candidate drug composites that can be widely categorized into virus-based and host-based therapy options.</p>
