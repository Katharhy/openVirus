<p id="para0016">For SARS-CoV-2, the large replicase polyprotein 1a (pp1a) and pp1ab encoded by the ORF1a/b are subjected to two viral proteases, papain-like protease (PL
 <sup>pro</sup>) and 3C cleavage-like protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) (also known as M
 <sup>pro</sup>), for producing non-structural proteins (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, RdRp, helicases) which are correlated to viral transcription and replication (

 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Therefore, enzyme inhibitors targeting these proteins may exhibit anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity

 <sup>pro</sup> of SARS-CoV-2, which is the translated polyproteins of ORF 1a/b, is a crucial enzyme that mediates viral replication and transcription 
 <xref rid="bib0062" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Specifically, a Gln-residue almost always requires a substrate at P1 (an amino acid in substrates). There is currently no human homologous for M
 <sup>pro</sup>, which makes it a promising antiviral target (

 <xref rid="bib0063" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Dai and coworkers had conducted the structure-based design of antiviral agents targeting this protease by parsing out the substrate-binding pocket of M
 <sup>pro</sup>
 <xref rid="bib0062" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. In this regard, further study targeting such a protease may give rise to certain antiviral drug candidates.
