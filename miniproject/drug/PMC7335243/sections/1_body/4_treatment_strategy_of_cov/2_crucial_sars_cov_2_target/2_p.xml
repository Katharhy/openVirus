<p id="para0015">The preceding overview of the virology of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the sundry potential mechanisms of damage to the host, lay the foundation for developing specific targeted treatment and prevention. A general idea of pivotal targets for drug discovery is shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> . In consideration of the role of the surface structural S in the virus-cell receptor interplay, it is of particular interest for the antiviral development. mAbs against the S1 subunit RBD and fusion inhibitors targeting the S2 subunit possess potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 capacity

Besides, since ACE2 is the key functional host receptor of SARS-CoV-2 to determine the pathogenicity, mAbs, or molecules targeting the host receptor are effective anti- SARS-CoV-2 drugs, as long as they do not elicit immunopathological effects in animal models 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. A recent study also probed into the COVID-19 S protein-binding site to the cell-surface receptor (known as Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78)). Their outcomes unveiled that the binding between regions III and IV of the S protein model and GRP78 was more favorable. In this regard, region IV is the major tractive force for GRP78 binding, and these 9 residues can be leveraged to design therapeutics specific against this disease 
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Of note, although inhibitors of the proteases that prime S for fusion possess antiviral activity, multiple inhibitors are needed because S can utilize a variety of proteases for priming
