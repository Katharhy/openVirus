<p id="para0017">Another notable drug target may be the cellular enzymes that attach fatty acids to a cluster of cysteines in the cytoplasmic tail of S due to the fact that fatty acids are essential for the fusion of host cell and assembly of the virus, like the description of other S proteins, such as hemagglutinin for influenza viruses. The enzyme that connects the acyl chain to S has not yet been discovered, but the cellular protein will undergo acetylation by the members from the ZDHHC family with unique, only partially overlapping substrate specificities. If a few of them may be acetylated in the airway cells of the lungs, their blockage may suppress the viral replication, and the acylation of cellular proteins will rarely be damaged. In this regard, targeting acyltransferases may be promising, because the cysteine group is existed in all CoV genus S, in spite of their source 
 <xref rid="bib0064" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. However, in consideration of the palmitoylation of crucial proteins in the innate immunity, if the proteins of the innate immune response are modified with the same enzymes as viral proteins, the acylation inhibitor may be limited.
