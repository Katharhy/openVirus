<p id="para0040">Stem cell therapy is also making its way into COVID-19 disease treatment. Recently, some researches have demonstrated that the intravenous transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was safe and efficient for COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for critically ill patients 
 <xref rid="bib0124" ref-type="bibr">[124]</xref>. As mentioned, COVID-19 infection may induce uncontrolled inflammatory innate reactions along with undermined adaptive immune reactions, subsequently leading to detrimental tissue damage. MSC-based immunomodulation treatment is able to counteract the cytokine storm aroused by the immune system and foster endogenous repair via reparative attributes of the stem cells 
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">[125]</xref>. As it is unveiled by the recent study of China, seven COVID-19 patients (1 critically ill patient, 4 critically ill patients, and 2 patients with mild symptoms) received intravenous injection of bone marrow MSCs. In all cases, the patients were cured, while the 3 patients in the placebo control group all suffered from severe illness, 1 died, 1 developed ARDS, and 1 was in stable condition

 <xref rid="bib0124" ref-type="bibr">[124]</xref>. Notably, the FDA has also opened the way to the compassionate use of MSCs intravenous infusions in patients with COVID-19 ARDS and very dismal prognosis 
 <xref rid="bib0127" ref-type="bibr">[127]</xref>. Although such a kind of treatment is an ideal option for COVID-19 therapy, it has limitations regarding the supply of clinical-grade MSCs and the rate of preparation for subsequent clinical use.
