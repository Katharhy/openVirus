<p id="para0032">Protease inhibitorsare promising candidates for antiviral agents, and can block the replication of viral genes via binding to enzymes that are responsible for proteolysis 
 <xref rid="bib0097" ref-type="bibr">[97]</xref>. Lopinavir and ritonavir, both protease inhibitors, have been approved as HIV medicines and have been found to possess antiviral activity against SARS and MERS. For the sake of destroying the SARS-CoV-2, clinical trials had begun to parse out the antiviral property of HIV protease inhibitors among patients. Notwithstanding, the antiviral effect of such inhibitors in coronavirus proteases remains controversial. Notably, a study regarding the comparison of the efficacy of prophylactic remdesivir and therapeutic remdesivir in combination with lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferon β against MERS-CoV unveiled that remdesivir was more effective than the combination therapy in reducing viral load and improving the degree of pathological changes in lung tissue. Aside from the gastrointestinal adverse reactions aroused by lopinavir-ritonavir, it is worth noting that lopinavir-ritonavir treatment alone may fail to offer benefits in comparison with standard care alone. The median time for clinical improvement was 16 d, and the reduction in viral RNA load among patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 did not appear to differ in both cases

Further, Baden and Rubin unraveled that lopinavir simply was not particularly potent against SARS-CoV-2. The concentration neccessary to suppress viral replication is relatively high as compared with the serum levels found in patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir
