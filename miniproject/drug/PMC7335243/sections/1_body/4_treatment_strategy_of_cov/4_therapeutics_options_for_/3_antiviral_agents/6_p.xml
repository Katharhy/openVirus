<p id="para0028">As an adenine analogue with a similar chemical structure to the approved HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor tenofovir alafenamide, remdesivir (GS-5734) exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several RNA viruses and has the capacity of competing with RdRp (

 <xref rid="bib0089" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>. It also possesses outstanding 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiviral activity compared with lopinavir and ritonavir 
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>. In the United States, the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported, and remdesivir was administered. The patient's clinical condition improved after only one day of remdesivir treatment 
 <xref rid="bib0079" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>. A newly released research offered remdesivir for COVID-19 inpatients on the basis of sympathy. In the cohort of patients admitted for treatment of severe COVID-19, patients treated with sympathetic remdesivir achieved relatively good clinical improvement (36 of 53 patients (68%)) 
 <xref rid="bib0091" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>. However, recently, leaked data from a crucial remdesivir investigation suggests this potent CoV agent may not be effective. Accordingly, the chief medical officer of Gilead Sciences said that the summary post online might include inappropriate characterizations of the study and it was terminated early due to low enrollment 
 <xref rid="bib0092" ref-type="bibr">[92]</xref>. Paradoxically, the drug's maker announced that in its own trial, more than half of 400 participants with severe COVID-19 had recovered from their illness within two weeks of receiving treatment 
 <xref rid="bib0093" ref-type="bibr">[93]</xref>. However, this study lacked a placebo-controlled arm. Moreover, the outcomes from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) further demonstrated that this drug can stop some patients from becoming critically ill 
 <xref rid="bib0093" ref-type="bibr">[93]</xref>. In this regard, these findings suggest that differences in races and differences in clinical trials may lead to disparate experimental outcomes. The real anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of remdesivir need to be further studied in the long term.
