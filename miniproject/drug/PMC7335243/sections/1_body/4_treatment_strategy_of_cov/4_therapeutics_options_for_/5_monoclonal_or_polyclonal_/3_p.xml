So, neutralizing antibodies against other pro-inflammatory cytokines may be another promising strategy to dampen the inflammatory responses, thus responding well to treat the COVID-19. In a clinical trial conducted in Anhui, China, IL-6 receptor-targeted mAb tocilizumab was utilized to treat 21 patients with severe COVID-19. Clinical data showed quick fever control and improved respiratory function
