<p id="para0008">As for the phylogenetic network analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, after analysis of the sample from across the world, researchers have found three central variants differentiated through amino acid alterations, denoted A, B, and C, with A being the ancestral type in line with the bat outgroup CoV. Intriguingly, types A and C account for a considerable proportion outside East Asia (Europe and the United States) 
 <xref rid="bib0037" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. By comparison, B is the most common type in East Asia, and its ancestors â€™genomes do not appear to spread outside East Asia without first mutating into a derived type B. Hence, SARS-CoV-2 genomes were found to be closely correlated, and evolutionary selection took place in human hosts, sometimes with parallel evolutionary events, where the same viral mutation occurs in two disparate human hosts 
 <xref rid="bib0037" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Owing to the erratic nature of RNA viruses as well as its high contagiousness, the continuous monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 from humans or animal species is of extreme significance for pandemic control.
