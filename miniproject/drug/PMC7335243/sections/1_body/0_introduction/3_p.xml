<p id="para0002">In general, CoVs, subfamily coronavirinae, are a cluster of highly diversified, enveloped, positive-sense and single-stranded viruses ((+)ssRNA virus) that can induce enteric, respiratory, hepatic as well as neurological disorders of discrepant severity in a wide range of animal species, encompassing humans 
 <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">4]</xref>. As the largest RNA viruses ever discovered, CoVs can be categorized into α-, β-, δ- and γ-CoVs. Among these genera, the β group can be subdivided into A, B, C and D lineages 
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In the past 17 years, three neoteric β-CoVs, SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), along with SARS-CoV-2 have emerged, engendering severe human diseases. Although the origin of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is not yet clear, recent studies have deduced that it might be transmitted through bats because it is highly similar to the bat SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses 
 <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Later on, genomic and evolutionary proofs of the occurrence of Pangolin-CoV indicated that pangolin species might be the potential intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2

Despite the continuous improvement of the prevention strategy and the disease surveillance system, the lack of efficacious drug treatment and correlated high morbidity cases of the SARS-CoV-2 along with its potentiality to induce pandemics, highlighting the urgent demand for neoteric drug discovery. In this review, we will first briefly describe the status of epidemiology, mechanism and diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition to the discussion of current management strategies for COVID-19, the emphasis has been given to the treatment options and drug discovery of COVID-19. We will refer to the drug screening progress and the development of vaccines for the COVID-19 therapy. Ultimately, we will delineate the overarching challenges in the clinical invention of new anti-coronavirus agents and offer some insights toward the prevention of such disease based on the understanding of its epidemic dynamics in real-time.
