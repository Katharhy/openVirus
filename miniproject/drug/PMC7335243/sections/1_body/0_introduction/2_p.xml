The rapid alteration of ecology and urbanization along with vulnerable public health systems have facilitated more frequent emerging of epidemics, which have become more and more intractable for us to prevent and contain. In December 2019, a new coronavirus (CoV) correlated with human respiratory disease was firstly reported causing pneumonia and death

The causative virus, named as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the pathogen leading to the CoV disease COVID-19. Infections with SARS-CoV-2 are now swift and violent, and as of 28 May 2020, over 5.5 million cases have been confirmed in more than 215 countries, with over 353,334 deaths. To date, SARS-CoV-2 has most closest relation to SARS and relevant viruses that circulate in bats, as evidenced by viral genome analysis as well as the research probing into the proximal origin of such virus
