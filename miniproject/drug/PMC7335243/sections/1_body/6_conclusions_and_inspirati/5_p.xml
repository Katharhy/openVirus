<p id="para0057">With respect to the detailed exploitation of COVID-19 vaccines, several pharmaceutical corporations and institutions have also launched the project for vaccine development. Notwithstanding, the commercial market for vaccines, especially vaccines for emerging infectious diseases, is confined by the high cost and time required for vaccine development along with the uncertainty of profitability. Accordingly, CEPI is combining efforts to encourage the progress of vaccines against COVID-19. Besides, in the near future, the production of a lot of vaccines may bring about the challenge in scaling up manufacturing quickly, because the infrastructure needed will differ in virtue of the vaccine type. Another concern regarding the vaccine development may be the antibody-dependent enhancement issue.</p>
