<p>The unexpected clinical manifestations of the COVID-19 outbreak led the medical community and the society at large to react in differing ways and introduce variable contention measures that interfered with a correct assessment of the cause-effect relationship between the extent of contagion, development of symptoms, disease severity and complications, and outcome. These measures included, among others, (1) the variable control of the environment and the local setting (workplace, transports, amusement places, healthcare facilities, nursing homes, etc.); (2) the uncontrolled use of RT-PCR-based assays on respiratory specimens, some of them with still unproven validity and reliability; and (3) the variable measures introduced to reduce social contacts. These non-standardized medical interventions must be contrasted with the intrinsic heterogeneity of the interaction of viral infection and host reaction, which includes (1) the reproductive number; (2) duration of the incubation period; (3) demographic and clinical characteristics of the patient (age, sex, comorbidities, and immune status); and, not least, (4) the possible adverse effects of treatments and treatment categories. Thus, the insurgence of a neurological disease in the acute phase of the infection must be assessed in the light of this complex scenario, in order to verify whether the disease is the direct effect of the viral aggression (meningitis, encephalitis, or acute encephalopathy) or an indirect, immune-mediated, effect. Compared to the former, the latter is more difficult to investigate and requires the calculation of the number of cases that during follow-up might be expected in the area due to the incidence of that same disease in the general population.</p>
