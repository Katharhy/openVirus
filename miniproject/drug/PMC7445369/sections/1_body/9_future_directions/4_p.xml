<p>The lessons learned from previous and current observations of the impact of pandemics on neurological manifestations and global health emphasize the need for strengthening health systems, to ensure that research and development efforts are directed toward existing needs. People with neurological disorders might be at risk of incurring the most severe complications of the infectious disease, and, conversely, the infection itself might be a source of neurological complications. These observations have profound reflections on the management of acute neurological conditions like stroke and chronic conditions like multiple sclerosis, neurodegenerative disorders, and myasthenia gravis. Furthermore, the implementation of social distancing and interruption of all nonurgent clinical activities, thus limiting access to hospitals, have induced significant problems in the clinical care of several chronic neurological conditions. The likely worsening of the outcomes of these neurological conditions due to the change in access to medical care is part of the impact of COVID-19 infection that should be measured [
