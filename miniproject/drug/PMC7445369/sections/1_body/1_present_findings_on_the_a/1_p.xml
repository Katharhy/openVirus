<p>In one of the first reports on neurological findings during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, neurological manifestations were present in 78/214 patients (36.4%) and fell into 3 categories: central nervous system (dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, and seizure), peripheral nervous system (taste impairment, smell impairment, vision impairment, and nerve pain), and muscular-skeletal [

In a retrospective study of patients admitted in a single center in Wuhan, 11/221 patients with COVID-19 developed acute ischemic stroke, 1 cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and 1 cerebral hemorrhage. However, patients with these severe complications are more likely to be elderly and present medical comorbidities, especially vascular risk factors such as hypertension [

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A complete assessment of neurological signs is often difficult because of drug-induced neuromuscular blockade or early death. Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Miller-Fisher syndrome [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] were also observed. The occurrence of cerebrovascular events in patients with arterial hypertension and cardiovascular disease might be related to a direct effect of the infection itself or an inappropriate host response. However, in case reports and small series, the possibility of coincidence cannot be excluded [
