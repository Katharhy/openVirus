<p>A significantly increased incidence of GBS after swine flu vaccination in the USA in 1976 led to a debate on the possible link between influenza vaccinations and GBS [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The reported relative risk was 7.6 corresponding to about ten excess cases of GBS per million vaccinations. Between 1978 and 2009, several studies on the association between influenza vaccination and GBS yielded conflicting results [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although the biological mechanisms remain unsettled [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], a study in mice [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] suggested that influenza vaccine antigens may induce cross-reactive anti-ganglioside antibodies, eventually causing peripheral nerve damage. During the influenza pandemic in 2009, the possible link between influenza vaccination and GBS drew special attention due to the rapid development and implementation of vaccines against pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus. A case-control study was conducted in Italy between October 2010 and May 2011 to explore the association between influenza vaccination and GBS [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Influenza vaccination was associated with GBS, with a relative risk of 2.1 (95% CI 1.1, 3.9), giving an attributable risk from 2 to 5 GBS cases per 1,000,000 vaccinations. These findings were in keeping with the results of eight studies conducted during the 2009â€“2010 influenza vaccine campaign with a monovalent A/H1N1 vaccine, which showed a non-significant or at best small increase of the risk [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The results of those studies do not modify the risk-benefit profile of seasonal influenza vaccination but call attention to the need to develop a vaccine with a favorable safety profile.
