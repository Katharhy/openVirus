<p>The current study aimed to screen pre-existing antiviral drugs and come up with potential antidotes against SARS-CoV-2. The advantages of drug repurposing (also known as drug repositioning, drug reprofiling and drug retasking) include: the risk of the drug failing the safety and toxicity tests is much reduced, reduced costs during clinical trials and finally, significantly reduced time scale required for drug development (Pushpakom et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Developing novel drugs or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 will demand a lot of time, which we cannot afford at present. SARS-CoV-2 is spreading at a rapid rate; therefore, it is rational to look for pre-existing drugs and formulations, which can control this highly contagious virus. The precautionary steps taken by governments all over the world include social distancing, quarantines and lockdowns, which themselves have adverse psychological and economic repercussions (Madhav et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The WHO also recognises the vast potential of drug repurposing approach, and on 18 March 2020, they announced ‘SOLIDARITY’ (World Health Organization, 
 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">2020d</xref>) global mega trial of the four most promising COVID-19 treatments. In the present study, we have identified two drugs against 3CLpro (Raltegravir and Paritaprevir) and two drugs against 2′-OMTase (Bictegravir and Dolutegravir), which are supposed to act as potential inhibitors against COVID-19. The proposed drug candidates obtained from this computational study could be efficacious in developing a much-needed threauptics against SARS-CoV-2, and it will further strengthen the concept of drug repurposing. However, being not able to replicate the physiological conditions entirely is one of the main drawbacks of computational biology (Gimeno et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Marklund &amp; Benesch, 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) and therefore, further 
 <italic>in vivo/in vitro</italic> validations are required to confirm the findings of this study. Raltegravir (Markowitz et al., 2007), Bictegravir (Sax et al., 2017) and Dolutegravir (Cahn et al., 2013; Walmsley et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) belong to the family of integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI). They are already being used in antiretroviral therapy (ART) against the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV) infections. The final drug, Paritaprevir(Feld et al., 2016; Sulkowski et al., 2015), is being used to treat chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infections. It suppresses viral replication by inhibiting the non-structural 3/4 A protease of HCV (Carrion et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Finally, the findings of this study might help develop antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2, expediting medical countermeasure advancement and should serve to persuade researchers and physicians to strengthen their efforts on discovering novel uses for existing medications.
