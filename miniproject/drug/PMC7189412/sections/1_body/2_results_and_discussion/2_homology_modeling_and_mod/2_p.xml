<p>Homology modelling is one of the standard 
 <italic>in silico</italic> procedures, which allows predicting the three-dimensional structure of a protein molecule based on experimentally solved homologous structures known as structural templates (Bordoli et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Sequence identity and Query coverage are two crucial parameters to identify the suitable structural templates for homology modelling technique. Moreover, the 3D structure of the target protein is essential to explore its function (Micheletti, 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The 3D models of 3CLpro and 2′-OMTase were predicted using SWISS-MODEL (Waterhouse et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). For the best results, we used the user-defined template option present in SWISS-MODEL. Protein BLAST (Camacho et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) results were taken into account for the selection of suitable template structures. The X-ray crystal structure of 3CLpro from Human SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) solved at 1.9 Å (PDB ID: 1UJ1) resolution was selected as the template for SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. For 2′-OMTase, we used a 2 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of nsp10/nsp16 complex (PDB ID: 3R24) of SARS-CoV. The template (PDB ID: 1UJ1) was selected because it has 96.08% sequence identity and 100% query coverage towards SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Also, the template (PDB ID: 3R24) has a sequence identity of 93.29% and query coverage of 100% against SARS-CoV-2. In SWISS-MODEl, Global Model Quality Estimation (GMQE) (Waterhouse et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) score of 0.99 out of 1 and QMEAN (Benkert et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) score of 0.09 was achieved for 3CLpro, whereas for 2′-OMTase, GMQE score was 0.97 out of 1, and QMEAN score was −2.57. These quality estimations depict the reliability of the modelled protein structure, target–template alignment and the template search method. It is also worth noting that 3CLpro makes a homodimeric structure, but since only one protomer is active in each dimer, we only modelled the single protomer, and further used it for 
 <italic>in silico</italic> interaction or molecular docking and MD simulation studies (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).
