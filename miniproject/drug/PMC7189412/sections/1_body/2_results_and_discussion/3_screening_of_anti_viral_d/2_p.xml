<p>Virtual screening is one of the essential tools in drug designing and discovery process as it allows the prediction of the conformation and orientation of a ligand or drug molecule within the binding site of a target molecule (Kitchen et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Also, the virtual screening tools employ scoring functions to predict the strength of the protein-ligand interactions, generating a score for each docked pose. Subsequently, the docked poses are ranked based on the score provided by the scoring function to identify the pose that most closely resembles the actual binding mode of the ligand (Gimeno et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). PyRx was used for the virtual screening of antiviral drugs against 3CLpro and 2′-OMTase proteins. One hundred twenty-three compounds belonging to the category of antiviral drugs were downloaded from DrugBank (Wishart et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) and were subsequently converted into a single SDF library. This in-house SDF library was used to screen both the proteins. Two drugs were selected against each protein based on their estimated free energy of binding (ΔG), binding site orientation and the protein residues with which they were found to be interacting with drug molecules. In the case of 3CLpro (see 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), we chose two molecules, namely Paritaprevir (DB09297) and Raltegravir (DB06817). Similarly, for 2′-OMTase (see 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), the best two drugs were found to be Dolutegravir (DB08930) and Bictegravir (DB11799).
