<p>According to the results obtained from electrostatic surface potential, all of the drug molecules were found interacting mostly with the negatively charged residues of both 3CLpro (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>) and 2â€²-OMTase (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>), which revealed that these molecules were oriented in the active site of both the proteins.
