<p>The estimated binding free energy (ΔG) of Paritaprevir against 3CLpro was observed to be −9.8 kcal/mol, and the estimated inhibitory constant was 65.52 nM. On the other hand, the binding affinity (ΔG) of Raltegravir was measured to be −7.8 kcal/mol, and the inhibitory constant was 1.916 µM. Both Paritaprevir and Raltegravir were found to be interacting with the active site residues (including the Cys145-His41 catalytic dyad) (see 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) and interacting with the substrate-binding pocket (see
