<p>PCA of MD simulations is a standard technique widely used to identify the essential motion of protein molecules. The PCA was employed to reveal the biologically significant and relevant motions from the global trajectories of unbound proteins as well as the protein-drug complexes using Essential Dynamics (ED) approach. ED analyses the combined fluctuations of the most unsteady regions of protein molecules into two variables, namely Principal Component 1 (PC1) and Principal Component 2 (PC2), which represents the majority of fluctuations observed in MD simulation.</p>
