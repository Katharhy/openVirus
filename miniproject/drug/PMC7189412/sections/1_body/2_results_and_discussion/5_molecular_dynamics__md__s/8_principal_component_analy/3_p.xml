<p>PCA graph of unbound 3CLpro, 3CLpro-Raltegravir complex and 3CLpro-Paritaprevir complex revealed that the protein molecule was slightly more flexible in the presence of both drug molecules (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0009">Figure 9</xref>). The trace of covariance matrix for 3CLpro, 3CLpro-Raltegravir complex and 3CLpro-Paritaprevir complex was found to be 115.482 nm
 <sup>2</sup>, 136.366 nm
 <sup>2</sup> and 132.059 nm
 <sup>2</sup>, respectively. The 3CLpro-Paritaprevir complex was found to be occupying lesser conformational space than the 3CLpro-Raltegravir complex. This result, along with previous analyses such as RMSD, RMSF, Rg and SASA additionally supported that Raltegravir and also Paritaprevir could be the most promising candidates which might be inhibiting the function of 3CLpro.
