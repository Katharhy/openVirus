<p>Structural superposition before and after the MD simulation of drug-free 3CLpro structures showed an RMSD of 2.41 Å. It indicates that the MD simulated 3CLpro structure was consistent and geometrically well optimised, which did not deviate, in comparison to the initial protein structure. Moreover, we also performed the structural superimposition analysis of drug bounded 3CLpro structures which explained that the RMSD before and after MD simulation of 3CLpro-Raltegravir complex and 3CLpro-Paritaprevir complex was reliable and stable with the values of 2.15 Å and 2.47 Å, respectively (see
