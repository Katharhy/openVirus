<p>The average SASA of 2′-OMTase, 2′-OMTase-Dolutegravir complex and 2′-OMTase-Bictegravir complex were found to be 126.77 nm
 <sup>2</sup>, 130.116 nm
 <sup>2</sup> and 131.03 nm
 <sup>2</sup>, respectively. The results suggested that both of the proteins-drug complexes were impressively stable after the binding of drug molecules to their active sites (see
