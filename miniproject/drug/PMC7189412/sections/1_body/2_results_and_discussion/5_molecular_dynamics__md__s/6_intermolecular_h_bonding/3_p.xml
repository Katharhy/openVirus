<p>In the case of 3CLpro, we observed the maximum number of hydrogen bonds in the 3CLpro-Paritaprevir complex (six intermolecular H-bonds) followed by 3CLpro-Raltegravir complex (five intermolecular H-bonds). The average value of intermolecular H-bonds were 2 for both 3CLpro-Paritaprevir complex and 3CLpro-Raltegravir complex, respectively (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figure 7</xref>).This results explained that both the drug molecules interacted effectively towards the active site of 3CLpro with a significant number of hydrogen bonds.
