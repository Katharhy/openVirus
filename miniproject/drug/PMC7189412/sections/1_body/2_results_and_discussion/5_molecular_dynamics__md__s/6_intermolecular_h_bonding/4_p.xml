<p>In the case of 2′-OMTase, we observed a maximum number of hydrogen bonds in the 2′-OMTase-Dolutegravir complex (six intermolecular H-bonds) followed by 2′-OMTase-Bictegravir complex (four intermolecular H-bonds). The average value of intermolecular H-bonds were 2 and 1 for 2′-OMTase-Dolutegravir complex and 2′-OMTase-Bictegravir complex, respectively (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0008">Figure 8</xref>). From the results of intermolecular hydrogen bonding, Dolutegravir was found to be interacting with a higher number of hydrogen bonds towards 2′-OMTase than the other drug molecule.
