<p>RMSF is an essential structural parameter to identify the flexible and rigid regions of the protein structure. It is a measure of deviations of a particle from its original position. Moreover, it can also be used to identify the flexible residues in the protein, and thus it enables us to explore the conformational flexibility of the protein structure. The RMSF analysis was estimated for C-alpha atom of each residue representing the average displacement of each atom.</p>
