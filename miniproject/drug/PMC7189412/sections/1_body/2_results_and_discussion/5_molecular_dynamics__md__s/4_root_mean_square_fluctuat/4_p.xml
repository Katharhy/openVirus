<p>In the case of 2′-OMTase, the fluctuations were observed throughout the entire protein. 2′-OMTase also has an extensively looped structure, and as previously explained, we did expect to see significant fluctuations across the molecule. Moreover, both protein-drug complexes were also highly flexible (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6b</xref>). The average RMSF values of 2′-OMTase, 2′-OMTase-Dolutegravir complex and 2′-OMTase-Bictegravir complex were found to be 0.155 nm, 0.161 nm and 0.165 nm, respectively. Even though the average fluctuations of both protein-drug complexes were very similar, the 2′-OMTase-Dolutegravir complex was consistently found to be showing the most significant fluctuations. Besides, the conserved K-D-K-E (Lys-46, Asp-130, Lys-170 and Glu-203) remained remarkably stable throughout the MD simulation.
