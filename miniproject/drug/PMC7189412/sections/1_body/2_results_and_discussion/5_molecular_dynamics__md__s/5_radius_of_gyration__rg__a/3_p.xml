<p>In the case of 3CLpro, both of the protein-drug complexes were found to be more compact than the unbound protein molecule (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5c</xref>). The average Rg value of 3CLpro, 3CLpro-Raltegravir complex and 3CLpro-Paritaprevir complex was found to be 2.165 nm, 2.116 nm and 2.144 nm, respectively. We also observed a few minor variations in Rg, which could be attributed to the conformational shifts that resulted from the changes in the secondary structures of protein during the MD simulation.
