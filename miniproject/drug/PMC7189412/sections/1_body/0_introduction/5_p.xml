<p>The present study utilises the systematic drug repurposing approach to identify antiviral drugs which can act as promising inhibitors against 3CLpro and 2′-OMTase and also understand their inhibitory mechanism through extensive 
 <italic>in silico</italic> approaches. We have employed molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies to calculate various structural parameters including the estimated binding free energy (ΔG) of the drugs, their estimated inhibition constant (Ki), Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF), Radius of Gyration (Rg), Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the intermolecular hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) for free and drug bounded protein molecules.
