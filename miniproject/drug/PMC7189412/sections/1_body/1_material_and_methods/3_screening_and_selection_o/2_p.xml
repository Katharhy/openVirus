One hundred twenty-three entries belonging to the category of antiviral drugs were downloaded from DrugBank database (Wishart et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) and were subsequently converted into a single structure data file (SDF) library (see

 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). AutoDockVina (Trott &amp; Olson, 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) docking wizard inbuilt in PyRx was utilised for all of the docking calculations. In PyRx, blind docking with the exhaustiveness 32 option was used to carry out the virtual screening and docking of antiviral drugs against 3CLpro (Grid Box: center_

Once we got the results obtained from virtual screening, we selected two drug molecules for each protein based on the estimated binding free energy (ΔG), estimated inhibition constant (Ki), their orientation at the catalytic site and the interacting residues. The selected protein-drug complexes were further subjected to MD simulations for understanding the structural stability of protein-drug complexes at the long-interval.
