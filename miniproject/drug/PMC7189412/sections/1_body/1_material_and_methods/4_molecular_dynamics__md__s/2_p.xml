<p>To make the docking results mimic the physiological state of protein molecules, the free proteins and the best protein-drug complexes were subjected to MD simulation in an explicit solvent model. MD simulation was performed using GROMACS 2019 (Abraham et al.) with GROMOS96 43a1 force field parameters (Chiu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The topology of the drug molecules was created using PRODRG webserver (Schuttelkopf &amp; van Aalten, 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The simulation of all of the proteins and protein-drug complexes were run for a period of 100 ns. To make the system electrostatically neutral, counter ions were added to the protein-drug complexes. The complexes were solvated within 10 Å SPC/E water cube (Berendsen et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). The protein-drug complexes were minimised in multiple steps using steepest descent method, where minimisation of the whole system, water cube and non-heavy atoms of the complexes were accomplished. The entire systems were then progressively heated up to 300 K on a time scale of 100 ps. The equilibration steps were performed in two different phases, one with constant pressure and temperature

Various structural parameters, like Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Root Mean Square Fluctuations (RMSF), Radius of Gyration (Rg), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on essential dynamics (ED) approach, Inter-molecular Hydrogen Bonding (H-bonding) and Solvent-Accessible Surface Area (SASA) were calcualted as a function of time to explore the structural behaviour of the proteins and protein-drug complexes.
