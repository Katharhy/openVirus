<p id="p0125">CoVs are enveloped, single strand positive-sense RNA viruses with a genome consisting of 26 to 32k nucleotides, expressing 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16) and four structural proteins, such as spike (S protein), membrane, envelope, and nucleocapsid proteins [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A, S protein is located on the surface of virus particles, which plays a key role in virus entry into host cells, and is also one of the major targets of antiviral drugs and neutralizing antibodies [

 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>]. CoVs are divided into four genera which belongs to Coronaviridae, alpha, beta, delta and gamma CoVs. So far, there are seven CoVs causing human diseases, including three highly pathogenic CoVs (HPCoVs) (SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV) and four normal human CoVs (abbreviated as HCoVs) (HCoV229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1) [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 belong to the alpha genus, while the other 5 CoVs belong to the beta genus. The genes of S protein from the three HPCoVs form 3 clusters, as shown in the polygenetic tree in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A. Compared with MERS-CoV, the S protein gene of SARS-CoV-2 is a little bit closer to SARS-CoV, as reported they are sharing about 50% identity [
