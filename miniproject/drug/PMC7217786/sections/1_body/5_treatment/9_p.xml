<p id="p0215">With this in mind, it is quite urgent to develop novel anti-influenza drugs with higher antiviral potency and resistance barrier. Hemagglutinin glycoprotein, located on the surface of influenza virions [
 <xref rid="bib133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>], plays a critical role in virus attachment and membrane fusion. Accompanied with HA structure characteristics elucidated, HA inhibitors appear to be one of the most promising candidates [

 <xref rid="bib136" ref-type="bibr">[136]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib137" ref-type="bibr">[137]</xref>]. With high efficacy and broad antiviral activity, some inhibitors targeting HA such as DAS181 and arbidol are currently in clinical development stage or partly approved for influenza virus infection [

 <xref rid="bib139" ref-type="bibr">[139]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib140" ref-type="bibr">[140]</xref>]. Considering the antigen drift and shift of IAVs, the conserved regions on HA, such as the HA1 receptor binding sites (RBS) and the HA2 stem domain, are more attractive for new drug design [

 <xref rid="bib142" ref-type="bibr">[142]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib143" ref-type="bibr">[143]</xref>]. A number of broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies targeting above the two domains have been identified. For example, CR9114 exerts a broader antiviral effect against both influenza A and B viruses in mice by binding to HA stem domain, which may be useful for the treatment of severe influenza disease [
