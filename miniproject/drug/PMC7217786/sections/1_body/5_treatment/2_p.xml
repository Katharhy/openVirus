<p id="p0180">The RNA virus inhibitors were designed to target the different steps of virus replication cycle. Some of them inhibit virus entry or release, some interfere gene synthesis, and some inhibit virus protease, or some modulate innate immune response, like interferons etc. However, there are no specific drugs for treatment of CoVs infection. Most often used for treatment of SARS and MERS are ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir. Ribavirin is similar to guanosine and inosine and interfere viral RNA replication, which is more frequently used in combination with interferons to treat chronic hepatitis C infection [
