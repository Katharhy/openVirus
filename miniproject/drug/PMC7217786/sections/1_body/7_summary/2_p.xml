<p id="p0245">Human CoVs and IAVs share many characteristics, especially in HPHTs. Most of them infect the respiratory tract through direct contact and airway droplets and cause similar clinical symptoms like fever, cough, and sore throat. In contrast, MERS-CoV, H7N9 and H5N1 viruses rarely transmit between humans. SARS-CoV, H1N1pdm09, and H5N1 viruses easily infect younger people. Severe patients usually infected with HPHTs develop bilateral pneumonia, ARDS, respiratory failure, and even death. CT and autopsy showed that the main pulmonary pathological manifestations were DAD, hyaline membrane formation, alveolar and interstitial edema, fibromyxoid exudation, etc. At present, there are no specific and effective drugs or vaccines for the treatment and prevention of CoVs. However, thanks to clinicians’ and scientists’ efforts worldwide, some promising progress has been made in the treatment of the diseases. Although there are some drugs and vaccines for the treatment and prevention of IAVs, it is still necessary to further research and develop more effective methods of treatment and prevention to better control the influenza epidemic.</p>
