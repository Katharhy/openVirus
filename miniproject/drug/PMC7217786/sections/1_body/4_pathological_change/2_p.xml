<p id="p0175">Both CoVs and IAVs can cause ARDS and lead to multiple organ failure and death. The published pathological data that were collected from autopsy, lung biopsies and chest computed tomography (CT) scan are summarized in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">TableÂ 3</xref> . For patients with HPHTs infection, the general manifestations of the lung pathological change were inflammatory exudation or acute diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), with hyaline membrane formation, fibrin mucoid exudation, interstitial and alveolar edema, inflammatory interstitial infiltration and vascular congestion, epithelial cell proliferation, and pulmonary consolidation. However, there is no fibrin exudate found in the lungs of MERS patients, which may be related to the different stage of the disease progression. Almost all of the virus infections caused bronchioles injury except COVID-19 and H7N9 IAV [
 <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], presented as the aggregation of fibrin in the bronchial intracavitary, the loss of cilia, the exfoliation of bronchioles epithelium, etc. It was reported that HCoVs were found to be associated with bronchiolitis in immunocompromised people, the elderly and young children, but showed light disease in the lungs.
