<p id="p0120">In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, caused a pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei province of China. It erupted in many other countries in the following months and eventually became a worldwide pandemic. The pneumonia was officially named COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO) [

At the same time, other types of coronaviruses and influenza viruses, which have been widespread in the world, may invade human society again during this winter or in other circumstances, circulating together with the SARS-CoV-2 and causing more serious respiratory diseases [

It is necessary to investigate whether the simultaneous prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, such as IAVs, can promote the spreading of each other. In addition, because the clinical symptoms caused by CoVs and IAVs infection are very similar to each other [

This article will summarize and compare the epidemic characteristics, clinical symptoms, treatment, and prevention measures for the diseases which are caused by CoVs or IAVs respectively, hoping to provide a brief comparative information for the clinicians and researchers who are working in the related fields.
