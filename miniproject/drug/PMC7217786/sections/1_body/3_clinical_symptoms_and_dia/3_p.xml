<p id="p0165">At the late stage of disease onset, compared with the seasonal viruses, all of the HPHTs can result in similar severe clinical symptoms, such as bilateral pneumonia, kidney damage, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lactate dehydrogenase, and lymphocytopenia. In addition, three HPCoVs and H7N9 IAV infection usually showed ground glass pneumonia. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, H7N9 IAV, and H5N1 IAV caused more hepatic injury. SARS-CoV-2 and H5N1 IAV meanwhile caused more heart failure. The critical patient ratio of the HPHTs infection can be 10%–70% after 2–10 days of the disease development.</p>
