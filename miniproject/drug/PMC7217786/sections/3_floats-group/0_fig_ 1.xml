  <p>Spike proteins and life cycles of CoV and IAV. 3D models of CoV with spike protein genes based polygenetic tree (A) and summary diagram of the CoV life cycle (B). (C) IAV with HA protein genes based polygenetic tree and (D) summary diagram of IAV life cycle. Both neighbor-joining trees are generated by using ClustalX 1.83 and MEGA7 with the full length of glycoprotein genes downloaded from GenBank. The year in the brackets indicates that the time of the virus was reported first.</p>
