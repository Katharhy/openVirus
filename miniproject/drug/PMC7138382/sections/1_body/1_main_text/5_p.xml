<p id="p0055">The knowledge gained from experiments of IFN-I treatment against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is valuable in the selection of potential treatments against SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are able to disrupt the interferon signaling pathway. For example, the Orf6 protein of SARS-CoV disrupts karyopherin transport (

 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007</xref>) and consequently inhibits the import in the nucleus of transcriptional factors such as STAT1, resulting in the interferon response. Similarly, the Orf3b protein of SARS-CoV inhibits the phosphorylation of IRF3 (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007</xref>), a protein involved in the activation of IFN expression. However, the Orf6 and Orf3b proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are truncated (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> a substantial sensitivity to IFNα (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Lokugamage et al., 2020</xref>): although SARS-CoV-2 replication is not entirely suppressed by interferons, viral titers are decreased by several orders of magnitude. SARS-CoV2 is substantially more sensitive to IFN-I than SARS-CoV, which suggests that IFN-I treatment should be at least as effective for the former than for the latter. Supporting this hypothesis, it was shown that IFNα2b sprays can reduce the infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 (

 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Lokugamage et al., 2020</xref>), while the replication of MERS-CoV (

 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Menachery et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Thiel and Weber, 2008</xref>), was reported to be indifferent to IFN-I prophylaxis.
