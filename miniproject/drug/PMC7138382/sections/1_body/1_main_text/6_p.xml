<p id="p0060">From the data presented above, IFN-I might be a safe and efficient treatment against SARS-CoV-2. Knowledge acquired during studies on MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV would be critical assets in that perspective: for example, they indicate that IFNÎ² should be the most relevant interferon subtype, and that IFN-I should be administered as early as possible to optimize antiviral therapy and avoid adverse events (

Furthermore, COVID-19 pathology, mainly consisting in pulmonary lesions, presents similar characteristics with interferonopathies: it may suggest that SARS-CoV-2 induces an excessive IFN-I mediated antiviral response, leading to tissue damage. IFN-I treatment should be limited to the early phases of the infection if this hypothesis is confirmed, as suggested in (
