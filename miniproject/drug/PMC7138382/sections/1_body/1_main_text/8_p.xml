<p id="p0070">In conclusion, IFNÎ²1 may account for a safe and easy to upscale treatment against COVID-19 in the early stages of infection. Similar treatments had a mixed efficiency against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV viruses, but 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could be substantially more sensitive to IFN-I than other coronaviruses. The current lack of animal model for COVID-19 should not prevent the clinical evaluation of IFN-I treatment, since its safety has already been assessed in numerous independent clinical trials. Publications of data about IFN-based COVID-19 treatment performed in China in early 2020, expected in a near future, should give more accurate information on the relevance of this therapy.
