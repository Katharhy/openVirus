<p>The media has also reported on the possible return of the virus after suffering from the infection in some cases [
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For now, it is hard to know how common these cases are, and how many exceptions there are. It is often wise to rest well after many viral respiratory infections to allow the body to recover after the infection has ended. It is unknown whether this infection can return if the immune system has not completely removed the virus from the body. But with all new and unknown viruses such surprises are possible, so one should be careful until the pandemic is over.
