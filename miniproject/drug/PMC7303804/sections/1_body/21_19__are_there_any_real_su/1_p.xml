<p>We all hope at this point (March 7, 2020) that there would be very few. I explained why it is no surprise that after the previous six coronaviruses, the seventh has now also managed to infect humans. Nor is its spread rate a surprise, as there are both more and less infectious respiratory viruses [
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It would be somewhat surprising for epidemiologists if the total number of infected people in the population was not significantly higher than the number of registered infected people. In such occurrence, case-fatality rate would indeed become significantly higher than that of the flu. We should continue to await the information of well-conducted studies on this key question.
