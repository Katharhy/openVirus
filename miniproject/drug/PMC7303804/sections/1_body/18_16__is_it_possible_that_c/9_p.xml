<p>In the event of any of these unfavourable developments, all of which are unfortunately possible though not likely, an entirely new protection strategy would be required. Each country will have its own approach. When the death toll in each of the affected countries begins to rise so much as to cause fear among the population, people will become increasingly willing to undertake much stricter epidemiological measures. In such a case, an increasing number of countries will resort to a solution that has proven effective in Wuhan â€“ ie, declaring large, very strict quarantines. It is essential to buy time in such quarantines so that health systems do not become overburdened. We should then anticipate the end of winter and hope that there would be evidence of possible seasonality of this virus. It may then begin to spread in a weakened manner or disappear altogether, at least until next winter.</p>
