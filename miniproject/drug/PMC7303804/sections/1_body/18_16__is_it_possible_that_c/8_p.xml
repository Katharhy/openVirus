<p>The worst-case scenario imaginable right now is the entry of some more dangerous, mutated version of coronavirus into one of the very poor countries in the world with a dysfunctional health system. Such countries cannot implement satisfactory quality epidemiological surveillance measures. Then, a more dangerous version of the virus would likely infect a larger percentage of the countryâ€™s population relatively quickly. Panic would ensue, probably also a black market for the transport of migrants to other countries. Then, a more severe variant of COVID-19 would start to expand uncontrollably and in a whole new way.</p>
