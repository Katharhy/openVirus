<p>This allows epidemiologists to follow the entire chain of movement of the virus from person to person. Due to this favourable circumstance, intensive isolation measures of all those who were in contact with those already infected can significantly slow down the spread of the virus. This was done in Wuhan. That is why “test-trace-isolate”, as the first line of defence, and quarantines as the ultimate response, both represent a justified containment strategy when people are infectious for others during incubation period. Both approaches will slow down and contain the epidemic if applied properly.</p>
