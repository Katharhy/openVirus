<p>Therefore, the number of deaths from influenza is reduced by preventive health intervention, ie, vaccination. This cannot be done with the spread of COVID-19. This is the first reason why the flu seems less dangerous than COVID-19. However, it may not be much less dangerous inherently, especially during seasons when flu is more severe. It is just that we protect the most vulnerable. In addition, flu vaccinations make it more difficult for it to spread among the population because there are fewer options for it to transfer to the uninfected. Due to the slower spread, new cases emerge more slowly and the health care system has time to deal with them properly, especially if they require intensive care.</p>
