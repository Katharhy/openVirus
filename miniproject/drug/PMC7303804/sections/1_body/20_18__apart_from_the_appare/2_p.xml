<p>In China, which is one-sixth of the world’s population, the death toll from COVID-19 could be stopped below 5000 by the Wuhan quarantine. If all other countries could implement anti-epidemic measures like China, then the death toll from COVID -19 could be at most six times higher, ie, up to 30 000. That would be ten times fewer deaths than the total number of deaths caused annually by seasonal influenza. Unfortunately, many countries will not be able to follow China’s example closely and will have uncontrolled outbreaks if the warmer season does not stop the spread of the virus.</p>
