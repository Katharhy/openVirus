<p>If all the reported deaths are divided by the total number of people with confirmed infection, then both the numerator and the denominator are wrong when it comes to calculating the actual case-fatality rate. Even deaths in the numerator would be wrong. This is because we monitor the confirmed infected and those who have died in real time. A great many infected people have not even had a chance to either recover or die, so the number of deaths in the numerator is an underestimate.</p>
