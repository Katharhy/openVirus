In the absence of these measures, there would be an exponential increase in the number of infected people. This number would soon outgrow the capacity of the health system. Many people within countries are also protected by their geographical dispersion, ie, many people live in smaller towns and settlements. A large number of them will probably never be exposed to an infected person.</p>
