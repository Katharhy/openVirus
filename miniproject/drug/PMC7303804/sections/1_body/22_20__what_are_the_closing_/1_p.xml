<p>In all the answers provided in this editorial I endeavoured to convey the most likely scientific explanations for the abundant information that is published about COVID-19 in the domestic and international media. Over time, some of the likely scientific explanations may need to be modified in the light of new information. One should not forget that this is a new and unknown virus. Therefore, surprises and deviations from the expected scenarios are in principle possible. That is why I emphasise that caution is needed, but not panic. The community of scientists and health experts will continue to closely monitor the further development of the pandemic.</p>
