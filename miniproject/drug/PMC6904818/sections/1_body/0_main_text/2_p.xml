<p id="p0015">Although emerging infectious diseases have been recognized for many decades, the last 20 years have been marked by the unprecedented emergence of several devastating epidemics of zoonotic RNA viral diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola, Nipah, chikungunya, West Nile, yellow fever, and ZIKV. Given the unpredictable nature of emerging pathogens, approaches for rapid development of countermeasures are actively pursued by both academia and industry. Besides vaccine and transmission control (e.g., vector control for mosquito-borne pathogens), antiviral therapy is an important countermeasure to prevent, treat, and block viral transmission.

 </xref> Because new drugs usually take more than 10 years to develop, drug repurposing has been actively pursued as a rapid approach for emerging and reemerging pathogens. Compared with conventional screening of compound libraries for inhibitors, drug repurposing has the advantages of speed and low cost. In response to the recent emergence of ZIKV, several groups have performed drug-repurposing screening.
