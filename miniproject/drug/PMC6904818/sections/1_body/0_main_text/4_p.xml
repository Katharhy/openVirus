 </xref> provided five lines of evidence to support that rilpivirine targets ZIKV RdRp (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). (1) Computational docking suggests that rilpivirine may bind to the palm site of RdRp protein. (2) Differential scanning fluorimetry showed that rilpivirine binds to recombinant RdRp with a K
 <sub>D</sub> of 100 nM. (3) The compound inhibited RdRp activity in a biochemical polymerase assay with a single digit micromolar half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>), which agrees with the antiviral potency in cell cultures. (4) A mutant RdRp protein containing 14 amino acid substitutions at the compound-binding site (suggested by computational modeling) was not inhibited or bound by rilpivirine. (5) Overexpression of wild-type RdRp protein in ZIKV-infected cells, but not the 14-amino acid mutant protein, competed for rilpivirine binding and thus alleviated compound-mediated antiviral activity. Although these results have established the mode-of-action of rilpivirine, two future directions may be pursued to further strengthen the antiviral mechanism. (1) Solving the crystal structure of rilpivirine-RdRp complex (through compound soaking or co-crystallization) will uncover the exact compound binding pocket and enable the rational design of analogs with improved potency. (2) The selection of ZIKV variants resistant to rilpivirine will identify mutations that are likely mapped to the viral NS5 RdRp gene.
