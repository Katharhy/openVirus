 <sup>−/−</sup> mouse (type I interferon receptor knockout) model (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). Treatment of ZIKV-infected IFNAR
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice with rilpivirine reduced organ viral burden and weight loss, improved clinical score, and prevented death. In the un-treated mouse brain, viral RNA was detected in astrocytes, microglia/macrophage, T cells, and neurons, but not neural progenitor cells. In addition, ZIKV infection caused significant inflammation and abundant apoptotic/necrotic cell damage. Treatment with rilpivirine reduced the levels of viral RNA in the brain hippocampus and frontal cortex and prevented apoptotic/necrotic cell damage, but it did not eliminate inflammation. These results indicate that rilpivirine suppressed viral replication and disease development. However, it was notable that compound treatment did not completely prevent weight loss or brain inflammation, suggesting that further improvement of potency may be required for better 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy. Nevertheless, the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> potency of rilpivirine seems better than sofosbuvir, a hepatitis C virus (HCV) nucleoside drug that was reported with anti-ZIKV activity.
