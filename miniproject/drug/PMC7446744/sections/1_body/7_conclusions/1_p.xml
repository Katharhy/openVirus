<p id="Par19">It has been a steep learning curve for the medical fraternity in learning how to manage critically ill patients with COVID-19. The existing knowledge of abnormalities in inflammatory and coagulation pathways offers opportunities for identifying biomarkers for severe disease, which combined with clinical risk factors will help in prompt identification of patients at risk of severe disease who require early and targeted intervention. Better understanding of the pathophysiology suggests suppression of the adaptive immune system on one hand and a hyperactive innate immune system on the other as the two principle severity-driving mechanisms in COVID-19 infection. This leads to a MAS-like picture associated with a hypercoagulable state that causes both micro and macrovascular thrombosis in the pulmonary as well the systemic circulation. This understanding will help us develop treatment protocols targeting various inflammatory pathways as well as to optimize anticoagulation therapies. Current anticoagulation practice suggests that all hospitalized patients should receive prophylactic anticoagulation, those with severe disease needing intensive care with respiratory compromise should have intermediate dose prophylaxis and therapeutic anticoagulation reserved for those with proven or suspected thrombosis. Results of prospective trials will only answer if this strategy is optimum in preventing thrombotic complications and improving pulmonary and overall outcome. A multi-pronged approach combining anti-inflammatory drugs and anticoagulation with specific antiviral medications is likely the approach that will work in critically ill patients (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Many trials are currently trying to address efficacy of different antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anticoagulation agents in isolation. Unfortunately, these trials may take a significant amount of time for completion and analysis before the evidence-based recommendations can be produced. Because of the enormous number of new patients over a short period, we have a unique opportunity to develop an international collaborative network and conduct large trials with many combination arms to answer the all-important question of which combination of antiviral, anti-inflammatory drugs with anticoagulation therapies are going to be the most effective in treating patients with severe disease. Early intervention strategy is likely to be helpful in preventing disease progression and thereby reducing the morbidity and mortality from this pandemic.
