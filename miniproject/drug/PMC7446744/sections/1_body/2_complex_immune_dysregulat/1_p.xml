<p id="Par8">Initial response to the viral infection is by the activation of the innate immune system with neutrophils, macrophages, and cytokines. This results in elevation of acute-phase reactants like C reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and ferritin [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This can be considered as the first cytokine wave or hypercytokinemia, which is essential in controlling viral infection. Dysregulated type 1 interferon response has been demonstrated in mice models of SARS-CoV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It is postulated that similar suppressed type 1 interferon response is present in COVID-19 infection, which when combined with suppression of the adaptive immune system [T,B and natural killer (NK) lymphocytes] creates an immunodeficient state that results in poor and delayed viral clearance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Initial hypercytokinemia, suppressed type 1 interferon response, and the inability of the adaptive immune system to clear the virus sets the stage for hyper activation of the innate immune system and cytokine storm in some patients. Cytokine dysregulation is a recognized feature of this infection. Studies in hospitalized patients have shown that plasma interleukin1 beta(IL1β), IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RA), IL7, IL8, IL9, IL10, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), granulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), interferon gamma (IFNγ), interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP1A), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta (MIP1B), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentrations on admission were higher in patients with COVID-19 infection compared to healthy adults [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In the same study, plasma concentrations of IL2, IL7, IL10, GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα were found to be higher in patients needing ICU admission compared to those who did not. Disease severity has been found to positively correlate with serum levels of TNFα, IL6, and IL10, and there was also a strong negative correlation of levels of TNFα and IL6 with the number of CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In a study by Diao et al., higher levels of the exhausted marker PD-1 were seen in COVID-19 patients, suggesting not only that lymphocyte numbers are lower, but existing T cells are functionally exhausted
 <bold>.</bold> In a larger study of 452 patients, of whom 286 were classified as having severe disease, dysregulation of the immune system was seen with a high leucocyte count and high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]
 <bold>.</bold> Regulatory T cells that help control inflammation were also found to be low in this study, especially in patients with severe disease. These mechanisms partly explain the unabated progression of the inflammatory process, the ongoing cytokine storm, and the progressive tissue damage. The similarity of severe COVID-19 disease to thrombotic microangiopathic anemia with elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer and bilirubin, decreased platelets, anemia, and renal and cardiac injury is suggestive of excessive complement activation. Hence, complement inhibition as a therapeutic option has also been suggested [
