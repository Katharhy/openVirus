<p id="Par9">Another multi-center study conducted in Europe investigated immune dysregulation in 54 patients (28 with severe respiratory failure). Clinical features suggestive of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) associated with low CD4+ T-cells, CD19+ B-cells, and NK cells were found in all the patients. Sustained elevation of TNFα and IL-6 was also found, representing a hyperactive monocyte macrophage system [
