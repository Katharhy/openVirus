<p id="Par10">These studies suggest that in this disease, a suppression of the adaptive immune system along with hyper activation of the innate immune system causes a disease phenomenon that is similar to MAS/hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Comparing the laboratory features, hyperferritinemia and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are common in both COVID-19 patients and patients with primary HLH. On the other hand, low fibrinogen and cytopenias due to bone marrow hemophagocytosis is not commonly found in COVID-19 patients [
