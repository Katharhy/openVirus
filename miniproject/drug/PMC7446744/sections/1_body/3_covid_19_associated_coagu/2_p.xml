<p id="Par12">A high rate of venous thrombosis has been observed even in anti-coagulated patients with this disease. In a French study of 26 patients on mechanical ventilation, prophylactic anticoagulation was used in eight (31%) cases while therapeutic dose anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was started on admission in 18 (69%) patients [

Despite anticoagulation, high rates of deep vein thrombosis were noted in all patients in the prophylactic dose group and 56% in the therapeutic dose group that was associated with high rates of pulmonary embolism [eight (23%) in the whole cohort]. A larger study involving 184 patients admitted in three hospitals in the Netherlands and treated with prophylactic enoxaparin reported an incidence of 31% and 25% of deep vein or arterial thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, respectively [

A follow-up of the same cohort of patients was published, which confirmed the high incidence of pulmonary embolism (65/75, 87%) in those patients diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis; and pulmonary embolism was associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality [
