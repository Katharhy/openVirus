<p id="Par11">The acronym COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) is being used to describe the coagulation changes in infected patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Abnormal coagulation parameters including increased D-dimer, fibrin degradation products, and prolonged pro-thrombin time have been found to be associated with poor prognosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In a study of 183 patients with COVID-19 disease, 15 out of 21 (71.4%) non-survivors had disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) as per the criteria set by the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH). This was in contrast to only one (0.6%) survivor fulfilling the criteria for DIC during the period of hospitalization, indicating that non-survivors have a higher incidence of DIC. Described incidence of thrombocytopenia has been variable, reported as 12% in an initial case series of 99 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and 36.2% in another series of 1099 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A meta-analysis analyzing pooled data from nine studies of 1779 patients including 399 with severe disease has demonstrated that thrombocytopenia is prognostic of the severity of the disease. Although there was notable heterogeneity between studies, severe thrombocytopenia was common in non-survivors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and increased mortality has been associated with lower platelet counts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based clot waveform analysis (CWA) is an easily available form of global hemostatic assay and remarkably high CWA were noted despite prophylactic anticoagulation in patients admitted to the ICU although there was no thrombosis or death in a study from Singapore [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A study on 24 critically ill patients analyzed whole-blood thromboelastography (TEG) which showed decreased R (reaction time) and K (kinetics time) values but increased K angle and MA (maximum amplitude) values, which is consistent with hypercoagulability
 <italic>.</italic> Factor VIII, Von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, D-dimer, platelets, and protein C were increased in most patients, and antithrombin marginally decreased, while prothrombin time (PT) and APTT were mostly normal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The authors concluded that the above findings do not support features of acute DIC but are consistent with severe hypercoagulability secondary to inflammation. Another similar study in 44 patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 showed fibrinolysis shutdown as evidenced by markedly raised D-dimer and complete absence of clot lysis in TEG at 30Â min; this was predictive of high rate of venous thrombosis) and need for hemodialysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This may suggest that functional coagulation assessment like TEG may be more useful in assessing hypercoagulability rather than conventional coagulation tests in patients with COVID-19.
