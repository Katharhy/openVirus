<p id="Par17">Similar to patients with SARS and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the cytokine responses seen in patients with COVID-19 have features of a cytokine storm. One study involving 43 adult patients found significant correlation of increased baseline IL6 levels with disease severity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and this is supported by similar findings in another study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Hence, some investigators have proposed using IL6 as a biomarker for assessing disease severity and blocking IL6 as a therapeutic strategy has been suggested [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the IL6 receptor, has been used safely and effectively in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. A pilot trial of adding tocilizumab therapy in patients with severe COVID-19 disease in combination with standard therapy of lopinavir, methylprednisolone, and oxygen therapy showed remarkable short-term clinical responses in 20 out of 21 patients within 2 weeks of tocilizumab therapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. No adverse drug reactions attributable to tocilizumab were noted. Following the success of this preliminary trial, a larger multicenter clinical trial is currently being undertaken (ChiCTR2000029765). Another trial in Belgium has been designed to observe the efficacy of the IL6 blockers tocilizumab and siltuximab individually and in combination with the IL1 blocker anakinra (NCT04330638). Indeed, IL1, IL18 blockade, IFN-γ inhibition, and TNFα inhibition are also amongst consideration for randomized control trials in patients with severe disease. High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been used as an immunomodulator in patients with severe disease with good outcomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. There are several trials currently exploring the utility of IVIG (NCT04411667, NCT04400058, NCT04261426, NCT04403269, and NCT04350580). The role of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) as therapy is extremely controversial. Ibuprofen is a commonly used NSAID, which is used for fever control, usually with acetaminophen. However, ibuprofen increases the synthesis of ACE2 enzyme and may potentially increase the risk of severity and fatality of COVID 19 infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. However, currently there is no definite evidence for or against the use of ibuprofen. The European Medicine Agency (EMA) guidelines published on March 31, 2020 suggest using acetaminophen for fever but also had advised not to stop ibuprofen if the patient is on it for other reasons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Currently, there are ongoing trials to assess the efficacy of inhaled ibuprofen (NCT04382768) and also oral lipid formulation of ibuprofen (LIBERATE trial, Lipid ibuprofen versus standard of care for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID19, NCT04334629). The efficacy and safety of other NSAIDS are currently being evaluated, the details of which are beyond the scope of this article.
