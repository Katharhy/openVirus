<p id="Par4">This narrative review aims to summarize the current available evidence on the interplay between hypercoagulability, thrombo-inflammation, and pulmonary microvascular thrombosis in COVID-19 infection resulting in respiratory failure and how this information can be used to design clinical trials to optimize patient outcomes. We begin with a concise review of the unique properties of SARS-CoV-2 that impacts the coagulation and inflammation pathways before proceeding with an in-depth discussion on the current available medical literature. We will also discuss anticoagulation and other pharmacological strategies described for these patients that pertain to the role of the coagulation pathway in the prevention and management of COVID-19-induced respiratory failure. For the purpose of this review, we performed a literature search on PubMed using the following keywords: COVID-19, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, thrombosis, and respiratory failure. This review is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.</p>
