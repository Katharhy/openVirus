<p id="Par5">SARS-CoV-2 is a novel betacoronavirus [large ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus] that is similar to the earlier SARS-CoV virus that caused the severe acute respiratory distress (SARS) outbreak in 2003 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Multiple spike glycoproteins (S) protrude from the viral surface and give it a halo-like appearance (hence corona). The spike S protein enables the virus to engage with its target cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The host’s transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) primes the spike S protein of the virus to facilitate its internalization into the cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). After binding to the ACE2 receptor, the virus enters the cell through endocytosis, releases ribonucleic acid (RNA) into the cytosol, replicates by using the cell machinery, and finally, by the process of exocytosis, is excreted from the cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. ACE2 is mostly expressed in the airway and type II pneumocytes explaining the tropism of the virus to the respiratory system. Not surprisingly, one of the major features of COVID-19 infection is involvement of the respiratory system. Importantly, ACE2 receptors are also expressed by vascular endothelial cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. While most patients will have symptoms of respiratory tract infection and start to improve within a week, sudden clinical deterioration 7–8 days after initial symptom onset and development of severe respiratory failure often combined with multi-organ failure is commonly recognized [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The group at highest risk of deterioration includes the elderly population, people with pre-existing chronic health conditions (e.g., cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, immunocompromised state, obesity, cardiovascular comorbidities, sickle cell disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In addition, patients from certain ethnicity groups (e.g., Afro-Americans, South Asians, and minority ethnic groups) and blood groups (e.g., blood group A with 3p21.31 gene cluster) have been shown to be at higher risk of worse outcomes [
