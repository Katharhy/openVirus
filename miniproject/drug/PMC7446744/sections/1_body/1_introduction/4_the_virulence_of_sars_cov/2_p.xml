<p id="Par6">Current literature suggests that a unique pattern of immune dysfunction is responsible for this disease progression in high-risk patients. Suppression of lymphocytes by the virus leads to a complicated immune mechanism with activated macrophages which releases cytokines (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This creates a cytokine storm [mostly interleukin IL-1β and IL-6], promoting expression of adhesion molecules for endothelial activation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and vascular inflammation. Endothelial cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines that contribute to propagation of microcirculatory lesions. The dysfunctional endothelium then becomes pro-adhesive and pro-coagulant [

Presence of viral elements within endothelial cells causes endotheliitis and accumulation of inflammatory cells with increasing cell death, leading to impairment of microcirculatory function in different vascular beds and their consequent clinical effects [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. NETs are microbicidal proteins, extracellular webs of chromatin, and oxidant enzymes that are released by neutrophils to contain infections. NETs have potential to cause inflammation and microvascular thrombosis in the lungs, causing respiratory failure. Highly specific markers of NETs such as myeloperoxidase (MPO)-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and citrullinated histone H3 (Cit-H3) were found to be elevated in this study. These collective findings suggest a unique ability of the virus to cause intense inflammatory reaction that makes the virus lethal.
