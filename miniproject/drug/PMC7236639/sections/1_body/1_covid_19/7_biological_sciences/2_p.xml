<p id="Par23">The control of COVID-19 largely depends on two factors. The first is to design early diagnostic tools to estimate more accurately the extent of the pandemic and provide effective vaccines. Testing kits are an amalgamation of research based on engineering and biomedical sciences. They are designed to exhibit high accuracy and rapid analysis to minimize the community spread of the disease [
