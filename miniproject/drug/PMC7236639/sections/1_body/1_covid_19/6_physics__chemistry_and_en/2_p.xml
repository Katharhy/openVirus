They help in implementing the manufacturing, production pipelines, logistics, and commercialization of PPE, along with disposable gloves, sanitizing gels, and respirators. In such an emergency context, the contribution of Universities in Engineering and Material Sciences can engage in synergy with companies that produce textiles, anti-wet coatings, ventilators and respirators, and can attempt to reconvert their materials and pipelines to products useful for combatting the pandemic. For example, material science and mechanical engineering can help to perform validation tests of newly produced PPE, and assist in the preparation of documents for approval [

Furthermore, constructive interaction between certification and regulatory entities as well as local, regional, and national governments can minimize the time to regulatory approval and delivery to the market of newly produced PPE. For example, the standard catalog UNI decided to give free access to their publications related to medical device and face mask regulations in a move to support interventions against COVID-19. The national governments allocate funds to companies to help them recover or convert their production to medical devices. Moreover, private and non-profit organizations finance small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and universities to promote the transfer of research results to markets for improving the safety of community health workers (CHWs) and, more in general, for tackling the immediate social, health and education emergencies.
