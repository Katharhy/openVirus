  <p>HIF-1α knockdown downregulates glycolysis and activates the AMPKα-ULK1 signaling pathway during IAV infection. (A) Effect of HIF-1α knockdown on the expression of glycolysis genes (
   <italic>LDHA</italic>, 
   <italic>HK2</italic>, 
   <italic>GLUT-1</italic>, 
   <italic>PKM2</italic>) during IAV infection in A549 cells mock-infected or infected with PR8 at 24 hpi by RT-qPCR. (B) A549 cells were pretreated with 2-DOG or vehicle for 30 min and then were mock-infected or infected with the PR8 virus for 24 h. Cells were harvested and analysed by Western blotting. (C) Intensity analysis of proteins, p-AMPKα
   <sup>Thr172</sup> and p-ULK1
   <sup>Ser555</sup>, in (B) was performed. The data were analysed by Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test (two-tailed) and is presented as mean ± SD (*
