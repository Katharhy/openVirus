  <p>The AMPKα signalling pathway is essential autophagic control of IAV replication. (A) A549 cells were mock-infected or infected with PR8 at MOIs of 5. At 1, 3, and 6 hpi, cells were collected, and cell lysates subjected to Western blot analysis. (B) A549 cells were infected with PR8 at MOIs of 0, 1, and 10, respectively. The cells were collected, and cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis at 24 hpi. (C-D) Effect of AMPKα and ULK1 knockdown on IAV replication in A549 cells. A549 cells were infected with pLKO.1 scrambled or shRNA-AMPKα or shRNA-ULK1 lentiviruses, mock-infected or infected with PR8 and then harvested at 24 hpi for Western blot analysis. Results are representative of three independent experiments.</p>
