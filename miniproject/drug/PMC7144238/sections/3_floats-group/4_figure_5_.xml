  <p>HIF-1α knockdown enhances IAV replication through autophagy. (A) Effect of HIF-1α knockdown on IAV replication in A549 cells. A549 were infected with pLKO.1 scrambled or shRNA-
   <italic>HIF1A</italic> lentivirus, infected with PR8 at MOI of 2 and harvested at 24 hpi to analyse M gene and 
   <italic>HIF1A</italic> expression by RT-qPCR. (B) Western blot analysis of samples treated and harvested as in (A). (C) Intensity analysis of proteins, p-AMPKα
   <sup>Thr172</sup> and p-ULK1
   <sup>Ser555</sup>, in (B) was performed. (D) A549 cells were infected with GFP-LC3B reporter lentivirus and then transfected with pLKO.1 scrambled or shRNA-HIF1A lentivirus and treated with rapamycin. Representative puncta images of A549-GFP-LC3B cells mock-infected or infected with PR8 at MOI of 2 at 24 hpi. (E) Quantification of GFP-LC3B puncta in (D). (F) Effect of HIF-1α knockdown on transcription of inflammatory cytokines genes (
   <italic>IFNB</italic>, 
   <italic>MCP1</italic>, 
   <italic>IL6</italic>, 
   <italic>CCL20</italic>) of A549 cells mock-infected or infected with 2 MOI PR8 at 24 hpi. The data was analysed by Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test (two-tailed) and is presented as mean ± SD (*
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, **
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, ***
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).
