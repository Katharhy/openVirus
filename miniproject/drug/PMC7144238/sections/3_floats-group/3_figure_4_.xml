  <p>The mRNA and protein levels of HIF-1α are upregulated after IAV infection in 
   <italic>vitro.</italic> (A) Heatmap of the innate immune response related-genes in A549 cells mock-infected or infected with 2 MOI PR8 virus by FPKM value of RNAseq at 24 h post infection (hpi). (B) FPKM value analysis of 
   <italic>HIF1A</italic> gene expression in A549 cells mock-infected or infected with 2 MOI PR8 virus at 24 hpi. (C) A549 cells were mock-infected or infected with the PR8 virus at MOI of 2. Cells were collected at 24 hpi and were subjected to flow cytometry analysis. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of HIF-1α expression analysis showed. (D) A549 cells were infected with the PR8 virus at MOI of 2. Cell lysates were collected at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hpi and subjected to Western blot analysis. The data was analysed by Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test (two-tailed) and is presented as mean ± SD (*
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
