<p>In this study, we provide molecular insights into how HIF-1α regulates the replication of IAV by interfering with AMPKα signalling-mediated autophagy in AEC2. We first demonstrated that epithelial cell-specific 
 <italic>Hif1α</italic> knockout mice infected with IAV had more IAV replication in the lung and developed severe lung inflammation. Knockdown of HIF-1α in A549 promoted IAV replication 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> by reducing glycolysis and augmenting AMPKα-ULK1-mediated autophagy. The findings have provided us novel therapeutic targets for dealing with IAV infection.
