<p>Host factors are involved in every step of the life cycle of IAV, including cellular proteins and RNAs, which can be simply divided into those that support viral replication and those that play an antiviral role [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a major transcription factor that allows mammalian cells to adapt to low oxygen tension (hypoxia). HIF-1 is a heterodimeric protein that consists of two proteins, HIF-1α and HIF-1β. HIF-1β is the constitutively expressed subunit, but the expression of HIF-1α is upregulated rapidly in response to hypoxia [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α is hydroxylated at conserved proline residues by the prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), which are oxygen dependent. Hydroxylated HIF-1α undergoes rapid proteasomal degradation by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase-mediated ubiquitination. This process results in low basal HIF-1α levels. Hypoxic conditions result in PHD inhibition and lower HIF-1α degradation, which results in HIF-1α accumulation and transcription of HRE (hypoxia response elements)-containing genes [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It has been reported that HIF-1 activates the transcription of many genes that are involved in glucose metabolism [

 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], angiogenesis [
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], cell proliferation/survival and invasion/metastasis [
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the role of HIF-1α in IAV infection of alveolar type II epithelial cells (AEC2) is still elusive and deserves further investigation.
