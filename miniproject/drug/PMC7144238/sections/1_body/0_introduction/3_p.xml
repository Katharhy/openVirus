<p>Autophagy is a complicated and strictly regulated process, involving degradation and turnover of aged proteins and damaged organelles [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Many studies have shown that autophagy functions as an adaptive cellular mechanism to deal with stressful stimuli such as starvation, oxidative stress, and pathogen invasion [

During autophagy, microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3-I) is lipidated to form LC3-II, which serve as an indicator of autophagic activity and flux. LC3-II directly binds the selective autophagy cargo receptor p62/SQSTM1 (sequestosome-1) and interacts with M2 and NP of IAV to increase viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) export and infectious viral particle formation [

 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Besides the AKT-mTOR signalling pathway, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPKα) signalling also initiates autophagy under cellular energy stress. Reduction in cellular ATP levels initiates autophagy through AMPKα, which phosphorylates and activates Unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1 kinase) to generate energy by increasing glucose uptake and glycolysis [

 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the function of AMPKα-ULK1 signalling in IAV infection and replication remains largely unknown.
