<p>For the detection of autophagosomes, cells were infected with lentiviruses expressing GFP-LC3B. After 48â€…h of lentiviral infection, these cells were used for next experiments. Following corresponding experimental treatment, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X 100. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI dye and slides were imaged on a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Olympus FV-1200). Images were quantified by Image J Pro.</p>
