<p>The chest cavity of the mice was opened and lung vascular beds flushed by injecting 5 ml of chilled (4°C) PBS into the right ventricle. Lungs were excised, minced and digested in DMEM/ F-12 K (Gibco) collagenase (Sigma) solution at 37°C for 1 h. Dissociated cells were transferred to a 15 ml conical tube and centrifuged for 10 min (335 × g, 4°C). The red blood cells were lysed by the addition of 3 ml ACK lysing buffer for 5 min at RT. The cells were washed with 12 ml cold PBS/0.5% BSA for 10 min (335 × g, 4°C). The cell pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of cold PBS/0.5% BSA and filtered through a 70 μm nylon mesh.</p>
