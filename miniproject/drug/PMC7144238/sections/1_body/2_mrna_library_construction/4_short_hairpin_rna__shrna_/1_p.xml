<p>Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences, synthesized by Nanjing Genewis Biotechnology, were inserted into pLKO.1 plasmid between the EcoRI and NheI restriction sites. The shRNA PLKO.1 construct was introduced into target cells via lentiviral transduction. The knockdown assay primer sequences were, Scramble CAACAAGATGAAGAGCACCAA; HIF-1α CCGCTGGAGACACAATCATAT; BECN1 CTCAGGAGAGGAGCCATTTAT; p62 GAGGATCCGAGTGTGAATTTC; AMPKα GAAGGTTGTAAACCCATATTA; ULK1 GCCCTTTGCGTTATATTGTAT.</p>
