<p>To further explore the role of HIF-1α on IAV replication, we silenced HIF-1α expression in A549 cells by lentivirus-mediated specific shRNA gene silencing. We found that knockdown of HIF-1α in A549 cells increased IAV replication markedly at the gene expression and protein level compared to the scrambled group (
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(A,B)). It is speculated that HIF-1α may regulate autophagy to facilitate IAV replication. Consistent with the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> data, we found that LC3-II was increased and p62 was decreased in HIF-1α knockdown cells during IAV infection (
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(B)). We also found that AMPKα-ULK1 signalling was increased in HIF-1α knockdown cells during IAV infection compared to the scrambled group (
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(C)). These results suggested that autophagy in A549 cells was significantly enhanced in the HIF-1α silenced cells. To determine whether the autophagic response is also regulated by HIF-1α during IAV infection in A549 cells, a GFP-LC3B reporter lentivirus was constructed. This tag reporter lentivirus enables the detection of autophagic flux by counting GFP-LC3B puncta. Compared to uninfected cells, the number of fluorescent LC3 puncta noticeably increased in IAV-infected cells. Consistent with the Western blot results shown in 
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(B), loss of HIF-1α also markedly increased GFP-LC3B puncta formation (
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(D,E)). Taken together, these results indicate that HIF-1α plays an important role in triggering autophagy during IAV infection
