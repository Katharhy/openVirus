<p>We next investigated the signalling response caused by HIF-1α deletion in AEC2 during IAV infection. We found that AMPKα-ULK1 signalling was more active in Spc-Cre

 <sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (

 <sup>fl/fl</sup> mice after IAV infection. These findings hint us that AMPKα-ULK1 signalling-mediated autophagy may play an important role in IAV replication. Thus, we next explored the signalling mechanism underlying this phenotype wherein a deficiency of HIF-1α enhanced IAV replication in AEC2.
