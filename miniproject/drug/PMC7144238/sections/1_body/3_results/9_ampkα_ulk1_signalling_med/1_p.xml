<p>To determine the role of the AMPKα-ULK1 axis in IAV infection and replication, we first tested whether IAV infection activates the AMPKα signalling pathway. Our results showed that IAV infection activated AMPKα-ULK signalling pathway in several hours post-infection but not 24 h post-infection. We found that autophagy is induced during IAV infection (

To figure out the role of AMPKα in autophagy during IAV infection, we knocked down AMPKα expression in A549 cells by lentivirus-mediated specific shRNA gene silencing. Our results showed that knockdown of AMPKα in A549 cells blocked AMPKα-ULK signalling pathway and decreased autophagy and IAV replication (

 <xref rid="F0008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>(D)). Taken together, these results suggest that AMPKα-ULK1 signalling-mediated autophagy is essential for IAV replication.
