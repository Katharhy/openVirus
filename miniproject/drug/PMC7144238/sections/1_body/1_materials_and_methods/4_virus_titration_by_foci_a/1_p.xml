<p>MDCK (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>/well) cells were seeded in 96-well culture plates and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 24 h. For foci assay, cell culture supernatant or lung homogenates were harvested. Serial 10-fold dilutions of lung samples in DMEM containing 0.1% BSA were prepared and added to MDCK cells. The plates were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 1 h. The media was then aspirated and replaced with 100 µl of 1% Avicell overlay and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Subsequently, the plates were fixed with 4% formalin in PBS for 10 min at room temperature (RT). Then the cells were washed and incubated for 10 min with 100 µl/well of Quencher (0.5% Triton × 100, 20 mM glycine in PBS). After 10 min the cells were washed with Wash Buffer (0.5% Tween 20 in PBS) and blocked with 50 µl Blocking Buffer (0.5% Tween 20, 1% BSA in PBS) at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 30 min. The primary antibody (anti-influenza Nucleocapsid NP polyclonal goat antibody from Virostat, Portland, USA) and the secondary antibody (anti-goat-HRP from KPL, Gaithersburg MD, USA) were diluted 1∶1000 in Blocking Buffer. 50 µl of the primary antibody was added to each well and incubated at RT for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with 50 µl of the secondary antibody for 45 min and then incubated with 50 µl of the substrate (True Blue from KPL) until blue spots from infected cell foci appeared. Foci were counted and viral titres calculated as focus forming units (FFU/lung).
