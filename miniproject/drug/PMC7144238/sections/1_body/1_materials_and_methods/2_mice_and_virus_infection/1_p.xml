 </disp-quote>These mice were bred and maintained in an SPF animal facility at Institut Pasteur of Shanghai. All the protocols and procedures were conducted in compliance with a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Institut Pasteur of Shanghai. Mice were anesthetized with 80 mg/Kg pentobarbital sodium dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by intraperitoneal injection. Anesthetized mice were infected intranasally with 20 μl influenza A/PR/8 virus diluted in PBS. Mice in the control group were anaesthetized and inoculated with PBS.
