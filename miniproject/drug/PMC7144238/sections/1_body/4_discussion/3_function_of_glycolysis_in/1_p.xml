<p>HIF-1α is one of the most important regulators of glycolysis. Glycolysis is the main source of energy as cells use this metabolic pathway for ATP generation. Viral infection induces metabolic reprogramming in host cells. Viruses totally rely on host cell machinery to propagate and trigger metabolic reprogramming in host cells to facilitate optimal virus production [

One study in pediatric patients with respiratory infections also showed there was higher glucose metabolism in the lungs compared to control; oral treatment with BEZ235 (a putative PI3 K/mTOR inhibitor) decreased glycolysis and reduced virus replication which resulted in decreased mortality in the mouse model of influenza infection [
