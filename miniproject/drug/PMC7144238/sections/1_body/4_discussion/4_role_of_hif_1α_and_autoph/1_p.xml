<p>The adult lung is a quiescent organ but responds rapidly to injury by activating survival signalling. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) plays a key role in the regulation of oxygen homeostasis. In the alveolar regeneration stage after IAV infection, HIF-1α plays a key role in AEC2 differentiation and alveolar repair by driving Notch signaling [
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. An aberrant oxygen environment at birth depletes half of AEC2s in adult mice, which increases the severity of respiratory viral infections later in life [
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. AEC2s function as adult stem cells capable of both self-renewal and differentiation into AEC1s [
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. AEC1s and AEC2s are targets of IAV, and may die during infection. This raises the question of how HIF-1α functions in IAV replication in AEC2.
