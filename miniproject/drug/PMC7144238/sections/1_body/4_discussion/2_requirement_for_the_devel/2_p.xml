<p>HIF1 is the major transcriptional regulator that responds to low oxygen tension. As the regulatory subunit of HIF1, HIF-1α is the master regulator of oxygen homeostasis. Besides its role in hypoxia, HIF-1α is involved in many cellular processes. As known, IAV infection-induced ALI led to hypoxia, which further increased the level of HIF-1α in lung tissue. What is the role of the high HIF-1α in the lung during IAV infection, especially in the AEC2? For the influenza virus, the main replicative niche is the lung epithelial cell. Our study focused on the role of HIF-1α in IAV replication in AEC2. We finally uncovered that HIF-1α is a key regulator of IAV replication by interfering with AMPKα-ULK1 signalling mediated autophagy. The results raise the opportunity to utilize HIF-1α signalling in IAV infection as novel therapeutic targets for the development of host-factor-directed antiviral drugs, which needs further studies to determine the possibility.</p>
