<p>In conclusion, our study unveils a novel mechanism that HIF-1α signalling controls the replication of IAV by regulating AMPKα-ULK1 signalling-mediated autophagy in AEC2s. This study has provided us new insights into the pathogenicity of IAV. Improved molecular understanding of the role of HIF-1α in IAV replication in relation to glycolysis and autophagy in the host cells may facilitate the development of novel host-factor-directed antiviral therapeutics for influenza virus infection.</p>
