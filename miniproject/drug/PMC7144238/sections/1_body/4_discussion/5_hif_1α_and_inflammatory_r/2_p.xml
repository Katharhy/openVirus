<p>In this study, we demonstrate that deficiency of HIF-1α enhances the replication of IAV by promoting AMPKα-ULK1-mediated autophagy in AEC2. Notably, we and another group both found that HIF-1α is critical for the transcription and production of proinflammatory and antiviral cytokines (

 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, HIF-1α is identified as a host restriction factor for IAV replication combined its role in antiviral cytokine expression and autophagy. Although antiviral cytokines expression was reduced in HIF-1α knockdown cell line, in the
