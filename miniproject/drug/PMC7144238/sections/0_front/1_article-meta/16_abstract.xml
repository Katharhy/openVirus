 <p>Infection of influenza A virus (IAV) can trigger exaggerated pulmonary inflammation and induce acute lung injury (ALI). Limiting IAV replication and alleviation of pulmonary inflammation are two important therapeutic strategies for influenza virus infection. Recent studies have shown that hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is an essential factor for the development and repair of ALI; however, the role and the underlying mechanisms of HIF-1α in IAV-induced ALI remain elusive. Here, we demonstrated that lung epithelial cell-specific 
  <italic>Hif1α</italic> knockout mice infected with IAV developed more lung IAV replication and severe lung inflammation, which led to increased mortality compared to IAV-infected control mice. Moreover, knockdown of 
  <italic>HIF1A</italic> in A549 cells (human alveolar type II epithelial cell line) promoted IAV replication 
  <italic>in vitro</italic>. Mechanistically, knockdown of 
  <italic>HIF1A</italic> reduced glycolysis by regulating transcription of glycolysis-related enzymes, which subsequently activated the AMPKα-ULK1 signalling pathway. Interestingly, AMPKα-ULK1 signalling promoted autophagy and augmented IAV replication. Taken together, deficiency of HIF-1α in lung epithelial cells reduces glycolysis and enhances AMPKα-ULK1-mediated autophagy, which finally facilitates IAV replication. These findings have deepened our understanding of the role of HIF-1α in regulating IAV replication and provided us novel therapeutic targets for combating influenza infection.
