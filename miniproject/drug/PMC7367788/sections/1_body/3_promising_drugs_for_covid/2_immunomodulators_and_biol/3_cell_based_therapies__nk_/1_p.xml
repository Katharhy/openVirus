<p id="Par37">Cell-based therapies have now been proposed as a prudent therapy against COVID-19. It works by boosting the immunity of SARS-CoV-2 patients. Recently, the FDA has approved Celularity to start a clinical trial for COVID-19 using natural killer (NK) cells (CYNK-001), which is used earlier in small numbers of cancer patients and found safe. CYNK-001 is a cryopreserved allogeneic natural killer cell therapy derived from placental hematopoietic stem cells. NK cells are important immune cells necessary for defense against virus-infected cells and neoplastic cells and show their activity via the process of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) [
