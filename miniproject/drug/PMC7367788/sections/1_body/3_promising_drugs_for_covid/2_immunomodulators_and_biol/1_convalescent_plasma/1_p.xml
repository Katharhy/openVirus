<p id="Par35">This passive immunoglobulin therapy is one of the potential adjunctive therapies now being used for COVID-19 patients. The rationale for such passive immunization is that plasma collected from patients after they recovered from COVID-19 might contain antibodies (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, and IgD) to SARS-CoV-2 and can be used to reduce the viremia and disease mortality in patients with life-threatening SARS-CoV-2 infections. Convalescent plasma therapy has been used in the past for many viral infections such as Ebola, influenza, poliomyelitis, SARS, and MERS and has shown improvement in clinical outcome [

These data support the utility of convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 patients, yet its use, until now, is recommended only to severe patients with life-threatening COVID-19 infections. More RCTs are required to optimize the amount, timing, and duration for which it is to be administered to COVID-19 patients. Moreover, being a polyclonal antibody therapy, its efficacy on the long run should be investigated more.
