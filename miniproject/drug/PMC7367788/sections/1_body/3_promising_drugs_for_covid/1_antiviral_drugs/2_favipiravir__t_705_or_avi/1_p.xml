<p id="Par32">It is another most promising purine nucleoside analog being studied for COVID-19 and was developed by Fujifilm Toyama, Japan. It has shown anti-viral activity for various RNA viruses including the Ebola virus and oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It is a prodrug of favipiravir ribofuranosy l-5′-triphosphate (favipiravir-RTP) and acts by inhibiting RNA polymerase activity, thus ceasing viral replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It has been approved in Japan and China for the treatment of novel influenza virus infections, and in March 2020, China has approved its use for COVID-19 patients. A study by Wang et al. has reported the EC50 of favipiravir was 61.88 μM/L against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A study conducted on COVID-19 patients in China has stated the more potent antiviral action (shorter time for viral clearance) of favipiravir plus interferon-alpha than that of lopinavir/ritonavir plus interferon-alpha [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in China comparing favipiravir with arbidol has shown better recovery profile after 7-day treatment in those on favipiravir among moderately ill patients but not among mildly or severely ill patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Favipiravir has mutagenic potential and cannot be used in pregnant women, but the main adverse effects reported in previous studies are mild to moderate diarrhea, an asymptomatic increase of blood uric acid and transaminases, and a decrease in the neutrophil counts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. To date, more than 25 clinical trials are registered for favipiravir in

Recently, in India, Glenmark pharmaceuticals got regulatory approval for the manufacturing and marketing of favipiravir (FabiFlu) to treat mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients. Together, all these data suggest the potential antiviral action of favipiravir on SARS-CoV-2. However, favipiravir has shown a variable range of IC50 in various viral studies, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and some studies have documented a possible ethnic or regional difference in its pharmacokinetic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. So, before concluding its antiviral effects in COVID-19 patients, it is very important to standardize its dosing regimen in the clinical trial and should consider the pharmacokinetic variations and drug–drug interactions among individuals of a different region.
