 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Recently, chloroquine has demonstrated the efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells 19. Being a weak diprotic base both CQ and HCQ act by increasing the pH of endosomes and prevent the fusion of viral and host cell membrane [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. They also interfere with the glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 receptors and also act at the post-entry stage of the virus. A study by Gao and colleagues have indicated the beneficial role of CQ phosphate in reducing the severity of pneumonia and lung injury, thereby decreasing the course of the disease in almost 100 patients of COVID-19 in comparison to the control group [

HCQ (EC50 = 6.14 μM) is more potent and safer than CQ (EC50 = 23.90 μM) and found to have a role in preventing cytokine storm that occurs in serious cases of COVID-19. An open-label nonrandomized French study of 36 patients (20 in the HCQ group and 16 in the control group) reported improved viral clearance with HCQ compared with control group patients receiving standard supportive care. The authors also reported that including azithromycin with HCQ for the treatment of 6 patients has shown more improvements in viral clearance in comparison to the HCQ alone group [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. But, a prospective study of 30 patients in China stated that there was no difference in clinical outcomes between HCQ (400 mg, daily for 5 days) plus standard treatment group (supportive care, interferon, and other antivirals) and standard treatment alone group [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. At the time, HCQ was the most promising and wonder drug for COVID-19, and now, despite initially promising results, recent studies on HCQ have reported disappointing findings so far in the randomized trials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. However, WHO and ICMR (Indian council of medical research) still find some hope with HCQ, and trials are being conducted to ascertain its efficacy and safety for COVID-19. In India, HCQ is used as a prophylactic drug for SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare professionals. Recently, the results of a most awaited trial conducted in the USA on 96,032 COVID-19 patients using HCQ and CQ with or without macrolides have demonstrated no significant differences in the clinical outcome of these agents in comparison to control group [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Also, some adverse events were reported with the CQ and HCQ group including arrhythmia and the survival rates were also less in these groups in comparison to the control group. Many RCTs on both CQ and HCQ are still in the clinical trial, evaluating their role against COVID-19 treatment, but whether it is efficacious or not, it would be ascertained only after completion of these trials. Also, it is important to optimize the dose, therapeutic time window, and the risk–benefit ratio associated with the use of HCQ.
