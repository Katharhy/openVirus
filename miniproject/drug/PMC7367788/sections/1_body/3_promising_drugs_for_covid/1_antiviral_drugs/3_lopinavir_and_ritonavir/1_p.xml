<p id="Par33">These protease inhibitors are widely used for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and have also shown potential antiviral activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in various studies conducted in vitro and in animal [

But, the adverse effects reported were less including diarrhea, nausea, and asthenia, and the number of death was also less in the LPV/RTV group in comparison to the control group. Recently, a study by Hung et al. has reported better antiviral and safety profiles, and faster recovery rates with early triple antiviral therapy (LPV/RTV, interferon beta-1b, and ribavirin) in comparison with LPV/RTV alone in a phase 2 RCT of COVID-19 patients

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Although, initial results of LPV/RTV RCT have not shown the remarkable clinical improvement, yet WHO and other organizations are testing the efficacy of LPV/RTV in the clinical trial of COVID-19. The role of LPV/RTV for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to COVID-19 is also being evaluated in one of the registered phase 3 clinical trials. More RCTs with adequate power are required to conclude the efficacy of LPV/RTV in COVID-19 patients.
