<p>From a public health perspective, the ability to contain the outbreak in India will primarily depend upon the strength of the public health system in India. As the number of confirmed cases in India is on the rise, the capacity of the public health system in combating the pandemic is being questioned by the experts. India's expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP is lower than the poorest countries in the world. According to the National Health Profile in 2019, India spends only 1.28% of its GDP as public health expenditure.

India ranks much below than China (48), Sri Lanka (71), Bangladesh (133), and Bhutan (134) in South Asia. The human resources and physical infrastructures of the public health system in India stand at an inferior stage. While the private health care system is flourishing in India, more than 65% population does not have health insurance, putting massive pressure on the public hospitals. In order to ensure the public health first, the government of India, on March 24, had announced 21â€‰days effective nationwide lockdown. The main objective of the lockdown was to maintain social distancing and suspend all forms of travel so that it can prevent the spread of infection from the infected at the community level. India has very less number of hospitals and testing centers. In India, there is only one hospital per 47,000 population. States like Himachal Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh have 12 and 16 hospitals, respectively, for per lakh population. Maharashtra, which has witnessed the maximum number of coronavirus cases in India, has only one hospital for every 1.6 lakh population. Statistics also reveal that on average, there is only one doctor for 10,700 people in India. Given this poor medical condition in India, a genuine question arises, how well prepared is India's public health system to deal with this crisis.

As of April 9, India has conducted a total of 1,44,920 tests recording lowest test rates per capita in the world. Some states in India have reported no tests so far.
