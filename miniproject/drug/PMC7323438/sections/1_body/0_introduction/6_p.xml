<p>Given the background, this article attempts to answer a very crucial question that what is the economic effect of COVID‐19 on the Indian economy, in general, and its impact on different sectors, in particular? However, before we discuss the economic repercussion of the pandemic, we, first and foremost, consider this outbreak as a human tragedy. There are no parameters that can account the human sufferings which the pandemic has brought. As the outbreak of COVID‐19 is spreading like wildfire, some of the current economic explanations may stand redundant as the crisis evolves. This article potentially reflects our perspective of COVID‐19 on the Indian economy as of April 13. Through this article, we address the following three aspects of COVID‐19 pandemic in the context of the Indian economy. First, we examine the effect of COVID‐19 on different sectors of the economy, such as the agricultural sector, manufacturing sector, and the service sector. Second, we will highlight how the bilateral trade relation between India and China has been affected due to the outbreak. Third, we present the impact of 21‐day nationwide lockdown on social consumption in India. Finally, we conclude the article by highlighting the growth projections about India and recommending some policy implications.</p>
