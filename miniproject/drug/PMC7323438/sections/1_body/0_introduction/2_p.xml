<p>The outbreak of COVID‐19, which was initially conceived as a Chinese‐centric shock, has now been understood to be a global crisis. With the number of cases increasing rapidly, the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 12, declared COVID‐19 as a global pandemic. The unprecedented outbreak of the virus has brought considerable human sufferings to every sphere of human lives. In addition to the public health emergency, the crisis has unpredictably hit the world economy. The operations of the world economy have substantially come to a halt. The economically challenging measures adopted across the countries such as bans on traveling, imposing restrictions on labor mobility, shutting down manufacturing companies, and sharp cutbacks in service sector activities to contain the disease, have produced enormous adverse effects on the economy. However, an accurate empirical assessment about the size and persistence of the pandemic and its likely impact on the world economy is yet unknowable. The earlier pandemics (SARS, Avian Flu, MERS) had affected particularly those countries that were economically less dominant; moreover, the magnitude of the previous pandemics was much smaller than COVID‐19. The effect of this virus is, however, economically different. The number of infections is frequently changing on an hourly basis. The top most affected economies out of the outbreak are United States, Italy, China, Spain, France, United Kingdom, and Germany. These economies accidentally happen to be the world's largest economies as well. G7 economies have witnessed exponential growth in the number of confirmed cases. These economies account 60% of the world's demand and supply, 65% of the world's manufacturing, and around 40% of manufacturing exports (Baldwin &amp; di Mauro,

UNCTAD projects that the slowdown in the world economy as a result of the outbreak of COVID‐19 will cost around 1 trillion dollars. According to the United Nations, the sudden decline in oil prices has been the major contributing factor to the global economic slowdown. Figure
