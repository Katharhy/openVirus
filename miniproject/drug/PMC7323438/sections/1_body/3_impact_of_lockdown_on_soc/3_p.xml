<p>It does not require a trained economist to assess the impact of the complete social and economic lockdown of India on the supply side of the Indian economy. This lockdown will bring massive disruptions in the production and distributions of goods and services except for the essential commodities. In an effort to contain the rapidly spreading coronavirus, a fall in social consumption can severely affect the GDP of an economy. As people are getting aware about the community transmission of the disease, they are maintaining social distancing and cutting back social consumption. Loss in social consumption is partly considered as a permanent loss. However, reductions in social consumption may not necessarily amplify all scenarios by the same degree and magnitude. This is due to the reason that demand and supply in the market are complementary to each other. If closing down the educational institutions and banning public events result in people taking more off from their works, then it will create supply shocks. In such a situation, demand shock will have less scope to do damage.</p>
