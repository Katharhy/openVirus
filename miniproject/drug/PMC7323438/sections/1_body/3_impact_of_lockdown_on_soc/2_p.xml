<p>The main objective of the initial announcement of 21‐day lockdown followed by its further extension till May 3, has been to ensure social distancing. Social distancing interventions can be effective against fighting the pandemic but are potentially detrimental to the economy (Koren &amp; Pető,

Business and corporate companies that depend heavily on the face to face communications or close physical proximity while producing a product or service are particularly vulnerable. The idea of social distancing has been proven effective to contain the rapid spread of the epidemics (Hatchett, Mecher, &amp; Lipsitch,

Many countries across the world have implemented the practice of social distancing by closing down schools, prohibiting large community gatherings, restricting nonessential stores and transportation in an effort to contain the spread (Anderson, Heesterbeek, Klinkenberg, &amp; Hollingsworth,

Previous research has established the efficacy of the implementations of social distancing on reducing the spread of epidemics. 1918 Spanish flu in the United States (Bootsma &amp; Ferguson,
