<p>The pandemic has hit the manufacturing sectors across the globe in different ways. Since the outbreak initially emerged in the manufacturing heartland of the world (East Asia), it is likely to disrupt the global supply chain in the industrial giants. With the further spread of the virus, the manufacturing sector across the world will experience a similar hit. The supply chain contagion will create a direct supply shock to the manufacturing sectors in the less affected nations. The less affected nations would find it harder to import the raw and possessed materials from the hard‐hit economies as a result of the pandemic. Subsequently, there will be a demand disruption in both less affected and hard‐hit economies owing to the macroeconomic drops in aggregate consumption demand (Baldwin &amp; di Mauro,
