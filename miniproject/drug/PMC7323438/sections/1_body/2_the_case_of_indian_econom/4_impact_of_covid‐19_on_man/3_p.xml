<p>The Indian economy was already struggling hard to recover from the economic slowdown prior to the outbreak. However, the continuing outbreak of COVID‐19 in India has made the possibility of revival difficult as several sectors in the economy are witnessing an adverse effect of COVID‐19. Even the Finance Minister has assured that the government will take some stringent measures to help the manufacturing industries, mainly the MSME's to reduce the effect of COVID‐19 on the sector. On the manufacturing front, the impact of the coronavirus will depend upon to the extent the sector is connected to China. The pharmaceuticals and automobile industries are already facing the effect. As the pharmaceutical industry is strongly linked to China, the supply chain of raw materials of drugs has been affected immensely. Though India is considered to be the top exporters of drugs in the world, it depends heavily on the import of bulk drugs. In the financial year 2018–2019, India had imported around 24,900 crores of bulk drugs and the import constitutes approximately 40% of the domestic consumption.

The largest production unit of pharmaceutical in Himachal Pradesh is undergoing the lockdown incurring huge manufacturing loss in India. On the other hand, with the disruptions in the supply chain, the automobile industry in India has also seen a severe impact. The coronavirus outbreak not only has affected the automobile industry but also hit the automotive components and forging industries. China accounts for 27% of exports of auto components in India and considers to be the leading supplier in India. As the manufacturing industries in China were shut down in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, many Indian automobile companies have suffered the losses. Several automobiles companies including Mahindra and Mahindra (M&amp;M), Tata Motors, and MG Motors in India have announced that they are facings constraints in the supply of auto components from the virus‐hit China.
