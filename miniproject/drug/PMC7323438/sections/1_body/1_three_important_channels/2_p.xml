    <italic>Supply Channel</italic>: The first important channel is the supply channel. With the disruptions in the production unit, closures of factories irrespective of sizes, cutbacks in the service sector, especially the financial sector can result in a significant disruption in the global supply chain.

    <italic>Demand Channel</italic>: As a consequence of the outbreak, there will be a fall in demand in the travel and tourism sector, the decline in the education services, decline in trade, contraction in demand for entertainment and leisure services.

   <p>
    <italic>Confidence Channel</italic>: The third crucial channel is the confidence channel. Amidst the global uncertainty, there is a fall in the confidence pattern of consumers as there is less consumption of goods and services. To contain the spread, several containment measures have been adopted by several countries, which are likely to affect the consumer and financial market confidence. Spillover effects are being transmitted through finance and confidence channel to financial markets.
