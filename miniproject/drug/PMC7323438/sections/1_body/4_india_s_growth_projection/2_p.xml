<p>Given the setbacks that the current state of the economy is encountering, it has been predicted that the economy is likely to hit by a lower growth rate in the last quarter of the current fiscal year. However, if the outbreak continues to rise, then the growth rate in the first two quarters of the next financial year might be subdued. Keeping in mind the negative effects of COVID‚Äê19, many international organizations and credit agencies have revised the growth projections. Restrictions of traveling both at the international and domestic level, disruptions in the supply chain, and declining investment demand and consumption will contribute to the sluggish growth rate.</p>
