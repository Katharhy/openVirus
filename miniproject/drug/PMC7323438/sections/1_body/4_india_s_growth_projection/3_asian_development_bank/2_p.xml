<p>Asian Development Bank (ADB) has projected that the outbreak of COVID‐19 might incur economic in Indian from $387 million to $29.9 billion in terms of personal consumption losses. In order to assess the economic effect of the outbreak on developing economies in Asia, ADB has categorized four possible scenarios. These scenarios are the best‐case scenario, moderate case scenario, worse‐case scenario, and hypothetical worst‐case scenario. Under the best‐case scenario, it has projected the loss to be $387 million for India, if the spread is contained by travel suspension and taking some precautionary measures after 2 months from late January. In the occurrence of a moderate scenario, the loss is likely to be hit by $640 billion. Imposing some restrictive policies in place and with the continuation of some precautionary measures for the next 6 months, under the worst‐case scenario, the personal consumption expenditure in India will fall by $1.2 billion.</p>
