<p>Given the status of India's poor health care system, government expenditure on public health care should be substantial to ensure all the required medical facilities to the people. India has reported a very low number of coronavirus tests. The government should ensure the supply of masks, gloves, and medical kits to the health workers to contain the virus. Since the agricultural and allied activities are heavily affected, and there has been a fall in aggregate consumption in the country except for the essentials, direct benefit transfers to the farmers can improve the demand for agricultural products post the pandemic. Due importance should be given to research and innovation so that scientist and researchers can find an effective way to address the crisis. In addition to public health, the government should also help vulnerable households by providing them with temporary direct benefit transfers. Such actions of the government would support the households to compensate for the loss of their incomes arising out of work shutdowns and layoffs. International cooperation and development aid from the developed countries to less developed countries can be proven effective during this crisis.</p>
