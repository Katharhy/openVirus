<p>After examining the effect of COVID‐19 on the Indian economy and its different sectors, this study recommends some policy actions both for the short‐run and long run. Effective implementation of easy monetary policy by considering a repo cut of 50 basis points and extending the period from 90 to 180 days in recognizing the nonperforming assets (NPAs) can provide stimulus to the financial sector. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) can also play a significant role in mitigating the effect of COVID‐19. Spending on pandemic mitigation measures should be a part of CSR initiatives. To minimize the effect, the government should induce more capital to the public sector banks in India. Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), should be given easy and cheap credit as these companies are worst affected by this pandemic. The MSMEs industry provides more than 100 million employment opportunities and contributes 16.6% to India's GDP. Post the crisis, the employees associated with the sector will experience a decline in their incomes. Government should provide some incentives to the employees to compensate for the loss that they are facing owing to the lockdown. Farmers and agriculture migrant workers should be included in the several assistance packages announced by the government and any social protection programs addressing the crisis should include the migrant labors. Unemployed informal workers should be provided cash income support through Jan Dhan financial inclusion program.</p>
