<p id="par0145">We also observed that the highest percentage of deaths occurred in the oldest patients, being 58.5% in those aged 80 or above (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). Percentages of deaths also increased with number of comorbidities, being 19.3% in patients with no comorbidity and 58% in those with at least 4 comorbidities (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). By analyzing the percentage of deaths in relation to the age groups and comorbidities together, we verified that no one under the age of 40 died independently of comorbidities, while comorbidities weighed on the number of deaths in other age groups, apart from the oldest one, aged 80 years and over, in which the percentage of deaths is very high independently from comorbidities (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). We confirmed this different effect of comorbidities on in-hospital death according to age, by identifying an interaction between age and number of comorbidities (interaction p-value &lt;0.001).
