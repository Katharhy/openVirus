<p id="par0185">The unusually high fatality rate should be interpreted with attention. Our analysis was only focused on hospitalised patients, the large majority (93.5%) with pneumonia, most of them (88%) requiring oxygen support. Data on Chinese population show fatality rates ranging from 2.3% (
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Wu and McGoogan, 2020</xref>) among 44,672 cases, mostly (81%) with mild disease, to 28% among 191 patients hospitalised in Wuhan (
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>); older age was associated with poor outcome in all the studies (

The reasons for such differences need to be disentangled, to properly describe the weight of the epidemics and the impact in the different settings on medical care organisation. First, in all the reports age is a predictor of worse outcome (

 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). With a median age of 66 years and 63% over 60, our is the oldest study population of all the studies mentioned. Moreover, in our study 65% are affected by at least one comorbidity. The presence of comorbidities is associated with a worse prognosis (
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Ciceri et al., 2020</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2020</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Comparing our data with those reported by Ciceri et al., from the same geographical area, we observed that the difference in overall mortality rate (23% vs 32%) might account for different percentages of patients with at least two comorbidities (19% vs 39%) (
