<p id="par0200">We also observed a reduced risk of in-hospital death according to the treatment received. Most of the patients were receiving combinations containing hydroxychloroquine ± azithromycin ± antivirals. The possible effectiveness and toxicity of hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 disease is debated: laboratory studies showed antiviral properties (
