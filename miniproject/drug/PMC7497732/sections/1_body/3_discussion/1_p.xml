<p id="par0180">In our study population of 539 patients hospitalised for COVID-19 disease we found an in-hospital mortality of 32%, reaching 44% in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Patients’ age, disease severity at presentation, level of inflammation and concomitant comorbidities appeared to be the main drivers of fatality events. We also observed different waves of patients’ admissions by calendar time characterized by different demographic and clinical profiles.</p>
