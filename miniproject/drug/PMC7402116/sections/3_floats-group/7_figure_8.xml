  <p>ACE-2 is needed to convert pro-inflammatory angiotensin II (ANG-II) to anti-inflammatory ANG (1-7) in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). As COVID-19 competes for ACE-2, less ANG-II is converted to ANG (1-7) which leads to more inflammation. Furthermore, individuals with ACE genetic polymorphism DD have higher levels of ACE activity which promotes more formation of ANG-II making individuals with this polymorphism susceptible to even greater inflammation. Individuals with the ACE polymorphism have the lowest ACE activity, which leads to lower levels of ANG-II and less inflammation.</p>
