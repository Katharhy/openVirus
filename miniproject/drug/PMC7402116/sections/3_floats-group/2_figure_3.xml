  <p>As more COVID-19-Porphyrin complexes are being produced the competitive inhibition increases, eventually out-competing heme leading to increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. The result is less production of ferritin, Fe, bilirubin, and carbon monoxide (CO). This may be part of the reason why COVID-19 patients have fluctuations in ferritin and bilirubin, which are measurable inflammatory markers. Furthermore, free iron release from the binding of COVID-19 to porphyrin increases ferritin even when HO-1 is inhibited. The end result is increased free heme and iron that leads to severe oxidative stress causing decreased HO-1 gene expression and competitively inhibited HO-1 enzymes that were previously active. Key: p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases = P38 MAPK, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP
   <sup>+</sup>/NADPH).
