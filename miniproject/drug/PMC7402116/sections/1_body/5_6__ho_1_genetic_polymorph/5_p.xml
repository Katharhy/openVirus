<p>There are many reasons for the negative clinical outcomes in the chronic inflammatory state of obesity as result of COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B60-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Peterson et al. have shown that obesity increases the oxidation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) [
 <xref rid="B64-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Oxidized HDL (Ox-HDL) alone is considered to potentiate increased inflammatory cytokines levels by the direct effect on adipocyte stem cells [
 <xref rid="B65-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Additionally, Ox-HDL causes an inflammatory cascade with inflammatory cytokines, interleukins (IL-6, IL-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and upregulation of Angiotensin II (ANG II), a biomarker for early detection of cardiovascular risk [
 <xref rid="B64-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. This made obese subjects susceptible to early heart failure and death subsequent to COVID-19 infection [
 <xref rid="B66-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. We showed that humans and mice with obesity display low left ventricle function [
 <xref rid="B67-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In a study of inflammatory markers comparing obese women in rural Appalachia to women in urban Brooklyn, Brooklyn had higher levels of both IL-6 and TNF, but both had low levels of adiponectin, marked elevation of Ox-HDL, and circulating endothelial cells (CEC). Obesity increases the volume of epicardial fat and subsequent inflammation converts beige fat to white fat after uncoupling of mitochondrial enzymes and destruction of mitochondria [
 <xref rid="B68-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. This negatively affected cardiovascular outcomes in obesity including heart failure and arrhythmias, even prior to COVID-19 infection. Increased antioxidant and HO-1-derived bilirubin may ameliorate the negative effect of COVID-19. Recent studies showed that upregulation of HO-1 attenuated this risk [
 <xref rid="B68-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], and converts white epicardial fat to preferred beige epicardial fat [
 <xref rid="B68-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="B69-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Increasing HO-1 levels with pharmacological therapy [
