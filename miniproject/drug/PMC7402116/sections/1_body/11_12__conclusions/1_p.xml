<p>The main drugs currently being used to treat COVID-19 patients such as the 4-aminoquinolones, azithromycin, and remdesivir all decrease heme production, in part, by inhibiting CYP enzyme induction, thus decreasing the demand for heme. These drugs also display interactions with the CYP system, which makes maintaining safe effective therapeutic drug levels a challenge. Heme arginate is a more powerful upregulator of HO-1 and inhibitor of ALAS, lowering heme levels substantially. Furthermore, Heme arginate is able to accelerate reactions mediated by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 [
