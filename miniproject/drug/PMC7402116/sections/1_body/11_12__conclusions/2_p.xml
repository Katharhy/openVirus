<p>Obesity is a chronic inflammatory disease manifested by an increase in cytokine levels at baseline, increasing the risk of a “cytokine storm” in obese patients. Obese individuals have many more ACE-2 receptors on the surface of white necrotic adipocytes and have many more white adipocytes in total than the number of brown adipocytes of their lean counterparts. COVID-19 causes severe systemic inflammation and downregulation of HO-1, already downregulated in the chronic inflammatory state of obesity. The clinical course of the disease has been challenged by the interaction of three genetic polymorphisms, all affected by COVID-19: first is the CYP2D6 enzyme system, second is the HO-1 anti-inflammatory gene, and third the ACE and ACE-2 enzyme systems. Effective therapy must include anti-viral drugs to halt viral replication. The second must involve the upregulation of the heme oxygenase system to reduce ROS and the severe inflammation caused by the cytokine excess. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant approach should be essential to our armamentarium until we have an effective vaccine.</p>
