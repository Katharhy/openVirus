<p>Leronlimab, the CCR5 (chemokine receptor 5) inhibitor, is currently entering Phase II clinical trials. This is an antiretroviral agent used to prevent the virus from entering the CD4 cell by blocking the CCR5 receptor [
 <xref rid="B135-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. CCR5 inhibitors are also being studied and have been found to significantly reduce IL-6 and TNF-a with a lower toxicity profile than Tocilizumab [
 <xref rid="B136-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. It has an excellent safety profile, used extensively in triple negative breast cancer and in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment [

 <xref rid="B140-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Convalescent plasma has been shown to reduce hypoxia in intubated patients [
 <xref rid="B140-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. The adverse effects associated with plasma transfusions include the risk of TRALI, TACO, and anaphylactic reactions [
