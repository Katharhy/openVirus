<p>The COVID-porphyrin complex leads to an upregulation of pro-inflammatory free heme production presumably by inducing delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALAS-1/2), the first step and rate limiting enzyme in the synthesis of the heme pathway [
 <xref rid="B18-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Since COVID-19 is able to bind heme at the porphyrin binding site, it reduces the amount of functional hemoprotein, potentially inducing ALAS-1/2 to produce more heme as a result of a negative feedback loop (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00636-f004">Figure 4</xref>). ALA synthetase and porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), which are present in both adipocytes and red cells maintain heme levels. ALAS-1/2 increases heme degradation by HO-1 [
 <xref rid="B19-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. COVID-19 produces dysfunctional hemoproteins and dysfunctional porphyrin that are no longer capable of making heme. This leads to more hemoprotein available for COVID-19 to bind to, which leads to the release of more free iron, and as a result, increased inflammation [
 <xref rid="B6-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, the iron released by dying cells has additive toxic effects. Murine models of HO-1 deficiency demonstrate a loss of stress defenses and increased toxicity from free iron [

 <xref rid="B24-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], as a result of lack of stress defenses [
 <xref rid="B25-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], tubular injury [
 <xref rid="B24-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], hemolysis, nephritis, and asplenia [
 <xref rid="B26-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The increased inflammation leads to severe oxidative stress which further decreases HO-1 gene expression [
 <xref rid="B6-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Drugs currently being used to treat COVID-19 patients include Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Azithromycin, and Remdesivir are all cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B27-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], although Remdesivir has only shown this for in vitro activity by Gilead Sciences as described in the Remdesivir (GS-5734) investigatorâ€™s brochure, Edition 5, 21 February 2020 and listed in the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines, Since these drugs downregulate CYP, which has a heme moiety, this decreases the demand for heme production [
 <xref rid="B28-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The success of these drugs is likely attributable to the fact that they all inhibit CYP production which results in lower heme production [
