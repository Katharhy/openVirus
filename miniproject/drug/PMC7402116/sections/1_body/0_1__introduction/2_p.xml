<p>The HO system, which comprises HO-1 (inducible) and HO-2 (constitutive), which degrade heme to free iron (increased ferritin synthesis), bilirubin (antioxidant), and carbon monoxide (antiapoptotic) is critical in its primary role in cellular defense is involved in a variety of crucial physiological functions. These include cytoprotection, anti-inflammation, anti-oxidative effects, apoptosis, neuromodulation, immune-modulation, angiogenesis, and vascular regulation [
