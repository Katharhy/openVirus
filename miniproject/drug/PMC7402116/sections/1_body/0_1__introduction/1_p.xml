<p>SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus, an RNA virus that shares the same subgenus as severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) [
 <xref rid="B1-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Human coronaviruses include the common cold and are generally inconsequential. Both SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) came from animal reservoirs and caused global epidemics. Coronaviruses are large viruses and include alpha, beta, delta, and gamma subgroups, with alpha and beta affecting humans [

 <xref rid="B3-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has a tremendous ability to bind porphyrins with even stronger affinity than ACE-2 receptors, resulting in the upregulation of free heme, an oxidant, and severe reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and decreased levels of heme oxygenase-1 enzymes (HO-1) [
