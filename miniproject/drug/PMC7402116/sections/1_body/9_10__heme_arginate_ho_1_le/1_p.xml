<p>Heme arginate increases HO-1 levels by inhibiting delta-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS-1/2), the rate limiting enzyme in the eight steps of the heme synthetic pathway [
 <xref rid="B55-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Heme arginate also promotes glucagon release, which results in an increase of 2.3-fold in HO activity [
 <xref rid="B144-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that increasing levels of HO-1 with heme arginate can improve inflammation and viral infections [

 <xref rid="B148-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. Sickle cell patients, for example, are in a pro-inflammatory state [
 <xref rid="B149-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. HO-1 upregulation reduced oxidative stress in the kidney in sickle cell disease [
 <xref rid="B150-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. Heme arginate, which is an upregulator of HO-1, was studied in this population and found to prevent dysfunctional hemoprotein formation, while increasing the ability of ferritin to chelate iron [
 <xref rid="B150-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. Increased levels of HO-1 play an essential role in the induction of ferritin synthesis as a result of increased levels of free iron from degradation of heme, which acts as antioxidant protection [

 <xref rid="B152-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>,
 <xref rid="B153-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. Increasing levels of HO-1 decreases lipid peroxidation, red blood cell (RBC) sickling, and heme content in the kidney [
 <xref rid="B150-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. Heme arginate also increases Nitric Oxide (NO) while decreasing adhesion molecules in HIV infected stem cells leading to a decrease in the number of HIV copies in cells [
 <xref rid="B145-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>,
 <xref rid="B146-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>,
 <xref rid="B147-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. This inhibition of HIV replication requires decreased adhesion, increased levels of antioxidants, and inhibition of viral transcriptase enzymes, all of which was accomplished by administration of azidothymidine (AZT)-Heme arginate [
 <xref rid="B145-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>,
 <xref rid="B146-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>,
 <xref rid="B147-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. This combination was successful even in an AZT resistant HIV strain [
 <xref rid="B147-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. HO-1 upregulation by heme arginate decreased dysfunctional hemoprotein, which resulted in HO-1 upregulation attenuating the EBOLA virus (EBOV) transcription/replication leading to a decrease in viral particles [
 <xref rid="B148-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. Heme arginate is well known to decrease heme production and has been used extensively to treat porphyria patients. The resultant increase in HO-1 reduces vasoconstriction [

 <xref rid="B155-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>], hepcidin [
 <xref rid="B156-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>], and inflammation with the potential ability to prevent the cytokine storm [
 <xref rid="B55-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This is especially important in patients who are predisposed to “the perfect cytokine storm” from COVID-19, including those with the longer GT allele HO-1 polymorphism, abundant white adipose cells (in obesity and diabetes), and those with CYP2D6 polymorphisms that lead to supra- or sub-therapeutic drug levels. There are a number of naturally occurring substances that are capable of upregulating HO-1. These include Thymoquine (black seed oil) in combination with Omega-3 that was shown to protect against obesity induced oxidative stress, improve insulin sensitivity and convert white fat to beige fat in a murine model of obesity [
 <xref rid="B157-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. In addition, pomegranate seed oil upregulated HO-1, improved mitochondrial function, and attenuated hepatic steatosis/fibrosis in a murine model of obesity [
 <xref rid="B158-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. It has previously been reported that HO-1 was upregulated in response to other naturally occurring substances such as resveratrol, curcumin, statins, and aspirin [
