<p>ACE levels are under genetic control and much research had been dedicated to understanding polymorphisms of the ACE genes [
 <xref rid="B159-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. Individuals with ACE gene polymorphisms are susceptible to the severe inflammation induced by COVID-19. Angiotensinogen is produced in the liver and is upregulated in adipocytes in obesity, while adipocyte angiotensin deficiency can prevent hypertension in the obese populations [

 <xref rid="B162-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. The major role of ACE-2 in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is in the conversion of angiotensin II (ANG-II) to angiotensin 1-7 (AT 1-7) (

 <xref rid="B163-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. In contrast, AT 1-7 promoted cardiovascular (CVS) protection along with anti-inflammation, anti-proliferation, and anti-fibrosis in organs with high ACE-2 concentrations [

 <xref rid="B165-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. ACE-2 is upregulated in adipose tissue in obesity and diabetes, with an increase in the ACE-2 receptors in white adipose cells, but more importantly, a major increase in the number of white adipocytes in obesity accounts for the increase in total ACE-2 receptors [
 <xref rid="B163-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. Since the spike protein of the COVID-19 virus enters the cell via the ACE-2 receptor, it remains unclear if this is the reason why obesity, with a significant upregulation of ACE-2 receptors, increases the risk of significant morbidity and mortality. Genetic polymorphisms exist for ACE-2 just as in ACE, and ACE activity has been well studied in individuals with different genetic polymorphisms [
 <xref rid="B166-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. Those with the DD genotype had higher ACE activity levels than those with the ID genotype (intermediate ACE activity), which was associated with higher ACE activity than those with the II genotype (least ACE activity) [
 <xref rid="B166-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. Since ACE is responsible for converting inactive ANG-1 to proinflammatory ANG-II, those with higher ACE levels are at higher risk of developing severe inflammation secondary to COVID-19 infection [
