<p>The consequence of COVID-19 binding the porphyrin molecules results in decreased functional hemoprotein, which has clinical manifestations [
 <xref rid="B4-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A hemoprotein is a protein linked to iron (Fe). The Fe group attached to the protein is capable of undergoing oxidation reduction (redox) reactions and function within the electron transport chain (ETC) of the mitochondria. Hemoproteins include hemoglobin, myoglobin, nitric oxide (NO) synthetase, catalase, and the cytochromes of the ETC in the mitochondria. Deficiency of any of these hemoproteins cause tissue inflammation and organ damage and even a prothrombotic state (
 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-00636-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Many COVID-19 patients require prolonged periods of supplemental oxygenation to maintain saturation levels even after all other symptoms have resolved. This is due to the decreased oxygen affinity COVID-19 causes in hemoglobin leading to the displacement of iron [

 <xref rid="B30-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Similar to hemoglobin, myoglobin is also affected by COVID-19. A significant number of COVID-19 patients experience rhabdomyolysis due to COVID-19 directly binding the porphyrin substrate of myoglobin, leading to the release of hemoprotein and iron, which induces inflammation and muscle breakdown [
