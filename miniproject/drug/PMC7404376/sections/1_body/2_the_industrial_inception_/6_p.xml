<p>Scientists began to understand how both bacteria and viruses could be managed. Although a disease pathogen could now be explained through the transmission of a specific microbe identified in a laboratory, what fundamentally caused an epidemic outbreak could also be understood within a broader ecological and social context. Take, for example, the French physician Eugène Jamot: in 1929, he discovered that the microorganism that causes sleeping sickness, the protozoa 
 <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, is transmitted by the tsetse fly. He claimed that French colonization had fundamentally unbalanced African colonial ecosystems through the introduction of new crops, social displacement, human migration, and labour recruitment, and that it was these social and ecological changes that had given rise to the sleeping sickness epidemic.

 </xref> In the urban environment of London, which suffered from cholera and typhoid throughout the 19th century, or in colonial environments such as British India, administrators took advantage of the biomedical knowledge to develop quick solutions, such as the use of therapeutics and vaccines, that would allow uninterrupted trade flows and labour regimes. Often biomedical solutions were prioritized over large‐scale infrastructural reforms—such as sewage, drainage, or slowing human labour migration—as methods to decrease disease transmission.
