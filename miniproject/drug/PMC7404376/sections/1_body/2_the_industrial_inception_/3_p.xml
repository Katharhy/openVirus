<p>However, viruses are fundamentally unlike bacteria. Microbiologist Louis Pasteur, bacteriologist Robert Koch, and other European pathologists studied bacteria via microscopes and cultivated them in the laboratory, yet viruses eluded these experimental apparatuses. The tobacco mosaic virus, the first virus ever to be identified, was discovered by plant pathologists in an attempt to counter harvest losses in plantations.

 </xref> In 1886, the German bacteriologist Adolf Meyer named it the “tobacco mosaic disease.” Dimitri Iosifovich Ivanovsky isolated its cause in 1892 by examining the sap of infected leaves. He declared that the infectious agent was able to pass through the ceramic sterilizing filters originally used to catch bacteria, and its filtrate could spread the disease to other plants.

 </xref> Likewise, Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch, both working at the Koch Institute for Infection Diseases in Berlin, investigated foot‐and‐mouth disease—a disease that caused substantial financial losses especially related to milk production and cattle breeding.

 </xref> They injected healthy calves with the virus and discovered that the filtered lymph fluid of animals with foot‐and‐mouth disease was able to infect other animals even when heavily diluted. The pathogen was therefore thought to replicate within the hosts.
