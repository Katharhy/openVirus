<p>Building on the 1878 proposal of his colleague Charles‐Emmanuel Sédillot, Pasteur declared, “every virus is a microbe.”

 </xref> Before the advent of late modern microbiology, the term “virus” was used for a broad category of virulent, poisonous substances causing diseases. Pasteur's statement narrowed down the general concept of “virus” to refer to all small and alive microscopic agents such as bacteria, protozoa, or fungi.

 </xref> While many of these infectious agents could be observed and discovered under the magnifying lenses of the light microscope, some of them remained invisible. By the end of the 19th century, viruses were thus defined by traits of technical uncontrollability. Unlike bacteria, viruses could not be filtered with ceramic or porcelain, could not be cultivated in artificial, purified environments (such as in a Petri dish), and could not be observed through microscopes. A search for their characteristics and developmental patterns started.
