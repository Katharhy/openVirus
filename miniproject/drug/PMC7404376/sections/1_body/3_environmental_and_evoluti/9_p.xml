<p>Nowadays, omics technologies applied to phylogenetic analysis have shown that the universal common ancestor, as depicted in the tree of life, was bacterial.

 </xref> Bacteria and viruses are conceived as fundamental elements necessary to all forms of life and which, throughout more than 4,000 million years, have combined and transformed basic chemical and biochemical elements to give rise to complex forms of life. The genomes of all cells in all species could be the result of the intensive evolutionary activity of horizontal gene transfer carried out by microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses.

 </xref> The theory of symbiogenesis completes the study of horizontal gene transfer. Beyond the medical framework of bacteriology, symbiogenesis frames the understanding of microbial life as the necessary, elemental dynamic of all living phenomena.

 </xref> The term symbiogenesis was made popular in the late 20th century by Lynn Margulis, who claimed that microorganisms are one of the major evolutionary forces in the origin of species as the endosymbiosis of bacteria is responsible for the creation of complex forms of life.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="cnt12300-note-0031">
  <sup>30</sup>
 </xref> Margulis theorized that eukaryotic cells evolved from a symbiosis of bacteria without nuclei that had previously lived independently. In her theory, both chloroplasts and mitochondria, which are organelles found in all plant and animal cells, respectively, evolved from once free‚Äêliving bacterial species.

  <sup>31</sup>
 </xref> This serial endosymbiotic theory gave microbiology a new evolutionary dimension and helped explain the origin of cells with nuclei. Margulis's idea was, and remains, highly innovative: cells with nuclei, including all the cells in the human body, descend from bacteria that formed symbiotic relationships more than 2 billion years ago.
