<p>Late 19th‐century scientific analysis and intervention on the microbial world fostered industrial production. Koch, Pasteur, and other scientists in Europe and its colonies solved, for 
 <italic>some</italic> humans, problems such as food shortages and epidemics. Within most of these scientific inquiries, microbes were viewed as pathogenic agents—that is, powerful actors that caused crippling disease for crops, livestock, and humans.

 </xref> Outside of biomedical settings, though, scientists such as Margulis and Winogradsky have conceptualized microbes within their ecological contexts to show how crucial they are in sustaining the most basic biological and biochemical processes of planet earth. In the last century, the analysis of microbes was repeatedly polarized, portraying them either as enemies to fight or as life‐sustaining elements. Despite the current pandemic, we posit that the latter position more usefully captures the “nature” of microbes amid environmental and social contexts. We argue that an appraisal of ecological models of microbes allows us to formulate a 
 <italic>longue durée</italic> examination of national, international, and intergovernmental institutions that function as mediators between both science and politics as well as science and society.
