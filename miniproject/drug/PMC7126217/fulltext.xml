Annually, influenza epidemics lead to 200&#x02013;500,000 fatal cases globally (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Courtin et al., 2017</xref>). Currently, therapeutic strategies to lower the mortality rates mainly rely on vaccines and chemical drugs. But usage of vaccines has been often challenged by frequent mutation of the antigen and narrow spectrum (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Tao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Zarubaev et al., 2015</xref>). On the other side, viral resistance and adverse effects restrict the clinic application of currently available anti-influenza virus drugs including neuraminidase inhibitors, M2 channel blockers and RNA synthesis inhibitors (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Hayden and De Jong, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Samson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Correia et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, alternative drugs with low toxicity, broad spectrum and less resistance remain to be developed.</p><p id="p0140">Ethnic medicines are valuable heritage and commercially important resources in the prevention and treatment of viral infectious diseases, a growing number of which are accumulating evidence of experimental and/or clinical efficacy (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Li and Peng, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Lia et al., 2019</xref>). Among them, <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> (&#x0201c;Ban-Lan-Gen&#x0201d; in Chinese, the sun-dried root of <italic>Isatis indigotica</italic> Fortune ex Lindl.) is well-known for its antiviral activity. In ethnic medical practice, <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> has been prescribed for treating fever, pestilence, sore throat, seasonal toxin, papule caused by warm toxin, macula, scarlatina, mumps, swelling abscess, erysipelas and erysipelas facialis (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Chinese Pharmacopoeia Commission, 2015</xref>). As officially approved medicinal material and products in China, <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> and its formulations have been used as the major herbal remedies in prevention and treatment against a wide range of viral infections, such as seasonal epidemics, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and H1N1 flu outbreaks in 2009 (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Deng et al., 2013</xref>). Regardless of the various subtypes of viruses and their rapid mutations, <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> was found to be effective in clinic against infections caused by influenza viruses with different strains and subtypes (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Ke et al., 2012</xref>). Notwithstanding the anti-influenza efficacy of <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> and its preparations is well acknowledged, their active constituents and pharmacological actions have not been elucidated. So far, a few antiviral components have been identified in <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic>, including (3H)-quinazolinone (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2013</xref>), glycoprotein (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Yamada, 1999</xref>), epigoitrin, 2,4(1H, 3H)-quinazolinedione (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2005</xref>), indirubin (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Mak et al., 2004</xref>), fructopyrano-(1&#x000a0;&#x02192;&#x000a0;4)-glucopyranose (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), clemastanin B (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2013</xref>), lariciresinol-4-O-&#x003b2;-D-glucopyranoside (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2015</xref>), polysaccharides (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>), isatithioetherin B and isatithioetherin D (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). Among these, the antiviral monomer epigoitrin has received much attention and it was chosen as the marker of antiviral efficacy in <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> when drafting the 2010 edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia.</p><p id="p0145">In previous study of the authors, the so-called &#x02018;epigoitrin&#x02019; used in former reports (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>) was found to be mixtures of unequal amounts of epigoitrin ((R)&#x02013;goitrin, (R)-5-vinyloxazolidine-2-thione) and goitrin ((S)&#x02013;goitrin, (S)-5-vinyloxazolidine-2-thione) in fact, and the isomers could not be separated by regular C<sub>18</sub> column. Consequently, the assay marker for <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> was changed to (R, S)-goitrin in 2010 and 2015 editions of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. In addition, (R, S)-goitrin was first resolved by the authors (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Nie et al., 2010</xref>) using normal phase liquid chromatography (NPLC). Later, novel supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods were developed for high-throughput chiral separation and stereospecific assay, respectively (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Nie et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). On the other hand, epigoitrin and goitrin were verified as breakdown products of their glucosinolate prototypes, epiprogoitrin ((R)-hydroxy-3-butenylglucosinolate) and progoitrin ((S)-hydroxy-3-butenylglucosinolate), on the effect of myrosinase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>

Different types of compounds have been isolated from this traditional medicine including alkaloids, lignans and flavonoids, etc. For the first time, antiviral effect and mode of action of glucosinolates and their biotransformed products from <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> were discussed in this study.</p><p id="p0250">Two pairs of enantiomers, namely epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin, were prepared from <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> by chiral separation. First, CPE inhibition assays were designed in three different ways to examine their inhibitory effect against influenza virus strain A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) <italic>in vitro</italic>, and to determine at which stage they act in the viral replication cycle. The results indicated that the antiviral activity of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin was mainly attributed to their virucidal effect, but not action on host cell protection or post-virus-adsorption interruption. Virus, rather than cell, was more probably to be the action target of the components. Hence, further insight into the antiviral activity <italic>in ovo</italic> was performed by hemagglutination test on the allantoic fluid of embryonated eggs. In agreement with previous observations, the four components were all found to significantly reduce viral titer in chicken embryos when mixed with virus before infection.

</p><p id="p0255">For a deeper understanding of the mechanism of the antiviral action, the effect of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin on hemagglutinin and neuraminidase was evaluated by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay and neuraminidase inhibition (NA) assay. Influenza virus is an enveloped RNA virus with hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) embedded in the lipid envelope. Viral adsorption to cells is the initial step of influenza infection, which is performed via the binding between sialic acid on the cell surface and hemagglutinin of the virus (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Skehel and Wiley, 2000</xref>). Results of HAI assay showed that exposure to epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin or goitrin did not affect the hemagglutinin activity of H1N1 virus. The components were indicated not to interfere with the binding of sialic acid and hemagglutinin. On the other hand, for the release of the influenza virus from the cell, NA functions as an enzyme cleaving sialic acid groups from the host glycoproteins (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2008</xref>). Epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin were found to exert low inhibition rates on neuraminidase by a NA inhibition assay. The components were indicated not able to prevent budding of progeny virus from the cell membrane. Therefore, it is implied that epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin play their antiviral activity by acting as virus neutralizers, which associate with some component on the viral envelope without interfering with viral adsorption or budding.</p><p id="p0260">Based on the IC<sub>50</sub> values obtained from CPE inhibition assay, the activity of the compounds <italic>in vitro</italic> was in the order of progoitrin&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;goitrin&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;epigoitrin&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;epiprogoitrin. Comprehensive comparison of the minimum concentrations exhibiting 100% inhibition and the inhibition rate at a minimum investigated concentration of 0.625&#x000a0;mg/mL obtained from HA assay on embryonated eggs, the activity of the compounds <italic>in ovo</italic> was in the similar order of progoitrin&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;goitrin&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;epigoitrin&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;epiprogoitrin. When comparing the potency of the antiviral activity between the monomers, no remarkable difference was found between the precursor and the myrosinase-derived product (epiprogoitrin vs. epigoitrin and progoitrin vs. goitrin). On the contrary, considerable discrepancy was observed between the enantiomers (epiprogoitrin vs. progoitrin and epigoitrin vs. goitrin). The gap between the antiviral potency of progoitrin and epiprogoitrin was larger than that between goitrin and epigoitrin. S-enantiomers (progoitrin and goitrin) claimed higher activity than R-enantiomers (epiprogoitrin and epigoitrin). It is implied that the heteroaromatic chain/ring is the main functional group of the <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> derived glucosinolates isomers and their breakdown products. And cyclization of the heteroaromatic chain to the oxazoline ring has no obvious influence on the function. The stereogenic center (chiral carbon atom) in the heteroaromatic chain of epiprogoitrin and progoitrin and in the oxazoline ring of epigoitrin and goitrin is an important structural feature from both chemical and biological points of view. Lucky enough, all the components were found to be safe both to the cells and the embryos.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0265">In conclusion, experimental results indicated that epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin, the <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> derived glucosinolates isomers and their breakdown products, could neutralize the influenza virus strain A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), thus exhibiting anti-viral efficacy <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in ovo</italic>. The finding enriched the pharmacology and the mechanism for research and development of <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic>, the most common traditional medicine used for treating influenza. Further mechanistic studies implied that the above components had no inhibitory effect on hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Thus, the attachment to the viral envelope without disturbing viral adsorption or budding to host cells was suggested to contribute critically to the mode of antiviral action of the components. Potential activity on other influenza virus targets like endonuclease, viral polymerase, nucleoprotein or M2 protein needs future exploration. With accurate anti-viral efficacy and low toxicity, epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin from <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> are expected to be used as promising antiviral drug resources. Consequently, further validation including <italic>in vivo</italic> evaluation and clinical trials are required before introducing them from the research into practical application. However, whether the glucosinolates and their enzymatic hydrolysates could inhibit other influenza viruses or not is unknown and the molecular mechanism still needs to be clarified by further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Author contributions</title><p id="p0270">Lixing Nie and Yanlin Wu designed and carried out the experiments, analyzed the data, and wrote the manuscript.
