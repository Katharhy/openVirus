<p id="p0230">In agreement with results of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> test, epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin failed to exhibit prevention or treatment effect against influenza virus A (H1N1) in 
 <italic>ovo</italic>. However, when the chicken embryos were treated with the pre-mixed solutions of the samples at a concentration of 5 mg/mL and the virus, their allantoic fluid showed no HA effect on CRBCs. As shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> , 
 <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> derived glucosinolate isomers and their breakdown products were all found to neutralize influenza virus A (H1N1) in a dose dependent manner. The minimum concentrations for epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin exhibiting significant inhibition (100% inhibition rate) were 5.0, 0.625, 1.25 and 1.25 mg/mL, respectively. At the minimum investigated concentration of 0.625 mg/mL, the inhibition rate for epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin were 0, 100%, 25% and 50%, respectively. At all the concentrations, the components were found to be safe.
