<p id="p0185">A U-bottom 96 well microtiter plate was labeled horizontally 1:2 to 1:128 dilutions. Using a multi-channel pipette, 50 μL of PBS was added to all the wells. 50 μL of allantoic fluid was added to the first well of each row and only PBS is added to the last row. Two-fold dilutions were made by transferring 50 μL from the first well of each column. This was done until the last column and the remaining 50 μL was discarded. 50 μL of 0.6% Leghorn chicken red blood cells (CRBCs) were added to all the wells and were mixed by manual agitation to the plates thoroughly. The plates were incubated for 60 min at room temperature. If the CRBCs formed a button or a ring at the bottom of the wells, it was recorded as negative using a “-” symbol. If hemagglutination occurred, CRBCs were agglutinated and immobilized, it was considered positive and recorded using a “+” symbol. The highest dilution of virus that caused complete hemagglutination was considered as the end-point in HA titration. The results were recorded according to the HA effect of the well at 1:16 dilution. Eggs that still alive were scored as survival and eggs showing no HA activity were scored as negative.</p>
