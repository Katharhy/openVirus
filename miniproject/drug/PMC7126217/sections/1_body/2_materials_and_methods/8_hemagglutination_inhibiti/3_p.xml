<p id="p0200">For hemagglutination (HA) titration, six embryonated chicken eggs were inoculated with 0.1 mL of influenza virus strain A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) (50 EID
 <sub>50</sub>) and incubated at 35 °C for 4 days. The amnio-allantoic fluid (AAF) was harvested from the live embryos and diluted with PBS from 2
 <sup>0</sup> to 2
 <sup>11</sup> for virus replication by the HA assay. Each diluted viral solution was mixed with an equal volume (25 μL) of 0.6% suspension of Leghorn chicken red blood cells (CRBCs) and incubated at 4 °C 25 μL of undiluted virus and PBS were used as the positive and the negative control, respectively. After 60 min, hemagglutination titer was determined. The highest dilution to cause complete agglutination in the HA assay was 128, which was labeled as the hemagglutination titer of the virus.
