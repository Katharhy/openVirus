<p id="p0205">For the hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay, 4 times of the hemagglutination titer (1:32) was used as the standardized hemagglutinin viral solution. 1:1 to 1:128 dilutions of the 5 mg/mL stock solutions of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin were prepared with PBS, respectively. Equal volumes (25 μL) of the standardized hemagglutinin viral solution and the sample solutions were mixed gently and incubated at room temperature for 30 min 25 μL of the standardized hemagglutinin viral solution and PBS were used as the positive and the negative control, respectively. Then, 25 μL of 0.6% suspension of CRBCs was added to the mixtures and incubated at 4 °C for 60 min. Finally, hemagglutination inhibition effect of the components was observed. The experiment was performed in duplicate for each dilution ratio.</p>
