<p id="p0070">This all changed when Gimano Amatngalim, who develops airway culture models in my lab, triggered me the next day: “Jeff, we should do something with Corona.” I realized that the essential experiments during lockdown should focus on SARS-CoV-2. We could exploit our airway culture models—in the past three months we screened 1500 drugs in 5 patient airway organoids—to study respiratory virus infections. What followed were exciting new collaborations and a rush to set up SARS-CoV-2 infections in our airway models that involved half of the lab staff. I find it highly exciting how the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is bringing scientists together in exploring solutions for this urgent clinical need.</p>
