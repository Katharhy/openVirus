<p id="p0080">We met late on a Friday night via Twitter, at the end of a hectic week when most Canadian research labs shut down due to COVID-19. Guillaume, the bioinformatics director of the McGill University Genome Centre, had noticed that Canadian COVID-19 researchers were struggling to find collaborators and key resources. Tara, an infectious diseases researcher at the University of Toronto, had noticed that early national mobilization of scientists to work on COVID-19 diagnostics was central to the successful German and South Korean responses, but was not happening in Canada. We had independently begun building tools to help the Canadian scientific response to COVID-19 by collecting research resources and scientific volunteers. By the next day, courtesy of Twitter, we had met ∼20 academic, government, and private web developers; science communicators; bioinformaticians; and graduate and medical students and formed COVID-19 Resources Canada. Our grassroots organization is now an ∼4,500 volunteer network that facilitates coordination and scientific capacity-building for Canadian public health, research, and grassroots COVID-19 responses, together with CanCOVID, a Slack community for Canadian COVID-19 researchers. In epidemics, proactive, rapid response is crucial. We try to meet this need with the tools each of us has at hand.</p>
