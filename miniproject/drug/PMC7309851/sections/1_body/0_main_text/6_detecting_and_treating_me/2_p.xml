<p id="p0090">The COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for research efforts to understand its mental health impact and develop new treatment strategies for survivors, family members, and frontline healthcare workers. Many healthcare workers in highly affected areas are likely to develop symptoms of depression, anxiety, and trauma. In the short term, it will be essential to delineate the scope of COVID-related psychiatric syndromes, track their trajectories over time, and identify modifiable risk factors for informing interventions. In the long term, these studies could also present new opportunities to advance our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying stress-related psychiatric disorders and develop better treatments. It will be critical to characterize the neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 infection and determine whether they are driven directly by viral invasion of the brain or by systemic intermediaries. Stress-related mood and anxiety disorders are usually episodic conditions, waxing and waning over time, yet it is unclear how mood, anxiety, and trauma symptoms evolve and why some individuals are affected while others are spared. Indeed, the molecular and circuit-level mechanisms underlying the induction, maintenance, and recovery from stress-induced affective episodes are largely unknown. Answering these questions will be critical for optimizing existing treatments and designing novel interventions that are accessible, scalable, and tailored to at-risk populations.</p>
