<p id="p0045">Measures implemented to care for COVID-19 patients and to mitigate viral transmission have affected all patients. For those seeking gender-affirming surgery (GAS), the negative impact can be greatly magnified. Health care team members may unknowingly contribute to this with inadvertently stressful language. From a surgeon's perspective, scheduled surgery is “elective” (not “urgent” or “emergent”), an anxiety-provoking word that insurers use when declining coverage. Surgeries may appear in the medical record as “canceled”—an unfortunate misnomer. Providers should assure patients that surgeries are delayed, not canceled. Insurance is also a source of anxiety. Concerns that prior authorization might expire are compounded for those seeking GAS, given burdensome authorization requirements. Support documents from multiple providers might need to be resubmitted, which can be challenging due to delays in getting appointments, appointment cost, or providers no longer practicing in the area. Staff should proactively request authorization extensions. For genital GAS, potential stress relates to medically necessary hair removal. Service locations have been closed, and a delay in hair removal can further delay surgery. Health care team members have capacity to acknowledge and address stressors to improve patients' health and wellbeing. Other useful interventions include online video support groups and telehealth visits. Staying informed and sharing information about new online resources is another way that team members can offer support; see
