<p id="par0165">Due to their strong primary pharmacology we have excluded psychoactive compounds and antiarrhythmics from our further analyses, as we think that these compounds, with strong effects on brain and hearth, are not suitable for repurposing for fighting viral infections. There is a strong possibility that they may cause rather specific and possibly dangerous side effects if needed to be given at higher doses than what is needed for their primary indication. It would, however, be important to know whether chronic use of antidepressants, or any other CADs, can in a positive or negative manner affect the activity of antiviral CADs. It is possible they may function as protection against viral infection, but conversely, in chronic use the body may adapt to constant exposure to lysosomotropic drugs, rendering CAD antivirals less effective. More research is needed on the effects of chronic usage of lysosomotropic drugs on antiviral activity of drugs exploiting the CAD mode of action.</p>
