 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, all data marked green are in favour of the compound having lysosomotropic behaviour which may result in antiviral effects. In addition to the initial three inclusion criteria, we have considered beneficial and marked compounds which have physiological charge higher or equal 1, and one or more tertiary nitrogen atoms, which are the most common structural features of CADs [
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Also marked were data on logP between 2 and 5, which indicates the capability of the compound to enter cells 
 <italic>via</italic> diffusion through the membrane in neutral form, in addition to the ability of binding to the membrane [
 <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Pharmacokinetic parameters, volume of distribution higher than 10 L kg
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup> and half-life in blood/plasma equal or higher than 10 h, are also marked green as they indicate that the compound in its original form accumulates in tissues 
 <italic>in vivo,</italic> and remains in the organism for a longer period [
