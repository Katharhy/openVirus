<p id="par0215">At the moment, there are more than 10 CADs currently being tested in numerous ongoing clinical trials on COVID-19, with chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin being most widely studied. FDA has recently revoked the emergency use authorization (EUA) to use hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat COVID-19 outside clinical trials due to the lack of efficacy, and due to marked toxicity findings in patient populations treated in clinical trials so far [

 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In addition, other well known CADs are also being clinically tested, such as amiodarone, fluoxetine, chlorpromazine and fluvoxamine, but also other drugs with possible CAD properties such as imatinib, bromhexine, formoterol [

The number of clinical trials and diversity of test protocols will hopefully make it feasible to get a better picture in near future on potential clinical value of these compounds as broad spectrum antivirals and open door to the development of new safer CADs for antiviral purpose.
