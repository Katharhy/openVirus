<p id="par0185">530 drugs and compounds have been included in the analysis: 447 compounds with known potential to induce phospholipidosis (either positive or negative), 20 drugs with unknown or unclear phospholipidosis results and 63 additional antiviral drugs without phospholipidosis data (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). All compounds were analysed by our 
 <italic>in silico</italic> QSAR model for prediction of cellular accumulation, which than resulted in 103 compounds passing both phospholipidosis and accumulation criteria, 9 compounds passing ACC criterion with unknown phospholipidosis data, 24 compounds passing ACC criterion but not phospholipidosis, and 112 passing phosholipidosis criterion but not accumulation prediction. Compounds were then additionally filtered according to their pKa values and primary pharmacology, to find compounds less likely to induce serious side effects when used for a different indication than what they were developed for. This resulted in total of 26 drugs with potential for repurposing for viral infections due to the high likelihood of exhibiting antiviral effects as lysosomotropic drugs. Among drugs that failed in either phospholipidosis or accumulation criterion there are 10 compounds which passed other criteria and can be considered as additional drugs that may possibly induce the same effects.
