<p id="par0145">Apart from these potential beneficial antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects, it is important to be aware of potential safety issues linked to lysosomotropic drugs. CADs are often, but not always, linked to liver- and cardiotoxic effects [

 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. SAR studies on hERG channel indicate that increasing basicity of many compounds increases the chance to block the channel resulting in cardiotoxicity [
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Despite these effects, these drugs are still widely used, and several of them were true blockbusters not so long ago, for example antibacterial azithromycin, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) antidepressants fluoxetine, citalopram and sertraline, as well as well-known antimalarial drug chloroquine. In repurposing for viral infections, additional types of toxicity may arise from their primary pharmacological targets, as they were developed to treat completely different diseases. We believe, however, that by careful analysis of pharmacological and toxicological properties of lysosomotropic CADs, new drugs among existing ones could be found that may be reasonably safe during short term treatment, at least for a group of COVID-19 patients that do not have pre-existing heart and liver conditions.
