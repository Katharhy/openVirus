<p id="par0115">The impact of lysosomotropic drug accumulation on cells is obvious: lysosomes increase in volume [
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], lysosomal function is impaired leading to downregulation of autophagy [
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], endocytosis and the entire membrane trafficking in the cell is reduced [
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Lysosomal and endosomal pH increases as a consequence of the overload of basic compounds [
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Due to the cationic drug binding to phospholipid bilayer and change of the surface bilayer charge, the degradation of phospholipids is slowed [
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] resulting in the accumulation of excess phospholipid membrane and vesicles inside the cell, which may lead to an adverse effect known as phospholipidosis [
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. If not too extreme, all these effects on cells are reversible upon the cessation of drug treatment [
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].
