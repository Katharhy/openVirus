<p id="par0120">In our previous studies on a set of 47 compounds we have shown that the extent of lysosomotropic accumulation in cells correlates with the compoundâ€™s extent of induction of phospholipidosis and lysosomal swelling [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The correlation is so apparent that it is even possible to determine the level of accumulation from the intensity of either of these processes caused by a drug. Strong correlation with accumulation was also shown for the inhibition of autophagy on a smaller set of compounds. Finally, accumulation in cells was also shown to correlate with their extent of binding to layers of phosphatidyl choline, the most abundant phospholipid in biological membranes [
