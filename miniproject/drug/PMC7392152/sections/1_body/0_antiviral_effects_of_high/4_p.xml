<p id="par0105">The mentioned drugs, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, highly accumulate in lysosomes/endosomes and their membranes, reaching about 100-fold higher intracellular than their extracellular concentration [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and thus belong to a group of lysosomotropic compounds (compounds that accumulate in lysosomes). We propose that the antiviral activity of (hydroxy)chloroquine and azithromycin is shared among all strong lysosomotropic drugs and is a consequence of their extremely high accumulation in cells and membranes, and subsequently of all the processes affected by this pharmacokinetic property.
