<p id="par0130">The evidence supporting antiviral activity of lysosomotropic cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) are described in various reports on individual drugs and have been extensively summarized by Salata et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Chloroquine and amiodarone have so far been amongst the most widely studied CADs for their antiviral effects. A recent review on broad spectrum antiviral agents, summarized the data on antiviral activity of various drugs in the Drugvirus database [

Even though the database is logically enriched in antiviral drugs, there are more than 20 CADs registered for various non-viral indications listed in the database with collected evidence of their broad antiviral activity 
 <italic>in vitro, in vivo</italic> and in clinical studies, including activities on coronaviruses, influenza, zika and ebola virus. Among listed drugs with antiviral effects, the CADs include: psychoactive drugs (chlorpromazine, fluoxetine, clomipramine); antiarrhythmics (amiodarone); antimalarials (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, amodiaquine, mefloquine, quinacrine); channel blockers (amiodarone, verapamil, manidipine); antibacterial (azithromycin); estrogen receptor modulators (tamoxifen, raloxifene, toremifene); two antivirals, the only ones known to utilize CADs mechanism of antiviral action 
 <italic>via</italic> the inhibition of endosomal pathway (arbidol (umifenovir) and tilorone (with additional activity of interferon induction)) [
