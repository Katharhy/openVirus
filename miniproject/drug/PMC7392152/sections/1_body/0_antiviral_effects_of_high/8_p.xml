<p id="par0125">The importance of intracellular membranes in coronavirus infection is immense. Firstly, viruses enter the cell by formation of membrane vesicles â€“ endosomes, and subsequently enter cytoplasm through the endosomal membrane (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). During the assembly of new virion particles, the virus is taking a portion of the membrane of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to pack the RNA in a lipid envelope enriched with transmembrane proteins. New virions are then packed in an exocytic membrane vesicle, which ultimately fuses with the plasma membrane and releases virions outside of cells [

Therefore, it is conceivable that a drug that is heavily bound to cellular membranes, negatively affects the viral life cycle, if not even the structure of its lipid envelope itself. Since the assembly of virions relies on electrostatic forces between the lipid envelope, their proteins, and RNA inside it, it is likely that the overload of cationic drug in the ER membrane, that viral lipid envelope is made of, leads to serious disturbances of virion structure.
