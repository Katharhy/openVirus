<p id="par0225">It will be critical in further investigations of lysosomotropic drugs to find out which administration regimens would be useful. Although evidence of their antiviral activities is mounting, it is still unclear at which stage of disease development endosomal pathway disruption could play the most important role and whether the efficacious level of any of these drugs can be achieved in the body without significant toxic effects. Moreover, it should be determined whether prior exposure to lysosomotropic drugs could help prevent the disease or, on the contrary, induce adaptations in the body and reduce the efficacy of antivirals with lysosomotropic mechanism. Defining target patient populations, based on disease status, drug safety profiles and other factors need to be carefully investigated. Answers to these crucial questions are required for assessing the potential of these drugs as broad-spectrum antivirals, suitable for repurposing to treat COVID-19 or any future viral infection epidemics.</p>
