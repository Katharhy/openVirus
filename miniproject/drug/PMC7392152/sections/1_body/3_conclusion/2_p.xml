<p id="par0220">In this study, we have analysed 530 compounds with the aim to find existing registered drugs which may be useful in combating current COVID-19 pandemics. Specifically, we were looking for drugs capable of accumulating in endosomes and membranes and thereby possessing inherent antiviral activity. The drugs were analysed based on their known physicochemical and pharmacokinetic data, in addition to our 
 <italic>in silico</italic> prediction of accumulation in lysosomes/endosomes. We have identified 26 drugs with high and 10 drugs with lower probability of showing antiviral effects due to their lysosomotropic behaviour. Broad spectrum antiviral activity has already been reported for some of these drugs and therefore, it is crucial to investigate their antiviral properties on SARS-CoV-2. Although they were not designed to be specific and may thus lack potency, these drugs may, either in combination or alone, be capable of reducing the extent of infection and helping patients avoid serious or long-term illness. Keeping in mind the low probability of finding a highly potent and specific antiviral drug for the ongoing pandemic, these drugs may represent at least a partial, but possibly one of the best antiviral pharmacotherapeutic solutions currently at hand.
