<p id="Par5">Surgical setting: caution should also be exercised during surgical procedures involving the upper respiratory tract including nasal endoscopy and lacrimal procedures as these are aerosol generating procedures (AGP) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Public Health England (PHE) has also included “surgery with high speed devices” as AGPs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Reports on evidence of virus-laden aerosol generation are published with orthopaedic and dental drills, however, there is lack of evidence on AGP properties of intraocular surgical instruments and no evidence of viral transmissibility from ocular or intraocular fluids especially as such instruments are used inside rather than on the surface of the eye [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The Royal College of Ophthalmologists with the British Eire Association of Vitreoretinal Surgeons (BEAVRS) and the United Kingdom &amp; Ireland Society of Cataract &amp; Refractive Surgeons [UKISCRS] have issued specific guidelines regarding pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and phacoemulsification procedures that employ instruments with high speed cut rates (phacoemulsification probes, vitrectomy cutters) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The guidance advises for suspension of non-elective surgeries and defines retinal detachment and cataract in the context of retinal detachment or glaucoma as urgent ophthalmic procedures. With due consideration to the unknown risk of infection, and a lack of conclusive evidence, the guidance recommends these procedures are seen as potential AGPs. However, further research is recommended regarding the need of Filtering Face Piece 3 (FFP3) respirators as well as eye protection by surgeons and scrub nurses while performing phacoemulsification cataract surgery and vitrectomy.
