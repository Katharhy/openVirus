<p id="Par4">Out-patient setting: the most likely route of transmission in ophthalmology is via aerosol spread of virus especially due to close proximity during eye examination (close contact defined as &lt;2 m, 30 min) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Breathing or speech generating aerosols (&lt;1 micron particle size) invisible to the naked eye are capable of carrying the virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], although fomite transmission is possible due to prolonged viability of virus on aerosols and surfaces [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Non-contact tonometry may generate microaerosols [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Transmission of respiratory viruses in hospital setting may also be aggravated by inadequate airflow, overcrowding, large temperature differences in rooms and rapid movement of air, which can increase the distance travelled by airborne particles [
