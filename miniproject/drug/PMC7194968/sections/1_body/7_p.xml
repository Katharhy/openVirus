<p id="para80">In sub-Saharan Africa, systems put in place to deal with HIV and the resourcefulness that characterises the health-care response might be a great asset in the fight against the new pandemic. And the experience in fighting for fair access to new treatments may be more relevant than ever in the coming weeks. In the short term, SARS-CoV-2 will draw attention away from HIV, disrupt treatment and prevention programmes, and may lead to a rise in disease burden and even HIV incidence as a result. HIV programme directors should use their experience and creativity to gather and disseminate data on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 at the individual, community, and national levels. Now is also the time to start thinking about how to rebuild and reshape the HIV response once the initial wave of COVID-19 is passed and nations learn to live with the dual pandemic.</p>
