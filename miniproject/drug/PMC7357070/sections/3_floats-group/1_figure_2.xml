  <p>KEGG pathways enriched in the genes associated with human proteins involved in both SARS-CoV-2–host and Dengue–host interactions. Each color represents an individual pathway. The size of each box reflects the number of proteins involved in that particular pathway. The number of proteins involved in each pathway is given in brackets.</p>
