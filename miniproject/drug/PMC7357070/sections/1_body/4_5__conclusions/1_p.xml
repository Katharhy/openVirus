<p>We demonstrated the usefulness of text and data mining techniques for finding human proteins involved in similar pathological processes involving well-known and novel viruses. We used the text and data mining techniques to identify possible molecular pathways common to two very distinct viruses, HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, as a case study. We extracted data for proteins related to the molecular mechanisms that may be essential for the development of the infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 and demonstrated the usefulness of such application. We found a few key proteins that are known to be associated with mechanisms related to both HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infections and to several different processes of pathogenesis, from virus entry to evasion of immune response and regulation of inflammation in the host. We considered the particular properties and molecular pathways that can be involved in different steps of HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infections. We provided a few examples of therapies targeting some of the identified proteins. We showed that even these unrelated viruses can share the same human proteins and regulatory pathways, which should be taken into account for the development of treatment strategies based on existing drugs. We believe that the suggested approach can be used to select known drugs to be applied against novel viruses on the basis of shared regulatory pathways and protein targets.</p>
