<p>By a literature review and a pathway enrichment analysis, we identified some key proteins and pathways which may be proposed as essential for both SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 infections. For instance, the protein AIP4 may play a role in inflammation, and the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with this protein may downregulate the host’s interferon response [
