<p>Some proteins, such as interferon gamma, interferon regulator factor 3, interleukin 2, matrix metalloproteinases, are responsible for the immune response or inflammation [

 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-02944" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Therefore, these proteins should be involved in specific or non-specific antiviral or inflammatory response. An increase of interleukins in the blood plasma occurs in response to the infection, especially it can be observed during viral infections. SARS-CoV-2 affects the immune response, leading to a significant increase of chemokines and cytokines. To combat the cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19, several anti-rheumatic medicines, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, as well as JAK inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, IL-1 inhibitors, anti-TNF-Î± agents, and corticosteroids are considered [
