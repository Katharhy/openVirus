<p>The genes encoding the proteins presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02944-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> are expressed widely or ubiquitously. Therefore, they can participate in similar pathways during both SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 infections, despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 use different cell types for their replication, which indicates different molecular basis for the progression of their associated diseases. Most of the proteins identified are 
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> proteins. For them, similar or identical molecular mechanisms of pathological processes during HIV-1 and COVID-19 can be proposed. This observation confirms the reliability of our approach for the extraction of data on proteins involved in the interaction of the host with either SARS-CoV-2 or HIV-1.
