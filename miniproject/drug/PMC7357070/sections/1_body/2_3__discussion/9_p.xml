<p>Pathway enrichment analysis can help to identify a role of some signaling pathways in both HIV-1 ad SARS-CoV-2 infection. To perform the pathway enrichment analysis, first we manually mapped the initial entities, extracted by text mining, to UniProt Accession numbers. This process allowed us to collect a list of 46 human proteins. The Toll-like receptor-signaling pathway has the highest number of proteins related to immune system pathways and found to appear in both SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 infections (
