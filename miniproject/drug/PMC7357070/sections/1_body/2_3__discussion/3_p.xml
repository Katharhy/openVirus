<p>The proteins cathepsin B and L, which are endosomal proteases, are responsible for viral fusion and the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm of human cells [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-02944" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The dependence of SARS-CoV-2 entry on cathepsin B was shown in the study by Hoffman et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-02944" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and discussed in also elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-02944" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-02944" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This process was shown to be pH-dependent. Divani et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-02944" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] suggested that the Spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 can be “primed” by cathepsins B and L, which is essential for their penetration into the cells. In the study by Yoshii. et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-02944" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], the authors claimed that cathepsin B is involved in CD4-independent entry of HIV-1, i.e., this type of entry can be used by HIV-1 variants that do not require CD4 for infection [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-02944" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. There is evidence that an interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with cathepsin L is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-02944" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Selective inhibitors of cathepsin L can be considered for the therapy of COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-25-02944" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The authors suggest the usage of selective cathepsin L inhibitors because active cathepsin S can assist viral release and MHC-I- and MHC-II-mediated antigen presentation as well as T-cell activation, which is important for protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and other infections. It is interesting that for herpesviruses, the role of cathepsin L in releasing viral particles was reported [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-25-02944" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], giving rise to the hypothesis that therapeutic strategies directed to inhibiting pathways associated with cathepsin L can be beneficial for non-specific antiviral activity. Cathepsin B is also associated with the release of HIV-1 particles in blood monocyte-derived macrophages [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-02944" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Additionally, it was shown that secretion of cathepsin B by HIV-infected macrophages leads to neuronal internalization and induces the progression of neuronal dysfunctions [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-02944" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-25-02944" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Therefore, cathepsin B expressed in different tissues is involved in several different molecular pathways of disease progression.
