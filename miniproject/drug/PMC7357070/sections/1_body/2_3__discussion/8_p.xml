<p>When we manually checked about 100 named entities (NE), we found 10 NE; and the lexical meaning of them was not related to known proteins but it was associated with the biological object, such as a virus, an organism, etc. Therefore, about 90% of the proteins found using our text and data mining algorithm can be considered as potential targets involved in the pathogenesis of both SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 infections.</p>
