<p>Summarizing our findings based on the analysis of the literature and on data retrieved from biological databases, we can define groups of proteins, which can be essential for both SARS-CoV-2-host and HIV-1-host interactions. The first group represents proteins responsible for viral entry in human cells, which are the same for HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 as well as for some other viruses. The second group of proteins is associated with the host’s immune response to virus invasion of the cells; HIV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 interaction with these host proteins will lead to immune suppression. In addition, there are a few proteins that were found in just one or two publications but are important for processes such as blood coagulation. Third, some viral proteins can interact with human proteins in a close manner or share some similar structural motifs and can have the same effect on protein–host interaction. </p>
