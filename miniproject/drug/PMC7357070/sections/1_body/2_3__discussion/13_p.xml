<p>The obtained results were confirmed by disease enrichment analysis based on geneâ€“disease associations using the DisGeNet database. We manually analyzed the top 30 enriched disease terms and classified them in four groups (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-02944">Supplementary Materials, Figure S1</xref>). The first group includes 12 terms related to viruses and bacteria, e.g., SARS, HIV infections, hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus infections, influenza, tuberculosis, and others. The second group is related to inflammatory respiratory diseases: asthma, chronic obstructive airway disease, and pneumonia. The third group is related to cancer diseases, whereas the fourth group includes all other diseases, which are associated with inflammation, e.g., atherosclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis. All 46 proteins appeared to be associated with at least one of the selected diseases, and the cytokines CXCL8, IL6, TNF were associated with all of them.
