<p>Overcoming the challenges of novel viral infections requires a fast and effective search for novel therapeutic approaches. A perspective strategy is focused on finding proteins involved in the infection process caused by both studied and well-known agents using published articles and other available information. The identified proteins can then be used as pharmaceutical targets. In this study, we aimed at evaluating such approach by considering the extensively explored HIV-1 virus [
