<p>The analysis of the available information provides (1) data on repurposing of antiretroviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2, (2) data showing similarity of interaction profiles between SARS-CoV-2 and human and HIV-1-human, (3) data indicating common pathophysiological mechanisms between SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 infections. In addition, there are a lot of data on the molecular mechanisms of HIV infection, regarding multiple pathways of virusâ€“host interactions and the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Text and data mining approaches can be helpful for fast and accurately extracting information about chemical compounds and their biological activities, as well as proteins associated with molecular mechanisms of disease development [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-02944" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this study, we applied text and data mining approaches to identify possible molecular pathways shared by HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Our hypothesis was that the search for similar molecular mechanisms shared by SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 could shed light on novel potential therapeutic approaches for the treatment of COVID-19.
