<p>After the extraction of the sets of proteins using all the corpora, we automatically compared them and identified overlapping proteins. According to our hypothesis, the proteins found in both sets of texts that were relevant (a) to HIV-1–host interactions and (b) to SARS-host and SARS-CoV-2–host interactions can influence the pathways and molecular mechanisms responsible for infection, invasion, and disease progression similarly or identically for HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2.</p>
