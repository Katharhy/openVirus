<p>In the first stage, we collected abstracts and full texts from NCBI PubMed and NCBI PubMed Central (PMC) repositories. We used the application-programming interface (API) available for PubMed and PMC, based on query allowing automated filtering of relevant papers. PubMed contains over 27 million articles, and PMC includes several million articles; for some of them (the so-called Open Access (OA) subset), it is possible to retrieve full texts in a machine-readable format (Extensible Markup Language, XML). We used PubMed and the Open Access Subset of PMC for our computational experiments. Relevant documents were selected based on the following combination of keywords: “HIV-1 AND virus–host interactions”, “SARS AND virus–host interactions,” “SARS-CoV-2 AND virus–host interactions”. The queries were built using Python 3.7 scripts. We obtained the list of the identifiers of articles in PubMed electronic library (PMIDs) or the identifiers of NCBI PubMed Central (PMCIDs). The queries allowed identifying over 200 PMIDs and over 6000 PMIDs in the PubMed database relevant to SARS–host and SARS-CoV-2-host interactions and HIV1–host interactions, respectively. We named these corpora of texts as “SARS-PubMed” and “HIV-PubMed”. Over 180 PMCIDs were retrieved for SARS–host and SARS-CoV-2–host interactions, and over 57,000 PMCIDs were collected for HIV-1–host interactions using an automated query (the “SARS-PMC” and “HIV-PMC” corpora). We excluded reviews from further consideration. Using PubMed API, we collected the texts of over 6200 abstracts of PubMed and over 38,000 full texts of original articles in XML.</p>
