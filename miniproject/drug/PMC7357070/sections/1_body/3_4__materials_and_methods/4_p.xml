<p>The collected corpora of abstracts were processed using Lingpipe-4.1.2 named entity algorithm trained on GENIA corpus [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-25-02944" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. For evaluating the average accuracy of recognition, we applied five-fold cross-validation based on the corpus used for training the algorithm and an external test set “HIV-RT-inhibitor corpus” containing 250 abstracts. The average precision for Lingpipe-4.1.2 was 0.84%, the recall was 0.79.
