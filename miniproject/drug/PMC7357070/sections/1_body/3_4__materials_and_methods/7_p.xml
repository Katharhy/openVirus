<p>To identify signaling pathways, first we manually mapped the initial entities, which were extracted by text-mining, to UniProt Accession numbers and obtained a list of 46 human proteins. Pathways enriched with 46 genes, were identified from the KEGG database [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-02944" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] using the “Enrichr” R package. We selected pathways which included at least 3 genes from the 46 ones and adjusted the 
 <italic>p</italic>-value to less than 0.05. Visualization of the list of pathways was performed using the “Treemap” R package. Additionally, we identified diseases associated with 46 genes using Enrichr and gene–disease associations using the DisGeNet database (
