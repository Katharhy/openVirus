<p>We used the automatically collected abstracts for the corpora “SARS-PubMed” and “HIV-PubMed” and the full texts collected for the corpora “SARS-PMC” and “HIV-PMC”. The texts represented in XML format were processed to save only the Materials and Methods, Results or Results and Discussion sections; the Introduction section was excluded. We used the abstracts of the “SARS-HIV-PubMed” corpus in the current study because the license agreement restricts the availability of full texts. It does not lead to a collection of unbiased corpora (i.e., corpora which are not limited by using several journals). Full texts of SARS-PMC and HIV-PMC were used for data extraction.</p>
