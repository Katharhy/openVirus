<p>The final set of proteins was checked using the UniProt API [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-25-02944" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-25-02944" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Only proteins found in UniProt and associated with 
 <italic>Homo Sapiens</italic>, SARS-CoV-2, HIV-1 were saved in the list of proteins, which we analyzed further. The manual inspection of the proteins selected was carried out using NCBI PubMed electronic library and the UniProt, Protein Atlas, and Integrity databases.
