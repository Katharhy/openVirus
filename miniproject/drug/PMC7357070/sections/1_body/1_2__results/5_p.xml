<p>The significant number of signaling pathways related to the immune system and the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway included the largest number of proteins identified. There were several pathways related to various viruses. This means that some of the 46 proteins are involved in pathways shared by SARS-CoV-2, HIV-1, and other viruses. This result was confirmed by a disease enrichment analysis, which was performed based on geneâ€“disease associations using the DisGeNet database [
