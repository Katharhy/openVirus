<p>To check whether other viruses have similar interactomic profiles to that of SARS-CoV-2, we also evaluated texts associated with Dengue virus and determined an overlap between the proteins relevant to Dengue–host interactions and those relevant to SARS–CoV-2–host interactions. We found 32 human proteins, which can be involved in both SARS-CoV-2–host and Dengue–host interactions. For them, we prepared a list of related pathways. We observed a similar profile of molecular pathways for proteins shared by Dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2 to that for proteins shared by HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 (
