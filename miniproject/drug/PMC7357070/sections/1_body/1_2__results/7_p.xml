<p>Nevertheless, we found differences in the number of pathways related to the immune system, in particular in the number of proteins associated with the Toll-like receptors-related pathway; this is consistent with other studies showing the involvement of the immune system in SARS-CoV-2 disease progression [

Also, some of the pathways, for instance, necrosis, apoptosis, and autophagy pathways, common to SARS-CoV-2–host and HIV-1–host interactions were not found in the list of pathways related to SARS-CoV-2–host and Dengue–host interactions. This information on proteins involved in the interactions between various viruses and the human organism can be helpful for the future development of therapeutic strategies against these viruses.
