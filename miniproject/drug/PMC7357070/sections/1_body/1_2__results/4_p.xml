<p>Besides the interpretation of the role of individual proteins in SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 infections, we performed KEGG [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-02944" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] pathway enrichment analysis using genes related to the human proteins found in UniProt: we obtained 46 proteins (see Materials and Methods). Then, we manually inspected the positions of the genes in the maps of enriched pathways and filtered out non-relevant pathways. For example, the FoxO signaling pathway was identified by the enrichment analysis, but FOXO transcriptional factors were not among those 46 proteins; thus, we considered the pathway as non-relevant. Finally, we obtained a list of 27 pathways (
