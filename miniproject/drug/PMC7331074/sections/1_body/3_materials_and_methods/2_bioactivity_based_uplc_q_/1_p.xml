<p>A Waters Acquity UPLC instrument system (Waters Co., USA) was used to separate the SFJD sample, which was equipped with a 2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.7 μm BEH C18 column (Waters, UK). The column temperature was maintained at 30 °C and UV detection was performed over the range of 190–400 nm. The mobile phases A and B were acetonitrile and water with 0.1% formic acid, respectively. The flow rate was 0.4 mL/min, the injection volume was 10 μL and the gradient duration program was as follows: 0–2 min, 2% A; 2–12 min, 2–15% A; 12–15 min, 15% A; 15–18 min, 15–20% A; 18–35 min, 20–50% A; and 35–40 min, 50–100% A. The mass spectrum was acquired with a Waters Q-TOF Premier coupled to an electrospray ionization source (Waters MS Technologies, Manchester, UK) in both the negative and positive ion voltage modes. The MS acquisition range was from 50 to 1500

The capillary voltage was 2.5 kV for the negative mode and 3.0 kV for the positive mode, and the sample cone voltage was 30 V, the collision energy was 5 eV, and the cone gas was 50 L/h. Leucine-enkephalinamide acetate (LEA, 200 ng/mL) was used as the lock mass (
