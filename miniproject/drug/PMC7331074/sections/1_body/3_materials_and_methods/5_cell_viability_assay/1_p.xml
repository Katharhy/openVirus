<p>Cell viability in all experiments was evaluated using the MTT method. Cells (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates (Corning Incorporated, USA). After incubating for 24 h, RAW264.7 cells were infected with influenza virus for 1 h and then the medium was removed, and RAW264.7 cells were added with serially diluted SFJD fractions, and all drugs were diluted in serum-free medium. After 24 h treatment, 20 μL/well MTT solution (5 mg/mL in PBS) was added, and the cells were further incubated for an additional 4 h. Formazan precipitates were dissolved with dimethyl sulfoxide (150 μL/well), and then, the absorbance was measured at 490 nm with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad model 680, O-524). The cell viability of normal groups (RAW264.7, NC group) was set at 100%, and the treated samples were normalized to this value (H1N1-infected RAW264.7 cells, H1N1 group). Cell viability according to the following equation: cell survival (%) = optical density (OD) of treated cells/OD of normal control × 100. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated as the concentration of SFJD causing the death of 50% of the cells.
