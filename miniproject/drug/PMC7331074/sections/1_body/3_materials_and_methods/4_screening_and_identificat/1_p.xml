<p>SFJD (One-gram weight) was extracted with 20 mL of 70% methanol using an Ultrasonic cleaner (40 kHz, 500 W, Ningbo, China) for 20 min at room temperature. The extract was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatants were filtered through a membrane filter (0.22 μm) for UPLC-TOF MS analysis. A total of 94 compounds of SFJD were identified and fingerprint chromatography including 22 mutual peaks was established with the similarity of more than 0.9.Related files and 94 chemical components in SFJD were also deposited in an online data repository as an attachment file (
