<p>Cells were washed twice with chilled PBS and then lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (Beijing Bey time Biotech Co., Ltd., Lot: 00021304) containing a protease inhibitor. Monomeric acrylamide/bisacrylamide solution (40%, 29:1), ammonium persulfate, and protein assay dye were from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Trypsin (modified, sequencing grade) was from Promega (Madison, WI). Water was obtained from a Milli-Q Ultrapure water purification system (Millipore, Billerica, MA). All experiments were repeated three times. The lysis solution was on ice for 30 min. Obtained cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4 °C to remove debris, and protein concentration in the supernatants was measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Beijing Bey time Biotech Co., Ltd., Lot: 00041305). Each sample was separated by denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a PVDF membrane by electrophoretic transfer. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk and 0.05% Tween-20 in Trisbuffered saline (TBST) and then incubated with the primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. After washing three times for 10 min, the PVDF membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG at room temperature for 2 h. The blots were visualized with the ECL reagent (GE Healthcare, Pisca-taway, NJ). The gel images were performed with the ChemiDoc XRS
 <sup>+</sup> analysis software.
