<p>In China, the combination of antiviral treatment, such as Tamiflu and traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), accounted for a large portion and was regarded to have unique advantage in treating EIDs to improve the clinical therapeutic effectiveness in virus prevention and control.

 </sup> The ShuFengJieDu capsule (SFJD), consisting of

 <italic>Radix bupleuri</italic>,

 <italic>Herba verbenae</italic>, 
 <italic>Rhizoma phragmitis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Radix glycyrrhizae</italic>, is one type of TCM for treating upper respiratory infection (URI) with symptoms of fever, sore throat, headache, and cough.

 </sup> A clinical study had demonstrated that administration of SFJD abates fever in an average time of 20.5 h, implying that SFJD had rapid and effective antipyretic action.

 </sup> In our previous study, we found that the presence of SFJD increased the partial pressure of oxygen in lung tissue, decreased lactic acid levels, and inhibited inflammatory factors such as IL-1β and TNF-α in acute lung injury rats. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Moreover, the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) has recommended SFJD for the treatment of patients with H1N1- and H5N9-induced flu based on its antiviral effect, but the detailed analysis involved in the component identification of SFJD is still lacking. Thus, it is essential to characterize the medicinal ingredients in SFJD, especially the active ingredients responsible for antiviral effects.
