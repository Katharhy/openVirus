<p>To characterize the potential effective components of each fraction from SFJD, the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) method was used to investigate the cell activity (the oseltamivir group was set up as the positive control). As shown in

 </xref>, the SFJD group (1 mg/mL) resulted in an increase in cell viability (76.34 ± 3.64%) compared to the H1N1 group. The cell relative viability of the oseltamivir group (0.8 mg/mL) was 93.34 ± 2.84% (normal control, RAW264.7 cell line, regarded as 100% cell relative viability). Among the fraction-treatment groups, cell viabilities in several groups, including forsythoside E (fractions no. 14, 57.03 ± 2.12%), verbenalin (fractions no. 19, 61.23 ± 4.42%), and emodin (fractions no. 64, 58.34 ± 7.14%), were significantly enhanced by about 50% (
