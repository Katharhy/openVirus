<p>The elemental compositions of the active ingredients in SFJD were identified based on the exact molecular weight, compared with data reported in the literature and natural product information references. Each compound was confirmed according to the retention time, MS, and MS/MS fragmentation data from previous studies. The UV chromatograms (254 nm), basic peak ion (BPI) chromatograms in positive/negative ESI modes, and 94 chemical components in SFJD had been shown in our previous study.

 </sup> To determine the proper concentration of SFJD for the further research, we measured its maximum nontoxic concentration. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>A, the maximum nontoxic concentration of SFJD was 500 μg/mL and the CC
 <sub>50</sub> of SFJD was 3064.2 ± 72.01 μg/mL. Oseltamivir was served as a positive control. Its nontoxic concentration was 125 μg/mL and CC
 <sub>50</sub> was 397.2 ± 9.42 μg/mL (

 </xref>B). SFJD fractions between UPLC and MS had been subdivided into 80 fractions which were collected into 96-well plates every 0.5 min, followed by evaporating to dryness. Then, 200 μL of the cell culture medium was added to dissolve these residues.
