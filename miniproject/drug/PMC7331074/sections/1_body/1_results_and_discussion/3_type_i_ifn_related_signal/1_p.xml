<p>The dysregulated core regulators in forsythoside E-, verbenalin-, or emodin-treated groups were integrated according to the related signals in antivirus and immune mechanism. Through analyzing the abovementioned data, we found that Type I IFN-related signals occupied a lot of proportion in a variety of signal categories. Type I IFNs are the major line of host defense against viruses and other microorganisms. Viral RNA activates signaling cascades through a number of pattern recognition receptor (PRR)–adaptor protein pairs, including RIG-I–MAVS, cGAS-STING, and TLR3/4-TRIF (toll-like receptors 3 and 4).

 </sup> Type I IFNs are regulated by IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), nuclear factor kappa B subunit p65 (NF-κB
 <sub>p65</sub>), and several intracellular signaling molecules, which are activated by PRRs.

 </sup> Type I IFNs are essential for immune defense against viruses by inducing the expression of interferon-stimulated genes and then suppressing the replication and spread of virus.

 </sup> Type I IFNs activate key components of the innate and adaptive immune systems, which are well-studied cytokines with antiviral and immune-modulating functions.
