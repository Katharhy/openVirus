<p>Here, key molecules (IRF3, MAPK, and NF-κB) mediating the Type I IFN response and MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathways were upregulated under H1N1 infection, while the increased trend was abrogated when H1N1-infected RAW264.7 cells were treated with SFJD. These results provide the first evidence for the effects of SFJD against H1N1 virus 
 <italic>via</italic> quantitative proteomics methods, suggesting that SFJD could mediate the protein phosphorylation levels of the H1N1-induced Type I IFNs and PRR signaling pathways to enhance its antiviral function
