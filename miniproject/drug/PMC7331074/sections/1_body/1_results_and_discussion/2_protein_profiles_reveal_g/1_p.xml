<p>To gain the insight into systemic responses to H1N1 virus infection in the absence or presence of forsythoside E, verbenalin, or emodin, we used a quantitative proteomics approach to reveal novel mechanisms of these active ingredients, respectively. The isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) approach was employed to analyze the protein changes in the three candidate ingredient (forsythoside E, verbenalin, and emodin)-treated groups. As shown in

 </xref>A, the workflow of the iTRAQ approach was used for the three candidate ingredients, respectively (forsythoside E, verbenalin, and emodin). Compared with those in the nontreated H1N1-infected RAW264.7 group, the expression levels of 105 proteins in the forsythoside E-treated group showed significant differences (63 upregulated and 42 downregulated) (

 </xref>B). To get a more precise analysis, we focused on the cell signals related with antivirus and immunoregulation in IPA core analysis. Taking the forsythoside E-treated group as an example, an overview of biological processes and signaling pathways in the forsythoside E-treated group is shown in

 </xref>C. Furthermore, based on our dataset, a total of 33 differentially expressed proteins fell into this “antivirus and immune-regulation” category (

These proteins were involved in IL-1/TNF-α signaling, JAK/STAT signaling, and MAPK signaling. In the antivirus- and immune-regulation-related pathway, three key proteins, NF-κβ, MAPK, and STAT1, were selected for the validations by the western blot method. The phosphorylated MAPK
 <sub>P38</sub>, STAT1, and NF-κB
 <sub>p65</sub> are the key signaling molecules in the Type I interferons (IFNs).

 </sup> To our knowledge, Type I IFNs are essential for immune defense against viruses.

 </sup> Macrophages infected by influenza virus can synthesize and release proinflammatory cytokines and IFNs, which further limit viral replication and spread.
