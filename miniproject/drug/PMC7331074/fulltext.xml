infectious diseases (EIDs) are a significant burden on
global economies and public health to any country in the world. With
the extensive application of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs)
for EID treatment, the underlying molecular mechanisms have caught
more attention than before. The ShuFengJieDu capsule (abbreviated
as SFJD) is a TCM prescription used for treating upper respiratory
infection (URI) with symptoms of fever, sore throat, headaches, nasal
congestion, and cough for more than 30 years in China. SFJD is also
widely used for the prevention and treatment of viral infectious diseases,
especially for the EIDs. In this study, a bioactivity-integrated method
of ultraperformance liquid chromatography quadrapole/time-of-flight
mass spectrometry combined with methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay
was applied to screen potential antivirus compounds in SFJD on the
H1N1-infected RAW264.7 cell models. Three compounds (forsythoside
E, verbenalin, and emodin) exert the advantages of protective effects
in cell vitality during H1N1 infection. The isobaric tags for relative
and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-coupled liquid chromatography
coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC&#x02013;MS/MS) analysis and
the subsequent quantitative proteome analysis were performed to investigate
the potential molecular mechanisms triggered by these three bioactive
compound-triggered molecular mechanisms in H1N1-infected RAW264.7
cells. Dysregulated proteins were involved in regulating the levels
of proinflammatory cytokines, the IFN (interferon)-stimulated gene
signal in the Type I IFN, TBK/IRF3, and MAPK/NF-&#x003ba;B signaling
pathways. In conclusion, we identified the main bioactive compounds
in SFJD exerting antiviral effects and illuminated that Type I IFN
and MAPK/NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathways are involved in the anti-H1N1
infection effects of SFJD. Our study not only provides solid theoretical
support for the clinic application of SFJD but also sheds light on
the novel research methods for TCM study.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ao0c01545</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ao0c01545</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epidemics associated
with emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are
now occurring in historically unprecedented numbers and emerging as
a significant burden on global economies and public health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> The current main class of antiviral drugs, such
as oseltamivir,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> zanamivir,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> and peramivir,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> was approved
for treating and preventing influenza worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> They comprise a certain chemical constituent and take advantage
of clear target and certain biological effects. Although antiviral
therapy is an important strategy for controlling influenza, the efficacy
depends on the timing of administration and is often limited by supply
shortage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Additionally, mutations of the
virus have also been found in previous studies to alter the binding
property of neuraminidase (NA) for the binding of oseltamivir, making
viral strains become resistant against these drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> Thus, more work
is still needed to develop new drugs which are simple, effective,
and accessible.</p><p>In China, the combination of antiviral treatment,
such as Tamiflu
and traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), accounted for a large portion
and was regarded to have unique advantage in treating EIDs to improve
the clinical therapeutic effectiveness in virus prevention and control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> The ShuFengJieDu capsule (SFJD), consisting
of <italic>Rhizoma polygoni cuspidati</italic>, <italic>Fructus forsythiae</italic>, <italic>Radix isatidis</italic>, <italic>Radix bupleuri</italic>, <italic>Herba
patriniae</italic>, <italic>Herba verbenae</italic>, <italic>Rhizoma phragmitis</italic>, and <italic>Radix glycyrrhizae</italic>, is one type of TCM for treating
upper respiratory infection (URI) with symptoms of fever, sore throat,
headache, and cough.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> A clinical study had demonstrated that administration
of SFJD abates fever in an average time of 20.5 h, implying that SFJD
had rapid and effective antipyretic action.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> In our previous study, we found that the presence of SFJD increased
the partial pressure of oxygen in lung tissue, decreased lactic acid
levels, and inhibited inflammatory factors such as IL-1&#x003b2; and
TNF-&#x003b1; in acute lung injury rats. However, the underlying mechanisms
remain largely unknown. Moreover, the China Food and Drug Administration
(CFDA) has recommended SFJD for the treatment of patients with H1N1-
and H5N9-induced flu based on its antiviral effect, but the detailed
analysis involved in the component identification of SFJD is still
lacking. Thus, it is essential to characterize the medicinal ingredients
in SFJD, especially the active ingredients responsible for antiviral
effects.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the main bioactive compounds
exerting
antiviral effects in SFJD and uncovered the underlying mechanisms
involved in the anti-H1N1 infection effects of SFJD. We assessed the
underlying mechanisms of SFJD on regulating the levels of proinflammatory
cytokines, the IFN-stimulated gene expressions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> and key effectors in the Type I IFN signaling pathways,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> TBK/IRF3 signaling pathways,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> and MAPK/NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Interestingly, forsythoside E, verbenalin, and emodin made
distinguishing roles and functions in several certain signals related
to antivirus activities, and western blot was finally used to verify
related signals. Our studies provide experimental evidence for studying
the antivirus mechanism of SFJD and also offer a new way for researchers
to find potential natural drugs in TCMs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Screening

the insight into systemic responses to H1N1 virus infection in the

a quantitative proteomics approach to reveal novel mechanisms of these

approach was used for the three candidate ingredients, respectively
(forsythoside E, verbenalin, and emodin). Compared with those in the
nontreated H1N1-infected RAW264.7 group, the expression levels of
105 proteins in the forsythoside E-treated group showed significant
differences (63 upregulated and 42 downregulated) (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c01545/suppl_file/ao0c01545_si_001.pdf">Table S2</ext-link>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>B). To get a more precise analysis, we focused on the cell
signals related with antivirus and immunoregulation in IPA core analysis.
Taking the forsythoside E-treated group as an example, an overview
of biological processes and signaling pathways in the forsythoside
E-treated group is shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>C. Furthermore, based on our dataset, a total of 33

JAK/STAT signaling, and MAPK signaling. In the antivirus- and immune-regulation-related
pathway, three key proteins, NF-&#x003ba;&#x003b2;, MAPK, and STAT1, were
selected for the validations by the western blot method. The phosphorylated
MAPK<sub>P38</sub>, STAT1, and NF-&#x003ba;B<sub>p65</sub> are the key

H1N1-Infected RAW264.7 Cells</title><p>The dysregulated core regulators
in forsythoside E-, verbenalin-, or emodin-treated groups were integrated
according to the related signals in antivirus and immune mechanism.
Through analyzing the abovementioned data, we found that Type I IFN-related
signals occupied a lot of proportion in a variety of signal categories.
Type I IFNs are the major line of host defense against viruses and
other microorganisms. Viral RNA activates signaling cascades through
a number of pattern recognition receptor (PRR)&#x02013;adaptor protein
pairs, including RIG-I&#x02013;MAVS, cGAS-STING, and TLR3/4-TRIF (toll-like
receptors 3 and 4).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> Type I IFNs are regulated by
IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), nuclear factor kappa B subunit p65
(NF-&#x003ba;B<sub>p65</sub>), and several intracellular signaling molecules,
which are activated by PRRs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> Type I IFNs
are essential for immune defense against viruses by inducing the expression
of interferon-stimulated genes and then suppressing the replication
and spread of virus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Type I IFNs activate
key components of the innate and adaptive immune systems, which are
well-studied cytokines with antiviral and immune-modulating functions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup></p><p>The most studied members of the Type I
family of interferons are the multiple IFN&#x003b1; and IFN&#x003b2;.
Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is a transcription factor of
IFN-&#x003b2;. In the early phase of viral infection, I&#x003ba;B kinase
&#x003b5; and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK-1) phosphorylate IRF3 lead
to the activation and homodimerization of the molecule. The phosphorylation
of IRF3 indicates the translocation of IRF3 molecules into the nucleus
and the initiation of the transcription of Type I IFNs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup></p><p>Simultaneously, the synthesized IFN-&#x003b2;
initiates JAK-STAT
signaling during virus infection, leading to the phosphorylation of
STAT1 and giving rise to a major contribution of IFN-induced genes
(ISGs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> NF-&#x003ba;B, a transcription
factor in the immune response, translocates into the nucleus and initiates
the induction of genes involved in inflammatory responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup></p><p>To further explore the underlying antiviral
mechanisms of SFJD,
we examined the expressions of the Type I IFN and PRR-related protein
phosphorylation. Western blot analysis was performed using the lysates
of H1N1-infected RAW264.7 cells treated with or without target ingredients
(forsythoside E, verbenalin, or emodin) to determine the protein expressions
of the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of TBK1, IRF3, MAPK<sub>P38</sub>, and NF-&#x003ba;B<sub>p65</sub>. TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase-1)
is a kinase downstream of critical adaptors in the cytoplasmic DNA-
and RNA-sensing pathways, which phosphorylates transcription factor
interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>, the ratio of <italic>p</italic>-TBK1/TBK1, <italic>p</italic>-IRF3/IRF3, and p-NF-&#x003ba;B<sub>p65</sub>/NF-&#x003ba;B in the H1N1-infected group was markedly higher in comparison
with that in the uninfected group (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01).
Compared with the H1N1-infected group, protein expressions of the

remarkably increased the cell viability of H1N1-infected RAW264.7
cells. Further mechanism study reveals that Type I IFNs and MAPK/NF-&#x003ba;B
signaling pathways are involved in the anti-H1N1 infection effects
of SFJD. Our study not only provides solid theoretical support for
the clinical application of SFJD but also sheds light on the novel
research methods for TCM study.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Reagents

set at 100%, and the treated samples were normalized to this value
(H1N1-infected RAW264.7 cells, H1N1 group). Cell viability according
to the following equation: cell survival (%) = optical density (OD)
of treated cells/OD of normal control &#x000d7; 100. The 50% cytotoxic
