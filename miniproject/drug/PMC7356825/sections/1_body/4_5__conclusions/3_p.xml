<p>The low bioavailability of polyphenols in the body is one of several factors which hinder the development of antiviral drugs from natural compounds. It can be attributed to inefficient absorption in the intestine, poor water solubility, high metabolism rate, rapid systemic elimination, and remains a challenge faced by many [

 <xref rid="B137-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. Strategies to enhance the bioavailability of compounds have been employed based on changes in drug formulation, or modification to the chemical structure. Nanoparticle, micelle, and liposome-based drug formulations which encapsulates the drug in the particles have been successful in improving bioavailability [

 <xref rid="B144-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Due to their small size and permeability, nanoparticles can improve delivery to membrane barriers, while micelles and liposomes can counter hydrophobicity as they can carry both hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules [

In addition, modifications to the chemical structure could also improve bioavailability by adding complexes that are highly soluble in water to increase aqueous solubility and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, or by the removal of chemical moieties to enhance stability of the molecule [
