<p>Many antiviral candidates have been found to inhibit viral replication using in vitro approaches, and only a few have been tested in vivo. This indicates the difficulty in translating experimental results to humans, and in completing the entire drug development process [

Nevertheless, careful evaluation must be conducted to understand the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of the drug by observing for any adverse side effects, or side effects associated with long-term exposure before using them in clinical practice. The target populations for receiving antiviral therapy will include children, elderly, and patients with pre-existing conditions, as well as pregnant women (risk of ZIKV infection) living in endemic areas, as they are especially vulnerable to the severe manifestations of arboviral diseases. In addition, further work is required to uncover the inhibition mechanisms of the antiviral candidates in order to elucidate the host or viral receptors involved in suppressing infection effectively, as well as to examine the possibility of combination therapies involving other natural compounds or established antivirals.
