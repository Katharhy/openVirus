<p>Over the course of the last 50 years, the emergence of several arboviruses—notably dengue, chikungunya, and Zika—have resulted in countless outbreaks globally, to which their geographical spread may be accelerated by rapid urbanization, deforestation, global warming, and increased international travel and trade [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The circulating arboviruses of public health concern in Asia can be classified into two groups: flaviviruses and alphaviruses. These include the dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) which are flaviviruses, and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) which is an alphavirus (refer to

For instance, hemorrhagic fever in DENV infections, encephalitis in JEV and WNV infections; severe myalgia and arthralgia in CHIKV infections [
