 <italic>Aedes albopticus</italic> mosquitoes, DENV comprises of four antigenically related but distinct serotypes, DEN-1 to -4. According to the World Health Organization, dengue virus (DENV) is considered to be the most widespread arbovirus worldwide, with the disease endemic in more than 100 countries [

In rare cases, severe dengue may occur with serious manifestations—including capillary leakage, fluid accumulation in tissue spaces, severe bleeding, and organ impairment—which can be potentially fatal [
