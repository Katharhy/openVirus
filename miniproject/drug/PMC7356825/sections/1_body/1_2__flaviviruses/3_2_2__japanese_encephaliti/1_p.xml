<p>JEV is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia with approximately 68,000 cases of infection estimated to occur annually [

 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. mosquitoes are the vectors responsible for the transmission of JEV, which occurs mainly in rural agricultural areas, often associated with irrigated rice paddies [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The virus is maintained in a cycle between mosquitoes, pigs and/or wading water birds; humans are incidental hosts. Japanese encephalitis is primarily a disease of children, with ~75% of cases occurring in children aged below 15 years old [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It is reported that most adults in endemic regions have natural immunity after childhood infection; however, individuals of any age may be affected [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The vast majority of JEV infections are asymptomatic or present as a flu-like illness. JEV can effectively cross the bloodâ€“brain barrier (BBB) to cause acute encephalitis, with severe manifestations including high fever, headache, vomiting, seizures, disorientation, coma, and ultimately death [
