<p>Pinocembrin is a flavanone abundant in propolis, honey, tea, and red wine. Widely studied for its role in neurodegenerative diseases and ischemic stroke, it has neuroprotective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, as well as anti-microbial effects [

 <xref rid="B127-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. It has been shown to be able to cross the BBB because of its low molecular weight and good liposolubility in an in vitro model using cultured rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) [

 <xref rid="B128-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. Recently, Lee and colleagues (2019) reported that pinocembrin is able to inhibit ZIKV infection in human placental JEG-3 and human hepatoma Huh7 cell lines. The study determined that pinocembrin acts on post-entry processes of the ZIKV replication cycle but its exact mechanism remains to be studied [
