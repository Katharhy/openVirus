<p>Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a flavonoid abundant in green tea and has shown to possess potent antiviral activity against HIV, influenza virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and HCV [

 <xref rid="B123-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. A direct virucidal effect of EGCG was observed against DENV, CHIKV, WNV, and ZIKV, but its specific mechanism is not well understood (refer to

 <xref rid="B101-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Three studies have collectively suggested that EGCG exerts its antiviral effect at the early stages of viral replication, possibly by binding directly to the viral particle to inhibit host cell attachment [

 <xref rid="B101-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Carneiro and colleagues (2016) suggested that the antiviral mechanism by which EGCG exerts on ZIKV (and possibly other arboviruses) could be the same as HIV, as reported in a previous study [
 <xref rid="B123-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. In that study, it was established that EGCG could destroy and destabilize the viral envelope phospholipids, thus leading to virus destruction [

 <xref rid="B124-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. In addition, a study in rats showed that EGCG can easily cross the placental barrier and spread to foetal tissues such as the brain, eyes, and heart [
 <xref rid="B125-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Together, these studies show that EGCG is a potential antiviral candidate capable of inhibiting several arboviruses, and would be especially helpful to treat or prevent neuroinvasive arboviruses like JEV, WNV, and ZIKV.
