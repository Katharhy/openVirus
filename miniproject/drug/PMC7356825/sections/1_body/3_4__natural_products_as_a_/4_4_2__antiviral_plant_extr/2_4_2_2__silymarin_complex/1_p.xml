<p>Silymarin is a complex extracted from milk thistle (

 <xref rid="B134-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, and hepatoprotective activities, it is used as a supportive treatment for chronic liver diseases, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver cirrhosis [

 <xref rid="B135-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Even in humans, it is a well-tolerated compound after prolonged and high dosage use, with the most common side effects being headache and itching [

 <xref rid="B114-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Additionally, silymarin has recently been reported to be able to inhibit MAYV, which is an alphavirus like CHIKV, by suppressing MAYV replication and attenuating MAYV-induced oxidative stress caused by MAYV infection [
 <xref rid="B115-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. This suggests that there could be potential in silymarin to be a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, but its activity against other viruses will need to be investigated further.
