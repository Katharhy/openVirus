<p>Flavonoids are an important class of polyphenols with more than 4000 varieties identified in various plant species, and can be further divided into six subclasses: flavonols, flavones, flavanones, flavanols, anthocyanin, and isoflavones [

 <xref rid="B91-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Regardless of the type of flavonoid, they are always characterized by a chromane ring bearing either a 2- or 3-phenyl ring which classifies them as a flavonoid, or an isoflavonoid, respectively [

 <xref rid="B94-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Hence, the antiviral effects of flavonoids are dependent on its bioavailabilityâ€”the proportion of active ingredient that is digested, absorbed, and metabolized through normal pathways and become available at the site of action [

 <xref rid="B90-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Therefore, in vitro results do not necessarily translate into efficacy in vivo and will require modifications to the compound to improve its bioavailability, so as to further clinical development against the target viruses. Strategies to overcome the poor systemic bioavailability of compounds will be discussed later. Numerous flavonoids, as well as plant extracts, have been reported for their antiviral activities against enveloped RNA viruses, including flaviviruses and alphaviruses (refer to
