<p>Mayaro virus (MAYV) is a neglected tropical arbovirus known to cause sporadic outbreaks in rural communities of South America, including Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, and Bolivia [

 <xref rid="B73-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. First isolated in 1954 in Trinidad, it is transmitted by forest-dwelling 
 <italic>Hemagogus</italic> mosquitoes; however, the vector competence of the urban 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito has been confirmed experimentally [

 <xref rid="B75-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. However, its symptoms may be clinically indistinguishable from dengue and chikungunya fever, hence leading to the misdiagnosis and underestimation of the number of MAYV infection cases [

 <xref rid="B77-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Due to the potential of MAYV mimicking the epidemiological progression of CHIKV, it could pose a serious threat to public health systems in many countries [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. In addition, the possibility of MAYV becoming further urbanized to spread to new territories mediated by 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and consequently causing large epidemics is worth noting. Therefore, increased surveillance and control plans must be considered to prepare for its possible emergence [
