<p id="Par10">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> provides a summary of all the references on which the EMA statement is based. It is obvious that (1) all studies, both positive and negative, are retrospective and observational (OSs); (2) some studies have a low sample size and other are preprints; (3) importantly, not all studies support the safety of RAASi; and (4) some studies supporting the safety of RAASi emphasize that caution is required in the interpretation of the findings. Thus, the recommendations of the EMA like those of the other scientific societies are based mostly on speculation and not on solid evidence.
