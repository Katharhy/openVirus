 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, professional scientific societies recommend the unrestricted prescription of RAASi during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a recent statement of the European Medicinal Agencies (EMA), it is emphasized (10 June 2020 EMA/284513/2020): “Recent observational studies of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs, also called sartans) have not shown an effect of these medicines on the risk of becoming infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (the virus causing COVID-19) and do not indicate a negative impact on the outcome for patients with COVID-19 disease. EMA therefore reiterates its previous advice that patients should continue to use ACE inhibitors or ARBs as advised by their doctors”.
