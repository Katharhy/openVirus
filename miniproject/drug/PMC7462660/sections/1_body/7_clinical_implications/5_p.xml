<p id="Par19">Based on the above, we believe that in the current period of uncertainty, the decision to prescribe RAASi should be individualized and based on evidence originating from physiology, pathophysiologic mechanisms, observational studies OSs, and clinical judgment. In this regard, the strategy that we follow is outlined below:

   <p id="Par20">Patients in whom RAASi proved beneficial in the pre-COVID-19 era but are currently not indispensable (Fig. 
    <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Effective agents which potentially do not affect RAAS should be considered [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Guideline-recommended alternatives depend on the underlying disease and include beta-blockers, which reduce plasma concentrations of ANG II (the ACE2 substrate) by reducing renin release from the kidneys as well as cleavage of ANG I to ANG II as well as calcium channel blockers, which are neutral concerning ANG II availability. Regarding diuretics, which are RAAS stimulators, torsemide is a highly effective diuretic agent that lowers blood pressure [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and has favorable effects on neurohormones, electrolytes, cardiac remodeling, but has been predominantly used in patients with HF [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. There is no doubt that switching from a RAASi to another antihypertensive therapy in stable ambulatory patients may occasionally be challenging. However, this challenge should be taken in the era of this lethal COVID-19 pandemic.

   <p id="Par21">Patients in whom RAΑSi proved beneficial in the pre-COVID-19 era but are currently indispensable (Fig. 
    <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). RAAS inhibitors should be prescribed and in patients already treated with these agents they should not be discontinued [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), a new drug class approved for treatment of diabetes, have been shown to significantly reduce atherosclerotic events, hospitalization for HF, cardiovascular and total mortality, and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) even in patients without diabetes [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Increasing experimental and clinical data demonstrated a reduction in neurohormonal activity with these agents, including in key target organs such as the heart and the kidneys [
