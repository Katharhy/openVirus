<p id="Par23">Evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of RAΑSi in the COVID-19 context is based on OSs, which have provided useful information in the past but have also led to errors even after application of multiple adjustment techniques. While the potential for benefit with the use of RAASi and the risks from stopping them is more evident, potential harm by RAΑSi may also be caused by the increase in the activity of the ACE2 receptor which the SARS-CoV-2 binds and enters into the host, the doubtful protective effects of the ACE2/ANG [1–7]/Mas axis in the lungs, and the proinflammatory properties of ACE2(+) cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. Acknowledging the proven RAΑSi benefit in patients with several diseases such as hypertension, heart failure, coronary disease, and diabetic kidney disease in the non-COVID-19 era, it is a reasonable strategy in this period of uncertainty to use these agents judiciously with careful consideration to avoid the use of RAASi in select patients whenever possible, until definitive evidence becomes available. Shared decision making with patient and caregivers is important in this. Admittedly, this strategy, like all the other recommendations on this issue, is not based on solid evidence but is intended to be individualized and, in this regard, differs from the “one size fits all” approach. It is obvious that in a complex biological system where multiple factors interact, one cannot incorporate all these factors into the guidelines and/or algorithms. In this case, sound clinical judgment and common sense should be used by the clinician for the individual patient. There is no substitute for that.</p>
