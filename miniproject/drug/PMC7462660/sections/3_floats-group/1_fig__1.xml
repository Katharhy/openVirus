  <p>Rational and algorithm for the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era. It should be noted that this strategy, like all the other recommendations on this issue, is not based on solid evidence due to the lack of the relevant randomized control trials. However, it is an individualized approach and, in this regard, better than the “one size fits all” approaches. (+): present; (−−/+): possibly absent; (−): absent; RAS, renin-angiotensin system; LVEF: left ventricular ejection fraction; ACEi: angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors; ARB: angiotensin receptor blockers; MRA: mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; SGLT2, sodium glucose cotransporter 2; *, not yet in guidelines but effectiveness documented in randomized control trials</p>
