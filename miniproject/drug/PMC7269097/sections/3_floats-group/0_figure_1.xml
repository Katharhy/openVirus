  <p>Overview of the proposed viral life cycle of SARS-CoV-2, the infectious agent of COVID-19. Both viral and host machinery are essential for viral infection, replication, reassembly, and egress. Remdesivir, the only FDA approved drug for COVID-19 treatment, blocks RNA replication. Highlighted are points of viral interference that have not been widely exploited: (1) inhibition of additional components of the viral replication–transcription complex (RTC); (2) development of new modes of disrupting viral protease activities; and (3) exploration of peptide-based inhibitors to prevent host–viral membrane fusion.</p>
