<p>Here, we outline viral pathways that contain druggable targets currently overlooked and propose general mechanisms to disrupt these pathways. We begin with a short primer on the SARS-CoV-2 viral life cycle and an overview of existing drugs that are the subject of current clinical trials around the world. We then focus on alternative druggable targets largely within the viral replicase machinery, as well as viral entry and proteolytic processing pathways. Our proposed strategies for blocking these pathways are informed by past and current work on inhibitors of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other successful antivirals. We hope to engage the medicinal chemistry community with ideas for novel therapeutic targets in order to develop 
 <italic>new drugs</italic> to specifically disarm coronaviruses in the host.
