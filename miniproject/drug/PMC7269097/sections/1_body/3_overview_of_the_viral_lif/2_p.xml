<p>Following engulfment and subsequent release from the endosome, viral genetic material is released into the host cytoplasm prior to translation of the single stranded viral RNA into long polypeptides that contain the nsps. Viral polypeptides are predicted to be cleaved into 16 individual nsps through an autoprocessing mechanism.

 </sup> There are two cysteine-like proteases expressed as part of these polypeptides: one is a papain-like protease (PLP), known as the accessory protease; the other is a chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>), known as the main protease. 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> cleaves itself and processes the remaining polypeptide into nsps 7–16, which make up the RNA replication-transcription complex (RTC). Several components of the RTC aid the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), which is responsible for replicating additional copies of the RNA genome and transcribing multiple mRNA fragments that encode either structural or accessory proteins. Following multiple cycles of replication and translation, the viral particle assembles and exits the cell though a budding mechanism known as scission. It is thought that β-coronaviruses rely on the host cell’s endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT), but the exact method of egress is still not known.

 </sup> Full scission from the host cell releases the virus to infect more cells and continue to replicate.
