 </sup> The viral RNA-encoded proteins can be divided into two main classes: structural and nonstructural proteins (nsps). The structural proteins (spike, envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid, and hemagglutinin esterase) form the viral particle and play additional functional roles during infection. Viral infection begins with an interaction between the viral spike glycoprotein (S protein) and a receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), on the host cell surface (

 </xref>). ACE2 is expressed in various cell types, including those in the lungs. Host proteases in the membrane are important in this process;

 </sup> namely, a cellular serine protease, called transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is known to prime the trimer of S protein on the viral particle surface prior to cell entry. Cleavage of S protein into two subunits is required for the process of viral and host membrane fusion prior to viral uptake by an endocytic mechanism.
