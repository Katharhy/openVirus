<p>Without the ability to accurately predict a timeline for a vaccine, we need additional clinical candidates to build an arsenal against SARS-CoV infections. Related coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus), caused serious, albeit less widespread, health epidemics starting in 2002 and 2012. The occurrence of multiple outbreaks further motivates us to annotate therapeutic targets for other coronavirus-caused diseases that might develop in the future. Similar to the treatment of influenza, we would benefit from multiprong defense tactics that include both vaccines and therapeutic agents. Many recent scientific reviews and essays have outlined vaccine efforts, as well as viral and host targets that are the focus of current campaigns aimed at redirecting clinically used compounds for COVID-19.
