<p>Coronavirus helicases are motor proteins necessary for unwinding double-stranded RNA, which form secondary structures, in order for replication and translation to occur. Since viral helicases typically share low homology with human DNA helicases, specific helicase inhibitors are unlikely to be toxic to the host.

 </sup> The amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV-1 helicase is identical to that found in SARS-CoV-2; hence, a solved crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-1 helicase provides opportunities for rational drug design.

 </sup> The Lupoli and Zhang laboratories (NYU, Chemistry) are currently using this structure to design small molecule ligands for computationally predicted binding pockets. In addition to a nucleotide binding site, the SARS-CoV helicase contains a zinc binding domain with three zinc fingers, and mutation of residues linking this domain to the helicase core domain were shown to cause a deficiency in nucleic acid unwinding.

 </sup> As a result, there are multiple sites for disruption of helicase activity.
