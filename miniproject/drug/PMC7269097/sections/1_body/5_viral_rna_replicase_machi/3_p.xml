<p>Unique among other RNA viruses, coronaviruses are believed to have two nsps with RNA polymerase activity. The canonical RdRP is primer-dependent for optimal activity, while the second polymerase (nsp8) is hypothesized to be a primase.

 </sup> The primary sequences of nsp7, 8 and RdRP are â‰¥96% identical in SARS-CoV-1 and CoV-2. A solved cryoelectron microscopy structure of the SARS-CoV-1 RTC complex has shown that interactions between RdRP, nsp7 and 8 are essential for activity.

 </sup> Interestingly, the main RdRP also has an N-terminal kinase-like domain that may carry out nucleotidyltransfer reactions. Disruption of this site or any member of this complex represents a novel opportunity for chemical interference.
