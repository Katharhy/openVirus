<p>The success of remdesivir in clinical trials, although limited, suggests that inhibition of viral replication is a viable strategy for the treatment of COVID-19. Importantly, it takes more than a single polymerase to replicate the viral genome and ensure pathogenicity. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to involve up to nine nsps in the RTC.

 </sup> Key players include the RdRP (nsp12), helicase (nsp13), and proposed polymerase cofactors/primase(s) (nsp 7, 8). To our knowledge, these proteins are not targets in current COVID-19 clinical trials. The viral RTC proteins are expressed in the cytoplasm and so are more accessible that their host counterparts in the nucleus.
