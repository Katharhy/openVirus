 <xref rid="bb0580" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. As a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder, RA carries a higher infectious risk than the general population. The use of synthetic and biologic disease-modifying drugs is associated with a potential further increase in the incidence of serious infections, but the poor control of RA disease activity is an even greater infectious risk factor. Thus, RA patients should be encouraged to continue their treatment even during COVID-19 outbreak. In our opinion, this strategy is reasonable as it aims to prevent disease flares that can contributes to increase patient burden, disability, poor quality of life, and healthcare use [

In addition, the discontinuation of ongoing treatments could lead to the need to introduce CS as bridging therapy, which may further increase the risk of viral infection, as well as being inappropriate for the management of SARS-CoV2 interstitial pneumonia.
