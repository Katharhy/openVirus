<p id="p0150">Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are currently included in the treatment protocol for the management of COVID-19 infections and might be useful to prevent or mitigate the course of infection in patients with RA taking them as csDMARDs. The use of IL-6 inhibitors as tocilizumab or sarilumab seems to be promising for the management of most critical cases of interstitial pneumonia complicated by CRS, but the identification of definite criteria to discriminate patients to be treated with these compounds is still under debate. Finally, although baricitinib has the potential to affect SARS-CoV2 penetration into pulmonary epithelial cells, major concerns remain about the inhibition of IFNs activity which could be detrimental in the course of viral infection.</p>
