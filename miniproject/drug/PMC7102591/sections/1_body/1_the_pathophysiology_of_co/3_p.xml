<p id="p0025">The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm, and the RNA is uncoated to allow translation of the two polyproteins, transcription of the sub-genomic RNAs and replication of the viral genome [

Progression to ARDS is associated with the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, known as Cytokines Release Syndrome (CRS), with a pattern very similar to that of secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH). In adults, sHLH is an under-recognized, hyperinflammatory syndrome characterized by a massive and fatal hypercytokinaemia with multiorgan failure, most commonly triggered by viral infections [

 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Main clinical features of sHLH include unremitting fever, hyperferritinaemia and cytopenias, and pulmonary involvement (including ARDS) occurring in approximately 50% of patients [
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A cytokine profile resembling sHLH has been reported in most severe COVID-19 infections, characterized by increased levels of a number of cytokines (interleukin-1β [IL-1β], IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF]) and chemokines (CXC-chemokine ligand 10 [CXCL10] and CC-chemokine ligand 2 [CCL2]) [

 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The management of this cytokine storm is one of the major unmet needs regarding COVID-19 infection.
