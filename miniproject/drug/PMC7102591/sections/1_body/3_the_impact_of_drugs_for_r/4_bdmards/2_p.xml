<p id="p0070">The risk of infection observed in RA patients treated with bDMARDs is generally considered slightly higher (from 1.5- up to 2-fold) compared with csDMARDs [
 <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. This evidence recurred in most RCTs [
 <xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and observational registry studies [
 <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>] and was confirmed by a recent meta-analysis which showed that this risk is progressively increasing in relation to the use of bDMARDs at higher than recommended dosages [
 <xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Following the results of comparative metanalyses and real-life studies, abatacept is accepted as the safest bDMARD in terms of infectious risk [
