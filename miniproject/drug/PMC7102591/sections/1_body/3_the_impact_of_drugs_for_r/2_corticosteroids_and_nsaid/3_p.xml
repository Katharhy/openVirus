<p id="p0050">Thus, CS on the one hand inhibit the immune response and delay the clearance of the pathogen, while on the other hand they suppress the host inflammatory response, which in the case of viral infections of the respiratory tract is the major responsible for lung damage and occurrence of ARDS [
