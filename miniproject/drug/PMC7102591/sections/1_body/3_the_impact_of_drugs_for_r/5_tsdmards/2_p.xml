<p id="p0080">The overall risk of serious and opportunistic infections observed with Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors in RA patients is roughly comparable with bDMARDs [
 <xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], although these early years of tofacitinib and baricitinib use have raised the issue of an increased risk of Herpes Zoster virus (HZV) infections [
 <xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Data from tofacitinib pooled population enrolled in RCTs showed an HZV incidence rate of 4.0 per 100 patient-years (with greater incidence in geographic area with high HZV endemicity), doubling the rates of RA patients not receiving JAKis [
 <xref rid="bb0335" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. A similar picture has also been observed in the overall development program of baricitinib, with an incidence rate of 3.2 cases per patient-years [
 <xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The subsequent real-life experience from US claim databases revealed that the risk of HZV was higher in patients receiving tofacitinib compared to those treated with abatacept (aHR 2.01 (95% CI 1.40; 2.88) [

 <italic>versus</italic> all bDMARDs [
 <xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Older age, female sex, prednisone &gt;7.5Â mg/day, prior infection, and greater number of hospitalizations were associated with increased HZV risk, whereas vaccination was associated with a lower risk [
 <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. More recent reports from RCTs conducted with novel JAK-1 selective inhibitors upadacitinib and filgotinib have basically confirmed the same trend, suggesting that the increase in HZV infections can be considered as a class effect of JAKis [
 <xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Although the exact mechanism by which HZV reactivation occurs in the context of JAK inhibition is unclear, the downregulation of both cell-mediated immunity and innate antiviral signaling through type I and II interferons (IFN) is likely to be involved [
