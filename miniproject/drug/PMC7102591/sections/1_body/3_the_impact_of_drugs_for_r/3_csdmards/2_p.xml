<p id="p0065">The most comprehensive analysis of infectious risk in patients treated with csDMARDs is a retrospective, longitudinal study of a population-based RA cohort using an administrative database including a total of 27,710 individuals with RA and providing 162,710 person-years of follow-up [
 <xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Use of csDMARDs without corticosteroids was associated with a small decrease in mild infection risk (adjusted rate ratio [RR] 0.90, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.88–0.93) and was not associated with increased serious infection risk (adjusted RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85–1.0). Similarly, another retrospective analysis conducted on 1993 patients from a claim database demonstrated a slightly reduced risk of hospitalized infection for methotrexate (adjusted RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70–0.93) and hydroxychloroquine (adjusted RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.62–0.89) [
