<p id="p0135">On the other side, IFN is one of the most potent innate immune responses to prevent viral replication during the early phases of infection [
 <xref rid="bb0550" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. The activation of transcription through JAK/STAT signaling pathway by IFNs leads to the upregulation of several interferon stimulated genes which have the ability to rapidly kill viruses within infected cells [
 <xref rid="bb0555" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Almost all viruses have developed strategies to combat the effects of type 1 and type 3 IFNs by blocking the IFN signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="bb0560" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>] and viral encoded factors able to antagonize the JAK/STAT pathway are crucial determinants of virulence [
 <xref rid="bb0565" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. In particular, Influenza A viruses disrupt JAK/STAT signaling by reducing the expression of the IFN receptor and by directly inhibiting IFN signaling [
 <xref rid="bb0570" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. As a consequence, JAK/STAT blockade generated by baricitinib certainly produces an impairment of IFN-mediated anti-viral response, with a potential facilitating effect on the progression of SARS-CoV2 infection at the moment not yet better quantified.
