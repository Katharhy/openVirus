<p id="p0110">As already described, ARDS occurring in most severe case of COVID-19 infection is mainly produced by the massive release of pro-inflammatory mediators (CRS) associated with viral replication and lung injury, leading to multiorgan failure [
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, the high levels of these cytokines have been reported to be inversely related to the absolute lymphocytes count, with surviving T-cells functionally exhausted [
 <xref rid="bb0470" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Since an effective immune response against viral infections depends on the activation of cytotoxic T cells, CRS might be associated with a decreased viral clearance, contributing to COVID-19 worsening. IL-6 and IL-1 play a pivotal role in this hyperinflammatory condition, suggesting the potential use of their blockers as treatment option for SARS-CoV2 related interstitial pneumonia. Data from a phase 3 RCT of IL-1 blockade (anakinra) in sepsis showed significant survival benefit in patients with hyperinflammation, without increased adverse events [

A multicentre RCT of tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor blocker licensed for both RA and cytokine release syndrome) has been approved in China and is currently ongoing in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and elevated IL-6 levels (ChiCTR2000029765) and a phase II study has been approved by the Italian Regulatory Drug Agency (AIFA) and will enrol 330 patients with pneumonia and early respiratory failure, with 1-month mortality reduction as primary outcome (TOCIVID-19). Moreover, the company that produces the second marketed IL-6 inhibitor sarilumab recently announced its intention to undertake a study with a similar design [
