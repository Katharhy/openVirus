<p id="p0090">Currently, vaccines and approved targeted therapeutics for the treatment of the new SARS-CoV-2 infection are still lacking and the management of COVID-19 is only supportive, even though a multitude of compounds are now under investigation for the treatment of this emerging disease [
 <xref rid="bb0375" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The need to urgently identify an effective approach to manage COVID-19 led to the strategy of testing the efficacy of the existing antiviral drugs commonly used for other viral infections. In particular, considering the similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and other Betacoronavirus associated with previous epidemics as SARS-CoV and MERS-Cov, the same drugs used with controversial results for these conditions (interferon, ribavirin, and lopinavir-ritonavir) have been considered even for COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Anecdotal cases have demonstrated the ability of lopinavir-ritonavir to significantly reduce viral load and improve disease outcome [
 <xref rid="bb0385" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. In addition, remdesivir, an adenosine analogue currently under development for the management of Ebola virus infection [
 <xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], has been recently recognized as a promising antiviral therapy against a wide spectrum of RNA viruses [
 <xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] and showed good preliminary 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> results in the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Consequently, lopinavir-ritonavir and remdesevir are currently the only anti-viral drugs included in the more severe case management protocols of COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Recent reports described the potential role of human monoclonal antibodies that bind the coronavirus spike receptor binding domain, leading to the neutralization of SARS-CoV2 capability to interact with human target cells [
 <xref rid="bb0405" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0410" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. However, at the moment these can only be considered as potential treatment options for the future, but they are obviously not available for the management of the current pandemic.
