  <p>As it is predicted that large-scale viral diseases will occur more frequently in the future, there are voices that Korean Medicine (KM) community need to discuss the role of KM and what to prepare to play a significant part of national disease control system in the post-Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) era.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>Unlike in the past infectious disease outbreaks, KM community has played a bigger part in COVID-19 pandemic in spite of regulatory challenges via activities of KM teleconsultation centers. Telemedicine in pandemic could be more actively utilized in light of the present KM teleconsultation centerâ€™s achievements. Data from KM teleconsultation centers would be useful to establish an evidence-base for effectiveness and safety of KM treatments if they are properly collected and analyzed. It might be beneficial to adopt an integrative medicine approach in response to acute viral infectious diseases in the future but the inclusion of KM in the national disease control system is required.</p>
