 </xref> However, going through the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Korean Medicine (KM) community was completely excluded from any stage of responses to COVID-19 including diagnosis, treatment, quarantine, or prevention due to various reasons including political and regulatory barriers and lack of social awareness. Because Korean Medicine Doctors (KMDs) had no way to participate or volunteer in any activities in the national disease control system, the Association of Korean Medicine, of its own accord, opened a KM teleconsultation center for COVID-19, which is run by KMD volunteers and donation.
