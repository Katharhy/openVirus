 <bold>Kang:</bold> KM must receive support from the government and be included in the public healthcare system. KMDs should actively participate in areas related to public healthcare. Special infectious disease centers must be established to facilitate integrative treatments between WM and KM. Significant changes have been noted in many centers in Gwangju and numerous local governments also have made promises that they will also incorporate similar changes. Therefore, the KM community must preemptively suggest its participation based on the moves made by their respective local governments. We can then participate in the prevention of the pandemic with easy access to relevant data and full support from the government.
