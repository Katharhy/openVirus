 <bold>Kang:</bold> In Daegu, KM remote consultation over the telephone started on March 9, 2020 and ended on April 5, 2020. In Seoul, the KM teleconsultation center started on March 31, 2020 and has remained ongoing. As of 22 April 2020, 2132 patients have received KM treatments via teleconsultation center and these are approximately 19% of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea. This number is particularly crucial because it was based on the telephone calls made by the patients of their own accord, without prior planning or any support from the government. During the early stages after the Daegu center began operating, many mild cases of COVID-19 were observed, who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and thus placed themselves in self-isolation because they could not be admitted to a hospital or quarantine facility. From the 2nd week in the Daegu center, we received calls primarily from patients entering quarantine facilities. As of 22 April 2020, at the Seoul center, we mainly have patients with mild cases of COVID-19 and typically receive calls from patients who have been released from a hospital or quarantine facility after testing negative for COVID-19. According to the results of our ongoing survey on the satisfaction of discharged patients, the KM teleconsultation center has received excellent results: a patient stated that “Western Medicine (WM) doctors only quarantined (us) without providing any drugs or treatments, whereas KMDs called us every day and provided herbal medicines, which I truly appreciated.”
