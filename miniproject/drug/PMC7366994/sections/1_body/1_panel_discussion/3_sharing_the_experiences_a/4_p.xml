<p id="par0030">Unlike the past swine flu, SARS, and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) pandemics, this teleconsultation center is the first instance wherein KM has contributed toward fighting against a pandemic related to an acute infectious disease. Moreover, it has provided a significant opportunity for KMDs to understand and observe the effects of CheongPyeBaeDok decoction (QingFeiPaiDu-tang in Chinese, Seihaihaidokuto in Japanese) on an infectious disease. Many KMD volunteers including students from colleges of KM, who wanted to contribute toward the prevention of an infectious disease offered to help at the center. Although the government was not initially interested in our centers, they now express interest in our achievements at the centers when they noted that more than 20% of all confirmed patients were treated through our center.</p>
