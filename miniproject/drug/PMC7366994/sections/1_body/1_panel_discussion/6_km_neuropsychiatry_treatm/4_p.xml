<p id="par0110">From the perspective of research, selection of the target population is crucial. Prior to research, it is crucial to train KMDs to use objective psychological tests and give standardized psychotherapy and instructions for self-care methods. For study designs, developing various research designs is also crucial. A research design that I can suggest at this time is a cross-sectional study on the characteristics of research subjects: we can study the characteristics and emotions that are often expressed and to what extent they are prevalent in patients with pathophobia, particularly those exposed to a relatively new disease. Moreover, the distribution of patterns needs to be identified in the confirmed cases of COVID-19, those who are self-isolated, and those who are not to evaluate the differences among these subgroups. We can include a battery of questionnaires to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of KM interventions administered over the phone. Because well-designed and controlled trials are not feasible in a remote consultation setting, we could try observational research despite its relatively lower evidence level. My suggestion for potential research areas includes prospective observational studies that evaluate changes before and after treatments, and case-control studies to observe differences between groups that received and did not receive the KM treatment for psychiatric symptoms as well as the aforementioned psychotherapy and self-care methods.</p>
