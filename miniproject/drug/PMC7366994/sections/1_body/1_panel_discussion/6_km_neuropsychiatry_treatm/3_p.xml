 <bold>Jung:</bold> The inclusion of KM psychiatric consultation and treatment over the phone from the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic can be a useful strategy. As we are currently treating confirmed and/or self-isolated cases, they are of great importance for KM treatment. However, other subjects should also be considered, such as patients who were not isolated, those who completely recovered, those who were released from quarantine facilities, and those who remained unaffected around patients with COVID-19. The psychiatric symptoms that can be developed from various causes include fear, panic, anxiety, hypochondria, and depression. In addition, a patient can experience somatic symptoms, such as hypertension, insomnia, and pain. Patients have often reported such symptoms and in KM, they are categorized under palpitations, fearful throbbing or depressive symptom. According to the Korean Standard Classification of Diseases, they belong to categories of phobias, adjustment disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, and depressive disorder. During diagnosis, it is crucial to understand a patient’s primary emotions, such as sadness, anger, or anxiety and it is also important to understand the severity of the symptoms. It is helpful for making a better decision by inquiring about patients’ conditions to evaluate any accompanying somatic symptoms. Standardized tools to identify and quantify anxiety, depression, and somatization disorders can also be used to collect data and develop treatment approaches in an objective manner. Before determining the treatment required, professionals should refer to the KM guidelines based on the test results. We can give herbal medicine and psychological treatments mentioned in the guidelines. Conducting in-person treatment is difficult for patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 or those who are self-isolated; however, healthy individuals can opt for these treatments. Both acupuncture and pharmacopuncture can be performed. If KM treatment over the phone or video are possible, psychotherapies can be useful: in particular, emotional freedom techniques recently registered via a new health technology assessment can be an option. Self-care methods, such as meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, and autogenic training, can be practiced.
