These are represented by Samgi-decoction (ShenQi-tang in Chinese, Jingito in Japanese), Jinmu-decoction (ZhenWu-tang in Chinese, Shinbuto in Japanese), and Gamisaengmaek-san (JiaWeiShengMai-san in Chinese, Kamishomyakusan in Japanese). In Japan, Oryeong-san is popular as a dampness-draining diuretic medicine. Regardless of which prescription has been used, we should develop measures to prepare against potential mass incidences of heart failures. Because providing acupuncture treatment at the well-known points, such as PC6, HT8, LI4, and LR3, can help prevent heart failure from deteriorating via autonomic regulation, we can also consider utilizing this approach.
