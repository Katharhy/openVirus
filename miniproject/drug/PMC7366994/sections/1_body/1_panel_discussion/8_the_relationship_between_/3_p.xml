 <bold>Kwon:</bold> Before discussing the management of cardiovascular abnormalities after COVID-19, I would like to briefly talk about the current situation. The first case wherein cardiovascular issues were noted was that of a 21-year-old woman with no underlying medical condition, who had been diagnosed with COVID-19.

 </xref> After she was diagnosed with COVID-19, we took her chest X-ray to check for pneumonia and the enlarged heart and diagnosed myocarditis were identified. Typically, when a person is diagnosed with myocarditis, they have to live the rest of their life with the condition of heart failure. After treatment, although she had tested negative for COVID-19, myocarditis was still noted and her heart functions have yet to recover. Similar cases have been reported overseas. In Wuhan, 19.7% of the Zhongnan hospital research team showed signs of cardiovascular abnormalities.
