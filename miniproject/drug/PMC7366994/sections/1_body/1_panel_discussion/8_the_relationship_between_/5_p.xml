 </xref> Therefore, we should develop a long-term prognosis observation. Moreover, I believe that we should control for heart abnormalities that may appear in the future and KM treatment can be used alongside heart failure symptom management. In particular, taking a diuretic may fail to resolve shortness of breath or edema for some heart failure patients. In my opinion, the most reasonable herbal medicine to recommend is Oryeong-san (Wuling-san in Chinese, Goreisan in Japanese). For older patients with intractable heart failure, there is no other treatment than the so-called Lasix (furosemide) as well as a diuretic called tolvaptan. However, approximately 30% of patients are not benefited with both treatments. This is particularly true among older adult patients: a Japanese study involved two groups of participants, those that responded to Tolvaptan and those who did not, wherein a significant increase in the amount of urine and decrease in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level upon giving Oryeong-san to participants who had not responded to tolvaptan. Among tolvaptan-responsive participants, adding Oryeong-san to tolvaptan decreased the frequency of rehospitalization and improved BNP level after a year.
