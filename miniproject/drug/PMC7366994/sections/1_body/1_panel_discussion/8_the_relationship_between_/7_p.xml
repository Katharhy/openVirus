<p id="par0175">I will now present my suggestions for policymaking. Rehabilitation management programs for patients that have fully recovered from COVID-19 will be useful. If these programs are developed, I believe that participation from internal KM as well as psychiatry is necessary. When the government sets up registry research for a long-term prognosis, because it would include follow-up data for cardiovascular abnormalities, hospitals providing KM treatment should consider arranging similar settings for active participation in the future.</p>
