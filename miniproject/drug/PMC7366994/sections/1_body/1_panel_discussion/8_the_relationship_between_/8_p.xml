<p id="par0180">Finally, the Japan Society for Oriental Medicine is conducting evaluations on the effects of symptomatic treatment of COVID-19 including herbal medicine. Because we are doing remote consultation and treatment, we must check on the progress of patients and I believe that our hard work deserves cooperation from the government. The reason why I believe that symptomatic treatment is necessary is because the success rate of antiviral therapy would be lowâ€”at which point, patients have to turn to symptomatic treatment. What are the prescriptions and herbs that work best in symptomatic treatment? I believe that this question will become a significant theme in the future, and we need to develop solutions to address it.</p>
