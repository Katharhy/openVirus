 </xref> This paper also reviews three cases of patients with COVID-19. In all of the three cases, the blood vessel was attacked via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and showed signs of abnormalities in vascular functions, thus leading to vasoconstriction, decreased blood flow, and, ultimately, multiple organ failures through microvascular dysfunctions.
