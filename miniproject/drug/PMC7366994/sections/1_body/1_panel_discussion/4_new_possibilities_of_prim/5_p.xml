 <bold>Jang:</bold> We have organized a team of medical staff and support groups from within the Association of Korean Medicine. There may be some limitations associated with the use of this data because it comprises information largely regarding mild cases of COVID-19; this is due to inpatients being excluded from the KM treatment. A considerable amount of data is continuously being accumulated and questionnaires are being administered. Since it is an ongoing process, conclusive comments will be available later.
