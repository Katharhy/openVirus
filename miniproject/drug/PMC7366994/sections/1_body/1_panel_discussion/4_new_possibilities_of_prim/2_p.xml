 <bold>Jang:</bold> In late March, during a World Health Organization seminar focusing on countermeasures against COVID-19 that are rooted in traditional medicine, I presented the role of KM in South Korea, particularly that of our KM treatment via teleconsultation. Although I attempted to contact some newspapers to introduce the role of KM in South Korea, they remained uninterested. Therefore, I instead wrote an article that was published in the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong on April 9, 2020, where I highlighted the role of KM teleconsultation in pandemic era.

 </xref> The notorious SARS, swine flu, and MERS pandemics in 2003, 2009, and 2013 have led to increased public awareness of (acute) infectious diseases. However, KM was not considered during the aforementioned pandemics. Although KMDs have emphasized the use of Korean medical approaches during the swine flu and MERS epidemics, they were not able to participate in their prevention. Therefore, it is a historical event that KMDs have directly treated patients during the fierce battle against COVID-19 and that one out of 5 confirmed cases of COVID-19 opted to receive KM treatments via teleconsultation.
