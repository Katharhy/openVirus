<p id="par0050">My presentation is primarily focused on teleconsultation and treatment. If a patient on antihypertensives is tested positive for COVID-19, he cannot visit a hospital or replenish his medication before it runs out. Therefore, the government temporarily opened remote consultation centers, which have been avoided for a long time. We utilized this temporary opportunity to actively introduce the KM teleconsultation and the government has validated its legality. The biggest advantage of remote treatment is that the safety of both patients and doctors is assured. However, the disadvantages include difficulty in diagnosis, low accuracy of checking the vital signs, and a long consultation time. Here, I would like to discuss primary care and physicians on-site. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) health statistics,

 </xref> the primary care physicians constitutes 27% of the total number of medical doctors in South Korea and this number includes KMDs in South Korea. Approximately 80% of all patients with COVID-19 in South Korea have been mild-stage patients. How can we treat this large number of patients? This problem is not specific to South Korea. To prevent the collapse of medical systems worldwide, it might be a good idea to allow primary physicians including KMDs to play a sufficient role in managing this pandemic. Therefore, while remote treatment is an alternative, it could be beneficial to make the most of it during this acute disaster situation.
