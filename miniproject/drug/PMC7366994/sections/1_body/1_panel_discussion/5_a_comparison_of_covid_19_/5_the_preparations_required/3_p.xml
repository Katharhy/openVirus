 <bold>Choi:</bold> The most significant differences between Korea and China, in terms of respiratory infections, lie in the integration of WM and TCM or KM. China has promoted the outstanding effect of TCM against COVID-19 pneumonia. I believe TCM has been successful owing to the fact that it was administered with fluids and respirators when pneumonia patients were hospitalized. In contrast, in Korea, where collaborative treatment on acute infections is not practiced, the KM treatment was limited to mild or recovering cases over the phone, without the co-administration of WM. Therefore, for infectious diseases, wherein the role of public healthcare is of the utmost importance, it might be necessary for the KM community propose methods for effectively participating in collaborative treatments. To this end, we should be supported from the public healthcare system by the government and the conflicts among WM doctors and KMDs should also be minimized. It might be a good idea that the next 5-year R&amp;D project to develop KM includes infectious diseases and positive results can be derived by incentivizing private or public medical institutions that decide to participate in the collaborative treatment of infectious diseases, or in conducting the relevant research. The KM community can benefit from helping government officials to understand the minimum requirements for us to contribute toward the fight against epidemics and establish a solid basis. For example, the KM Policy division in the Ministry of Health and Welfare can discuss with authorities in the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention and other public healthcare sectors. Therefore, we should take steps to ensure the KM community can work collaboratively with the WM community in future scenarios.
