 <bold>Choi:</bold> Consultation and provision of herbal prescriptions to confirmed cases of COVID-19 over the phone was an unprecedented move. Considerable efforts and sacrifices have been made, including those from the Association of Korean Medicine. From the KM teleconsultation center, data are being collected and reviewed by an advisory committee with dedication, and I am proud to have partaken in this valuable work. Understanding how to organize this precious data regarding KM treatment that have been collected from more than 2000 patients is another noteworthy challenge. Careful planning is generally crucial for collecting clinical data to be meaningful and informative if it is to lead to valid evidence. With the significant time-related pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic, conducting analyses may be a challenging task. However, descriptive statistics show the current KM treatment status. Although the data are based on patients with mild cases of COVID-19, we can gain insights from reviewing statistics, such as the treated patient group, primarily observed symptoms, and the prescriptions provided. The current situation is considered a miracle in itself.
