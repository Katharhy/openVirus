<p id="par0095">An area wherein the KM community should focus on improvement is linking our data with the utilization of the health insurance system. An infectious disease is particularly addressed by the public healthcare system. Unfortunately, the participation of KMDs in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic occurred outside the public healthcare system provided by the government. Sharing data from the public healthcare system with only the prescriptions that are not covered by insurance is a difficult task. Even a single claim is sufficient to establish an association with public health insurance data. Index data (e.g., death rate and hospitalization due to reactivation) can be viewed by the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service or the National Health Insurance Service. This approach enables not only simple data analysis but also cohort research using big data. We cannot expect a vaccine or remedy to be developed in the near future because it generally takes long. Based on these situations, the importance of the fundamental translational research on KM examining the antiviral effects of herbal medicines can be emphasized. The establishment of a laboratory for infectious diseases can help us screen the effective individual herbs or herbal medicine preparations in the early stages of epidemics. Therefore, we can integrate the knowledge of KM and promptly develop effective treatment strategies specifically designed for Korea.</p>
