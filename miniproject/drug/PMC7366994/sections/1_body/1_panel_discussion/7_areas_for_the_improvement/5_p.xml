<p id="par0130">The symptom assessment also includes fatigue. Because of its subjective nature, deriving an objective assessment of fatigue is a difficult task. However, 5- or 7-point Likert scales or a visual analog scale can be used. In addition, the severity of symptoms, such as dry mouth, headache, and muscle pain can be distinctly classified. I also recommend using generalized tools, such as 5- or 7-point Likert scales or VAS for this purpose. Moreover, vomiting can be accompanied by nausea or may be perceived as a preceding symptom. Distinguishing between the two symptoms can be difficult. Assessing nausea and vomiting as a single item may have provided better results. Indicating the severity of nausea does not provide significant help, in terms of clinical data. Instead, differentiating between nausea and vomiting and keeping track of how often these symptoms occurred by writing down the frequency of occurrence during a specific period can prove to be useful. For diarrhea, I have already presented the Bristol scale.

While assessing the number, it is important to consider how many times compared to the last time and average number over a few days. Moreover, a report of accompanying symptoms, such as incomplete evacuation and urgency, should be encouraged to report because it plays a crucial role in determining the prescription of KM.
