 <bold>Park:</bold> When preparing for this discussion, I carefully examined the medical charts used at the KM teleconsultation center. Even after considering both limitations that consultation is over the phone and only ready-made herbal prescriptions are available, I was able to identify a few areas for improvement. Let me begin with the charts. First, bowel movements. If patients used a standardized evaluation tool for bowel movements, the reliability of data could have been relatively higher despite the use of treatment without contact. I noted that KMDs who are involved in the preliminary diagnosis or treatment were regularly taking turns. This can lead to personal biases among the doctors. I believe that this situation could have been avoided by using a standardized tool, e.g. the Bristol stool scale.

If consultation and prescription using telecommunication technology such as video is available, it would make things much easier. I believe the use of a simple smartphone application that requests patients to make a simple choice could lead to increasingly accurate results.
