<p id="par0125">Second, I focus on fever, one of the most important symptoms in infectious diseases. It was noted that patients were asked to check their temperature on their own. However, the charts alone cannot determine when the measurements were taken or to be taken again later, or how patients felt when the temperature was taken. To improve the chart, I would adjust measurement intervals between 2–8 h, depending on a patient’s severity, and would suggest periodic checks for vital sign of the patient. As patients also experience “chills”, I wondered whether the degree of shivers can be measured. I also considered that the presence and absence of “chills” is of higher importance because it can be an accompanied symptom of fever. Increased significance could have been attributed to determining whether or not a patient experienced “chills”. In KM, “chills” may refer to how much a person detests cold stimulus or how much a person dislikes feeling cold. Including descriptions regarding the difference between these two types of “chills” would have proven useful.</p>
