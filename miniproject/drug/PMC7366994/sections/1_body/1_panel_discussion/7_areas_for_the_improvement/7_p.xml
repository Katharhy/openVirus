<p id="par0140">Finally, if we consider clinical research, I believe that including the safety data is essential as the general public is worried that herbal medicine can have detrimental effects on the liver. We have received a lot of criticism regarding this issue. In my opinion, including a question about side-effects in the chart currently used at the KM teleconsultation center was a good decision. Furthermore, I believe that continuous monitoring of adverse events can help construct data regarding frequently used herbal prescriptions. We may also conduct a follow-up study with regular observations or introduce a system wherein a patient can receive an objective evaluation, such as a blood test. We could be benefited by considering the possibility of evaluating the complete recovery rate and the time required to complete recovery, the morbidity rate, the rate of reconfirmed cases, and the degree of improvement in the quality of life among people who received KM treatment through a follow-up study over a specific period of time after their complete recovery.</p>
