<p>Looking at the major pandemics of respiratory viruses, we are mainly exposed to the influenza virus, the pandemics that occurred in 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009, and various theories predict that the next pandemic of this category of respiratory infections will occur between 2020 and 2050 and be capable of causing a human epidemic (Holmes,

The “flu shot” or annual vaccine is the best way to prevent the flu, and all high‐risk healthcare workers are advised to be vaccinated every year. But sometimes more dangerous and even deadly forms occur that are likely to lead to epidemics and pandemics (Andrews,
