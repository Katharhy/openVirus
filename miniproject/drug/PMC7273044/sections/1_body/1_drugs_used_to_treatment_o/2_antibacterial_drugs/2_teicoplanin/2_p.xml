<p>A glycopeptide antibiotic commonly used to treat a bacterial infection is active against SARS‐CoV and is on the list of drugs that are also used to treat COVID‐19 (J. Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="jcp29785-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). This antibiotic is commonly used to treat Gram‐positive bacterial infections, especially staphylococcal and streptococcal infections, which are effective against viruses such as Ebola, influenza virus, flavivirus, hepatitis C virus, HIV, and on coronaviruses such as MERS‐CoV and SARS‐CoV (Lo, Spengler, Erickson, &amp; Spiropoulou, 
 <xref rid="jcp29785-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Teicoplanin acts in the early stages of the virus's life cycle, which is blocked by the low pH cleavage of the viral spike protein by cathepsin L in the late endosomes, thus blocking the release of the viral RNA genome and the virus replication cycle (Cathepsin L requires entry of the 2019‐nCoV virus into the cell, the S protein region known as target teicoplanin, which is also present in the 2019‐nCoV virus). A study by Junsong Zhang found that cleavage site cathepsin L is conserved between SARS‐CoV and 2019‐nCoV S protein. The concentration of teicoplanin required for IC50 in vitro is 1.66 μM, well below the human blood concentration (8.78 μM for a daily dose of 400 mg; J. Zhang et al.,
