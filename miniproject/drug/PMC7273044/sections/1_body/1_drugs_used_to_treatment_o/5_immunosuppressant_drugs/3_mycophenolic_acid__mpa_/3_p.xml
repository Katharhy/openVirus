<p>MPA acts as a synergism with IFN‐β1b and thiopurine analogs but it has less protective effect than the combined effect of lopinavir/ritonavir with IFN‐β1b. The use of this compound in bedside coronaviruses was that with the IFN‐β1b used in Saudi Arabia to treat MERS‐CoV all patients using this drug combination could survive but patients had lower acute physiology and chronic health (Allison &amp; Eugui,
