<p>Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor (NAIs) used to treat influenza A and B infections and reduces the mortality of patients, especially those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Oseltamivir and zanamivir are first‐line medications for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza. Oseltamivir reduces the proliferation of influenza viruses in a dose‐dependent manner and prevents epithelial barrier dysfunction and cytotoxicity for up to 4 days. It is an ethyl ester prodrug that is hydrolyzed by hepatic esterases to its active form, oseltamivir carboxylate and has a longer half‐life than oseltamivir. The effectiveness of oseltamivir in reducing the mortality of patients with H5N1 influenza virus was related to when the drug was used before the onset of respiratory failure (75 mg oral dose twice daily; Adisasmito et al.,

The duration of drug use is 5 days, but in people with influenza and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia or immune deficiency, the drug duration can be increased to 10 days (Uyeki et al.,
