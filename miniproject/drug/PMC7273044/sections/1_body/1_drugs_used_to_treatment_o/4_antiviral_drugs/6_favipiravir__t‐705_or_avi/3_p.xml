<p>A study by Fang et al. (
 <xref rid="jcp29785-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) found that favipiravir could play an important role in protecting mice from the fatal infection of wild‐type and oseltamivir‐resistant‐influenza B viruses. Favipiravir has also been used in combination with zanamivir to successfully clear the type B influenza virus in immunocompromised children (Lumby et al., 
 <xref rid="jcp29785-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). In a randomized clinical trial, Chen et al. (
 <xref rid="jcp29785-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) showed that in patients with moderate COVID‐19 who were untreated with antiviral drugs, favipiravir increased clinical recovery over 7 days and reduced fever, cough, and respiratory problems, it was therefore used as an effective drug in these patients. Another study by Jianjun Gao on 80 patients with COVID‐19 at the Hospital of Shenzhen, China, showed that favipiravir had a stronger antiviral effect than the lopinavir/ritonavir drug combination and reported no adverse effects (Furuta, Komeno, &amp; Nakamura,
