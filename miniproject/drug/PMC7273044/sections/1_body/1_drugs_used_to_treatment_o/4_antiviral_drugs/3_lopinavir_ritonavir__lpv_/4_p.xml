<p>Jinyu Xia's study also showed that the combined effect of Arbidol with LPV/r was greater than that of LPV/r (16 patients received oral Arbidol with LPV/r and 17 patients received LPV/r alone). Arbidol has been shown to have a direct antiviral effect on the initial in vitro replication of SARS‐CoV (Deng et al.,
