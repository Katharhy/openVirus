<p>Recently, in a nonhuman primate model (rhesus macaque), the therapeutic effect of remdesivir on MERS‐CoV infection was investigated, with remdesivir being injected 3 hr before virus inoculation. The results showed that remdesivir prevents lung damage from the virus. However, the same results were observed when remdesivir was injected into the laboratory model 12 hr after virus inoculation. Human trials have shown that remdesivir is safe in the human body so the effect of this compound against new coronaviruses can be investigated (Brown et al.,
