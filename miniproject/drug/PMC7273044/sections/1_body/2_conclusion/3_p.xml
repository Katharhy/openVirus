<p>However, the use of hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis is appropriate because it blocks the entry of the virus and prevents virus replication, and remdesivir has extensive antiviral activity against coronaviruses. Therefore, the appropriate recommendation for the treatment of patients with COVID‐19 is a combination of existing drugs. IFNα‐2b together with ribavirin, when used for the treatment of MERS‐CoV, showed that their effective dose was decreased compared to the single‐dose regimen and better‐stimulated cytokine release and inflammatory responses, and decreased viral replication, modulated host response, and improved clinical outcomes. Ribavirin plus lopinavir/ritonavir in patients with SARS‐CoV reduces ARDS and mortality, and in patients with SARS‐CoV who receive corticosteroids with ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir, their ARDS and mortality significantly decreased. Lopinavir also has a stronger antiviral effect than the LPV/r, and the combination of arbidol and LPV/r is more effective than LPV/r. In addition to these drugs, if ACE2 is presented in its soluble form as a suitable recombinant protein, it may be a new factor in counteracting the spread of coronavirus as well as its proliferation in infected individuals. Another possible treatment option could be the use of serums that are obtained from the blood of patients infected with the new coronavirus during their recovery and also targeting the cellular components involved in the host's inflammatory response to the virus is also a good way of targeting viral damage by targeting a cellular protein.</p>
