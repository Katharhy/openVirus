<p>Considering the gerolavic nature of COVID-19, where the majority of the seriously affected population is older than 60, classical prevention and treatment strategies may not be effective. Given the severity and lethality of the pandemic, even healthcare systems in developed countries will find it challenging to cope with the increased disease burden and hospital needs. Conventional approaches to prevention such as vaccines are much needed, but even these do not offer complete protection in the elderly due to multi-morbidity and age-related immune declines. Therefore, interventions that enable immunocompromised elderly to mount an immune response to newly developed vaccines are necessary to help eradicate the disease and reduce the associated mortality.</p>
