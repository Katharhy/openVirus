<p>Statistics from the COVID-19 pandemic indicate that COVID-19 is a gerolavic infection, one that disproportionately affects the elderly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). The majority of the infected population are 50 and older, while the majority of the deceased are 60 and older [
 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. At the same time, fewer than 10% of the infectedwere 30 or younger, while mortality rates are 2.8% in males versus 1.7% in females [
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, these values for the young are skewed upwards because of higher mortality among the elderly. According to Worldometers [
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], an online resource aggregating data on COVID-19, of the 139,580 people infected worldwide as of March 13, 2020, 70,733 patients had recovered and 5,120 had died. Based on these data, the mortality rates (number of deaths/number of cases), or the probability of dying if infected by the virus, were determined to be 3.6% for individuals aged 60-69, 8% for individuals aged 70-79, and 14.8% for patients aged 80 years or older. An open coronavirus analysis project by the Nobel Laureate Michael Levitt [
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and a recent study by Mizumoto et al. [
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] provide further insight into the mortality rates of COVID-19, specifically using data from the Diamond Princess Cruise, where all passengers were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 for an extended period. Of the approximately1,690 passengers over 65 years of age, 7 passengers died, suggesting a death rate of 0.41%. This death rate is approximately 4.3 times higher than that of influenza. As more countries start reporting statistics, these death rates are likely to be adjusted. These statistics indicate that the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, and the severity and lethality of COVID-19, are age-related.
