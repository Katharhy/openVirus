<p>Caution should be exercised when conducting any clinical trials for NAD boosters against gerophilic and gerolavic infections, as the underlying biology of NAS metabolism and viral infections is still poorly understood. Recent studies in humans demonstrate that NR supplementation reduces the levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines [
 <xref rid="r98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>], while Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) may reduce the expression of these cytokines [
 <xref rid="r99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Other studies implicate NAD in increased cytokine production [
 <xref rid="r100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] and the NAD+-consuming enzyme CD38 in increased inflammation [
 <xref rid="r101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Additional immunological studies of NAD boosters must be performed before clinical trials may be conducted. However, considering the large consumer base of NR and NMN supplements, it may be possible to conduct metastudies on influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, severity, and lethality.
