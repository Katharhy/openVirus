<p>An age-related decrease of thymic function consequently reduces the levels of specific T cell subsets [
 <xref rid="r109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. FOXP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical in homeostasis of the immune system and are believed to start declining in numbers at around 50-60 years of age; this remains one of the fundamental drivers of immunosenescence. There are two known origins for Treg cells: thymus-derived Treg cells and peripherally-derived Treg (pTreg) cells. Thus, inducing a peripheral Treg response in older individuals might be a feasible strategy for increasing Treg cell levels until we have more plausible options for thymic rejuvenation. FOXP3 transcription factor (TF) is the most important regulator of Tregs and age-associated immunosenescence. FOXP3 TF expression is regulated by chemical modification by sirtuin (sirt) and histone deacetylases, in particular Sirt1 and HDAC9 [

 <xref rid="r111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Interestingly, NAD is essential for sirtuin action. Therefore, it is plausible that NAD and NAD-related compounds such as NR and NMN, which are under investigation as therapeutic interventions that increase serum and cellular NAD levels, also act via Sirt1 along the FOXP3 and Treg axis, and play a role in immunosenescence and “inflammaging”.
