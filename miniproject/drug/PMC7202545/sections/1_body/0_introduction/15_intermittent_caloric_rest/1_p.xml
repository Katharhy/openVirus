<p>It has been shown in multiple studies that calorie restriction leads to increased lifespan and improved cardiometabolic markers, even when initiated in middle age [
 <xref rid="r106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Caloric restriction should be considered as a preventive measure on a long-term basis and is indicated for younger individuals. Some elderly patients already have frailty syndromes and evident sarcopenia/ osteopenia, which limits the suitability of intermittent caloric restriction. Nevertheless, the benefits of time-restricted feeding and intermittent fasting go beyond simple caloric restriction due to the production of ketones. Ketones are active signaling molecules that play a major role in the PPAR, sirtuin, NAD and CD38 pathways, encourage autophagy (the removal of damaged cellular materials), modulate the immune response, and have been explored in clinical trials as an adjuvant therapy for cancer treatments [
