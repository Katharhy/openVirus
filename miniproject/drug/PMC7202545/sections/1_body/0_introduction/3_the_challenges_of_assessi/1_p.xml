<p>The online resources Our World in Data [

 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] provide deep visual insight into the global burden of disease by cause and demographics. In 2017, there were 56 million deaths globally; over two-thirds of these (76%) were in people over 50 years of age. According to the online period life tables put out by the US Social Security Administration [
