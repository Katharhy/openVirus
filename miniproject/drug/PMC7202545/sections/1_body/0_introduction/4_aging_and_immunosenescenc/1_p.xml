<p>One of the possible causes of the age-associated increases in COVID-19 infection rate, severity, and lethality is immunosenescence. Immunosenescence is a well-known age-related process contributing to the global burden of disease [
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It is among the major factors underlying the difference between younger and older populations in the response rate to vaccinations and the virulence of infectious diseases [
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Among the factors contributing to immunosenescence is the chronic involution of the thymus gland with increased age. Indeed, the infection rates of COVID-19, separated by age, are correlated with involution of the thymus [
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The thymus gland is most active early in life, reaching maximum size within the first year. Its activity then declines with age until an individual reaches 40 to 50, after which there are negligible traces of the thymus remaining, replaced by fibrotic tissue [
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As a result of thymic involution, the number of naïve T cells exiting the thymus decreases significantly, with substantial declines in older age [
