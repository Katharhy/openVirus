<p>Besides thymic involution, there are many other factors driving immunosenescence and the increase in multimorbidity that occurs during aging [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the hypothesised reciprocal relationship between immunosenescence and infectious disease acquisition. In this model, age-associated immunosenescence leads to a reduced ability to resist infection, while infection produces biological damage and loss of homeostasis. This ultimately contributes to accelerated aging and the development of age-related diseases, and further accelerates immunosenescence. In support of this model, infections and other age-related diseases are among the main causes of death in the developed world and in developing countries.
