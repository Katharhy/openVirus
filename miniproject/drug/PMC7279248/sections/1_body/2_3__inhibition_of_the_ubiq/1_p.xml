<p>The ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) is important for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and also in viral replication processes. The UPS system is a complex process that leads to the degradation of ubiquitinated target proteins through the cutting action of the proteosome. Proteosome inhibitors are therefore molecules that are capable of inhibiting proteoasome activity, inducing the inhibition of the UPS response. We, in this review, focus our attention on the inhibition of proteasome activity by drugs already routinely used in many tumor pathologies. Some studies have focused on the role played by the ubiquitin–proteasome system and its inhibition in the process of entry and replication of the coronavirus [

Several studies have shown that virus infection leads to the accumulation of protein–ubiquitin conjugates, suggesting an important role of the increased ubiquitination process in ubiquitin–proteasome-mediated viral replication or protein degradation. Furthermore, the accumulation of proteins explained by the inhibition of proteasome activity causes a blockage of protein synthesis, endoplasmatic reticulum stress and cell death, leading to the inhibition of viral replication [
