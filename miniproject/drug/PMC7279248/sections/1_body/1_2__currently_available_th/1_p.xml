<p>To date, there is no vaccine available, nor a specific antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2. The current therapeutic strategies used to cope with this pandemic are mainly based on symptomatic and respiratory support. On 28 January 2020, the WHO published a document summarizing its guidelines and scientific evidence derived from the treatment of previous HCoV epidemics [

Furthermore, the scientific world works constantly and is looking for an effective therapy, mainly based on strategies previously used against SARS-CoV and MERS - CoV. Interferons nebulization and various antivirals were initially used, including Nafamostat, Nnitazoxanide, Rribavirin, Penciclovir, Ffavipiravine, Rritonavir, Baricitinib, Lopinavir, Oseltamir and Arbidol. However, Remdesivir has been shown to be most effective in reducing viral load [
 <xref rid="B38-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] (GS5734). As an RNA polymerase inhibitor, it has been shown, alone or in combination with chloroquine or interferon-β, to effectively block the replication of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B39-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Based on experience in the fight against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, antiviral drugs and systemic treatment with corticosteroids commonly used previously in clinical practice, including neuraminidase inhibitors (Oseltamivir, Peramivir, Zanamivir, etc.), Ganciclovir, Aciclovir and Rribavirin, as well as methylprednisolone [

Another effective drug is chloroquine (500 mg every 12 h) and hydroxychloroquine (200 mg every 12 h), drugs used for many years in the treatment of malaria, and today also in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Several possible mechanisms have been studied. Chloroquine can inhibit the pH-dependent phases of the replication of different viruses [
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], with a powerful effect on the infection and spread of SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B45-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Furthermore, chloroquine has immuno-modulatory effects, suppressing the production/release of TNF-α and IL-6. Several studies have found that chloroquine interferes with the glycosylation of SARS-CoV cell receptors [
 <xref rid="B45-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and has worked in both the entry and postentry stages of COVID-19 infection in Vero E6 cells [
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In Italy, a large survey conducted by the National Cancer Institute and the Pascale Foundation of Naples focused on the use of tolicizumab. It is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody, directed against the IL-6 receptor and commonly used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Passive immunization has been successfully used for the treatment of infectious diseases, and 80 SARS patients were treated with convalescent plasma during the last major outbreak, while the same treatment did not occur for MERS. Since many patients have recovered despite the high number of deaths, this could also be a strategy for SARS-CoV-2.
