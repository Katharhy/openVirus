<p>In the absence of definitive protocols, effective antiviral care and a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the scientific community should explore possible therapeutic strategies, relying mainly on those used in previous epidemics. In this review, we summarized the current knowledge regarding the use of drugs, and in particular of ubiquitinâ€“proteasome system inhibitors, which were proven to be powerful tools in reducing the cytokine storm and in inhibiting virus replication for other coronaviruses (

Several molecules appear to be promising candidates; in particular, MG132, epoxomycin, bortezomib and carfilzomib have the potential to affect both viral replication as well as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Further studies are now warranted in order to establish the clinical efficacy of these compounds and to compare the clinical outcomes of patients.
