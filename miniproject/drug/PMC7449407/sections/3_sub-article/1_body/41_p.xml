<p>Reviewer #2: This retrospective study offers an interesting and well designed point of view on an epidemiological infective outbreak in Indiana happened in 2015. The language used is correct and perfectly clear. Sample size appears wide enough to be significant for the purpose of this research and statistical analysis has been conducted appropriately. In my opinion, the authors have operated rigorously in the planning process, obtaining a wide range of results during the first selective part in the geographical media, the Twitter API. Unfortunately, some relevant data could have been lost due to privacy policy of single users. Then, thanks to the widely used and approved BTM followed by NLP process, all the results have been divided based on risk factors for HIV, IDU and heroin abuse, noticing a significant increase compared with precedent data. Correlation with the outbreak is potential and fortified by the NLP process that identified and removed news and non-generated user tweets. Furthermore, thanks to the analysis, the authors obtained data from the public intervention and its increase immediately after the outbreak. At the end a clear and exhaustive explanation on the limitations of this study offers new interesting starting-points for other studies. Could it be possible to evaluate similarly data from other social medias? Could it be possible to prevent future outbreaks monitoring the trend of some specific word patterns on the web making it a new alert for a ready public intervention? Those aspects could be evaluated in future studies.</p>
