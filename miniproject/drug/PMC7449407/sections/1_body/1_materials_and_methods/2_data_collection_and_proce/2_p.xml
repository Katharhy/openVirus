<p>After isolating tweets timestamped during the outbreak period, we filtered tweets for a geospatial shape file limited to the state of Indiana that resulted in a total of 10,148,663 tweets. We then applied a text filtering process using keywords based on three topics: HIV, heroin, and opioids similar to keywords used in other related studies. We also filtered our dataset for common “street” or “slang” terms associated with heroin and IDU and prescription opioid drug abuse (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0235150.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for a list of filtered keywords). This provided us with a target dataset of 5,112 tweets consisting of messages geolocated in Indiana and that also contained a relevant targeted keyword that we then processed for thematic analysis using NLP.
