<p>The above characteristics were chosen primarily to remove news and non-user generated tweets from our filtered dataset. This process allowed us to use BTM to filter out thousands of tweets unrelated to the study aims (i.e. here we define “signal” as tweets related to HIV, opioid, or heroin/IDU self-reported user knowledge, attitudes or behavior), and then isolate “signal” tweets with specific relevance to our study. Due to BTM’s topic modeling technique, news tweets and behavioral tweets tend to be assigned to different topic clusters, so we were able to isolate the news clusters and irrelevant behavioral clusters and excluded them from further analysis.</p>
