<p>This study conducted a retrospective analysis of tweets geolocated in Indiana during the immediate pre and post phase of the 2015 HIV outbreak. Specifically, the study used an unsupervised machine learning approach using NLP to detect messages related to user behavior associated with opioid abuse, heroin injection drug use, and HIV, critical elements of the risk environment that led to the 2015 Indiana outbreak. We did this in the hopes of finding specific “signal” of risk factors that may have preceded the outbreak. Overall, we found a relatively small volume of Twitter conversations directly related to the Indiana outbreak and most conversations occurring in the post-outbreak period.</p>
