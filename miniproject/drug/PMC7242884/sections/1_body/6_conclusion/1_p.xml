<p>Compulsory licensing is a powerful public health tool â€“ it can be instrumental for alleviating insufficient supplies of necessary pharmaceuticals as well as mitigating prohibitively expensive drug prices. Conceivably, countries may face both problems when a COVID-19 cure is ushered to market. While the rewards of patent protection are necessary to support continual innovation, the compulsory licensing exception exists for public health emergencies such as the current COVID-19 crisis. Governments must do what is necessary to fight the present pandemic. International organizations can play a key role by providing the legal know-how as well as setting a supportive tone for using compulsory licensing. In the process, pharmaceutical companies and G20 countries should not deter or retaliate against developing countries pursuing such public health measures in the time of a pandemic.</p>
