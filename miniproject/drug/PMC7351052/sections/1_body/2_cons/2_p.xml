<p id="par0055">Some data have shown discouraging outcomes when steroids are used in viral lung infections. Evidence from observational studies suggests a higher mortality rate when steroids are used in influenza-induced acute lung injury. A recent meta-analysis of 10 studies enrolling a total of 6548 patients reported that the use of steroids was associated with increased mortality and length of ICU stay in patients with influenza pneumonia (

Moreover, steroids may increase the risk of developing other systemic complications, such as autoimmune and cardiovascular events, and can promote resistance to neuromuscular blocking agents, which are widely used during mechanical ventilation in patients with SARS (
