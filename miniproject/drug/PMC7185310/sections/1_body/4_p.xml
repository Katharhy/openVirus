<p>On the contrary, a strain-matched B cell response can provide close to, if not, sterilizing protection. The limitation, as already stated, is the antigenic drift of the new strains that constantly arise in the global human population as immunity to the circulating strain increases in the population after infection or thanks to immunization with seasonal influenza vaccines. A few years ago, it was found that broadly crossreactive antibodies could be generated against IAVs, and inducing this type of immunity through vaccination is the focus of current enhanced efforts (
