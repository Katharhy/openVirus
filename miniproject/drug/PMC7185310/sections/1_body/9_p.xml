<p>The effectiveness of the immune mechanisms related to each specific response (for B and T cells) is also important for the multiple specificities. For example, a specific neutralizing antibody capable of blocking infection or generating “sterilizing immunity” would likely be more effective than a specific cytotoxic T cells response that requires infection or a specific antibody that only works through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The more effective the multiple individual immune response components are, the less likely specific adaptive mutations will occur in an individual. Conversely, the less effective the individual responses are, the more likely specific adaptive mutants could arise.</p>
