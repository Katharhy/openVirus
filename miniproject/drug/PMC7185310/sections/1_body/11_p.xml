<p>So how can virus evolution be slowed? Perhaps clues may be gathered from chronic infections such as HIV or hepatitis C virus. In these infections, the virus can escape immune pressure mediated by both T cell and B cell specificities, leading to the generation of quasi-species in the host. The basis of virus evolution is the intrinsic unfaithful nature of the viral polymerase whose activity introduces systematically “errors” in the newly produced viral genomes and generates a pool of virus variants for selection, a concept shared by influenza viruses. For HIV, preventing viral replication using combinations of highly specific and synergetic drugs, called highly active antiretroviral therapies, is now the basis of viral suppression and has changed the lives of HIV-infected patients worldwide (

These highly active antiretroviral therapies depend on the use of the multiple antiviral drugs to effectively suppress viral evolution and prevent the generation of drug-resistant viruses. Monotherapies have all failed to prevent HIV evolution and have resulted in the selection of drug-resistant viruses, a fate that is also true for the treatment of influenza with adamantanes.
