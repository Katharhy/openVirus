<p>IAVs cause seasonal outbreaks worldwide and occasionally severe pandemics that are a significant burden in morbidity, mortality, and economic loss. The continuous evolution of IAV through mutations and reassortments provide the overall mechanisms to explain why previous exposure to IAV does not confer permanent protection against IAV infection. The key molecules targeted by B cell immunity are the two major IAV surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). For most pandemics, zoonotic IAVs with viral glycoproteins previously uncirculated in humans gain the ability to replicate and efficiently transmit to humans. For seasonal IAV epidemics, progressive antigenic drift, especially around the sialic acid binding site of the HA protein, generates new viral variants with amino acid changes that alter antigenic epitopes and preclude optimal recognition by pre-existing immunity. This antigenic evolution leads to the complete replacement of older strains with new viruses circulating through the human population.</p>
