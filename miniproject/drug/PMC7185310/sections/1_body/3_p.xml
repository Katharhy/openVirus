<p>Creating a universal influenza vaccine has long been a goal of influenza researchers. In the late 70s, CD8+ T cell responses to influenza were discovered to have broadly crossreactive specificities to peptides derived from more conserved internal proteins, creating hope of a more universal T cell-based vaccine (

However, CD8+ T cells have been shown in animal models to definitively provide protection against IAV disease, and a beneficial role has been suggested in human studies (
