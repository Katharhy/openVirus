<p>The objective of universal influenza HA vaccines is to generate a specific immunity in the human population to conserved regions that are broadly found in IAVs. Current candidate vaccine approaches are focused on the viral HA, particularly to the HA stem. To the extent that specific immunity can drive point mutations during an acute infection, a focused universal vaccine would create a prime opportunity for IAV to be pressured quickly and to evolve in that region. Therefore, it is important to consider what factors reduce the risk of rapid virus evolution and the mutations of antibody binding site or T cell epitopes. A more comprehensive look at virus evolution can be found in the review from Bloom and colleagues (
