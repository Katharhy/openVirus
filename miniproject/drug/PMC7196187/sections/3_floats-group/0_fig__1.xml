  <p>Collection of Specimens/samples and diagnostics methods for COVID-19: Depiction of various diagnostic methods for COVID-19 infection. CT scans can be utilized to find lung abnormalities in patients with infection, this can be a serious tool to determine severity and track progress. The NP swab taken from the patient is collected and transported to a laboratory. Here, RT-PCR analysis is conducted using specific viral gene probes targeting viral specific genes. If the viral nucleic acid is present in the specimens, the patients is diagnosed with COVID-19. Similar RT-PCR techniques are utilized to detect presence of the virus in tissue samples after autopsy and stool samples of patients exhibiting symptoms. The plasma and blood collected by venipuncture is used to detect virus specific antibodies in the blood using ELISA method using a reporter antibody. As antibodies will be present in the blood after infection, this can be utilized as a tool to detect exposure to virus. The rapid detection kits use blood from a finger prick to detect 1gG and IgM antibodies. These tests are easily accessible and do not need a laboratory for further processing.</p>
