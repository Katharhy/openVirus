 <bold>Nasopharyngeal swabs:</bold> The NP specimen is a vital and sensitive sample to test the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as suggested by the CDC. This sample could be used to analyze an asymptomatic patient with the disease. For this type of sample collection, only synthetic fibre swabs with plastic shafts are recommended, because calcium alginate or wooden-shaft swabs might inactivate the virus and could provide a negative result for the nucleic-acid assay. After the collection of the swab, it should be placed immediately into a 2-3 mL of sterile medium or saline for proper viral transport. If the NP swabs are not available, then the anterior nares and mid-turbinate specimen can also be collected from the symptomatic patients for the detection of the viral infection.
