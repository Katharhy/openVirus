<p>Although a definitive treatment or specific vaccine for this deadly viral infection is still a question to be answered, an experimental study related to convalescent plasma (CP) therapy appears as a shaft of light to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Doctors and scientists are claiming that CP therapy was effective during the past epidemics; it could be a potential treatment option in this current scenario as well. Even the ICMR has given approval for the state hospitals to register for a CP trail protocol, to initiate the clinical trials of CP therapy for the COVID-19 patients. The CP therapy is a common adaptive immunotherapy, where the patients recovered from a viral disease with high neutralising antibody titer against the virus and would be used as plasma donors to treat the affected individuals. In this therapy, when our body gets infected with the SARS-CoV-2, our immune system produces antibodies against it. These antibodies reach out to identify and mark the invading virus as the intruding foreign body inside the human system (

The CP therapy has been used to treat several infectious diseases, including Spanish flu (1917-1918) (
