<p>The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an outbreak caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread, and as per the World Health Organization (WHO) data on April 21, 2020, it has reached 213 countries, with 23,56,414 confirmed cases and 160,120 deaths (

The spread of COVID-19 is more severe than that of the previous Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), because of the increased industrialization, which led to virus evolution (

Structural studies revealed that there is a close relationship between the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is spherical, and the viral envelope entails a bilipid layer, which has the membrane (M), envelope (E), spike (S) proteins, and positive-sense RNA as genome, with an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence. SARS-CoV-2 can be viewed as a self-assembled nanostructure in which the most vulnerable and weakest part is the lipid bilayer envelope composed of phospholipid molecules. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells through ACE2 receptors, leading to COVID-19 related pneumonia, while also causing acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system (
