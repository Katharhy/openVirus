<p>The government of India has announced the call for research projects from its various funding sources and has embarked on some major research projects on COVID-19 that are relevant to national needs. This promotes the new areas of Science and Technology with special emphasis on emerging needs by providing funds for the development of vaccines and drugs in this pandemic situation. In light of this, it will become increasingly necessary to maintain systemic and coordinated efforts between the public, clinical, commercial, and industrial sectors to establish a cohesive body of knowledge and ensure robust diagnostics and treatment supply lines in the midst of this pandemic. Hence, clinical laboratories play a major role in this crisis, contributing to patient screening, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment. Hence, cooperation with various institutions, academics, governments, and pharmaceutical companies is inevitably necessary to control the virus, combat the situation, and provide solutions for any future pandemic outbreaks. In this review, we aim to discuss the updates of current diagnostics and therapeutic approaches to COVID-19 patients. As rapid diagnostics and development of vaccines and drugs for this dreadful virus are important interventions in the management of the COVID-19 outbreak, the updates on this topic are essential in the current scenario for the betterment of patients. In addition, we discuss the types of sample/specimens collected and rapid diagnostics methods for accurate results to guide treatment options. Currently, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are the most-used drugs, which have been discussed along with their mechanism of action on the virus. In addition, Convalescent plasma therapy, which is promising as a way to improve the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients, is also discussed.</p>
