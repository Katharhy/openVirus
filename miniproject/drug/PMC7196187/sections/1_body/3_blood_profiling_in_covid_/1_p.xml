<p>Blood profiles and biochemical assays are the most commonly recommended test by physicians in case of any disease conditions (
 <xref rid="S1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Various blood and biochemical abnormalities have been witnessed in patients with COVID-19. The most commonly found irregularities include leucocytosis, leukopenia, lymphopenia, increased CRP, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (

On viral entry into the body, the virus attacks the throat, causing the initial symptoms of COVID-19, further progresses to the lungs, and causes distress, following which it reaches the bloodstream (
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), resulting in the progression of the condition. In healthy individuals, white blood cells (WBCs) circulate in the blood and are attacked by foreign particles, such as bacteria and viruses. Leukocytosis occurs when there is an abnormal increase in WBCs above the normal range (3,400 to 9,600 cells/μL). This is a common sign of inflammation induced by viral entry. Similarly, leukopenia is the anomalous decrease of WBCs (less than 4,000 cells/μL) in the blood and can also result from various viral infections in which the WBCs are used more quickly than they are made. Likewise, lymphocytes are cells produced by the bone marrow involved with immunity; a dynamic balance is maintained in the number of lymphocytes in healthy individuals. Lymphopenia or reduction of lymphocytes (less than 1,000 lymphocytes/μL) is another abnormality commonly observed in COVID-19 patients. Lymphopenia is a factor that is positively correlated with disease severity (
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and may be caused by the surge in cytokines mediated by COVID-19 or by direct inactivation by SARS-CoV-2. Correspondingly, the inflammatory response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 results in the modification of levels of CRP and ESR in the blood. In COVID-19, CRP concentration rises following IL-6 secretion caused by the cytokine storm after infection. It binds to markers present on dying cells and consequently activates the complement system to mediate phagocytosis of the dead cells. As a result, CRP (normal 3.0 mg/L) is increased in patients with COVID-19. Likewise, after infection, the cytokine storm increases the fibrinogen levels in the blood; this makes the erythrocytes adhere together, increasing the ESR during times of infection. Aside from the changes in the blood portfolio, LDH, a common component of cells of various organs, is increased in COVID-19. The normal blood LDH level is 140-280 units/L, but when the cells or tissues are damaged, LDH is released into the serum, increasing its levels. Hence LDH is used as a test to detect cell or tissue injury. Like LDH, procalcitonin is normally negligible in the blood (0.01 μg/L) but increases once stimulated by cytokines. The lungs and liver also produce procalcitonin as a response to inflammatory cytokines. These processes increase the levels of procalcitonin in the blood upon infection or injury. This is concomitant with increased levels of AST and ALT, indicating liver damage. Since many reports have observed kidney and liver injury in patients with COVID-19, these markers could thus be elevated (
 <xref rid="S1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The changes in the levels of these components suggest that COVID-19 may be involved with damage to various tissues and cells in the body. It is imperative to closely monitor the changes in these parameters to uncover early biomarkers of COVID-19. Changes in levels of these cells and molecules may happen well in advance of the onset of typical COVID-19 symptoms. Moreover, a deeper understanding of the changes in these parameters will aid in the development of therapies for COVID-19. Further investigation is needed in this area for a better understanding of these abnormalities in blood parameters to provide accurate therapeutic drugs for COVID-19.
