<p id="Par6">To compare the scientometric aspects of the studies on SARS, MERS and Covid-19, three separate datasets of publications on these three topics were retrieved from Scopus through three separate search strategies. The decision on which general database to use (e.g. Web of Science (WoS) or Scopus) was mainly made on the basis of the number of indexed Covid-19 studies in particular, as the sector of the coronavirus literature that is currently emerging (compared to the literatures on SARS and MERS that have already stabilised). At the time of the data retrieval (May 2020), WoS had indexed slightly less than 5,000 research items on Covid-19, while the number of items in Scopus neared 12,000. Given the fact that the Scopus database was considerably more up to date in that respect, this database was set as the main source of data extraction in this work. Therefore, for the sake of consistency, the data for SARS and MERS were also extracted from Scopus.</p>
