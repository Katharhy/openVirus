 <xref rid="Fig27" ref-type="fig">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig31" ref-type="fig">31</xref> in the “
 <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>”, the nodes of the bibliographic coupling maps have been colour-coded by the average year of publications and the average citations per document associated with the journals that each node represent (except for the Covid-19 map that has only been overlaid with the average citations). According to these maps, 
 <italic>Emerging Infectious Diseases</italic> and 
 <italic>The Lancet</italic> have been a major source of publications for early studies on both SARS and MERS. This pattern for 
 <italic>The Lancet</italic> seems to have extended to Covid-19 studies as well, as this journal has published a substantial portion of the early studies on this topic. For SARS, the strong representation of 
 <italic>Chinese Medical Journal</italic> and 
 <italic>Chinese Journal of Microbiology and Immunology</italic> among the journals that published early studies are notable, a pattern that could be explained by the geographical origin of the SARS outbreak. Such pattern is to a less obvious extent also observable with respect to the MERS literature. It reflects on the MERS map through representations of journals such as 
 <italic>Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal</italic> and 
 <italic>Saudi Medical Journal</italic> by colours associated with early publications.
