<p id="Par28">The analyses of journal citations also showed similar patterns of scatter and relatively cohesive clusters in relation to the Covid-19 literature compared to the well-defined clusters of journal citations for SARS and MERS literatures. Consistent with the previous observation with respect to journal bibliographic coupling, the Covid-19 literature seems to be also much less cohesive in terms of its journal citation networks, when compared to the SARS and MERS literatures. As discussed earlier in relation to bibliographic couplings, this could also be partly explained by the fact that Covid-19 papers are scattered across a more diverse range of journals and broader variety of subject categories. For the maps of journal citation relations presented in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>, only the strongest citation relations have been visualised by increasing the minimum strength threshold for the citation links between pairs of journals to show on the map. The nodes have also been overlaid with the average citation colour coding. For SARS, the maps present very strong citation relations between publications in 
 <italic>Journal of Virology</italic> and those of 
 <italic>Virology</italic>, 
 <italic>PNAS</italic> and 
 <italic>Science</italic> (and to a lesser extent, with 
 <italic>Emerging Infectious Diseases</italic>, 
 <italic>The Lancet</italic> and 
 <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic>). For MERS publications, the strong citation relation between 
 <italic>Emerging infectious Diseases</italic> and 
 <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic> are the ones that most stand out. Also, for the Covid-19 literature, three pairs of strong citation relations are identifiable: first one between 
 <italic>Journal of Medical Virology</italic> and 
 <italic>The Lancet</italic>, second one between 
 <italic>Journal of Medical Virology</italic> and 
 <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic>, and third one between 
 <italic>European Radiology</italic> and 
 <italic>Radiology</italic>.
