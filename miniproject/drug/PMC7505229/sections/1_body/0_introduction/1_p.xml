<p id="Par2">On December 31, 2019 an official case of a novel respiratory disease of the category of coronaviruses, named Covid-19, was reported in Wuhan, China, marking the beginning of what proved to be one of the direst and most devastating viral outbreaks in the modern history (Sohrabi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>; Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2020</xref>). This was immediately followed by an unprecedented and swift response of the academic community to address various dimensions of this health crisis and prompted an avalanche of scholarly publications on this topic (Golinelli et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2020</xref>; Haghani et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>; Kagan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>). In less than five months, more than 12,000 publications on this topic have already been indexed by Scopus with the number increasing figuratively every day in considerable increments
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> (Torres-Salinas et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2020</xref>). And this figure does not even include many more publications available in various repositories, including CORD-19 (Colavizza et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>), in the form of preprints awaiting peer review by their respective journals. Such explosion of research on a single topic and the off-the-charts surge in the rate of publications is arguably an unprecedented trend in the history of scholarly publications. An article published by Science on May 13, 2020, referred to this phenomenon as one that is “among the biggest explosions of scientific literature ever” (Brainard 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>). It highlighted how, in the face of this phenomenon, it has become extremely challenging for scientists to stay abreast of the latest developments. This has made the importance of research synthesis more tangible than ever and has even resulted in the development of several computational research mining tools for this very topic utilising methods such as Artificial Intelligence (AI). Among such efforts is a research synthesis tool powered by AI algorithms which has harvested datapoints from a large number the CORD-19 articles and categorised them (Brainard
