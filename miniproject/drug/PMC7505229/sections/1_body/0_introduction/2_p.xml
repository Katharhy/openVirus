On November 16, 2002, the first case of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) disease was reported in the Guangdong province in southern China, which by 2003, swiftly spread from continent to continent, prompting the World Health Organisation to declare it as a pandemic.

These two constituted the two most major coronavirus outbreaks, until Covid-19 came along.
