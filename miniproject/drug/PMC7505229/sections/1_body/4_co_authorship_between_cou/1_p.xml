<p id="Par31">Collaborations of authors aggregated at the level of the countries were also analysed with respect to the SARS, MERS and Covid-19 literatures. Outputs of the analysis are presented in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16</xref>, for SARS, MERS and Covid-19 respectively. In each map, the size of nodes, each corresponding with a country, are proportional to the number of published documents with an author affiliated with the institutes of those countries. The links connecting the nodes indicate co-authorships between authors residing in the countries, while the thickness of the links represent the strength (i.e. frequency) of the co-authorships. The colour assigned to each node represents the average number of citations that studies emerged from countries have received. The minimum number of documents for country names to appear on the maps has been set to 5, a number chosen based on the criterion of the quality of the resultant maps.
