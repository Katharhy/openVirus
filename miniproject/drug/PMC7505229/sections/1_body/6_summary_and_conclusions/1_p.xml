<p id="Par44">Macro-syntheses of the scholarly literatures generated in response to the three most significant outbreaks of coronaviruses, i.e. SARS, MERS and Covid-19, revealed interesting structural similarities across all three literatures and suggested that they are commonly made up of three major segments. In each case, publications related to public health emergency management have been the earliest to merge, followed by studies on virus chemistry and clinical treatments. However, despite this similarity of the structures and the recurring patterns of publications following each outbreak, the magnitude of the rate of scholarly research prompted by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus outbreak remains a striking phenomenon, arguably, unique in the history of scientific publication. The main motive of this study was to document this major milestone and the magnitude of these scientific efforts. It is, per se, a heartening observation to note how the 2020 global health crisis has mobilised the efforts of scholars across the globe and across scientific disciplines. A question that naturally follows, however, would be to discover how the rush to combat this global crisis through scientific work has influenced the rigour and quality of the publications. This could warrant further research on this rapidly evolving literature in the form of quality assessment of publications.</p>
