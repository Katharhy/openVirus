<p id="Par16">The co-occurrence of keywords associated with the SARS, MERS and Covid-19 literatures were analysed using VOSViewer (Van Eck and Waltman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2010</xref>). Each analysis was performed on the separate set of data associated with the literature of interest. The maps of keyword co-occurrences associated with SARS, MERS and Covid-19 literatures are provided in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> respectively. The minimum number of occurrences for the keywords to be included in the map was set to 5 in all three cases. The number was chosen on the basis of the clarity of the resultant clusters. The unit of analysis has also been set to 
 <italic>all keywords</italic> (that includes both 
 <italic>author</italic> and 
 <italic>index</italic> keywords) and the method of counting was 
 <italic>binary counting</italic>. Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig18" ref-type="fig">18</xref> in the “
 <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>” illustrate the map associated with the SARS literature overlaid respectively with the average year of publication and average number of citations associated with the studies in which these keywords have occurred. Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig19" ref-type="fig">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">20</xref> present the counterpart outputs for the MERS literature analysis. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig21" ref-type="fig">21</xref> is a heatmap of Covid-19 keyword co-occurrence and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig22" ref-type="fig">22</xref> overlays the Covid-19 map of keywords in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> with the colour-coding of the average number of citations. Given that almost all studies of Covid-19 are 2020 items, the colour-coding related to the average publication year was forgone with respect to this literature. Maps of term occurrences based on the analysis of the title and abstract of studies on SARS, MERS and Covid-19 have also been presented in the “
 <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>” in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig23" ref-type="fig">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig24" ref-type="fig">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig25" ref-type="fig">25</xref> respectively. While the below analysis focuses mainly on the interpretation of the keyword maps, similar patterns are by-and-large observable through analysis of the title and abstract terms of these studies.
