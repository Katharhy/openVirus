<p id="Par21">A second cluster of keywords associated with each of the three literatures were also discovered that is attributable to the studies on the chemistry and physiology of the virus, or viral pathogenesis, or in other words, the chemical constitution of the virus (Knight 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1954</xref>), a sector of virology that investigates the biological processes and activities of viruses that take place in infected host cells and result in the replication of a virus. This cluster has been assigned the green colour in the maps of Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>. According to the maps, the most distinct terms associated with this cohort of virology studies on SARS, MERS and Covid-19 are terms such as “
 <italic>virus protein</italic>”, “
 <italic>virus entry</italic>”, “
 <italic>chemistry</italic>”, “
 <italic>metabolism</italic>”, “
 <italic>physiology</italic>”, “
 <italic>pathology</italic>”, “
 <italic>cell line</italic>”, “
 <italic>(virus/viral) protein(s)</italic>”, “
 <italic>molecular model(s)</italic>”, “
 <italic>virus genome</italic>”, “
 <italic>virus rna</italic>”, “
 <italic>virus replication</italic>”, “
 <italic>mutation</italic>”, and “
 <italic>enzyme activity</italic>”. As this sector of studies often use “
 <italic>animal model(s)</italic>”, terms such as “
 <italic>animal cell</italic>”, “
 <italic>animal experiment</italic>”, “
 <italic>controlled study</italic>”, “
 <italic>mice</italic>” and “
 <italic>mouse</italic>” have frequently appeared in the representative Cluster (ii). In reflection of the fact that these cohort of studies ultimately seek “
 <italic>drug design</italic>”, in addition to generic common terms such as “
 <italic>drug design/potency/structure/synthesis</italic>”, the names of the specific potential drugs that have been investigated in relation to each disease have appeared in this cluster. This includes terms such as “
 <italic>hydroxychloroquine</italic>” or “
 <italic>remdesivir</italic>” on the Covid-19 map. An inspection of the maps overlaid with the average year of publications for SARS and MERS in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig18" ref-type="fig">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">20</xref> in the “
 <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>” suggests that, on average, this cohort of studies are generally the last to appear in the published domain compared to the two other major clusters, but, according to Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig19" ref-type="fig">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig21" ref-type="fig">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig23" ref-type="fig">23</xref>, they receive relatively high citations on average.
