<p id="Par17">With respect to each of the three literatures, three distinct clusters of keywords were identifiable. These clusters showed certain patterns of commonality across the three datasets. Each map presents a distinct cluster of keywords that seem to be associable to the studies related to public health emergency management and the prevention of epidemic. This cluster has been assigned a yellow colour in all three maps in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> Here, this is referred to as Cluster (i). In this cluster, one can observe terms such as those associated with general public health including “
 <italic>wold health organisation</italic>”, “
 <italic>public health</italic>”, “
 <italic>public health service</italic>”, “
 <italic>global health</italic>”, as well as those associated with disease outbreaks including “
 <italic>emergency</italic>”, “
 <italic>health risk</italic>” “
 <italic>epidemics</italic>”, “
 <italic>pandemic</italic>”, “
 <italic>outbreak</italic>”, “
 <italic>viral diseases</italic>”, “
 <italic>virus infection</italic>”, “
 <italic>communicable disease</italic>”, “
 <italic>transmission</italic>”, “
 <italic>travel</italic>”. Terms representing measures of emergency severity also appear in this cluster including “
 <italic>mortality</italic>”, “
 <italic>fatality</italic>”, “
 <italic>morbidity</italic>”, “
 <italic>infection risk</italic>”. This cluster also includes terms that are linked to the prediction of disease propagation. These are terms such as “
 <italic>mathematical model</italic>”, “
 <italic>modelling</italic>”, “
 <italic>simulation</italic>”, “
 <italic>statistical model</italic>” and “
 <italic>prediction</italic>” that have commonly occurred in this cluster. The cluster includes terms affiliated with measures of disease control and spread prevention such as “(
 <italic>social/patient) isolation</italic>”, “
 <italic>quarantine</italic>”, “
 <italic>hygiene</italic>”, “
 <italic>handwashing</italic>”, “
 <italic>prevention</italic>”, “
 <italic>infection control</italic>”, “(
 <italic>population) surveillance</italic>”, “
 <italic>mass screening</italic>”, “
 <italic>(face) mask</italic>”, “
 <italic>contact tracing</italic>”. The cluster also represents keywords that are attributable to public policy making and social protection such as “
 <italic>health care planning</italic>”, “
 <italic>health care policy</italic>”, “
 <italic>health care quality</italic>”, “
 <italic>leadership</italic>”, “
 <italic>disaster planning</italic>” and “
 <italic>polices</italic>”.
