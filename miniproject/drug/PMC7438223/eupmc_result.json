    "AIMS:Our study aimed to review the impact of COVID-19 pandemia in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus, to analyze the clinical characteristics of the infection and to propose clinical practice recommendations from the Italian Society for Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology (ISPED). METHODS:A literature search was carried out in the guideline databases, Medline and Embase and in Diabetes Societies websites until May 21st, 2020 for guidelines and recommendations on type 1 diabetes mellitus management during COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS:COVID-19 infection in pediatric patients seems to be clinically less severe than in adults; children have so far accounted for 1-5% of diagnosed cases, with a median age of 6.7 years (1 day-15 years) and better prognosis. Clinical manifestations include mild, moderate, severe disease up to critical illness. There is currently no evidence suggesting a higher risk of COVID-19 infection in children with diabetes than unaffected peers. Besides general recommendations for pediatric patients, ISPED has proposed specific measures for patients with diabetes. CONCLUSION:COVID-19 outbreak modified type 1 diabetes management, and telemedicine has been demonstrating to be an effective new tool for patients care. Moreover psychological aspects deserve attention and future researchs are mandatory."
