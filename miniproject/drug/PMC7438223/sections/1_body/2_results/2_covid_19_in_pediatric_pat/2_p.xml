<p id="p0095">COVID-19 infection in pediatric patients seems to be clinically less severe than in adults; children have so far accounted for 1–5% of diagnosed cases, with a median age of 6.7 years (1 day–15 years) and better prognosis

 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The hypothesis that children are less susceptible to COVID-19 is intriguing, since newborn and infants can be infected, even if vertical transmission has not been certainly ruled out

 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>; a lower risk has been recently ascribed to an age-dependent expression of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 in nasal epithelium is the first point of contact for SARS-CoV-2 and the human body

Children affected by COVID-19 infection are generally asymptomatic increasing the risk of prolonged spreading of the outbreak. In fact, in more than 90% of affected children, the infection is clinically silent or is characterized by mild to moderate disease, while, in 5.2% of cases, severe form and in 0.6% critical illness have been described
