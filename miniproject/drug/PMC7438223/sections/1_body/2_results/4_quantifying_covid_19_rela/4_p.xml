<p id="p0150">A recent study aimed to establish if diabetes is a risk factor influencing the outcome and prognosis of COVID-19 reported that adult patients without other comorbidities were at higher risk of severe pneumonia, showed higher tissue enzyme levels indicating multiorgan involvement, uncontrolled inflammatory response and hypercoagulable state together with dysregulation of metabolic control, even if insulin requirement increased after infection 
 <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Worsening of metabolic control affects severity of pneumonia, together with the coexistence of comorbidities. Therefore, diabetes should be considered as a risk factor for the inflammatory storm leading to rapid worsening of COVID-19 infection.
