<p id="p0265">There is currently no evidence suggesting a higher risk of COVID-19 infection in children with diabetes than in unaffected peers. In addition, contrary to adult patients with diabetes, there are no reports suggesting that diabetes is a comorbidity associated with poor outcomes in children and adolescents. Despite the risk that the COVID-19 infection may develop into a more severe form seems to be lower if diabetes is well controlled, several practical recommendations may be useful. Children and adolescents affected by type 1 diabetes, as for other chronic conditions, need uninterrupted access to drugs, supplies, technology and care, especially in stressful situations. Since the lockdown reduced the access to outpatient clinics, pediatric diabetologists rescheduled all routine checks as telephone consultations and video-link consultations. In this stressful moment, patients and their families need to be reassured that a close link with the pediatric team is and will be available, and the medical care is maintained and reinforced. Since strict glycometabolic control is mandatory to prevent short- and long-term complications, pediatric diabetologists realized the need to develop new and alternative routes for disease management. The reduction of direct contacts among patients and healthcare team might be responsible for the worsening of metabolic control, with an increased risk of severe decompensation, even if in absence of COVID-19 infection.</p>
