<p id="p0210">Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition requiring complex clinical care and lifelong involvement, and may have significant influence not only on the physical and psychological but also on the emotional state in children, adolescents, and their caregivers. Intensive insulin treatment and new technological devices require patients and family engagement and significant modifications of daily life. Adequate food plan and exercise plan are mandatory to achieve and maintain good metabolic control. The observations based on the large number of infected people that were exposed and the evidence of person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 infection led to the social isolation of patients. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission have been applied in susceptible populations including children, especially if affected by chronic conditions like type 1 diabetes, health care providers, and fragile people. Elevated levels of stress, anxiety and depression have been reported during the outbreak, together with the fear of being infected, or infecting parents and relatives

Even if COVID-19 infection in young patients with type 1 diabetes has been rarely encountered, patients experienced the awareness of being considered as a risk group. Moreover forced sedentary behavior might negatively influence exercise programs and degree of glycemic control

Chewing and spitting out food as a compensatory behavior should be taken into account particularly if associated with weight gain and increased insulin requirement. Deterioration of metabolic control might also impair quality of life and resilience levels
