<p id="p0060">In addition to inhaled NO, donor compounds and nutraceuticals which boost NO production may also be possibilities in treating the novel virus. No trials with donor compounds or natural products like curcumin are currently underway, but due to the evidence of their efficacy in various models of cardiovascular dysfunction, donor compounds should absolutely be explored for early intervention in COVID-19. Curcumin upregulates gene expression for anti-inflammatory response by activating nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) [

Innovative delivery platforms, such as NO releasing nanoparticles, can be particularly conducive in targeting the virus's pathology in the respiratory tract before widespread systemic manifestations. Successful results would be instrumental in improving patient outcomes and curbing the inundation of health systems.
