<p id="Par2">Genomic alignments suggest that the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) from the genus 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> may be the result of recombination of genetic material from two different viruses, one similar to the Chinese horseshoe bat virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and the other closer to the pangolin virus (two divergent viruses could have infected the same organism simultaneously). To date, aside from bat coronavirus RaTG13 (96.2% similarity), the Pangolin-CoV (91.02% similarity) is the coronavirus most closely related to SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Even though the exact origin of the virus remains unclear, it is possible to infect a Chinese horseshoe bat or a pangolin with the SARS-CoV-2 and evaluate the success of the infection to determine the origin of the new virus responsible for the pandemic: did it come from animals or from a laboratory? While the absence of disease symptoms in these animals may be due to the effectiveness of their immune systems, the intensity of viral proliferation can be easily detected using the real-time PCR technique. However, the genie has already escaped from the bottle, and now we need to deal with the result, not the cause. Moreover, a ‘hand-made’ virus is likely to be effective against both animals and humans. Investigations suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may bind human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor with high affinity but computational analyses predict that the interaction is not ideal and that the RBD (receptor-binding domain) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for binding to human ACE2 receptor with an efficient solution different from those previously predicted [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This evidence is strongly arguing against culture-based scenarios. Thus, the high-affinity binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to human ACE2 receptor is most likely the result of natural selection on a human or human-like ACE2 receptor that permits another optimal binding solution to arise. However, more scientific facts are needed to answer the question about the origin of the virus. Obtaining related viral sequences from animal sources would be the most definitive way of revealing viral origins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The possibility of the existence of a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, a missing link between a bat and human or a pangolin and human can also shed light on the current pandemic. To date, however, there is no credible evidence to support the claim that SARS-CoV-2 originated from a laboratory-engineered coronavirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].
