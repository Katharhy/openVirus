<p id="Par5">For the human population, this is the third significant coronavirus infection to occur in the twenty-first century, following severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002–2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2011. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were newly identified coronaviruses of zoonotic origin in the genus 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, with a much lower incidence than SARS-CoV-2: 8,096 cases for SARS since 2002 (mortality rate ~ 10%) and 2,494 cases for MERS since 2012 (mortality rate ~ 35%). Oddly enough, SARS-CoV-2 is not very similar to the genomes of SARS-CoV (about 79%) or MERS-CoV (about 50%) [

Despite the initial reports stating that most of the laboratory-confirmed infected patients (27 of 41 cases) had links to the Wuhan seafood market where different animals, including bats, snakes, birds, pangolins, and other small mammals are normally traded within the market [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], it is now obvious that the newly identified coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted with enormous efficacy from human to human via respiratory droplets or close contact. The highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 is probably due in large part to the virus spreading via asymptomatic infected individuals [

Based on data from hospitalized patients, the majority of COVID-19 cases (about 80%) presented as asymptomatic or with mild symptoms while the remainder were severe or critical [
