<p id="p0030">It is unclear whether these cardiac conditions are provoked by Covid-19 or are just comorbidities or non-specific complications of infection. Studies during the flu epidemic in the USA and clinical practice show that inflammation due to flu may destabilise coronary plaque and cause myocardial infarction (MI) [
 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] This, in turn, is due to multiple mechanisms such as tachycardia, hypoxia, increased wall stress and inflammatory cytokines as well as thrombophilia [
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Similar links with MI were shown for more recent epidemics of SARS and Covid-19 [
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Only future studies will establish a possible relationship between Covid-19 and coronary artery disease. Only the awareness of such a link will encourage the cardiovascular community to search for it and to set appropriate studies to clarify this issue.
