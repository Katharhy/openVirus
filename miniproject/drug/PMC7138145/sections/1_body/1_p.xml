<p id="p0015">Covid-19 appears less pathogenic than previous viruses such as SARS-COV or MERS-COV. But, deaths in the Wuhan Province where the Covid-19 epidemic started were between 0.5% to 2.5% [
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In Europe, where the virus has recently migrated, the rate may be higher from 4% to 6%. However, the death rate depends on the number of infected people which is, at present, still unknown. Hypertension or coronary heart disease is present in 38% and diabetes in 19% of COVID-19 patients [
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A report on 136 Covid-19 patients shows that 26% of them required cardiovascular intensive care. They had a higher rate of death and a higher prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease than those not requiring intensive care [
 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A recent report on 72.314 cases from the Chinese centre of the disease control shows a mean death rate of 2.3% which increases to 5% in patients with cardiovascular disease and to 7.3% in those with diabetes [

 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although the vulnerability of the patients with heart diseases to Covid-19 is quite evident in these reports, the single study using multivariable regression analysis shows that only older age, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score and high values of d-dimer on admission are independent predictive values of mortality [
