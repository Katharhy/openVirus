<p id="p0040">As was the case for the SARS-COV infection, the receptor for the new 2019 Covid-19 is human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a homologue of ACE1 [
 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The virus spike protein binds to ACE2 which allows the penetration of the virus into the epithelial cells of the lungs. ACE2 is found primarily in the lower respiratory tract, rather than in the upper airway [
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This distribution can explain the few upper respiratory tract symptoms typical of flu and why Covid-19 is not just a common cold [
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Contrary to ACE1 which converts angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 2 and is a therapeutic target for hypertension and heart failure, the biology of ACE2 and its therapeutic potential is unclear [
 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is believed that ACE2 plays an antagonist part to the effects of ACE1, converting angiotensin 2 back to angiotensin 1. In view of the role of ACE2 in the penetration of 2019-nCov, drugs such as angiotensin 2 receptor blockers (ARBs) that increase angiotensin 2 plasma levels could activate ACE2 and an adverse Covid-19 pandemic [
 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. ARBs are mainly prescribed for hypertension and it has been suggested that alternative drugs to ARBs should be used to treat hypertension during the Covid-19 pandemic [
 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The caveats here are a) there is no evidence of increased ACE2 expression with ARBs in the lung b) ACE2 expression is reduced in hypertension models c) hypertension and its treatment with ARBs did not affect previous coronavirus infections.
