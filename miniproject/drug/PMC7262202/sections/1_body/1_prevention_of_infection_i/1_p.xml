<p>Due to low immunity combined with poor lung function in lung cancer patients, it is vital to ensure protection and adopt measures for prevention. During the epidemic, lung cancer patients should stay at home and minimize going outside. We suggest that a regularly ventilated, clean, and regularly disinfected environment is necessary for lung cancer patients. In addition, patients should perform proper exercises at home to enhance their immunity. Adequate sleep is essential to maintain a good emotional state, and suitable methods to relieve tension, anxiety, and other emotions should be practiced; a safe and nutritious diet without raw meat and eggs must be consumed. Finally, body temperature and respiratory symptoms should be routinely monitored to identify problems and deal with them promptly.
