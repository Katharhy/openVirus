<p>Lung cancer patients may be prone to lung infections due to low immunity or lung damage caused by chemotherapy, and targeted and immunotherapy drugs, which may lead to different degrees of lung infiltrative lesions on chest CT.

Even patients without typical clinical symptoms, and peripheral blood routine performance cannot rule out the possibility of asymptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. We recommend that patients complete epidemiological history screening, SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleic acid and IgM/IgG antibody tests at designated hospitals to rule out COVID‐19 infection from other bacteriological infectious pneumonia or drug‐induced lung injury.
