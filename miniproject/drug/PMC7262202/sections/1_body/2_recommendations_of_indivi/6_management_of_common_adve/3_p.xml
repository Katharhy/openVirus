<p>In order to reduce the incidence of nausea and vomiting, we recommend that patients rest and maintain a reasonable diet before chemotherapy. In addition to medication to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy such as ondansetron, studies have shown that psychological adjustments such as periorbital massage, listening to music, enjoying pictures, and yoga can also reduce the incidence of nausea and vomiting.

After vomiting, we recommend that patients rinse their mouths with warm water in order to keep their mouths clean as well as clearing up vomit to avoid revomiting caused by the pungent smell. Moreover, if the manifestations continue, such as abnormal vomit color, excessive vomiting and dizziness, then patients should be taken to hospital for symptomatic treatment.
