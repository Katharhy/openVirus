<p>Lung cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy may not be able to receive timely chemotherapy during the epidemic. A major concern in these patients is the reduction in antitumor efficacy due to interruption of chemotherapy. Even if there is no effect of the epidemic, during normal chemotherapy, several patients have difficulty in advancing chemotherapy due to intolerable adverse events, local medical conditions, and family factors. Therefore, while we attach importance to the adverse effects of this epidemic on chemotherapy delays in patients with lung cancer, we should also regard the adjustment of chemotherapy regimen rationally. The treatment strategies should be appropriately adjusted under the guidance of an oncologist, according to the tumor burden of the individual, stage and effect of antitumor treatment, tolerance of antitumor treatment, and local epidemic situation.</p>
