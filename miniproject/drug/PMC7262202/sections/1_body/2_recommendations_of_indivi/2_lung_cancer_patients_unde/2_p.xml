<p>We suggest that for patients with a low tumor burden and stable disease and those undergoing postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and maintenance treatment, chemotherapy in hospital can be appropriately postponed or switched to oral chemotherapy with targeted drug administration at home. For patients who need further chemotherapy, it is recommended that the treatment should be carried out under the supervision of an oncologist. A safe chemotherapy regimen with appropriate dosage should be chosen and any adverse events post chemotherapy should be closely monitored.</p>
