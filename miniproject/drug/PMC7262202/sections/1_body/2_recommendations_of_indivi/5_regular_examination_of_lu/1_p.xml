<p>Regular examination of patients with early‐stage postoperative lung cancer can be delayed. For advanced lung cancer patients receiving targeted therapy with sensitive gene mutations, the scheduled examination can be appropriately postponed or delayed on the basis of the cancer conditions. The interval between examinations can be extended to more than 2–3 months for patients with symptomatic remission or stable disease. During the postponed examination period, patients are advised to continuously take the original targeted drugs and closely monitor symptoms. Patients should be examined immediately and be kept well‐protected from infection, if symptoms progressively worsen. Examinations during chemotherapy should be performed in a timely manner as far as possible under permissible epidemic situations. The examination procedures and methods should be simplified to shorten hospital stays. After examination, patients may consult oncologists online or offline to comprehensively select the appropriate follow‐up treatment plans.</p>
