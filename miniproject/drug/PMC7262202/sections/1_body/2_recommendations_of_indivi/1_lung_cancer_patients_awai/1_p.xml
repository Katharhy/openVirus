<p>For lung cancer patients who have not yet started medical treatment, the treatment strategy should be comprehensively considered according to the tumor burden and general condition of the patient. For patients awaiting adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery, reasonable decisions should be made based on the postoperative pathology, clinical stage, genetic status, risk factors, and prognostic indicators. One study showed that lung cancer patients with a sluggish recovery can still benefit from delayed adjuvant chemotherapy starting four months after surgery without increasing mortality.

In addition, for patients with lymph node stage N2 after surgery with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations, oral EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR‚ÄêTKI) treatment at home may be considered as the optional adjuvant treatment option,
