<p>Targeted therapy is recommended for patients with advanced lung cancer with sensitive mutations such as EGFR, anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion (ALK), and ROS1 fusion.

 <xref rid="tca13424-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> Although patients can be treated at home with oral drugs, attention should still be paid to the adverse events of some targeted drugs. Patients whose symptoms are obviously relieved after targeted therapy and those with stable disease can be appropriately deferred to the hospital for review during the epidemic. Further, it is necessary to promptly consult a doctor under proper protection under emergency symptoms or obvious disease progression.
