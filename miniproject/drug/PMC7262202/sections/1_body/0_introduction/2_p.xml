<p>One study showed that among patients infected with SARS‐CoV‐2, patients with malignant tumors progress to severe disease more rapidly than noncancer patients (13 vs. 43 days,

Thus, they need to be well protected from COVID‐19. Conversely, some advanced lung cancer patients need to receive regular antitumor treatment due to the high tumor burden and deal with treatment‐related adverse events.
