 <xref rid="tca13424-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> Owing to its extremely high infectivity and the susceptibility of the population, the 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID‐19) has spread rapidly and widely in China and several other countries in less than two months. Faced with the gravity of the epidemic, China has incorporated COVID‐19 into the statutory Class B infectious diseases and controlled it in accordance with the Class A infectious diseases. Hospitals are not only the gathering places for suspected and diagnosed COVID‐19 patients but also high‐risk areas for infection. Reducing on‐site hospital gathering is a highly effective prevention and control measure to reduce the risk of cross infection, which has obviously affected the routine examination and treatment of lung cancer patients in regions affected by the epidemic.
