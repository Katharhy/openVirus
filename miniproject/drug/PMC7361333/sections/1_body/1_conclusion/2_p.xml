<p>Though possible, it is unlikely that the early viral mutations observed in Europe and then in the US after the virus emerged from China radically influenced its fitness. Moreover, their contribution to lethality is difficult to determine, since at the beginning of a pandemic event, the virus is likely to be very aggressive and its sequences would tend to be more homogenous. On the other hand, the early mutations we observed in the viral polymerase gene could have affected its processivity and fidelity, further increasing its mutation rate and the generation of viral clades progressively more heterogeneous.</p>
