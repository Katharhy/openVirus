<p>Several reports result show that SARS‐CoV‐2 is rapidly moving across countries, and new mutation hotspots are emerging in different parts of the genome.

 </xref> Such variability indeed has implications for control of the pandemic and potential emergence of viral strains with different characteristics, including increased or reduced infectivity and lethality. Although SARS‐CoV‐2 is less lethal than MERS‐CoV, up to 20% of the infected people develop rapidly a severe disease characterized by interstitial pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome that can ultimately lead to death. This is particularly evident in elderly and in people with underlying medical conditions.

 </xref> However, most of the patients remain asymptomatic or develop mild symptoms, like fever and dry cough, followed then by breathing difficulties (dyspnea), and bilateral ground‐glass opacities on chest computed tomography scans, indicating that the target cells are located in the lower airways.
