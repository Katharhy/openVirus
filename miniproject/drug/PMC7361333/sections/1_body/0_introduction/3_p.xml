<p>Viral fitness of RNA viruses is influenced by their very high frequency of mutation, which, in turn, can affect infection speed and evolution rate.

 </xref> However, the resulting genetic variability needs to be balanced between the maintenance of genetic information integrity and survival within the host.

 </xref> The viral genome mutagenic process is depended on several factors, including viral enzymes responsible for nucleic acids replication, which may have few or no proofreading and/or postreplicative nucleic acid repair capability. In addition, host enzymes, spontaneous nucleic acid damages due to physical and chemical mutagens, and recombination events can contribute to the genomic variability, together with particular genetic elements responsible for the production of new variants. Mutation rates are modulated also by additional factors such as determinants of the template sequence and structure involved in viral replication.

 </xref> Biological characterization of viral mutations provide precious insights for assessing viral drug resistance, immune escape, and pathogenesis‐related mechanisms. In addition, viral mutation studies are crucial for designing new vaccines, antiviral drugs, and diagnostic assays.
