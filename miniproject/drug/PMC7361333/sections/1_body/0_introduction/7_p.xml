<p>The extent of such mutations and their effects on infectivity and mortality is being actively examined by population genetic analyses of sequenced genomes of SARS‐CoV‐2. While some studies suggested that specific mutations may be correlated with increased transmissibility,

In fact, the final objective of viruses such as SARS‐CoV‐2 is to reach a point of equilibrium with their host and become endemic, thus allowing spreading in the absence of a high mortality rate.
