<p>The worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), the novel human pathogen, first detected in China quickly became a global health emergency, culminating with the World Health Organization publicly proclaiming the SARS‐CoV‐2 outbreak as a pandemic (11 March 2020). So far, more than 7 million people have been infected and more than 400 thousand have died, causing profound economic disruption and unsettling consolidated human traditions. SARS‐CoV‐2 is an enveloped +single‐stranded RNA virus, belonging to the 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genus, which includes two other RNA viruses that have caused recent important epidemics: SARS caused by SARS‐CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS‐CoV. SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV have caused more than 10 000 cumulative cases in the past 2 decades, with mortality rates of 9.6% for SARS‐CoV and 37% for MERS‐CoV, respectively.
