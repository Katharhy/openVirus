<p>Determination of infected subjects and mortality calculations during the epidemics are difficult. During the initial period of the epidemic, many patients were diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‚Äê19) only after developing critical illness or even at the time of death, whereas asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic patients were untested, leading to an underestimation of the denominator.

 </xref> Additional significant biases affect mortality curves: to name a few, the parameters used for death counting, the rigidity of lockdown measures, and population age. Over time, countries started adopting better policies for diagnostic polymerase chain reaction testing and lockdown strategies, and, consequently, the spread of the virus was better monitored and the data were more carefully determined.
