<p>Different with gemcitabine, both oxysophoridine and lycorine are bioactive alkaloids derived from Chinese herbal medicines. Alkaloids are a group of naturally occurring chemical compounds that contain mostly basic nitrogen atoms [

 <italic>in vitro</italic> cellular or 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> animal assays have shown that oxysophoridine has various pharmacological activities, including suppression of the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and colorectal cancer cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] by regulating apoptosis associated with the Bcl-2/Bax/caspase-3 signalling pathway, and alleviation of spinal cord injury via anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative stress and anti-apoptosis effects [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the present study, we found a new indication for oxysophoridine as a compound inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture. To our knowledge, this is the first time to report the antiviral activity of oxysophoridine. We also found that oxysophoridine could efficiently inhibit flavivirus and alphavirus replication (unpublished data), which indicated that oxysophoridine may have a broad-spectrum antiviral activity against RNA viruses.
