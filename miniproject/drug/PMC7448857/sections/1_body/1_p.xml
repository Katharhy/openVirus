<p>In this study, we tested antiviral activity of gemcitabine, lycorine and oxysophoridine against SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture, and chloroquine was used as a positive control [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Vero-E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (WIV04) [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.005 were treated with increased concentrations of compounds. The viral RNAs in cell culture media were quantified with quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). All these three compounds exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of 2019-CoV replication in infected cells as chloroquine (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(A)). The EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of gemcitabine, lycorine, oxysophoridine and chloroquine were 1.24, 0.31, 0.18 and 1.36 μM, respectively. To confirm that the inhibition of viral replication was not due to compound-mediated cytotoxicity, a cell proliferation-based cytotoxicity assay was performed. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(A), the CC
 <sub>50</sub> (50% cytotoxic concentration) values were all above 40 μM. The selectivity index (SI[CC
 <sub>50</sub>/EC
 <sub>50</sub>]) in Vero cells were above 33, 129, 222 and 30, respectively. We then performed indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for viral protein expression using anti-NP antibody to further verify the antiviral activity of all the three compounds. The number of IFA positive cells indicated the capability of virus replication and spreading within infected cells. Comparing with DMSO treated group, compounds treated groups showed significantly decreased positive cells with increased concentrations of compounds (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(B)). Consistently, the inhibitory effects of these compounds on SARS-CoV-2 replication were also displayed through dose-dependent rescuing CPE in infected cells (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(C)). Additionally, all three compounds could efficiently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in Huh-7 cells (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(D)), which indicated that their antiviral activities were not cell type dependent. Given the successful application of antiviral combination therapy for treatment of HIV and enterovirus infection, the antiviral effect of gemcitabine in combination with increased concentrations of oxysophoridine was also evaluated in Vero-E6 cells (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(E)). The expected additive inhibitory effects were observed with the combination of gemcitabine and oxysophoridine.
