  <p>The antiviral activities of gemcitabine, lycorine and oxysophoridine against SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. (A) Dose-dependent inhibition of gemcitabine, lycorine and oxysophoridine on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Vero-E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.005 were treated with increasing concentration of compounds for 24 hours. Real-time RT-PCR was used to quantify viral RNA copy numbers in culture media. The cytotoxicity of the compounds on Vero-E6 cells was examined with CCK-8 assay kit. Antiviral activity and cytotoxicity are shown in pink and blue, respectively. The EC
   <sub>50</sub> and CC
   <sub>50</sub> are displayed in the upper right corner for each compound. At least three independent experiments were performed, and one representative experiment was presented. The data were represented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) of the triplicate measurements. (B) IFA analysis of the inhibition of the compounds on SARS-CoV-2 replication. At 24 hpi, the infected cells treated with different concentration of compounds were fixed and subjected to IFA using the primary antibody against NP protein of SARS-CoV-2. (C) Characterization of antiviral activities based on CPE-reduction assay. At 48 hpi, the CPE in infected Vero-E6 cells was visualized under light microscope. (D) Dose-dependent inhibition of gemcitabine, lycorine and oxysophoridine on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in Huh-7 cells. The cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.001 were treated with increasing concentration of compounds for 72 hours, and viral RNA copy numbers in culture media were quantified through real-time RT-PCR. The asterisks denote statistical differences between indicated groups.*

Vero-E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and simultaneously treated with 10 μM gemcitabine plus different concentrations of cytidine or uridine. The asterisks denote statistical differences between indicated groups.*
