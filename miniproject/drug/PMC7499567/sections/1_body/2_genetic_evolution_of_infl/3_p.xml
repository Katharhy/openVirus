<p>Unlike other RNA viruses, the coronavirus genome replication involves RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase that has 3′-exonuclease corrective activity (Smith, Sexton and Denison 
 <xref rid="bib252" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). With the objective of immune evasion in humans and maintenance of the genotype in the 
 <italic>Homosapiens</italic> population, as has been demonstrated for the coronaviral strain HCoV-OC43, coronaviruses also maintain the antigenic drift (Ren
