<p>A method of prevention and treatment of aspiration pneumonias and ventilator-associated pneumonias may be adapted for virus-associated pneumonias. The method involves hypoosmotic (to 200–250 mM) conditioning of red blood cells (RBCs) of autogenic blood in a solution of a broad-spectrum antibiotic, with the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and heparin. This approach avoids hemolysis and uses autogenic RBCs as an intravenous depot for the delivery of antibiotics to the area of inflammation (pneumonia), where the tonicity of blood is normalized due to swelling. DMSO increases the fluidity (decreases the microviscosity) and permeability of cellular RBC membranes, which helps to deliver antibiotic into the cell. A proposed dose of DMSO (0.3–0.4 ml) does not affect morphology or functional properties of blood cells (Gurtovenko and Anwar
