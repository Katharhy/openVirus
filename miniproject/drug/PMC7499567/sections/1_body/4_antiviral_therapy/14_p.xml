<p>For this reason, it is important that chloroquine is able to change the redox status of a cell (Giovanella

 <xref rid="bib226" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib225" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). It seems that aberrant glycosylation after the decrease in acidity of intraluminal environment of Golgi complex cisternae is associated with рН-induced changes in the topology/location of glycosyltransferases in multienzyme complexes of aperiodic oligosaccharides synthesis.
