<p>The nature of RNA viruses suggests that systemic interferon alfa-2b might be effective as non-specific background therapy, taking into account the weakened state of patients. The efficacy of topical interferon solutions is doubtful, but they may be considered in case of local symptoms (rhinitis, pharyngitis etc.). Usage of systemic interferon inducers such as tilorone and cycloferon (Ekins

Background antiviral therapy also includes targeted agents that affect enzymes of the viral genome replication; this includes oseltamivir, and the most potent (but also most toxic of this group) ribavirin, as well as other novel targeted antiviral medications. Anti-replicative activity has been observed for inosine pranobex (Sliva, Pantzartzi and Votava
