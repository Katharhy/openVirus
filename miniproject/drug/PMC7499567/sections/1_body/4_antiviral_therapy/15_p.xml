<p>As all participants of the interaction between human cells and respiratory RNA viruses (glycoproteins and glycolipids) are richly decorated by glycans with terminal sialic acids, which are recognized by the viral particles as specific receptors, the chloroquine-induced disruption of the processes of sialylation/glycosylation of cellular and viral participants of this interaction is reflected in its antiviral effects.</p>
