<p>From the earliest days of the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, there has been considerable focus on drug repurposing. A bibliometric analysis of drug repurposing has described the many FDA-approved drugs that have been tested for other indications. This analysis highlighted chloroquine as one of the most repurposed drugs as it has been tested against hundreds of diseases (Baker

 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Not surprisingly, chloroquine has also been identified by several groups (in China, South Korea and the United States) (Jeon

There are numerous other drugs proposed, including a broad array of nucleoside analogs, neuraminidase inhibitors, peptides, RNA synthesis inhibitors, anti-inflammatory drugs as well as traditional Chinese medicines (Lu

 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) through to an array of small molecules that are primarily lysosomotropic drugs (Weston 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib297" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Most of these studies use Vero cells for testing and this animal cell type may not be an ideal. We await seeing how the wider use of human cells may impact the discovery of other inhibitors of this virus. Additionally, some of these molecules identified may be impractical due to off-target effects or not being able to be used at concentrations similar to their original indication.
