<p>There are eight negative polar segments of RNA genome of the influenza virus that code at least 10 structural and 9 regulatory proteins (Varga

Some uncertainty regarding the proteome of the influenza A viruses is related to the fact that, unlike most RNA viruses, the transcription and translation of the genome of these viruses take place in the nucleus and not in the cytoplasm of infected cells. This permits influenza A viruses (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1A</xref>) to use the cellular splicing machinery to form splice variants of viral mRNA(messenger RiboNucleuc Acid). In addition, to widen their proteome, the influenza A viruses are probably using alternative open reading frames.
