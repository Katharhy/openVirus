<p>Taking into account the importance of serine proteases, glycoproteins and glycolipids in the lifecycle of influenza viruses and coronaviruses, it seems logical to suggest that the factors that modulate the profile of glycosylation of proteins and lipids of epithelial cells and viruses, as well as control the activity of serine proteases on the epithelial lining of respiratory ways, may significantly limit the virulence of influenza viruses and coronaviruses and represent therapeutic drug targets.</p>
