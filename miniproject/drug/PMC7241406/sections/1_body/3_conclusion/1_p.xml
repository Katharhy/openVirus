<p id="p0160">At this point, clinical studies are needed expeditiously to investigate the safety and efficacy of local prophylactic regimens following exposure to SARS-CoV-2. For instance, investigations can include initial local delivery of a combination of chloroquine, zinc and azithromycin to the eyelids and ocular surface with eye drops or a spray/aerosol. This would potentially inhibit binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the likely major entry point into the human body, would reduce the risk of systemic side effects and conserve drugs that may become scarce, since the dosage required would be much less than for systemic treatment. A spray or aerosol preparation would also allow treatment of the nasal passages [

If a patient has active infection of the respiratory tree, then this combined medication could also be given in an inhaled form. The advantage of this ACE2 targeting approach is that ACE2 receptors from the outer cornea, through the lacrimal drainage system to the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems as well as both nasal and oral cavities, are directly accessible to a high topical drug dose. Thus, the portals that make us susceptible to coronavirus attack and invasion can be used to provide protection that is likely to be safe, extensive, convenient and at low cost. The ocular surface, offering all of the benefits of local treatment familiar to ophthalmologists, may thus provide a convenient testing ground for rapid, safe and likely cost-effective trials of newer drugs that may be developed to combat this modern plague.
