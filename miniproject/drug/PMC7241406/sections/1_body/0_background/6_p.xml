<p id="p0060">That slit lamps and their accessory lenses are a source of infection transmission has long been known [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In epidemic adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis ((AKC), shipyard/eye hospital eye) [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], ophthalmologists are not infrequently infected although this is not well documented [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. While AKC can cause considerable incapacity and has resulted in some risk-minimization measures, unlike coronavirus it does not usually result in death. The earlier severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic resulted in recommendations for how to manage eye facilities and include advice in relation to slit lamp cleaning and eye protection for staff [

 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Slit lamp biomicroscopy is an almost optimal method of transferring material in breaths between two individuals, short of actual facial contact. A very recent study provides evidence for human-to-human transmission [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Pathways include direct transmission, such as cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation transmission as well as contact transmission including contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 aerosol and fomite transmission is highly likely, since the virus can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours and on different surfaces up to days [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. While transmission of coronaviruses occurs via an airborne route [
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], because infected, symptomatic patients tend to develop severe lower, as opposed to upper respiratory tract infections, it has been supposed that airborne agent virus has to be small enough to penetrate directly into the lower respiratory tract to preferentially replicate there before causing disease. That transmission could occur via the ocular-nasolacrimal pathway was not considered.
