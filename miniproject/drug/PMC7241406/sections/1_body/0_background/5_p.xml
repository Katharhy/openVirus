<p id="p0055">Dr Li Wenliang's death and the apparent high infection rate in ophthalmologists (and ENT surgeons) [
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], attributed to the high viral shedding from the nasal cavity, should not be unexpected. A high initial viral load is associated with poor prognosis [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and ophthalmologists are particularly at risk, since ophthalmic practice involves very close ophthalmologist-patient physical proximity. This is necessitated by optical imperatives to optimise image quality by close alignment of imaging devices to the eye. Slit lamp biomicroscopy is the cornerstone of ophthalmic practice and the slit lamp is also used to carry out surgical procedures. The back focal distance (the distance of the subject from the front lens surface of the microscope), is set to give the surgeon sufficient space for manipulation ~ 11 cm (
 <xref rid="fig2a" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). With the instrument body length added, the distance from patient to the surgeon's eye is at a convenient working distance of ~28–30 cm. This proximity and the possibility of cross infection between examiner and examinee has long been recognized and a protective, transparent, typically Perspex® “breath shield” was added to slit lamps. It is evident in slit lamps from as early as 1919 [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and may well have gained popularity during the era of the 1918 influenza pandemic. The necessity for such shields is readily apparent from studies in which exposure between two face-to-face breathing manikins is measured [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] – 
 <xref rid="fig2b" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, 
 <xref rid="fig2c" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref> B and C. Tracer gas experiments to investigate the range of exhalation, either by mouth (
 <xref rid="fig2b" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B) or nose (
 <xref rid="fig2c" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C) show that at ~30 cm, one would be within the “line of fire”. This study concluded that air exhaled from human respiration contains contaminants and is able to penetrate the breathing zone of other nearby persons. Of interest is that exhalation flow may stratify in a horizontal layer at breathing zone height under certain conditions. Thus, with slit lamp examination, the layer of air between patient and ophthalmologist may remain stable, exposing both individuals for the entire time of the examination. Breath shields are often missing from slit lamps either because they are not fitted or because, as they get in the way, are removed.
