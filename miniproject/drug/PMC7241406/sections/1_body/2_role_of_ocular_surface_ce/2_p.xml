<p id="p0080">While ACE2 mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs, surface expression of ACE2 protein was described in lung alveolar epithelial cells and small intestinal enterocytes [
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and it was postulated that ACE2 might provide the coronavirus entry route. The eye and its adnexae were not investigated in this study. It was subsequently shown that ACE2 protein is more abundantly expressed on the apical than the basolateral surface of polarized airway epithelia [
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and thus accessible by topical agents. An immunohistochemical study revealed both extra- and intraocular localisation of ACE in human eyes [
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Of particular interest was the localisation of ACE to the epithelial cells of both the cornea and conjunctiva. Apical epithelia location and whether receptors are ACE2 remains to be confirmed. Recently, more widespread distribution of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors, ACE2 as well as TMPRSS2 protease and cathepsin B/L activity (for post-binding spike protein priming) have been documented using single-cell RNA-sequencing data [
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. While it was recognized that binding affinity of the spike protein and ACE2 is the major determinant of SARS-CoV replication rate and disease severity and that viral entry also depends on protease activity, ACE2, rather than protease activity, may be a limiting factor for initial viral entry. This study confirmed evidence of ACE2 in the limbus, corneal epithelium (basal/suprabasal, superficial and wing cells) and conjunctiva (basal and superficial cells) and co-location with TMPRSS2 in superficial conjunctival cells. Of interest is that this study demonstrated evidence of ACE2 in nasal goblet cells which also express genes associated with immune functions including innate and antiviral immune functions. There should be some priority for re-evaluation of these elements in the ocular surface [
