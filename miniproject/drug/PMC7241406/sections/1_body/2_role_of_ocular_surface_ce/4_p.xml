<p id="p0090">The tear film lipid layer plays an important role in retarding tear film evaporation and tear spillage [
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. However, this lipophilicity and that of the periocular skin [
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] may potentially play a role in how coronaviruses and perhaps other enveloped viruses access the ocular surface. In the skin, extracellular surface lipids provide a barrier function [
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and while a similar function might keep viruses from accessing ocular surface receptors, tear and supracutaneous flow could result in a “second chance” for the virus to bind to receptors downstream in the lacrimal drainage pathway and beyond. The tear film, comprised of nonpolar lipids, is generally hydrophobic [
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The coronaviruses with a crown of spike proteins around a lipid bilayer envelope [
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] may be well suited to adhering to the ocular surface. Coronavirus cell entry and adhesion require lipid rafts and the presence of cell membrane cholesterol [
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and in a sense, the cholesterol containing tear lipid layer [
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] might act as “lipid raft”, facilitating initial viral adhesion. The precise nature of potential viral adhesion to the tear film requires elucidation since this represents another potential means of intervention via local rather than systemic means.
