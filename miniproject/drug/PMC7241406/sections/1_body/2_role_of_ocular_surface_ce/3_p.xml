<p id="p0085">The density of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors and their presence or absence in the lacrimal drainage system would be of interest, since viral particles that land in the tear film need not necessarily bind to an epithelial cell immediately but could be presented with a second opportunity (a “wash through” effect) in the lacrimal drainage system. Tear film resilience may well protect the underlying corneal and conjunctival epithelium so that viral adherence to the tear film could prevent access to the apical epithelial surface, which may account for the relatively low incidence of keratitis/conjunctivitis reported to date
