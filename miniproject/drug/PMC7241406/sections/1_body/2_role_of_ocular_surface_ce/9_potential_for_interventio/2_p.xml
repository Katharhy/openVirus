<p id="p0120">Possible drug interventions targeting the ACE2 receptor include ACE inhibitors and chloroquine. ACE inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of systemic diseases including hypertension and are generally well tolerated [
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. This class of drugs has not previously been considered as having an anti-viral role. Crystallography studies demonstrate that while the ACE inhibitor lisinopril binds in a region near the centre of the receptor [

 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], the virus binding sites are on the outer surface of the receptor near the N terminal [
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], so direct blocking by lisinopril of the virus attachment site seems unlikely. However, the potent ACE2 inhibitor MLN-4760 induces a large receptor conformational change, a hinge bending motion, important for both inhibitor binding and catalysis and could prove to be unfavourable for viral binding to the receptor and/or syncytial formation [
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. It was thought that metallopeptidase inhibitors such as MLN-4760 may prove useful for prevention of viral binding to ACE2 [
