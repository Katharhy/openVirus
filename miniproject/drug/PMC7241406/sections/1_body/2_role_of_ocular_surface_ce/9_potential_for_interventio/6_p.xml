<p id="p0140">While systemic chloroquine and its derivatives appear to be associated with relatively minor side effects in the shorter term, electrocardiogram QT interval prolongation has been reported [
 <xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] and this may be exacerbated by combination treatment with azithromycin [
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The well-known association with irreversible visual loss due to retinal toxicity is considered a late manifestation [
 <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], however early-onset (~2 months) has been reported in a case where the ideal dosage was exceeded for one month [
 <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. A number of predisposing factors to retinal toxicity include genetic [

 <xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] and racial factors [
 <xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]), may play a role. Chloroquine's anticancer activity in concert with zinc have been explained by the fact that chloroquine acts as a zinc ionophore [
 <xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>], significantly, inhibiting cellular autophagy and enhancing apoptotic cell death via inhibition of lysosome function. It transpires that zinc inhibits coronavirus polymerase activity [
 <xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], blocking viral replication. For this reason, combination treatment for Covid-19 with chloroquine and zinc has been suggested [
 <xref rid="bib102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>], although this intervention has yet to be formally reported.
