<p id="p0130">Chloroquine has long been used in the treatment of malaria and subsequently, autoimmune disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis) as well as in oncology and for pediatric inflammatory disease. However, chloroquine has direct antiviral effects, inhibiting pH-dependent steps of the replication of flaviviruses, retroviruses, and coronaviruses [
 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], exhibiting strong antiviral effects on coronavirus infection of primate cells [
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. The drug can be effective either before or after exposure to the virus, so could act both therapeutically and prophylactically. Several mechanisms have been proposed but of particular interest is that the drug appears to interfere with terminal glycosylation of ACE2 [

 <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>]. Chloroquine also has immuno-modulatory effects [

 <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], suppressing the production/release of tumour necrosis factor and interleukin 6, which may mitigate the severe inflammatory cascade associated with severe COVID-19 disease [
 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Recently, hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [
 <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], fortuitous, since it appears that lower toxicity has been attributed to this derivative [
