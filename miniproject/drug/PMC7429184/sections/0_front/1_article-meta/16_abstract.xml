  <title>Background</title>
  <p>COVID-19 is the most rapidly expanding coronavirus outbreak in the past 2 decades. To provide a swift response to a novel outbreak, prior knowledge from similar outbreaks is essential.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>Here, we study the volume of research conducted on previous coronavirus outbreaks, specifically SARS and MERS, relative to other infectious diseases by analyzing &gt;35 million articles from the past 20Â years. Our results demonstrate that previous coronavirus outbreaks have been understudied compared with other viruses. We also show that the research volume of emerging infectious diseases is very high after an outbreak and decreases drastically upon the containment of the disease. This can yield inadequate research and limited investment in gaining a full understanding of novel coronavirus management and prevention.</p>

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p>Independent of the outcome of the current COVID-19 outbreak, we believe that measures should be taken to encourage sustained research in the field.</p>
