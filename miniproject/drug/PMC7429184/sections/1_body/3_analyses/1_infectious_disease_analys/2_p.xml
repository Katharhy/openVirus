<p>In the present study, we focused on the past emerging coronaviruses (SARS and MERS). There are many other strains of the human coronavirus, and 4 of them are known for causing seasonal respiratory infections [

We focused on SARS and MERS because they are more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 and both have zoonotic origins and raised international public health concern. Additionally, we also analyzed Ebola virus disease, influenza (seasonal, avian influenza, swine flu), HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C as comparators that represent other important emerging infectious diseases from the past 2 decades. For these 9 diseases, we collected all their aliases, which were added to the set of diseases 
 <italic>D</italic> and were used as keywords to filter the datasets. To reduce the false-positive rate, we analyzed only papers that, according to the MAG dataset, were in the categories of medicine or biology, and following Fire and Guestrin [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] had â‰¥5 references. Additionally, to explore the trend in the core categories of infectious disease research, we performed the same analysis on the virology category. In the rest of this section, we describe the specific calculations and analyses we performed.
