<p>Using these metrics, we inspected how the coronavirus publication and citation rates differed from those of other examined EIDs. We analyzed how trends of citations and publications have changed over time. Additionally, to inspect the similarities between the trends of different diseases we calculated the dynamic time warping (DTW) distance [
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] between all the disease pairs. Finally, we clustered the time series using TimeSeriesKMeans [
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].
