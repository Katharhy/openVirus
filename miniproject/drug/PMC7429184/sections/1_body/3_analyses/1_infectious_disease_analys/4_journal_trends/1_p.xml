<p>To investigate the relationship between journals and their publication of papers about emerging viruses, we combined the Semantic Scholar and PubMed datasets with the SJR dataset using ISSN, and selected all the journals from SJR categories related to infectious diseases (immunology, epidemiology, infectious diseases, virology, and microbiology). First, we inspected whether coronavirus papers are published in the top journals. We selected the top 10 journals by SJR and calculated the number of papers they had published for each disease over time. Next, we inspected how published papers about coronavirus are regarded relative to those about other EIDs in terms of ranking. To this end, we defined a new metric, JScore
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub>. JScore
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> is defined as the mean SJR score of all published papers on a specific topic 
 <italic>t</italic>. We used JScore
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> to observe how the prominence of each disease in the publication world has changed over time. Last, we explored publications by looking at the quartile ranking of the journal over time.
