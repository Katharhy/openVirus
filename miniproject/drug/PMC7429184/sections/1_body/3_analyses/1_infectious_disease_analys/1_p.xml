<p>To study the research of emerging viruses over time, we analyzed the datasets described in the Data Description section. In pursuing this goal, we used the code framework recently published by Fire and Guestrin [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which enables the easy extraction of the structured data of papers from the MAG dataset. The MAG and PubMed datasets were filtered according to a predefined list of keywords. The keyword search was performed in the following way: given a set of diseases 
 <italic>D</italic> and a set of papers 
 <italic>P</italic>, from each paper title 
 <italic>p
  <sub>t</sub>
 </italic>, where 
 <italic>p</italic> ∈ 
 <italic>P</italic>, we created a set of “word-grams." Word-grams are defined as 
 <italic>n-</italic>grams of words, i.e., all the combinations of a set of words in a phrase, without disrupting the order of the words. For example, the word-gram
 <italic>s</italic> of the string “Information on Swine Flu,” word-grams(InformationonSwineFlu), will return the following set: {Information,on,Swine,Flu,Information on,on Swine,Swine Flu,Information on Swine,on Swine Flu,Information on Swine Flu}. Next, for each 
 <italic>p</italic>, we calculated word-gram(
 <italic>p
  <sub>t</sub>
 </italic>) ∩ 
 <italic>D</italic>, which was considered as the diseases with which the paper was associated.
