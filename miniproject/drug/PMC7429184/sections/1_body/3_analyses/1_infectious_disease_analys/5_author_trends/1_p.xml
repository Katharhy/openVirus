<p>To study how scientific authorship has changed in the field of infectious diseases, we explored what characterizes the authors of papers on different diseases. We inspected the number of new authors over time to check how attractive emerging viruses are to new researchers. Additionally, we analyzed the authors experience, where author experience is defined as the time that has passed from his or her first publication. The authors were identified by the identification number provided in the MAG dataset. Author disambiguation is a challenging task; Microsoft combined multiple methods to generate their author identifications [
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. We also analyzed the number of authors who wrote multiple papers about each disease.
