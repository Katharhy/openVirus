  <p>For each institution, we looked for the institution’s page on Wikidata. From each Wikidata page, we extracted all geography-related fields (the fields used were “coordinate location (P625),” “country (P17),” “located at street address (P6375),” “located in the administrative territorial entity (P131),” “headquarters location (P159),” and “location (P276).”).</p>

  <p>To first merge all the Wikidata location fields, we used the “coordinate location” with reverse geocoding to determine the city and country of the institution.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>For all the institutions that did not have a “coordinate location” field, we extracted the location data from the other available fields. We crossed the data against city and country lists from GeonamesCache Python library [
   <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] to determine whether the data in the field described a city or a country.

  <p>To acquire country data for an institution that had only city data on Wikidata, we used GeonamesCache city-to-country mapping lists.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>To get city and country data for institutions that did not have the relevant fields on Wikidata, we extracted geographic coordinates from 
   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Wikipedia.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Wikipedia.org</ext-link> (English Wikipedia). Even though Wikidata and 
   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Wikipedia.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Wikipedia.org</ext-link> are both operated by the Wikimedia Foundation, they are independent projects that have different data. Similar to Wikidata coordinates, we used reverse geocoding to determine the city and country of the institution.
