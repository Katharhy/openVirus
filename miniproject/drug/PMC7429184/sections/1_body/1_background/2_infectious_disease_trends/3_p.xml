<p>Data about infectious diseases can also come from web- and social-based sources. For instance, in 2009, Ginsberg etÂ al. [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] used Google search queries to monitor the spread of influenza epidemics. They used the fact that many people search online before consulting physicians, and they found that during a pandemic, the volume of searches differs from normal. They then created a mathematical model to forecast the spread of influenza. This research was later converted into a tool called Google Flu Trends, and at its peak, Google Flu Trends was deployed in 29 countries worldwide. However, not everything worked well for Google Flu Trends; in 2009, it underestimated the flu volume, and in 2013, it predicted more than double the number of cases compared with the true volume [
