<p>In 2010, Lampos and Cristianini [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] extended the idea of Carneiro and Mylonakis [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] to use temporal data to monitor outbreaks. Instead of using Google Trends, they used Twitter as their data source. They collected 160,000 tweets from the UK, and as ground truth, they used Health Protection Agency weekly reports about the H1N1 epidemic. Using textual markers to measure influenza on Twitter, they demonstrated that Twitter can be used to study disease outbreaks, similar to Google Trends. In 2011, Salath√© and Khandelwal [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] analyzed Twitter and demonstrated that it is possible to use social networks to study not only the spread of infectious disease but also vaccinations. They found a correlation between the sentiment in tweets toward an influenza vaccine and the vaccination rate.
