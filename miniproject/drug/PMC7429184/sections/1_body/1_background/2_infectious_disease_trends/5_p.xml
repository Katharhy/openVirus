<p>In 2014, Generous et al. [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] used Wikipedia to monitor and forecast infectious disease outbreaks. They examined Wikipedia access logs to forecast outbreak volumes for 14 combinations of diseases and locations. The model worked successfully for only 8 of the 14 cases. Also, the authors suggested that it was even possible to transfer a model between locations without retraining it. In contrast to most of the web-based disease-monitoring methods, Wikipedia-based monitoring presents a fully open forecasting system that can be easily reproducible. Generally, in the past couple of years, Wikipedia has become a widely used data source for medical studies [

 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] took the influenza surveillance one step further by fusing multiple data sources. They used 5 datasets: Twitter, Google Trends, near real-time hospital visit records, FluNearYou, and Google Flu Trends. They used all these data sources with a machine-learning algorithm to predict influenza outbreaks. In 2017, McGough et al. [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] dealt with the problem of significant delays in the publication of official government reports about Zika cases. To solve this problem, they used the combined data of Google Trends, Twitter, and the HealthMap surveillance system to predict estimates of Zika cases in Latin America.
