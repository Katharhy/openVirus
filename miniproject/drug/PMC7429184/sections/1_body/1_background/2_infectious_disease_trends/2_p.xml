<p>In 2006, Cowen et al. [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] evaluated the ProMED dataset from the years 1996 to 2004. They discovered that there are diseases that received more extensive coverage than others: “86 disease subjects had thread lengths of at least 10 reports, and 24 had 20 or more.” They note that the pattern of occurrence is hard to explain even by an expert in epidemiology. Also, with the level of granularity of ProMED data, it is very challenging to predict the frequency with which diseases are going to accrue. In 2008, Jones et al. [
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] analyzed the global temporal and spatial patterns of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). They analyzed 305 EIDs between 1940 and 2004 and demonstrated that the threat of EIDs to global health is increasing. The same year, Freifeld et al. [
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] developed HealthMap, an interactive surveillance system that integrates disease outbreak reports from various sources.
