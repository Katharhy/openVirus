<p>In 2012, Takahashi-Omoe and Omoe [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] surveyed publications of 100 journals about infectious diseases. They discovered that the USA and the UK had the highest number of publications, and relative to the country’s socioeconomic status, the Netherlands, India, and China had relatively high productivity. In 2014, similar to Wislar et al. [

 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] studied ghost authorship in nursing journals instead of biomedical journals. They found that there were 28% and 42% of ghost and honorary authorships, respectively.
