<p>In 2015, Wiethoelter et al. [

 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] studied the evolution of scientific publications by analyzing 89 million papers from the Microsoft Academic dataset. Similar to the increase found by Aboukhalil [
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], they also found a drastic increase in the number of authors per paper. In 2019, Fire and Guestrin [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] studied the over-optimization in academic publications. They found that the number of publications has ceased to be a good metric for academic success as a result of longer author lists, shorter papers, and surging publication numbers. Citation-based metrics, such as citation number and h-index, are likewise affected by the flood of papers, self-citations, and lengthy reference lists.
