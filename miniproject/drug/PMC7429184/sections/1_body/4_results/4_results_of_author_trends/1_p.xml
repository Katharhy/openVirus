<p>By studying the authorship trends in the research of emerging viruses, we discovered that there is a difference in the mean experience of authors among diseases. SARS researchers had the lowest experience in years, and hepatitis C had the most experienced researchers (see TableÂ 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We noticed that the SARS research community had a smaller percentage of relatively prolific researchers than other diseases. Moreover, researchers with multiple papers related to SARS and MERS published on average 3.84 and 3.86 papers, respectively, while hepatitis C researchers published on average 5.24 papers during the same period. Additionally, from analyzing authors who published multiple papers on a specific disease, we found that on average there was a 2.5-paper difference between HIV and SARS authors. Furthermore, swine flu, SARS, and MERS were the diseases on which authors published the fewest multiple papers.
