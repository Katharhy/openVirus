<p>In recent years, there has been a surge in academic publications, yielding &gt;1 million new papers related to medicine and biology each year (see Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1a</xref>). In contrast to the overall increase in the number of infectious disease papers, there has been a relative decline in the number of papers about the coronaviruses SARS and MERS (see Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1b</xref>). Also, we found that 0.4% of virology studies in our corpus from the past 20 years involved human SARS and MERS, while HIV/AIDS accounts for 7.9% of all virology studies. We observed that, unlike the research in the domain of HIV/AIDS and avian influenza that has been published at a high and steady pace over the past 20 years, SARS was studied at an overwhelming rate after the 2002–2004 outbreak and then sharply decreased after 2005 (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). In terms of Normalized Paper Rate (see Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), after the first SARS outbreak, there was a peak in publishing SARS-related papers with NPR twice as high as Ebola’s. However, the trend decreased very quickly, and a similar phenomenon can be observed for the swine flu pandemic. The MERS outbreak achieved a much lower NPR than SARS, specifically &gt;16 times lower when comparing the peaks in SARS and MERS trends. In terms of Normalized Citation Rate (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), we observed the same phenomenon as we did with NPR. Observing Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>, we can see that there are diseases with very similar trends. More precisely, NPR and NCR trends are in 2 clusters, where the first cluster contains avian influenza, Ebola, MERS, SARS, and swine flu and the second cluster contains HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and influenza.
