<p>By inspecting global collaboration and research efforts, we found that the geolocation of researchers correlated with publication trends. For instance, most SARS, MERS, hepatitis B, and avian influenza research was done by investigators based in the USA and China (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). In the case of SARS and MERS, most of the research stemmed from China and the USA (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>), with only 17% of SARS papers’ first authors being located in Europe. Overall, researchers from 57 and 67 countries have studied MERS and SARS, respectively. However, most SARS papers (73%) were written by researchers in only 6 countries (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). While the USA was dominant in the research of all inspected diseases, China showed an increased output in only these 3 diseases. Also, MERS and SARS were studied in the fewest countries, and HIV was studied in the most countries (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Moreover, SARS and MERS were the diseases least studied in Europe, with only 17% and 19% of SARS and MERS studies, respectively, as opposed to Ebola studies, 29% of which were conducted in Europe.
