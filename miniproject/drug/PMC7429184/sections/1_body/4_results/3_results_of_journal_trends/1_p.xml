<p>From analyzing the trends in journal publications, we discovered that the numbers of papers published by journal quartile are very similar to Normalized Paper Rate and Normalized Citation Rate (see Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). We observed that for most of the diseases, the trends are quite similar: an increase in the study rate is coupled with a greater number of published papers in Quartile 1 (Q1) journals. We discovered that for SARS, MERS, the swine flu, and Ebola, Q1 publication trends were almost parallel to their NPR trends (see Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Also, we noticed that HIV, avian influenza, influenza, and hepatitis B and C have steady publication numbers in Q1 journals. Looking at papers in highly ranked journals (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), we observed that the diseases that are being continuously published in top-10–ranked journals are mainly persisting diseases, such as HIV and influenza. Additionally, we inspected how the mean journal ranking of publications by disease has changed over time (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). We found that only MERS had a decline of JScore. We also noticed that current papers about SARS had the highest JScore.
