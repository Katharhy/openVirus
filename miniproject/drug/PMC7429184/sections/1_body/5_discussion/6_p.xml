<p>Many of the trends that we observed are related to the pattern of the diseases. We observed 2 main types of infectious diseases with distinct trends. The first type was emerging viral infections such as SARS and Ebola. Their academic outputs tend to peak after an epidemic and then subside. The second type were viral infections with high burdens such as hepatitis B and HIV, for which there is a more or less constant trend. These trends were most evident in publication and citation numbers, as well as journal metrics. The collaboration and author distributions were more affected by where the outbreak occurred or where there was a high burden. This was also strengthened in the clusters we found, where they were divided in the same way.</p>
