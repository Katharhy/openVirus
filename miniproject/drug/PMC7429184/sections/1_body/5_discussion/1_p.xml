<p>In this study, we analyzed trends in the research of emerging viruses over the past 2 decades with emphasis on emerging coronaviruses (SARS and MERS). We compared the research of these 2 coronavirus epidemics to 7 other emerging viral infectious diseases as comparators. To this end, we used multiple bibliometric datasets, fusing them to get additional insights. Using these data, we explored the research of epidemiology from the perspectives of papers, journals, authors, and international collaborations.</p>
