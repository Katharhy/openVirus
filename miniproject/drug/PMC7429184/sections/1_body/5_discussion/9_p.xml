<p>This study may have several limitations. To analyze the data, we relied on titles to associate papers with diseases. While a title is very important in classifying the topic of a paper, some papers may discuss a disease without mentioning its name in the title. Additionally, there may be false-positive hits; for instance, an acronym might have several meanings that are not related to an infectious disease term. An additional limitation is our focus on a limited number of distinct diseases. There are other emerging infections not evaluated herein that could have followed other trends. To deal with some of these limitations, we only analyzed papers that were categorized as medicine and biology papers as a means to reduce false-positive results. Furthermore, we show that the same trends appeared even when we filtered all the papers by the category of virology (see Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">12</xref>). Finally, we compared papers that were tagged with a MeSH term on PubMed to the papers we retrieved using our keyword search of the title. We found that we matched MeSH terms with 73% recall, which is in the range described by Breugelmans et al. [
