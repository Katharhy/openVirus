<p>Currently, there is no doubt that we have to be better prepared for the next pandemic and the emergence of “Disease X.” We observed that currently there is a non-sustained investment in EIDs such as SARS and MERS, which is a key issue. Another crucial issue is the sharing of research material such as data and code. Data and code allow scientists to make more accurate discoveries faster by continuing knowledge from previous studies. Using the MAG dataset Paper Resources table, we inspected how many papers from the 9 diseases we analyzed had code or data. We found that there were 30 and 75 papers that had data and code, respectively. These numbers are very low, and we suspect that there are a lot of missing data in this table. We firmly believe that publishing code and data should be mandatory when possible.</p>
