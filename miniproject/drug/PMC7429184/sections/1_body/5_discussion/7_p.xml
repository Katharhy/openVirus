<p>In terms of practical implications, we see several options. First, notwithstanding the importance of pathogen discovery, as evident in projects like the Global Virome Project [
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] that is trying to discover unknown zoonotic viruses to stop future outbreaks, it is still important to monitor the status of current research that concerns known pathogens. It can be observed from Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> that there are diseases with declining interest from the scientific community. These trends are harder to spot when looking at the total number of publications because the total number of papers generally keeps increasing (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1a</xref>). Using NPR and NCR can help decision makers investigate whether additional resources should be invested in the study of these diseases. For instance, while SARS and MERS were in WHO’s R&amp;D Blueprint as priority diseases, they still exhibited a decline in their research rate. Second, using collaboration data, it is possible to find which countries have potential for growth in the number of researchers on specific diseases and also which bilateral grants have potential.
