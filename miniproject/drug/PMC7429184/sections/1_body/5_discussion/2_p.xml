<p>By analyzing the results presented in the Results section, the following can be noted: First, the surge in infectious disease publications (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>) supports the results of Fire and Guestrin [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], who found that there has been a general escalation of scientific publications. We found that the increase in the number of infectious disease publications is very similar to that in other fields. Hence, Goodhart’s Law (“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure”) did not skip the world of virology research. However, alongside the general increase in the number of papers, we observed that there was a decline in the relative number of papers on the specific infectious diseases that we inspected. The most evident drastic decrease in the publication rate happened after an epidemic ended. It seems that, for a short while, many researchers study an outbreak, but later their efforts are reduced. This finding is strengthened by considering the average number of multiple papers per author for each disease (see Table 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Additionally, similar patterns were found in the funding of MERS and SARS research [
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], which indicates that there is a possibility that the research rate has decreased as a result of lack of funding.
