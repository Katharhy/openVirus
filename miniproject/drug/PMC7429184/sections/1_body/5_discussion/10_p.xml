<p>In the future, we would like to perform extended collaboration analysis by improving the institution country mapping. Currently, we were able to identify 94% of the countries of origin for the institutions in the MAG affiliation table. We intend to improve the institution country mapping by using additional data sources. In addition, we are planning to extend our study into other diseases and look for correlations with real-world data such as global disease burden.</p>
