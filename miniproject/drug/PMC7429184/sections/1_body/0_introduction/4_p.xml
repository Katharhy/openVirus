<p>In this study, we answer these vital questions by utilizing state-of-the-art data science tools to perform a large-scale analysis of 35 million papers, of which 1,908,211 concern the field of virology. We explore nearly 2 decades of infectious disease research published from 2002 up to today. We particularly focus on public health crises, such as SARS, influenza (including seasonal, pandemic H1N1, and avian influenza), MERS, and Ebola virus disease, and compare them to HIV/AIDS and viral hepatitis B and C, 3 bloodborne viruses that are associated with a significant global health burden for &gt;2 decades.</p>
