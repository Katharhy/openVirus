<p>A crucial aspect of being prepared for future epidemics is sustained ongoing research of emerging infectious diseases even at â€œtimes of peace" when such viruses do not pose an active threat. Our results demonstrate that research on previous coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, was conducted by a relatively small number of researchers centered in a small number of countries, suggesting that such research could be better encouraged. We propose that regardless of the fate of COVID-19 in the near future, sustained research efforts should be encouraged to better prepare for the next outbreak.</p>
