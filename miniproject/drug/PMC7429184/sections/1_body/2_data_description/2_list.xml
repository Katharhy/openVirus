  <p>MAG—Microsoft Academic Graph is a dataset containing “scientific publication records, citation relationships between those publications, as well as authors, institutions, journals, conferences, and fields of study” [
   <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The MAG dataset we used was from 22 March 2019 and contains data on &gt;210 million papers [
   <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This dataset was used as the main dataset of the study. Similar to Fire and Guestrin [
   <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], we only used papers that had ≥5 references in order to filter out non peer-reviewed publications, such as news columns that are published in journals.

  <p>PubMed—PubMed is a dataset based on the PubMed search engine of academic publications on the topics of medicine, nursing, dentistry, veterinary medicine, health care systems, and preclinical sciences [
   <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. One of the major advantages of using the PubMed dataset is that it contains only medical-related publications. The data on each PubMed paper contain information about its venue, authors, and affiliations, but they do not contain citation data. In this study, we used the 2018 annual baseline PubMed dataset containing 29,138,919 records [
   <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We mainly utilized the PubMed dataset to analyze journal publications (see Paper Trends section).

  <p>SJR—Scientific Journal Rankings is a dataset containing the information and ranking of &gt;34,100 journals from 1999 to 2018 [
   <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], including their SJR indicator (a measure used to assess the prestige of a journal, SJR takes into account the number of citations and the prestige of the source of the citing paper [
   <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]), the best quartile of the journal (“The Journal Impact Factor quartile is the quotient of a journal’s rank in category [X] and the total number of journals in the category [Y], so that [X / Y] = Percentile Rank Z” [
   <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]), and more. We utilized the SJR dataset to compare the rankings of different journals to assess the level of their prestige.

  <p>Wikidata—Wikidata is a dataset holding a vast knowledge about the world, containing data on &gt;78,252,808 items [
   <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Wikidata stores metadata about items, and each item has an identifier and can be associated with other items. We utilized the Wikidata dataset to extract geographic information for academic institutions in order to match a paper with its authors’ geographic locations.
