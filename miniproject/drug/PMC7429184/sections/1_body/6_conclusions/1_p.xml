<p>The COVID-19 outbreak has emphasized the insufficient knowledge available on emerging coronaviruses. Here, we explored how previous coronavirus outbreaks and other emerging viral epidemics have been studied over the past 2 decades. From inspecting the research outputs in this field from several different angles, we demonstrate that the interest of the research community in an emerging infection is temporarily associated with the dynamics of the incident and that a drastic decrease in interest is evident after the initial epidemic subsides. This translates into limited collaborations and a non-sustained investment in research on coronaviruses. Such a short-lived investment also involves reduced funding as presented by Head et al. [

There has been an unprecedented explosion of publications on COVID-19 since January 2020 and also a significant allocation of research funding. We believe the lessons learned from the scientometrics of previous epidemics argue that regardless of the outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to sustain research in this field should be made. More specifically, in 2017 [

 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], SARS and MERS were considered to be priority diseases in WHO’s R&amp;D Blueprint, but their research rate did not grow relative to other diseases. Therefore, the translation of international policy and public health priorities into a research agenda should be continuously monitored and enhanced.
