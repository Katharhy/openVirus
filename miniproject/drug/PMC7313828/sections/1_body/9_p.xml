<p>Smaller and less expensive studies will allow a more diverse portfolio of agents to be rapidly screened. We propose urgent double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trials testing agents with biologic activity against SARS CoV-2 in outpatients. Several small molecular agents demonstrate potency in vitro and in nonrandomized studies in humans, including remdesivir, favipiravir, and selinexor [

 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Neutralizing antibody formulations are being developed and may have prophylactic value. Ideally, parallel studies would be conducted with each of these agents to provide clinicians with comparative efficacy, toxicity, and dosing convenience data to optimize early treatment.
