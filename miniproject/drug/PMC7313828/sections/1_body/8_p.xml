<p>Second, because only 15% of infected people develop the clinically relevant outcome of hospitalization, proof-of-concepts trials must enroll large numbers of participants to be adequately powered. Although such trials are required for licensure or to establish a new indication for a licensed agent, we propose smaller, rapid studies using viral shedding metrics and symptoms as surrogate endpoints for risk of progression to severe disease. Virologic endpoints are established surrogates of treatment efficacy for HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HSV-2, influenza, and cytomegalovirus [

It is likely that a profound reduction in shedding early during SARS Co-V-2 infection will translate into prevention of oxygen need and hospitalization. We performed power calculations and identified that a 30-participant trial with blinded and equally sized placebo and treatment arms would have 80% power to detect a 5-day reduction in shedding or symptomatology. Once test-of-concept studies show antiviral and clinical potential, adaptive trials with clinical outcomes of hospitalization can be initiated. This approach is of special importance in high-risk populations such as senior centers and cancer centers.
