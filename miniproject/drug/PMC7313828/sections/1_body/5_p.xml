<p>Widespread early treatment could also mitigate local epidemics. Although a proportion of SARS CoV-2 transmission is attributed to asymptomatic and presymptomatic viral shedding, many transmissions result from coughing and sneezing leading to airborne droplets. Household viral load is a determinant of transmission for human herpesviruses (HSVs) [
