<p>To manage the pandemic, effective strategies are needed to treat infection and lower its fatality rate. To this end, the biology of SARS CoV-2 provides a golden opportunity to diagnose and treat, before infection becomes uncontrollable. The average time between development of symptoms and requirement for hospitalization is 7 days [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and average time between development of symptoms to death is 14–21 days [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Viral kinetic studies demonstrate that early infection consists of a 2- to 3-day surge in viral loads, followed by a slow decline that persists for 2–8 weeks [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref>]. Initial symptoms develop around the period of maximum viral load and represent an optimal time to intervene (
