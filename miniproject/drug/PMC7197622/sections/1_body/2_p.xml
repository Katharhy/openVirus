<p>Besides their lipid-lowering activity, statins exert pleiotropic effects on inflammation and oxidative stress, contributing to their beneficial impact on cardiovascular diseases. Statins modulate the immune response at different levels, including immune cell adhesion and migration, antigen presentation, and cytokine production. Moreover, they restore the vascular redox balance by reducing reactive oxygen species and increasing antioxidants, and ameliorate nitric oxide bioavailability, endothelial function, and integrity. Most of these effects depend on statin-mediated inhibition of the production of isoprenoids, which are fundamental constituents of small GTPases (such as Ras, Rho, and Rac), and on consequential down-regulation of redox-sensitive proinflammatory transcriptional factors such as NF-ÎºB.
