<p>In conclusion, statins are low-cost, extensively tested, well-tolerated drugs that are less likely to be affected by a shortage in a health crisis such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, even in low-income countries, where treatment with more expensive drugs may not be implemented. Adjuvant treatment and continuation of pre-existing statin therapy could improve the clinical course of patients with COVID-19, either by their immunomodulatory action or by preventing cardiovascular damage. This hypothesis should warrant consideration for phase III clinical trials.</p>
