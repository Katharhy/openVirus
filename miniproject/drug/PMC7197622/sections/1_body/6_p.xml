<p>Cardioprotective actions of statins should also be taken into consideration in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Observational studies have found that elderly people with cardiovascular comorbidities are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and to develop severe symptoms.

 </xref> Furthermore, the lipid-lowering action of statins could treat the hyperlipidaemia associated with the use of protease inhibitor-based antiretroviral and immunosuppressive drugs in COVID-19 infection. Statin therapy has proven effective in improving hyperlipidaemia in patients with human immunodeficiency virus receiving protease inhibitor treatment

 </xref> Most statins undergo hepatic metabolism through CYP3A4, and concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors currently used in COVID-19, such as ritonavir and cobicistat, could increase the risk of muscle and liver toxicity; therefore, starting with a lower dose of statin and monitoring creatine kinase and transaminases would be advisable in these cases.
