<p>Similar to avian influenza viruses, betacoronaviruses cause severe respiratory illnesses by triggering an intense proinflammatory host response. Some immunomodulatory therapies have indeed proven beneficial in patients with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19; for example, tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor, was effective as a supportive therapy in selected COVID-19 patients.

 </xref> SARS-CoV-1 interaction with Toll-like receptors on the host cell membrane significantly increases the expression of the 
 <italic>MYD88</italic> gene, whose product activates NF-κB, thereby triggering inflammatory pathways.

 </xref> Experimental models have demonstrated that statins stabilize MYD88 levels after a proinflammatory trigger such as hypoxia.
