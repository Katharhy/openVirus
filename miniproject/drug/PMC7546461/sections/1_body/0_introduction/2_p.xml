<p>Speed of response is critical with respect to mitigation of infectious outbreaks, since in a susceptible population, the number of infections may increase exponentially. The aim of outbreak preparedness is therefore to ensure that contingency planning is in place beforehand to avoid delays associated with an ad hoc response, thus enabling intervention whilst case numbers are low. For well-established diseases such as measles in humans, this preparation includes systems for (1) 
 <bold>detection</bold> by routine surveillance, (2) 
 <bold>confirmation</bold> by designated specialist laboratories, and (3) 
 <bold>response</bold>, which will be uniquely tailored to the situation [

Contrastingly, spillover of a novel pathogen entails additional complications caused by gaps in fundamental knowledge and validated technical resources. Since this ‘research and development gap’ impinges on the effectiveness and rate of response, it is an important factor that must be considered in the context of preparedness [
