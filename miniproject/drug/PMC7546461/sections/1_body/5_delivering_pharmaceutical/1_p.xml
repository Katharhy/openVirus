<p>The future trajectory of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is uncertain; however, elimination of the virus may depend on the availability of antiviral treatments and vaccines. Delivery of novel pharmaceutical interventions from conception to clinic is a prolonged process with numerous practical and regulatory hurdles to cross, necessitating short-term stopgaps. Repurposing of drugs already approved for human usage is an attractive option: their production is already optimised and upscaled, and they have known safety and bioavailability data, allowing human clinical trials to proceed rapidly after testing of in vitro efficacy. However, the repurposing of approved drugs can have major consequences in outbreak situations, causing acute shortages and rendering them unavailable to patients using them for the licensed indication [

Furthermore, medications can have potentially serious side effects, and emergency use approval may entail an uncertain risk/benefit profile, as seen with the example of hydroxychloroquine, which recently had its emergency use authorisation (EUA) revoked by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [
