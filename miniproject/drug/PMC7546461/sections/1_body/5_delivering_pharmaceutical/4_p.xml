<p>Vaccines are used to safely increase immunity levels against pathogens in populations in order to protect individuals and reduce pathways to viral spread. For SARS-CoV-2, a remarkably fast and broad vaccine development response was initiated, with the first candidate reaching human trials only 86 days after cluster identification [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], over 6 times faster than the first SARS-CoV-1 human vaccine trial [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008902.g002">Fig 2</xref>). At the time of writing, 35 candidates had reached human trials, with 122 more in preclinical development [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. A range of vaccine platforms (different core approaches to elicit antibody-based immunity and their associated manufacturing pipelines) are being trialled [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Amongst them are next-generation techniques like mRNA vaccination [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], which requires relatively little development time after viral genome sequencing. If successfully tested and deployed, these novel concepts may establish themselves more firmly within the vaccine ecosystem and potentially accelerate vaccine development beyond the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, the implementation of novel pharmaceutical interventions will ultimately be subject to the normal technical challenges involved with upscaling production to meet massive demand and will be dependent on the availability of appropriate production lines [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Many of the novel vaccine approaches currently being trialled have never been manufactured at this scale, suggesting unforeseen scalability issues may place future roadblocks.
