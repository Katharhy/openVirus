<p>Delivery of neutralising antibodies (nAbs) to patients early in disease is another treatment option. Serum from convalescent COVID-19 patients contains anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and donated serum can be infused to acutely ill patients [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Other options include products containing purified polyclonal antibodies from the pooled sera of COVID-19 survivors [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], through to the identification and characterisation of monoclonal nAbs, since these have the potential to be produced in large quantities and delivered as immunotherapy. By February, a SARS-CoV-1 nAb (CR3022) was reported to bind the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]; however, it was later shown not to cross-neutralise the virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In early April, an antibody (S309) from a SARS-CoV-1 survivor was found to neutralise SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], followed in May by a humanised antibody (47D11) capable of blocking infection with both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Also in May, a team demonstrated in vivo protection against high-dose SARS-CoV-2 challenge in Syrian hamsters after injection of a human monoclonal nAb [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], whilst another reported identification of 19 SARS-CoV-2 nAbs [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. This was accomplished by isolating individual B cells reacting to native-like SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, followed by expression of the encoded antibodies and virus neutralisation assays. Importantly, highly potent nAbs were found that targeted different regions of the spike protein, implying suitability as a cocktail therapy with reduced risk of viral escape.
