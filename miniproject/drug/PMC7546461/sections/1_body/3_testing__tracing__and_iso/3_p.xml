<p>In addition to diagnostic testing and contact tracing, genomic epidemiology can today be used to describe the evolution of a virus in time and space, uncovering transmission patterns [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Importantly, this is now a real-time tool rather than a retrospective one. Whereas the first SARS-CoV-1 genome was published over 6 months into the 2002â€“2004 outbreak [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008902.g002">Fig 2</xref>), nearly 5 months into the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, over 27,000 complete genomes could be downloaded from the GISAID sequence repository (

Technological advances in high-throughput sequencing have made this possible, first via short-read technologies such as Solexa (now Illumina), first available in 2006, and second by the 2014 commercial implementation of nanopore sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Technologies. These platforms are commonly used to investigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission clusters, for example, by the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which has sequenced thousands of virus genomes during the pandemic. Due to a relatively low entry price, nanopore technology has been decisive in improving accessibility to sequencing, reinforced by initiatives including the ARTIC Network [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], who quickly developed and published primer schemes and protocols for amplicon sequencing of whole SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Analysis of this wealth of data has also been made more accessible by online tools; for example, the Nextstrain platform [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] is being used to integrate genomic, geographical, and temporal data to visualise patterns of SARS-CoV-2 spread, whilst CoV-GLUE, an online resource created using the Genes Linked by Underlying Evolution (GLUE) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] software environment, focuses on identifying and tracking new variants.
