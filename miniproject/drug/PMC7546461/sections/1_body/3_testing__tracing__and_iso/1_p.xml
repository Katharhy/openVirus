<p>When facing a novel pathogen, an immediate research priority is the development of diagnostic assays to detect infected individuals. Testing in the clinic ensures that COVID-19 patients are separated from SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals and confirms viral shedding has ceased before discharge. Testing in the community uncovers viral transmission dynamics to support control policies, such as prevalence in vulnerable demographics [
