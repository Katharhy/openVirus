<p>Virus discovery methods include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays targeting conserved genome regions specific to all members of a taxonomic family (potentially even unknown ones), attempted virus isolation in cell culture, microscopy to study the virion morphology, and metagenomic analysis of human samples for the identification of the pathogen. These analyses were carried out on samples from the initial COVID-19 cluster and published in a remarkably short 34 days [
