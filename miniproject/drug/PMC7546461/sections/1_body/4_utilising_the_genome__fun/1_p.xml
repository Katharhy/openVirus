<p>A viral genome sequence is a launchpad for a range of parallel research goals aiming to deliver technical resources and fundamental knowledge about a new pathogen. The genome provides the sequences of protein-coding genes, which are used to safely produce pure stocks of individual viral proteins. The gene sequence is first amplified from a clinical sample or viral culture using PCR or is synthetically constructed. The DNA is delivered to cells, which produce (express) the protein encoded by the gene. Viral proteins are used in the generation of traditional antibody-based diagnostic assays, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), which are designed to detect viral proteins in patient samples or patient antibodies against the virus [
