<p>In vivo studies such as those in livestock, frugivorous bats, and companion animals are necessary to establish their potential role in forming viral reservoirs and to provide data that are informative on the possible pathways of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from its wild reservoir to humans [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Traditionally, a clinical sample containing replication competent virus would be required; however, access to samples for researchers in countries without active cases is often logistically difficult in the early phases of an outbreak. Today, only a genome sequence is required—synthetic DNA technology allows the reconstruction of viral genomes in artificial vectors—from which viable infectious RNA can be produced and replicating virus rescued. The first such SARS-CoV-2 culture was achieved only 1 week after delivery of synthetic DNA constructs spanning the genome [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and reported 42 days after the first genome became available. This technology offers a powerful platform to carry out reverse genetic approaches using genetic engineering to study genotype-to-phenotype relationships and the function of viral components, and also enables validation of diagnostic tests in the absence of clinical specimens [
