<p>Whilst the amino acid sequence of a protein can be accurately predicted from the nucleotide sequence of its encoding gene, the protein conformational structure that determines its function cannot, and must be solved using structural biology techniques. Hardware and data processing performance revolutions in recent years have dramatically accelerated the generation of high-resolution structures; only 2 months after the first SARS-CoV-2 genome was released, a 3.5 Å resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the spike protein was published [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], revealing differences to SARS-CoV-1 that preclude the binding of some anti-SARS-CoV-1 antibodies. This was followed in short order by structures including the cellular receptor ACE2 [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid RNA-binding domain [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and the SARS-CoV-2 main protease [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This structural information is useful for in silico modelling of protein–protein interactions and high-throughput computational screening of chemical compounds with potential antiviral properties. Another remarkable approach to find drug targets exploited expression of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells, followed by separation of the viral proteins (and bound host proteins) from the host background. Identification of bound host proteins by mass spectrometry revealed a number of druggable candidates that may represent therapeutic targets [
