<p>An outbreak caused by a novel pathogen requires a rapid research effort across the experimental and clinical spectrum. As an outbreak response progresses, research and development continue to play an integral role at each stage (summarised in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008902.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Here, we describe the various aspects of this research and development landscape using COVID-19 as an example, with emphasis on recent factors that have accelerated the response to the outbreak.
