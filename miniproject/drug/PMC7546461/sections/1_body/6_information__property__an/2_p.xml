<p>Timely and high-quality scientific research relies on knowledge sharing between teams with varying expertise and facilities, making connectivity a keystone component of research preparedness for outbreaks. Whilst the World Health Organization (WHO) plays a crucial role in coordinating global research efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, preexisting networks and formal consortia of trusted partners can immediately coordinate to form focus groups and share resources [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], specifically train research preparedness concepts to the next generation of scientists. An advantage of larger networks is the ability to coordinate multi-armed studies with unified procedures and centralised administration, in order to maximise sample size and achieve consensus faster. For this purpose, WHO launched the Solidarity clinical trial for testing COVID-19 treatments [

Representative national ethics committees supported by WHO, funding agencies, and relevant collaborative research consortia provided statements guiding the conduct of COVID-19 research, which helps to standardise and expedite ethical research [
