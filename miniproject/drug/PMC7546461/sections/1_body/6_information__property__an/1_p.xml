<p>Against the backdrop of technological advancements that have boosted outbreak research capacity in recent years, key paradigm shifts in information sharing have also occurred, dramatically increasing how quickly and widely new results and data are received by other researchers and the public. In a rapidly evolving situation, maximum data utility is achieved by prompt release. The pace of viral genome publication during crises was highlighted as a problem during the 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008902.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], accessible to all. For researchers, the open access 
 <italic>bioRxiv</italic> and 
 <italic>medRxiv</italic> preprint servers (launched in 2013 and 2019, respectively) have become invaluable resources for the rapid dissemination of results, hosting a combined 7,060 articles by July 29, 2020. The cost of this speed is the absence of peer review, which can sometimes result in the publication of data falling below a necessary quality standard. Encouragingly, this openness has not been limited to academic spheres; many major technology companies including Intel, Microsoft, and Amazon have temporarily granted open access to their patent libraries for SARS-CoV-2-related research as part of the ‘Open COVID Pledge’ [
