<p id="Par41">In this review, we described the potential effect of coronaviruses on cells in general and on neurons in general and the ability of viral proteins to cause failure of several cell organelles (ER stress, Golgi fragmentation, and Autophagy machinery alteration). These events start with the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) that the virus will use to hide and to translate its so-called accessory proteins. DMVs or membrane rearrangements can be an invagination towards the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or other organelles, or an extrusion of the ER membrane. Since DMVs originate from the endoplasmic reticulum, it is normal to observe a stressed and dysfunctional ER that could lose its functional interaction with the mitochondria and Golgi apparatus as displayed in Fig.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. It is not clear yet whether SARS-CoV-2 can cause all these events, since most of the studies focus on drug discovery and what are the protein(s) involved. However, phylogenetic trees presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> gave the rationale that the function of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3, 4, and 6 should be similar to their counterpart from other coronaviruses. In support of this idea, using human neuronal and lung cells in vitro, we demonstrated that these proteins can promote ER stress and Golgi apparatus fragmentation. Therefore, a thorough investigation of these events should be conducted, and patients recovering from COVID-19 should be enrolled in clinical studies to determine whether they will develop organ failure due to ER stress and the contribution of these events in ischemic strokes, lungs collapse, and long-term organ damage. Therefore, to avoid future problems and to be able to develop inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, a systematic study should be established using all affected cell types.
