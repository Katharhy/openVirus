<p id="Par28">The ER-associated degradation (ERAD) tuning vesicles (or EDEMosomes) controls the degradation of misfolded glycoproteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. EDEMosomes are large vesicles budding from the ER that fuse in an Atg5-dependent manner with lysosomes for degradation of their contents. Coronavirus hijacks the machinery of EDEMososme formation for the production of DMVs. Viral NSPs associate with an EDEMosome cargo receptor that usually organizes the sorting of EDEMososmes from the ER. Furthermore, the unfolded protein response (UPR) maintains ER homeostasis by shutting down the translation and increasing the ER protein folding capacity. However, under sustained ER stress, the UPR can induce apoptotic cell death and cytokine production [
