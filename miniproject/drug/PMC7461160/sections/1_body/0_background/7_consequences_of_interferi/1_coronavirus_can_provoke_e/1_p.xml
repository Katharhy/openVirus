<p id="Par27">A healthy and functional ER is vital for the synthesis of new plasma membrane proteins, lysosomal enzymes, proteins for the Golgi apparatus, and proteins for extracellular secretion. Any alteration in its function can provoke ER stress and accumulation of misfolded proteins that could lead to cellular deregulation and diseases. In this regard, global proteomic studies revealed that several genes related to ER stress are overexpressed in cells infected with SARS- CoV, such as glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78 or BiP) and glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], upregulating GRP78/94 and the PERK pathway, while 3a and 8ab proteins were shown to induce lysosomal damage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Orf6 and Orf7a were also described to induce ER stress, where Orf6 activates caspase-3 through JNK-dependent apoptosis pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. However, nothing is known about SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Some of these events could be observed, because at least one domain (N- or C-terminal) of BiP, CHOP, or other involved ER factors belong to the group of intrinsically disordered proteins. Any deregulation of one of the domains can alter that protein function and contributes to ER stress. This phenomenon is mainly assured by SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein that associates with the other viral proteins to induce these deregulations.
