<p id="Par35">In the hematogenous entry, endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier (BBB) or leukocytes are infected by the virus to infiltrate the CNS [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. In the same way, HCoV-229E infects monocytes/macrophages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>], peritoneal macrophages, and dendritic cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 may infect monocytes and macrophages through ACE2-dependent and ACE2-independent pathways or attach to ACE2 expressed in the endothelium of BBB to obtain access into the CNS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. The angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 receptor is widely distributed in the lungs, heart, liver, kidney, and intestine. After the infection, monocytes migrate to the tissues where they turn into infected resident macrophages, permitting viruses to reach different organs and tissues. Cerebral cytokine storms can result in the breakdown of the BBB and allow monocytes to traverse the BBB physically.
