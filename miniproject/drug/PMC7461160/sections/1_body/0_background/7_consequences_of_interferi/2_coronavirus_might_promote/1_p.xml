<p id="Par29">Proteins synthesized in the ER are packaged into vesicles that will fuse with the Golgi apparatus. These cargo proteins are modified and destined for secretion via exocytosis or for use in the cell. The Golgi is also involved in lipid transport and lysosome formation. Therefore, provoking its fragmentation can cause the cell to collapse. In this regard, it has been shown that SARS-CoV and MHV infections trigger the rearrangement and fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus [
