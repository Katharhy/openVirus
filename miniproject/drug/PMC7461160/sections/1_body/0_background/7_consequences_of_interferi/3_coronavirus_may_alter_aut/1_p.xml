<p id="Par30">Viruses can use autophagy machinery for their own replication and have also developed strategies to escape autophagic degradation. Recent evidence suggests an inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV and MERS on the autophagy process. MERS blocks the autophagosome/lysosome fusion and causes the suppression of the autophagic flux. However, it was not elucidated if this blockage is mandatory for viral replication. Three MERS proteins are described to limit autophagy, Nsp6, p4b, and p5, with Nsp6 also inhibiting the expansion of autophagosomes as shown for other betacoronaviruses [

The actual induction of autophagy in infected cells could be due to other factors, such as the presence of double-stranded RNA within the cell, activation of toll receptor signaling during cell entry, and/or induction of ER stress during replication and envelopment. Therefore, it is important to study these events in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and to determine a) which SARS-CoV02 proteins are involved in ER stress, b) what is the impact of this stress on cell function, and c) can these events be reversed to prevent viral replication.
