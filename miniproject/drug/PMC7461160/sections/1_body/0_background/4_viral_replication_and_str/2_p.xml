 <italic>Orf1a</italic> gene is expressed early and translated into a polyprotein that will be cleaved into 11 non-structural proteins (Nsp1-11) by the papain-like activity of Nsp3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] or by Nsp5, which possess a chymotrypsin-like protease activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. 
 <italic>Orf1ab</italic> is in a different frame from 
 <italic>Orf1a</italic> and the virus uses programmed-1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) to synthesize it.
