<p id="Par12">Replication and transcription of the virus happen within a replication/transcription complex (RTC) encoded by the virus with NSPs as primary constituents. Nearly all RTC elements are encoded by the large replicase gene that consists of Orf1a and Orf1ab. The early formation of the RTC is an essential step in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle to safeguard viral genome replication and to synthesize subgenomic mRNA.</p>
