<p id="Par8">HCoVs were considered relatively harmless until the SARS outbreak in 2003, where they appeared clinically for the first time as a severe respiratory illness with high mortality and morbidity. Coronaviruses have been identified to infect a wide variety of animals, birds, and mammals, including mice, cats, bats, dogs, pangolins, as well as humans, with a diversity of clinical presentation including respiratory tract infection and gastroenteritis. The outbreaks of SARS and MERS and the frequent re-introduction of coronaviruses in the human population increased the awareness of the danger of emergence of other zoonotic coronaviral infections. These epidemics indicate the need to develop antiviral compounds to combat coronavirus infections. However, gaps still exist in the knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis and transmissivity of this family of viruses.</p>
