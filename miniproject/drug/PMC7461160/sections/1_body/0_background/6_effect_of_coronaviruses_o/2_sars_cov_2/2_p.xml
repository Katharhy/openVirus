<p id="Par25">The central respiratory failure observed with some patients may be partially due to the neuro-invasive potential of the virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. It has the ability to damage the brainstem where the pneumotaxic center is located, and hence, endotracheal intubation and mechanical respiratory support may be needed. A recent study registered neurological manifestations in 214 patients, of which 78 patients (36.4%) had neurologic manifestations, showing a neurotropic potential for the SARS-CoV-2 [

Edema and partial neuronal degeneration were observed in brain tissues in China and many cases of viral encephalitis in different countries were registered.
