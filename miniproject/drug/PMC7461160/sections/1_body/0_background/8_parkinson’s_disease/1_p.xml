<p id="Par40">A potential relationship or at least an epidemiological association [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>] between viral infections and PD was first mentioned after the 1920–1930s influenza epidemic, which was associated with Encephalitis Lethargica (EL) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. The EL patients presented a type of ‘sleeping sickness’ which included uncontrollable sleepiness but also headache, nausea, fever, catatonia, and occasionally coma [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. Compared to normal age-matched controls, PD patients have an elevated cerebrospinal fluid antibody response to coronaviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Furthermore, reduction or blocking of the ER- to-Golgi trafficking leads to the accumulation of α-Synuclein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>] that contributes to ER stress as observed in PD disease model. Furthermore, Golgi fragmentation observed in PD results in reduced delivery of dopamine transporter [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>] and impaired axonal synapses and dendrite trafficking. Interestingly, Golgi fragmentation was described in human neurons infected with MHV and SARS-CoV.
