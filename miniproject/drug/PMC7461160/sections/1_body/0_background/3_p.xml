<p id="Par9">CoVs belong to the 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic> order—
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family—and received their names from the unique “crown-like” spikes that are visible on the outer membrane of the virions. Coronaviruses are large enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses that are broken down into four classes: 
 <italic>Alpha</italic>, 
 <italic>Beta</italic>, 
 <italic>Gamma</italic>, and 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic>. Coronaviruses are the largest RNA viruses known with a genome ranging between 27 and 32 kb. Like all the 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic> members, Coronaviruses have a highly conserved genomic organization, unique enzymatic activities, and express non-structural genes by ribosomal frameshifting.
