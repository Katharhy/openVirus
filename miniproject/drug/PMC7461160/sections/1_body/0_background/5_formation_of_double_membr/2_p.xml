<p id="Par16">Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses and, as such, arrogate intracellular membranes of different cellular organelles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The membrane rearrangements can be an invagination towards the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or other organelles, or an extrusion of the ER membrane forming double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Outer membranes of DMVs interconnect with the ER and other virus-induced structures called convoluted membranes (CM). The ER is probably the main donor for this elaborate Reticulovesicular Network (RVN), but autophagosomes and late endosomes can also be a membrane source of DMVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The formation of replication sites most likely emerges from the ER membrane, while the major budding sites of SARS- CoV use the membranes in the ERGIC and Golgi region [
