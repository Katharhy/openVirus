 <underline>NSP3</underline> is a 215-kDa glycosylated protein with transmembrane domains interacting with several proteins involved in transcription and replication, and also serves as a scaffolding protein for these mechanisms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Nsp3 contains two conserved transmembrane regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] that insert into the ER membrane. These transmembrane domains are required for the DMVs’ pairing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Exogenous Nsp3, both full length and/or the C-terminal transmembrane-containing region, induces disordered membrane bodies (DMB) as well as multilamellar and giant vesiculation (MGV), showing the ability for the C-terminus to participate in membrane production or expansion of existing membranes. In SARS-infected cells, Nsp3 stimulates membrane buildups that grow larger in size with time supporting. Expression of Nsp3 with either Nsp4 or Nsp6 reduces the formation of MGV but not DMB, indicating that Nsp4 and Nsp6 have a regulatory role on Nsp3′s membrane proliferation ability. Co-transfection of Nsp3 with Nsp4 provokes a particular membrane conformation, generating a perinuclear double-membrane walled maze-like body (MLB) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], suggesting a significant interaction between Nsp3 and Nsp4 and supporting published data. The C-terminal one-third of Nsp3 (nsp3C) is sufficient to interact with Nsp4 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and Nsp6 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].
