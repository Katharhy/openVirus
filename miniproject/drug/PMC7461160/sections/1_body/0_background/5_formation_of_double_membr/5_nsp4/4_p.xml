<p id="Par22">The avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) Nsp6 has been shown to activate autophagosome formation, inducing vesicles containing Atg5 and LC3-II [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and it shares this property with Nsp6 of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV. All the Nsp6 orthologs throughout the 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic> order preserved the ability to engender autophagosomes directly from the ER. However, the autophagosomes formed by Nsp6 have smaller sizes compared with those induced by starvation, suggesting that Nsp6 might also inhibit the enlargement of autophagosomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The mechanisms behind Nsp6-induced autophagy are poorly described, even though involvement of mTOR and the ER stress transcription factor CHOP are neutralized [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Nsp6 may modify adaptive immune responses by sending immunomodulatory proteins synthesized by the ER into autophagosomes for degradation. The SARS-CoV-2 Nsp6 protein also interacts with the sigma receptor, which is known to participate in ER stress response [
