<p id="Par20">The interaction between Nsp3 and Nsp4 was shown to be necessary for the formation of convoluted membranes (CM) and DMVs in MERS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], probably through the luminal loops of Nsp3 and Nsp4 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] positioned in the TM1 and TM2 regions, respectively. The interaction of these domains with their counterparts on the opposite side of the ER lumen induces membrane pairing. The N-terminal region of Nsp3 is required for complete DMVs formation and its TM1 region along with Nsp4 is sufficient to induce membrane pairing.
