<p id="Par7">Since the discovery of the first coronaviruses (CoV) by Tyrrell and Bynoe in 1965 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], more strains have emerged. Only two circulating human coronaviruses (HCoVs), HCoV-229E [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and HCoV-OC43 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], were described as the frequent cause of the common cold until 2002â€“2003 when the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV spread into the human population in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Then, two new coronaviruses, CoV NL63 in 2004 (alphacoronavirus) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and HKU1 in 2005 (betacoronavirus) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], were discovered. Another coronavirus, the MERS-CoV, emerged in the Middle East and engenders lower respiratory tract infections with high mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].
