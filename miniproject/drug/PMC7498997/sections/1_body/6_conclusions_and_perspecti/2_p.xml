<p id="Par53">COVID-19 has shown a clear male-biased severity and mortality in different countries. The sex-biased pathogenesis is not understood properly, but it could be multifactorial. The difference in immune system function between males and females could be an important determinant. Females are known to show a robust immune response to pathogens which could help them to better regulate viral load and viral clearance compared with males. Since many immune genes are present on X chromosome, the XX and XY genetic constitutions could also contribute to COVID-19 severity. Other differences including steroid hormone milieu and sex organs could also play a crucial role in pathogenesis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Estrogen in females can have immune-enhancing effects while testosterone secreted by the testis can have immune-suppressive effects. However, there is no sufficient clinical data to show that the SARS-CoV-2 can enter the testis and regulate COVID-19 severity and mortality in males. Hence, testis involvement should be further explored to understand male-biased mortality. The stress endurance level in males and females is also different with females showing higher endurance against different stress including food shortage and pathogens. This could also be a contributing factor in sex-biased pathogenesis from COVID-19.
