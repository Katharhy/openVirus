<p id="Par40">The mortality rate due to SARS-CoV in 2002â€“2003 was high, and interestingly, this virus also showed higher mortality in males compared to females. Using SARS-CoV in the murine model, it was observed that the SARS-CoV can show high mortality in male mice [

Following SARS-CoV challenge, the levels of proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and chemokines including C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CCL2 and CXCL1) expression were elevated in the lungs of male mice compared to females. The authors suggested that this could lead to a prolonged inflammatory response in males and consequently lead to lung immunopathology and increased mortality [
