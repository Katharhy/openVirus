<p id="Par39">A study by Marquez et al. highlighted important sex differences in immune responses using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The authors showed that genomic differences between sexes increased after age 65. The innate and pro-inflammatory activity increased but adaptive immunity decreased in males [

In another study with a Japanese cohort, it was observed that the age-related decline of immune cells including B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells was slower in females compared to males. The rate of decline in IL-6 and IL-10 production was also slower in females [

Moreover, the stronger innate and adaptive immune response in females may help to clear the pathogens faster than in males. This could be a reason why females are showing less severity and mortality towards COVID-19.
