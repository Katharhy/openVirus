<p id="Par34">Sex differences result in differential regulation of innate and adaptive immune response which in turn regulates sex-biased pathogenesis and mortality towards various pathogens [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Males and females show differences in immune response when challenged with viral infections. For instance, in acute HIV infected cases, females show 40% less viral RNA than males, and hepatitis virus shows higher mortality in men [
