<p id="Par42">Another important immunomodulator, high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), could be a contributing factor for sex-specific severity and mortality from COVID-19. Infected or stressed cells usually release endogenous damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) that can activate the immune system by interacting with PRRs such as TLRs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Many DAMPs including biglycan, decorin, versican, fibrinogen, IL-33, defensin, DNA, RNA, F-actin, and HMGB1 have been identified [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Increased level of HMGB1 can induce proinflammatory cytokine (TNF, IL-1, and IL-6) release, and since chronic inflammatory diseases result in HMGB1 increase, the severity in COVID-19 patients with underlying inflammatory comorbidities could be correlated to HMGB1 levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Sex-related differences in immune responses can lead to differential mode of action to clear the viral load and damaged cells. Stressed pulmonary endothelial cells in males are known to undergo necrosis while in females apoptosis is more common [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Since necrosis releases more HMGB1 than apoptosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], this indicates that HMGB1 levels are differentially regulated in male and female COVID-19 patients with higher levels in males that further contributes to the severity and high mortality in males.
