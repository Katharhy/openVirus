<p id="Par26">ACE2 is a membrane-bound transmembrane aminopeptidase that is expressed in different tissues including the heart, intestine, kidney, lungs, lymph nodes, and testis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In the lungs, ACE2 is mainly expressed in type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]; however, its function in the lungs is not clear [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. ACE2 undergoes post-translational modifications where a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) cleaves ACE2 to release the ectodomain which has the catalytic domain and that can bind coronavirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). ACE2 also undergoes post-transcriptional modification where the 
 <italic>miR-421</italic> binds to 3â€²-UTR of ACE2 and modulates its expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This suggests that apart from ACE2 expression, regulation of 
 <italic>miR-421</italic>, TMPRSS2, and ADAM17 is important to understand COVID-19 pathogenesis.
