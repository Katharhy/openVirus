<p id="Par29">The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in maintaining blood pressure, fluid homeostasis, and salt balance. ACE2 is a homologue of ACE, but they have opposite functions with ACE involved in activation of RAS by conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. On the other hand, ACE2 negatively regulates RAS system by inactivating angiotensin II [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. An inÂ vitro study showed that human coronavirus (HCoV-NL63) infection can downregulate ACE2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and similar findings were observed with SARS-CoV infections in mice model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The reduced ACE2 levels following SARS-CoV infection led to acute lung injury, and interestingly, the lung injury was significantly attenuated in ACE2 knockout mice and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) treated groups [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In animal models, while ACEI and ARB treatments increase ACE2 receptors, clinical data for similar effects are lacking [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Based on this, it was argued that patients under ACEI and ARB medication may be at increased risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The study by Sama et al. found that plasma ACE2 levels are high in men compared to women in patients with heart failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARB was not associated with higher plasma ACE2 levels [
