<p id="Par46">Males and females are under the influence of different hormonal milieu. Testosterone has been shown to have immunosuppressive effect while estrogen has immunoenhancing effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Testosterone has been found to inhibit T helper cell differentiation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] and positively correlate with the viral load of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus in macaques [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. Testosterone is also known to decrease the responsiveness towards influenza vaccine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Analysis of testosterone levels in females showed that the level is usually low in females suffering from autoimmune disease compared to healthy females [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Furthermore, androgen ablation in male mice showed improved performance of immune cells towards prostate cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Androgen ablation also alters immune organs as the thymus and spleen have been reported to increase weight [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Although the mature peripheral CD4 T cell population declined, the one that reached the spleen showed enhanced activation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. This suggests that male sex hormones (androgens) could lead to susceptibility and severity towards pathogenic infections. It is indicated that prostate cancer patients who are under androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) to regulate androgen production have lowered risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with patients who did not receive ADT [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. The authors argued that [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>] since TMPRSS2 expression is induced by androgens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>], the ADT could downregulate TMPRSS2 and this in turn could be lowering SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is suggested that ADT could be beneficial for COVID-19, and since this disease progresses rapidly, the ADT intervention will be beneficial during the initial stage of viral infection and not in later stages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. However, the expression of TMPRSS2 in human male and female lungs is not different [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>], and in mice models, treatment with enzalutamide, an AR antagonist, did not result in decreased pulmonary TMPRSS2 expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. Hence, the use of AR antagonists to regulate TMPRSS2 expression for COVID-19 warrants further research.
