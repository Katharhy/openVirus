<p id="Par47">Estrogen, on the other hand, provides protection against pathogens as it has antiviral properties in different viral infections including HIV, hepatitis C virus, Ebola, and human cytomegalovirus [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Since SARS predominantly replicates in airways, higher estrogen levels in females may increase the protection from SARS infections [

However, gonadectomy or treatment with the AR antagonist flutamide did not affect morbidity or mortality in male mice following SARS-CoV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Based on this, it was suggested that the estrogen receptor signaling plays an important role in coronavirus infection and mortality, while androgens do not play a role in pathogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. This suggests that estrogen signaling is critical in regulating viral infection and could be one of the reasons why females are showing fast recovery and low mortality from COVID-19.
