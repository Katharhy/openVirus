<p>With respect to the third target of viral suppression, there also are geographic and demographic disparities. As mentioned previously, approximately 47% of people living with HIV globally have achieved viral suppression. But, there are significant regional differences, with the proportion being as low as 22% in the Middle East and North Africa and as high as 65% in Western and Central Europe and North America.

 </sup> Even in countries with significant treatment scale-up programs, such as those supported by PEPFAR, we see viral suppression differences by age and sex/gender. For example, in Uganda, the proportion of young people aged 15–24 years achieving viral suppression is about 22% lower than that for adults aged 15–64 years
