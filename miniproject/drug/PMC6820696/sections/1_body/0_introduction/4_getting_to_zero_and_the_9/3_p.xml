<p>Variation in reporting reflects some confusion about the difference between targets and cascades. For the 90-90-90 framework, the denominators of the second and third targets are derivative from the target before, that is, 
 <italic>of those who are diagnosed</italic>, the proportion who are on treatment, and 
 <italic>of those who are on treatment</italic>, the proportion who have achieved viral suppression. This is different from the testing and treatment cascade framework, in which the denominator of each step always is the 
 <italic>total number of people living with HIV</italic>, regardless of whether they have been diagnosed, accessed treatment, or achieved viral suppression. The latter analysis translates the targets into a less ambitious (and much less catchy) 90-81-73.
