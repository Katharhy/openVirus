<p>Patients with comorbidities including hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes tend to have higher risk for having severe COVID-19 which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and mortality.

 </sup> Statins are commonly prescribed in most of the patients with CVDs according to current diabetes and cardiovascular guidelines. Statins are known to have anti-inflammatory effects which involved in Myd88 and downstream nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathways, which was highly activated in SARS-CoV infection. Several studies showed statins might have beneficial effect on influenza infection.

 </sup> Statin also showed potential therapeutic effects on hyper-inflammatory ARDS.

 </sup> In JUPITER trial, a post hoc analysis showed a reduction in incident pneumonia with rosuvastatin.

 </sup> Currently there is no evidence to determine whether statin usage could be beneficial in COVID-19. Farag et al screened more than 2000 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2 main protease enzyme substrate-binding pocket focusing using simulated structural analysis and the results showed rosuvastatin might be a promising target.

 </sup> Large-scale observational or randomized trials would be needed to determine the effect of statins on COVID-19. For now, statin therapy should be continued in patients with suspected COVID-19 infection with existing cardiovascular comorbidities since no evidence show harmful and acute cardiac injury could also occur in COVID-19. Adverse effects of statin should still be monitored since myalgia, increased creatine phosphokinase, rhabdomyolysis, and acute kidney injury do occur in patients with COVID-19.

 </sup> Also, drug-drug interactions between statins and protease inhibitors had been described and should also be carefully accessed during clinical practice.
