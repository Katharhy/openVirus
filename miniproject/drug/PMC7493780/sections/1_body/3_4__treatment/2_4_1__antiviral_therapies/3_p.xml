 </sup> In a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label multicenter trial involving adult patients with COVID-19, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive conventional therapy plus umifenovir or favipiravir for 10 days. The primary outcome was clinical recovery rate of day 7. The results showed favipiravir, compared with umifenovir, did not significantly improve the clinically recovery rate at day 7 but favipiravir significantly improved the latency to relief for pyrexia and cough.
