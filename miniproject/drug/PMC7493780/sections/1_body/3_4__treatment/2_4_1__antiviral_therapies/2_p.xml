<p>Lopinavir and ritonavir were two protease inhibitor which was used to treat HIV infection. In a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 and high oxygen demand, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir-ritonavir (400 and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days in addition to standard care or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital. Although the results showed no benefit on primary endpoint and the detectable viral load were also similar between the two groups, there were still some suggestions of potential benefit with lopinavir-ritonavir with a shorter intensive care unit (ICU) stay and a shorter time to hospital discharge.
