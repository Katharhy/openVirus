<p>COVID-19 pathological mechanisms also contribute to increased venous thromboembolic risks which include endothelial damage, microvascular thrombosis/occlusion, and even autoimmune mechanisms. Coagulopathy is known to occur in the majority of patients who die of COVID-19. In a study of 449 patients with severe COVID-19, anticoagulant therapy mainly with low molecular weight heparin appeared to be associated with lower mortality in the subpopulation meeting sepsis-induced coagulopathy criteria or with markedly elevated 
 <sc>d</sc>-dimer. Currently statements suggest that all hospitalized COVID-19 patients should receive thromboprophylaxis, or full therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation if indication is present.

 </sup> Future research is needed to determine the optimal dose/duration of anticoagulation therapy.
