<p>Colchicine was initially extracted from 
 <italic>Colchicum autumnale</italic> (autumn crocus) and is an inexpensive, orally administered, potent anti-inflammatory medication that has been used for centuries. The mechanism of action is through the inhibition of tubulin polymerization and microtubule generation and affects the activities of cellular adhesion molecules, inflammatory chemokines, and the inflammasome.

 </sup> Evidences showed colchicine counteracts the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby reducing the release of IL-1b and an array of other ILs, including IL-6.

 </sup> Recently, colchicine has been successfully used in two cases of life-threatening posttransplant capillary leak syndrome, which mechanism also involves cytokine release.

 </sup> Colchicine has been shown to limit IL-1b production as a response to various NLRP3 inflammasome inducers in a dose-dependent fashion.

 </sup> Several trials have been performed for evaluating the effect of colchicine on the COVID-19 infection (NCT NCT04326790, NCT04322682).
