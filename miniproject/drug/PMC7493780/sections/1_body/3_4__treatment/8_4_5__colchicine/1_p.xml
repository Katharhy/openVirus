<p>Patients with severe COVID-19 infection have higher serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-Î±, interleukin [IL]-1 and IL-6) and chemokines (IL-8) compared with individuals with mild disease or healthy controls. In experimental models, it has been shown that inflammasome NLRP3 is a major pathophysiological component in the development of ARDS and acute lung injury. The simulated structural models have shown that COVID-19 proteins (eg, viroporins E, 3a, and 8A) might provoke the activation of inflammasome NLP3.</p>
