<p>ACE2 is an enzyme within the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that is expressed on the cell surface of type 2 alveolar epithelial cells in the lungs and other tissues. It also acts as the receptor for the SARS-CoV spike protein. The affinity of SARS- CoV-2 for ACE2 is 10- to 20-fold higher than that of SARS- CoV. ACE2 is a crucial counter-regulatory component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and shares approximately 60% homology with ACE. ACE2 levels are increased following treatment with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which yield the concerns that using these medications might increase the severity of COVID-19, especially in patients with existing cardiovascular diseases. However, the experimental and clinical data showed conflicting results. Experimental models of acute lung injury, including a model of SARS-CoV infection, suggest that ARBs may mitigate COVID-19 by attenuating Ang IIâ€“mediated acute lung injury by blocking AT1R.

 </sup> RAAS inhibitors on ACE2 are complex and should not be assumed that changes in ACE2 levels reflect changes in ACE2 levels in the lung, which is the portal of entry for SARS-CoV2.

 </sup> Currently, there is no evidence either from clinical or animal study showing that ACEI/ARB use increase cardiovascular complication. Therefore, the ACC/AHA statement suggested the ACEI/ARB use should continue in patients prescribing ACEI/ARB already (

Interestingly, Zhang et al just reported a retrospective, multicenter cohort of 1128 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and hypertension. The results showed inpatient use of ACEI/ARB in COVID-19 patients with hypertension was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with non-users.

 </sup> Paired trials of losartan as a treatment for COVID-19 are being conducted among patients who have not previously received treatment with a RAAS inhibitor and are either hospitalized (NCT04312009) or not hospitalized (NCT04311177).
