<p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2; also known COVID-19), which belongs to coronavirinae subfamily, is a single-strand RNA coronavirus, which enters human cells mainly by binding the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.

 </sup> ACE2 is mainly located at human oral pharynx, upper airway, heart, liver, kidney, intestine, neuron, and testis. After virus binding with ACE2 and entering the cell, receptor downregulation happens, which currently supposed to be host defense mechanism to limit further viral invasion or viral-induced mechanism to escape immune system.

 </sup> After endocytosis, the virus leaves the endosome by PH-dependent cysteine protease and begins its replication. During above process, ACE2 receptor downregulation will significantly diminish the physiological functions of ACE2 in degrading angiotensin-2 (ANG2) into angiotensin 1-7 (ANG1-7). Physiologically, ANG2 can cause vasoconstriction, aldosterone secretion, increase inflammation and ROS production, thrombosis, and fibrosis; reciprocally, ANG1-7 can be considered as regulatory enzyme that opposes the effect of ANG2 and becomes cyto-protective (eg, anti-inflammation, anti-fibrosis). The downregulation of ACE2 leads to decreased ANG1-7 level and increased ANG2 level, which may induce uncontrollable cytokine storm and could lead to organ dysfunction in critical cases.
