<p>The major symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Other symptoms such as headache, anorexia, malaise, sputum production, nasal congestion, diarrhea, or parageusia may also be presented initially. The viral transmission and spreading could occur in asymptomatic carriers. Typical chest compute tomography findings of COVID-19 are bilateral subpleural and peripheral ground-glass opacities and consolidations, which could be seen in 75% of the patients.

 </sup> The most common lab finding of COVID-19 is lymphopenia (83.2%). Other lab abnormalities similar to viral infections are noted such as leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Several biomarkers are linked to severe inflammatory response and could be used as poor prognostic factors such as ferritin, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), 
 <sc>d</sc>-dimer, troponin, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). About 8% to 28% patients with COVID-19 have elevated troponin levels, which indicate cardiac injury.

 </sup> Acute respiratory infections and respiratory system distress are recognized triggers for CVD and the underlying CVDs are also associated with increased severity of infectious diseases.
