 </sup> The estimated mean incubation period for COVID-19 is about 2 to 14 days, with about 15% asymptomatic carrier and 85% symptomatic patients. Among all patients with symptoms, 80% are mild cases and 20% are severe to critical cases. According to World Health Organization (WHO) as of March 3, the estimated mortality rate is about 3.4%, in which the comorbidity of cardiovascular disease may result in 10.5% mortality rate, much higher than diabetes (7.3%), chronic respiratory disease (6.3%), or no preexisting conditions (0.9%).
