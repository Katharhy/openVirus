<p>Many patients with COVID-19 have evidences of myocardial damage. Shi et al reported that among 416 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, 19.7% had myocardial injury which were manifested by elevated high-sensitivity troponin-I levels. Patients with myocardial injury had a significant higher in-hospital mortality rate (51.2%) compared with those without (4.5%).

 </sup> also presented a cohort of 187 hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 and a total of 27.8% had myocardial injury as manifested by elevated troponin T levels. Similarly, mortality was significantly higher in those with elevated troponin T levels than those with normal troponin T levels (59.6% vs 8.9%, respectively;

Higher mortality was found in those with elevated troponin T levels in preexisting CVD (64.4%) and without prior CVD (37.5%), indicating that myocardial injury was correlated with the risk of mortality. Similar findings were also observed in western population. In a series of patients from Seattle, patients with evidence of cardiac involvement had a marked increase in mortality.

 </sup> In addition, during the internalization process of COVID-19 into human cell, activated macrophages can release cytokines, which will promote the expression of adhesion molecules for endothelial activation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and vascular inflammation. The dysfunctional endothelium becomes proadhesive and procoagulant. The activated macrophages can also release procoagulant factors, such as plasminogen activator that further accelerates vascular inflammation and enhances a prothrombotic state, and this is often seen with high 
 <sc>d</sc>-dimer levels in COVID-19 infection. The presence of microangiopathy and microthrombi leads to micro-infarcts within the cardiac tissue and also contributes to plaque rupture and acute myocardial infarction.
