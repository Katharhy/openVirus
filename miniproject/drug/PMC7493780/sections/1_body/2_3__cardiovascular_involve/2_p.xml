<p>In addition to intracoronary plaque rupture, myocardial injury could result from other reasons. From a series of 18 patients with ST-segment elevation in New York with confirmed COVID-19, only six (67%) of nine patients who received coronary angiography had obstructive disease and five (56%) underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (one after the administration of fibrinolytic agents.

 </sup> Increased troponin value represents evidence of myocardial injury and these may come from cytokine storm, hypoxic injury, coronary spasm, microthrombi, myocarditis, or true plaque rupture.

 </sup> Severe infections could cause hypoxia and hypoperfusion to vital organs which predispose patient to thrombotic events.

 </sup> Guo et al demonstrated additional insights that patients with high troponin T levels are associated with higher levels of CRP, procalcitonin, 
 <sc>d</sc>-dimer, NT-proBNP, and greater leukocyte counts, indicating that myocardial injury was correlated with the severity of inflammation.

 </sup> From previous influenza epidemics, more patients die of cardiovascular events than respiratory involvements.

 </sup> Viral infections can trigger acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmias, and exacerbation of heart failure, owing to combination of systemic inflammatory response and localized arterial inflammation.

 </sup> Systemic inflammation or hypoxemia resulted from COVID-19 may also induce atrial/ventricular arrhythmia, most commonly atrial fibrillation, which may raise the issue of anticoagulants usage.
