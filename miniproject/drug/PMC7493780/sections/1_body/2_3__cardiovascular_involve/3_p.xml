 </sup> In addition, 71% of COVID-19 patients who died fulfilled the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria for DIC, compared with only 0.6% among survivors.

 </sup> Furthermore, a small proportion of patients may have direct cardiac involvement including cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, or heart failure. One COVID-19 case was reported to have myocarditis with reduced systolic function and marked biventricular myocardial interstitial edema according to cardiac magnetic resonance images.

 </sup> Sporadic autopsy cases also showed infiltration of interstitial mononuclear inflammatory within myocardium.

 </sup> Endomyocardial biopsy done in a COVID-19 patient with cardiogenic shock showed viral particles in the myocardium, suggesting the damages could either come from viremic phase or migration of infected macrophages.
