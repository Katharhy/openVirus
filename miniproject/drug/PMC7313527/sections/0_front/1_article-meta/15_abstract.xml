 <p>The SARS-CoV binds its spike (S) proteins to host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Following entry, the viral RNA is released in the cytoplasm - a potential site of thymoquinone to stop the release. ORF1a and ORF1ab are translated to RdRP which eventually synthesizes mediate both replication and transcription. The Zn2+ can stop viral replication by inactivating (
  <bold>―|</bold>) RdRP. Another bioactive component of black seed 
  <italic>i.e.</italic>, nigellimine might have dual actions working as ionophore (→) to enhance Zn entry into the infected cells as well as to inhibit (
  <bold>―|</bold>) the uncoating of the virus inside the infected cells. However, if allowed to continue, replication, full-length (−) RNA copies of the genome are produced and used as templates for full-length (+) RNA genomes. During transcription, sub-genomic RNAs are produced through discontinuous transcription which are eventually translated to synthesize viral proteins. Generally, viral nucleocapsids are assembled from genomic RNA and N protein in the cytoplasm, followed by budding into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi intermediate compartment. Virions are then released from the infected cell through exocytosis. (→, activation or stimulation;
