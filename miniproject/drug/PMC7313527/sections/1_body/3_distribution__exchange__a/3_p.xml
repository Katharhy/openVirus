 <sup>2+</sup>) can be toxic to the cells by inhibiting cytoplasmic enzymes such as adenylate cyclase (
 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, intracellular homeostasis of Zn as well as exchange of Zn in and out of the cells is critical and is controlled by two Zn transporter protein families namely, SLC39A (Zn importer protein
