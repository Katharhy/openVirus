<p id="par0125">Among the active medicinally bioactive constituents from 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic>, thymoquinone has been given more emphasis (

 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">Houghton et al., 1995</xref>). For example, 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil and thymoquinone were found to produce antinociceptive effects through indirect activation of the supraspinal μ1- and κ-opioid receptor subtypes (
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Abdel-Fattah et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, brain endogenous angiotensin II was suggested to be involved in central nociceptive mechanisms by its antagonistic interaction with the endogenous opioid system (

 <xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">Lantz et al., 1991</xref>). These lines of evidence suggest that opioid receptors and ACE share similar inhibitory molecules. Hence it is not impossible that thymoquinone might also block ACE2. In other words, thymoquinone may block the SARS-CoV-2 entry
