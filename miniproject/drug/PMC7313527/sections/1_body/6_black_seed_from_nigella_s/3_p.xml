 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds contain unsaturated fatty acids (26 %–38 %), proteins, alkaloids, saponins (melanin), and essential oil (0.4 %–2.5 %). A GC–MS analysis has revealed a mixture of eight fatty acids and 32 volatile terpenes in the seed extract (
 <xref rid="bib0320" ref-type="bibr">Nickavar et al., 2003</xref>). Thymoquinone, dithymoquinone (nigellone), thymohydroquinone, and thymol are considered the main active constituents. Thymoquinone is the major component (28 %–57 %) of the volatile essential oil (
