 <sup>2+</sup> access to SARS-CoV-2 infected pneumocytes is crucial to fight back the viral pathogenesis. However, oral supplement of Zn alone may not make sufficient availability of Zn in pneumocytes. Earlier it was proven that chloroquine can enhance the uptake of Zn by lysosomes - a cellular organelle important for SARS-CoV-2 replication (

Given the similar chemical structure of a number of terpenes present in black seed such as nigellimine, they might provide similar ionophore functions to aid Zn entry to pneumocytes. While the other component, thymoquinone, might inhibit the binding of the virus with ACE2 on the pneumocytes.
