 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Cortegiani et al., 2020</xref>) argued that “there is sufficient pre-clinical rationale and evidence regarding the effectiveness of chloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 as well as evidence of safety from long-time use in clinical practice for other indications.” Use of chloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients in China also showed clinical and virologic benefit (
