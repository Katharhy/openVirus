<p id="par0110">Chloroquine was further hypothesized to interfere with SARS-CoV-2â€²s abiity to bind to ACE2 receptor and prevents its entry into pneumocytes as it might inhibit sialic acids biosynthesis to limit cell surface binding of SARS-CoV-2. Among the other possible mode of protection, chloroquine has been hypothesized to modulate the acidification of endosomes thereby inhibiting formation of the autophagosome. Through reduction of cellular mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation, chloroquine may also inhibit virus replication. Moreover, chloroquine could alter M protein maturation and interfere with virion assembly and budding (
