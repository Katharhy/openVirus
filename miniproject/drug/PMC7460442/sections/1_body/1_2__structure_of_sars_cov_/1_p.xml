<p>The viral genome of SARS-CoV-2 is composed of 29,903 nucleotides and highly resembles SARS-like CoVs infecting bats with a nucleotide similarity of 89.1%. SARS-CoV-2, like other CoVs, possesses a large RNA genome and exhibits a unique replication strategy. Specifically, the virus has a nonsegmented positive-sense RNA genome with a 5′cap structure along with a 3′ poly (A) tail. This unique structure allows the replicase polyproteins to read the genome for translation. Two-thirds of the genome encodes nonstructural proteins (NSPs), while the remaining one-third encodes for structural and accessory proteins. Vital structural proteins are spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. In addition, two viral replicase polyproteins termed PP1a and PP1ab are produced by the virus, which are modified into 16 mature NSPs [
