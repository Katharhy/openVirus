<p>SARS-CoV-2 targets the lower respiratory tract and causes mild to severe symptoms. COVID-19 patients show significant clinical symptoms, including non-productive cough, myalgia, reduced leukocyte, dyspnea, fever, fatigue, and pneumonia.

Although the pathogenesis of novel coronavirus disease is not fully understood, the similarity of novel coronavirus with SARS-CoV can provide significant information about the pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection. The body shows aggressive inflammatory responses after viral entry, and it may cause severe damage to airways. The pathogenicity is increased by a large number of viral copies replicated in the cell. The life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 is divided into four stages: (i) entry of the virus, (ii) protein expression, (iii) transcription, and (iv) release of the virus from the cell [
