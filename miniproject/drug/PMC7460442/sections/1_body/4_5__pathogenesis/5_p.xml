<p>As discussed earlier, ACE2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. It has been reported that the involvement of ACE2 receptors is also related to the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) in 2019-nCoV pathogenesis [

 <xref rid="B63-ijerph-17-05904" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The results of the study suggest that the increase of the I/D allele frequency ratio significantly increases the recovery rate (point estimate: 0.48, confidence interval (CI) 95%: 0.05–0.91, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.027), but the I/D allele frequency ratio has no significant difference in the case of death rate (point estimate: 1.74, CI 95%: 4.5–1.04, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.22). The I/D allele ratio of ACE receptors varies significantly across world regions, accounting for the different recovery rates across regions, but it also raises concerns that ethnic and genetic differences can impact the effectiveness of currently investigated RAS-associated medications in different regions [
