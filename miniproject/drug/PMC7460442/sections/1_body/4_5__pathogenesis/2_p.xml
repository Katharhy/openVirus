<p>Coronavirus enters the cell by its sole determinant viral S-protein and undergoes several steps to accomplish the replication. While S-protein is divided into two domains, S1 and S2 domain, the S1 domain is responsible for binding with the receptor, and the S2 domain accounts for the fusion of the viral membrane with the cell membrane [

 <xref rid="B55-ijerph-17-05904" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] showed that the proteolytic processes occur in the S2 domain, which accounts for fusion and infection. After the viral entry, the RNA genome of the virus is released in the cytoplasm and then undergoes translation, followed by transcription, through which the virus continues to replicate [
 <xref rid="B56-ijerph-17-05904" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. After the formation of viral proteins by translation, these new proteins are inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus. When viral RNA is combined with the proteins, the nucleocapsid is formed. Finally, the newly formed viruses enclosed in the vesicles are released by exocytosis [

Higher leukocyte count, respiratory problems, and exaggerated pro-inflammatory cytokines are exhibited by COVID-19 patients. In a case report, a patient presented with fever for the past two days displayed abnormal breathing sounds and a temperature of 39.0 Â°C. The real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) conducted on the sputum culture showed a positive result for COVID-19 and confirmed the disease [
