<p>Further studies concluded that the genome sequence of COVID-19 is highly related to CoV infecting bats [

It is suggested that SARS-CoV-2 originated from the Chinese chrysanthemum bat as their genomic sequence is very much similar to SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, there may be an intermediate host between humans and bats. The pangolin, an animal used by the Chinese for its meat and having specific medicinal value, is thought to be the source of this virus. Epidemiologists speculate that someone who purchased a pangolin from one of the wet markets in Wuhan got infected after consumption, setting forward the chain of transmission [
