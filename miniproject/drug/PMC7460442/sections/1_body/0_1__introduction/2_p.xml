 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-05904" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The current strain of COVID-19 is less deadly than the previous MERS-CoV infection, with a mortality rate of 40%, and SARS-CoV, with a mortality rate of 10% [

Epidemiological investigations conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that the COVID-19 triggered by the Huanan South China seafood marketplace in Wuhan. However, no substantial evidence to exhibit that animal connection has been identified [
