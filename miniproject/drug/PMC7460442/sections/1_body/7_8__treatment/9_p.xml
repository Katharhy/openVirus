<p>SARS-CoV-2 targets the ACE2 receptor via spike-like protein, so it is an efficient target for the drugs, including chloroquine, promazine, and emodine, to prevent the viral attachment with the surface of the host cell [

S protein priming is the next precarious phase of viral entry into the host cell, where it is required to be cleaved by intracellular proteases including TMPRSS2, cathepsins, and furin for the fusion of viral membrane with the cell membrane of the host. S-protein priming by TMPRSS2 is the most crucial phase for the prognosis of infection into the host, so the viral infection can be controlled with the use of protease inhibitors, including camostat and nafamostat, which target TMPRSS2, and thereby inhibit the viral fusion [

Apart from antiviral therapy, the use of antibiotics can be used for the associated co-infections, community-acquired, or hospital-acquired pneumonia, and it depends on the clinical results of the patients. These broad-spectrum antibiotics, including azithromycin and fluoroquinolones, can be given as empirical therapy to cover all attainable pathogens, continuing the therapy until all pathogenic bacteria are cleared from the body. The combination therapy of azithromycin with hydroxychloroquine showed significant activity against COVID-19 infection [
