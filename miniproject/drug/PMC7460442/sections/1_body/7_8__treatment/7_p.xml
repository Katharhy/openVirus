<p>As discussed earlier, a variety of drugs are recommended and tested in non-clinical models; among them, penciclovir, ribavirin, and favipiravir require high doses to decrease the infection and are supposed to be less effective [

An open-label, non-randomized clinical trial showed that hydroxychloroquine (600 mg/day) treatment is magnificently related to a decreased rate of viral replication in patients, and its effectiveness is reinforced by azithromycin (500 mg/day) [

Contrary to the previous results, at the time of publication, an open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial showed that the use of hydroxychloroquine alone or with azithromycin did not improve the clinical status of hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 as compared with standard care [
