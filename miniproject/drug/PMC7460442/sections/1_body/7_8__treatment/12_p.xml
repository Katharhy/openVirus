<p>A most recent study published in Lancet claims the production of a vaccine named PittCoVacc developed by the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. PittCoVacc uses S-protein, which provides protection by the induction of specific antibodies in the body. Researchers are conducting different analyses on the vaccine, and they are planning a series of tests in humans in the coming months [

Another vaccine named mRNA-1273 is being developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease researchers combined with biotechnology institution Moderna. In this case, mRNA is enclosed in lipid nanoparticles that encode the S-protein of the virus, and then it takes the antigen into the body. In response to antigen, specific antibodies are produced that provide protection against SARS-CoV-2. The clinical trial of the mRNA vaccine is underway, while scientists are working together to evaluate the pathogenesis and clinical features for combating the disease by approaching a series of therapeutic options and development of other vaccines [
