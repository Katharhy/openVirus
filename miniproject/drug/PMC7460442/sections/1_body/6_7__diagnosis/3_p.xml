<p>Subsequently, when nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR results come back positive, it is accounted for as a confirmed case [

Meanwhile, a CT scan of the chest provides confirmed diagnostic evidence of COVID-19 disease as it has greater sensitivity and high specificity. Thus, the chest CT has been recognized as a significant indicator for COVID-19 diagnosis in different epidemic areas [

In this context, a study compared three RT-PCR analyses, targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RdRp/Helicase, spike, and nucleocapsid genes of the virus with testified RdRp-P2 assay, which is extensively used in more than 30 European countries. According to this study, RdRp/Hel is more specific and gives accurate results for SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the RdRp/helicase assay of COVID-19 does not cross-react with other types of coronaviruses and respiratory microorganisms in the cellular medium. In contrast, the RdRp-P2 assay, reported for previous coronaviruses, reacts with the pathogens of the respiratory tract in the cell culture. Thus, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel can be considered sensitive and specific, and this information helps fortify the diagnosis of COVID-19 [
