<p>An unimaginably high degree of transmission raised a question of whether evolution was stimulated by mutations. Genetic mutation analysis is essential for understanding evolution [
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-17-05904" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A study was conducted to understand and evaluate the genetic mutations pattern, in which eighty-six genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were selected. All strains were identified in patients from Australia, China, France, England, Germany, Taiwan, Japan, Belgium, USA, and Vietnam. China was used as a reference to evaluate the sequence of the genome. SARS-CoV-2 presents a specific type of protein, a long ORF1ab polyprotein at the 5′ end with additional structural proteins, including envelope protein, spike glycoprotein, matrix, and nucleocapsid protein. The genetic examination identified three deletions in the genomes collected from Australia, the USA, and Japan. Out of three deletions, two deletions were noted in the ORF1ab polyprotein, and one deletion was noted in the 3′ end of the genome. Furthermore, changing antigenicity may be driven by the mutations that occurred in the spike glycoproteins, which may be the reason for the vigorous pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 [
