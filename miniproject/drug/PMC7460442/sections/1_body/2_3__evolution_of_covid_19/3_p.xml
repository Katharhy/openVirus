<p>Two precarious mutations were observed in the bat coronaviruses considered highly transmissible so far and are attributed to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Out of the two, the first improved the structure of spike proteins that appeared as projections on the outer surface of the virus. These modified spike proteins allow the virus to attach to the ACE2 receptor, which spans the respiratory tract lining. The second critical mutation permitted the virus to develop a protein dagger named furin, which can slice other proteins to cause the virus to bind firmly to the lung and throat cells. It is presumed that furin protein is the reason that COVID-19 is so deadly and contagious to humans [
