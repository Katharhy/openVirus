<p>It has been suggested that most of the coronavirus species infecting humans are found in the bat reservoir [

A recent study showed that the gene sequence of novel coronavirus has 96.2% similarity to the coronaviruses found in bat (RaTG13), 89.1% similarity to SARS-CoV [

 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-17-05904" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It has been documented that both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV attach to the same receptor at the host named angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2). After analyzing and evaluating 103 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), a recent study showed that the virus evolved into two L and S types. SNPs showed absolute linkage across the strain of SARS-CoV-2. Examination of these types revealed that the L-type (70%) is predominant as compared with the S-type (30%). The evolutionary inspection suggested that the S-type is the most ancient form of SARS-CoV-2. Several tests and analyses also showed that the L-type is more vigorous and cruel as compared with the S-type [
