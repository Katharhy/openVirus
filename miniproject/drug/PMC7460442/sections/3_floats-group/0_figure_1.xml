  <p>The life cycle of a coronavirus, modified, and used from Zhang et al. [
   <xref rid="B27-ijerph-17-05904" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] with an open-access journal license. Upon entry to the host lungs, the CoV attaches to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-2) receptors and releases its nuclear content into the cytoplasm. Translation of the RNA makes replicase complex, which results in the formation of transcripts of several proteins (named in pink box). Translation of these transcripts makes spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and other accessory proteins. Assembly of these proteins produces a new virion that is matured and is released out of the cell to infect other cells.
