<p id="p0058">We propose, then, a Multi-Objective Optimisation (MOO) approach to the problem. For a recent review of MOO applications in optimisation, we refer the reader to Gunantara

 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In the following, we consider the hierarchical objective approach, in which the planner first optimises for their main objective (number of tests performed) and then, among all the solutions which give an optimal objective value, looks for the one optimising a secondary objective (mean test waiting time).
