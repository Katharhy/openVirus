<p id="p0047">In 
 <xref rid="sec0002" ref-type="sec">SectionÂ 2</xref> we mentioned two limitations of the 
 <italic>Base Model</italic> which might not hold true in real-life applications. The first limitation is that there is a fixed quantity of swabs assigned to each laboratory. In most countries, central or regional health authorities oversee and plan testing. Swabs collected in a region, for example, might be sent for testing to any laboratory in the same region. The second limitation is that tests (and reagent) can move overnight from any location to any other location subject to global capacity limits. When applying the model to large countries, though, logistic constraints might impose that movement of material only happen between geographically close locations.
