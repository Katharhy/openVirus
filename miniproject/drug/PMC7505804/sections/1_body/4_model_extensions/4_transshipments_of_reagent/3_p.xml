<p id="p0052">Without capacities, moving swabs and reagent would be equivalent. For example, a lab 
 <italic>l</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> could send a swab it cannot test to another lab 
 <italic>l</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>, because 
 <italic>l</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> does not have enough reagent to test it; or, which is the same, 
 <italic>l</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> could send one unit of reagent to 
 <italic>l</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>, which could test their swab by themselves. In the presence of capacities determined by equipment and personnel availability, though, the two options are not interchangeable. In the example above, 
 <italic>l</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> might not have the capacity to test one more swab, while 
 <italic>l</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> could have it if provided with the necessary reagent.
