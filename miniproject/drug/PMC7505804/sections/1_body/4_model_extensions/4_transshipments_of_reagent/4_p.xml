<p id="p0053">In light of the above considerations, we propose an extension of the model in which reagent can be forwarded between labs: a practice which goes by the name of 
 <italic>transshipment</italic>. A planner can also use transshipments as a way to extend the radius at which factories send their products, by first storing them at a lab to which the factory ships and, when the need arises, forwarding them to other labs â€” even if these labs were not originally reachable from the factory with an overnight shipment. Because reagent take one day to move between labs, we are indirectly introducing distance-based lead times in the reagent supply chain.
