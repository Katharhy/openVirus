  <p id="p0020">We assume that quantities 
   <italic>q</italic>
   <sup>rg</sup> and 
   <italic>q</italic>
   <sup>sw</sup> are global capacity limits on the total amount of reagent and swab movements. Such an assumption rests on the observation that, during an epidemic, a central decision-maker manages logistic resources and can reallocate them from one area to another. If this were not the case, it would not be hard to enforce local limits, e.g., on the number of swabs that the planner can move out of a single laboratory. In a model extensions presented in 
   <xref rid="sec0007" ref-type="sec">SectionÂ 5.1</xref>, locations are partitioned in regions and we impose region-specific capacity limits.
