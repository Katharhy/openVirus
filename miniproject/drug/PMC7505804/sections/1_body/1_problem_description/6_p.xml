<p id="p0021">Given this input data, a planner must determine, for each day of the planning horizon, (i) how many units of reagent to move from the factories to the laboratories, and (ii) how many swabs to move between laboratories, with the aim of maximising the number of tests carried out.

  <p id="p0022">While the main objective of the planner is to maximise the number of swabs tested, it is possible to account for secondary objectives. For example, because effective testing must be both large-scale and quick, one might want to minimise the average time swabs spend waiting at lab facilities. In 
   <xref rid="sec0009" ref-type="sec">SectionÂ 5.3</xref> we propose a multi-objective extension of the problem in which, among all solutions which maximise the number of tests carried out, we select the one with lowest average waiting time.
