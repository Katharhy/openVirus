  <label>Remark</label>
  <p id="p0018">We assume the planner has already chosen the laboratory to which he assigns the swabs. More generally, though, a planner might need that swabs be tested in a given region, without any constraint on which specific lab performs the test, as long as they are geographically close to the point where the swabs were collected. In 
   <xref rid="sec0007" ref-type="sec">Section 5.1</xref>, we will extend the model to take into account this general case, making the number of swabs assigned to each lab a decision variable. We also refer the reader to 
   <xref rid="sec0008" ref-type="sec">Section 5.2</xref>, in which we introduce a fourth possibility for the decision maker: to move some reagent from a lab which has a surplus to one which is lacking.
