<p id="p0036">Constraint 
 <xref rid="eq0007" ref-type="disp-formula">(7)</xref> states that the quantity of reagent in the factory’s inventory at the beginning of the day, plus the quantity produced, is equal to the quantity in inventory at the end of the day, plus the quantity shipped to the labs. Constraint 
 <xref rid="eq0008" ref-type="disp-formula">(8)</xref> equates, on the left-hand side, the quantity of reagent in the lab’s inventory at the start of the day and the total amount received with, on the right-hand side, the inventory at the end of the day, plus the quantity of reagent used (or, which is the same, the number of tests performed). Because all variables are non-negative, constraint 
 <xref rid="eq0008" ref-type="disp-formula">(8)</xref> makes constraint 
 <xref rid="eq0005" ref-type="disp-formula">(5)</xref> redundant.
