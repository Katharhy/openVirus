 <xref rid="eq0001" ref-type="disp-formula">(1)</xref>–
 <xref rid="eq0012" ref-type="disp-formula">(12)</xref> is that it suffers from symmetry. For example, consider any solution with slack capacity to transport swabs between two labs 
 <italic>l</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>, 
 <italic>l</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> ∈ 
 <italic>L</italic> during a day 
 <italic>t</italic> ∈ 
 <italic>T</italic>. One can get another solution of the same cost in which, on day 
 <italic>t, l</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> sends one more swab to 
 <italic>l</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> and 
 <italic>l</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> sends one more swab to 
 <italic>l</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>. To reduce symmetry, we impose two restrictions on the transport of swabs between labs: (i) a lab 
 <italic>l</italic> can ship out swabs only if it is already working at full capacity, i.e., it is testing 
 <italic>Q
  <sub>l</sub>
 </italic> swabs or it ran out of reagent; (ii) a lab can only send or receive swabs during a given day, but not both.
