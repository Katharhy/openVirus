<p id="p0096">Future research on optimising the delivery of mass-scale test programmes can develop integrating other test types, such as immunological tests, i.e., tests which detect the presence of antibodies which a person has developed in response to the viral infection. These tests are too slow for early detection of positive patients; e.g., T and B cells response to COVID-19 were detected around one week after the onset of symptoms 
 <xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, while swab tests can identify the virus even before symptoms appear. However, because antibodies persist in the blood even after a patient does not host the virus any longer, health authorities use immunological tests for mass-screening of populations (including asymptomatic patients) with the aim of assessing the prevalence of the virus, the level of population immunity and other epidemiological dynamics. It would be interesting to study not only how to increase capacity for immunological tests, but also to study the problem of selecting the patients to test with higher priority, in order to create an accurate epidemiological picture of the population while using a restricted supply of antibody tests such as ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay)
