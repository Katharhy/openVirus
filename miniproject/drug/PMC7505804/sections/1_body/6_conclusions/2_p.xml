<p id="p0091">We have proposed a model for the problem of assigning reagent and swabs to laboratories in a country which wants to maximise the number of rRT-PCR tests during a viral epidemic. After describing an Integer Programming model for a basic version of the problem, we have strengthened and extended the formulation to include real-life aspects of the organisation of healthcare systems. The complete model takes into account that many countries manage healthcare at a regional level and that labs can function as reagent transshipment points, and allows to optimise two hierarchical objectives: primarily, maximising the number of tests performed and, secondarily, minimising the average time a swab waits before it is tested.</p>
