<p id="p0092">We performed two computational studies: the first based on real-life data from Italy and the second on synthetic instances. Under the assumptions we used, the main one being that reagent availability is often a bottleneck for testing more swabs (see, e.g.,

   <p id="p0093">Increased inter-regional coordination has the potential of increasing the testing capabilities of the country as a whole, as shown by the analysis of Italian data. In particular, moving swabs from critical regions to regions with spare capacity produced an increase of up to 40% in the number of swabs tested in the Italian scenario. The study performed on synthetic data confirmed this finding, but found a more modest effect. The recommendation, in fact, is that countries which do not have adequate lab infrastructure (i.e., which would have insufficient test capacity even if fully stocked with reagent) first focus on expanding their lab network, e.g., by purchasing new machines and training more lab personnel. Countries with an advanced laboratory infrastructure, instead, will benefit more from inter-regional collaboration.</p>

   <p id="p0094">Steady availability of reagent has a large impact on the number of swabs tested and their waiting time. A solid chemical industrial base, with many (although possibly small) factories producing reagent daily gives an advantage compared with having to rely on a discontinuous supply, e.g., when purchasing from international markets. If the supply is not steady, then we recommend to allow labs to work as small warehouses by letting them forward reagent to other labs, i.e., enabling transshipments.</p>
