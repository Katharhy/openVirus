 <xref rid="fig0007" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 7</xref> shows example results from the 
 <italic>Regional</italic> and 
 <italic>400Km</italic> models, for four representative Italian regions from the north (Piemonte and Emilia-Romagna), the centre (Lazio) and the south (Sicilia) of the country. Each chart reports the number of swabs analysed per day. Note how, for three of the four regions, the results of the 
 <italic>Regional</italic> model agree with the real data, validating our modelling assumptions and hinting that regions managed resources locally efficiently. In all four regions, during the last period of the planning horizon, the models use the full laboratory capacity and their curves appear flat, i.e., the limiting factor is not reagent availability anymore, but structural limitations such as testing machines or lab personnel. Note how, in Sicily during the middle period, the 
 <italic>400Km</italic> model provides a solution with fewer tested swabs than the 
 <italic>Regional</italic> model and the 
 <italic>Real Data</italic>, for two days. However, there was a catch-up on the tests during the last part of the planning horizon, resulting in more tests carried out in total.
