<p id="p0065">Finally, we consider the output obtained from the Hierarchical Model, but allowing for reallocation of swabs between laboratories in different regions. This assumption effectively means that regional daily demand can be shared across regions. Because swabs would need to move within a short time (e.g., overnight) we put limitations on the inter-laboratory distance that allows swab transfer. We consider three thresholds of 100Km, 200Km and 400Km and we denote the corresponding data as 
 <bold>Model - 100Km, Model - 200Km</bold> and 
 <bold>Model - 400Km</bold>. (We make an exception for the island region of Sardinia, for which moving swabs outside of the region would be unfeasible even if there are other laboratories within 400Km.) 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>b shows how laboratories can transfer swabs when using the 200Km threshold. Compare 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>a and b to note how inter-regional collaboration gives a central planner more opportunities to move swabs between regions in case there should be a day with a demand peak in a particular area. We refer the reader to
