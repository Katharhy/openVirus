 <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> reports detailed results of the analysis. Each row corresponds to one day, and the columns list the real data and the results obtained using the model. Columns 
 <italic>#tests</italic> report the number of swabs tested during that day. Columns 
 <italic>%gain</italic> are the percentage gains obtained using the models, compared to the number of swabs actually tested in Italy in the described period. The last row gives aggregate results for the whole country. Note how using optimisation techniques results in a testing capacity increase between 14% and 39%, under the hypotheses explained above. In particular, assuming that tests in Italy were largely limited by the unavailability of reagent due to a poor allocation of supplies and low inter-regional collaboration, optimising these two aspects can allow to perform up to 250 000 more tests (the increase between 
 <italic>Real Data</italic> and 
 <italic>Model - 400Km</italic>) during 13 days.
