 <xref rid="fig0006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> shows the number of swabs tested, day-by-day, when using our proposed models 
 <italic>Regional, 100Km, 200Km</italic>, and 
 <italic>400Km</italic>. Note how 
 <italic>Model - 400Km</italic> fully uses the system’s capacity during the last period of the time horizon, where the number of tested swabs becomes a flat line. During some days, a model with fewer lab transfer capabilities gives more tested swabs than a model in which more transfers are allowed. For example, on April 6, using 
 <italic>Model - 400Km</italic> results in fewer tests than 
 <italic>Model - 200Km</italic> and 
 <italic>Model - 100Km</italic>. This is not surprising if we consider that the models maximise the number of swabs tested over the whole planning horizon, even if this results in fewer tests on any particular day.
