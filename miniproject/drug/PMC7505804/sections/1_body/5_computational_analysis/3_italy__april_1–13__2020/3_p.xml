<p id="p0063">We analyse the number of swabs tested, day by day and region by region, using five different scenarios. The first uses the official numbers released by Italy’s “
 <italic>Dipartimento della Protezione Civile</italic>”, which we refer to as 
 <bold>Real Data</bold>. Next, we consider the output obtained by the Hierarchical Model, under the following hypotheses. Swabs collected in a region cannot be sent to other regions, but can be allocated to any laboratory within the collection region (for this reason we label this data as 
 <bold>Model - Regional</bold>). In modelling terms, this corresponds to setting

We use this hypothesis to model how testing happens in Italy, with local laboratories and regional “reference laboratories” collecting swabs from all-over the region and providing double checks before non-urgent hospital admissions (emergency patients are admitted even before test results are ready) and discharges. Also remind that the Italian healthcare system is managed on a regional basis, with ample autonomy given to the local health authorities but little inter-regional interaction 
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. We assume that labs can procure reagent from their geographically closest factory, and that procurement is optimised by a planner deciding the quantities of reagent sent to each laboratory, to maximise the number of tested swabs. This assumption reflects how Italian regions were procuring supplies autonomously, before the central government created and rendered operational a COVID-19 Commissariat which also acted as a national procurement centre
