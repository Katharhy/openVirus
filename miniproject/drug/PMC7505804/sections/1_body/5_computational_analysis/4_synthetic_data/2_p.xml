<p id="p0069">By conducting a scenario analysis on synthetic data, we want to learn how some aspects of the healthcare system of the area hit by an epidemic can affect its ability to perform large-scale testing of the population. The factors we analyse are:
 <list list-type="simple" id="lst0001">
  <list-item id="lstitem0009">
   <label>1.</label>
   <p id="p0070">The effects of having a healthcare system with a large level of independent decision-making at the sub-national level (as is the case, e.g., of Italian regions, Spanish autonomous communities, German lander or the United States) and the benefits of increased cross-regional collaboration, common planning, and resource sharing.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="lstitem0010">
   <label>2.</label>
   <p id="p0071">The capillarity and production capacity of bio-chemical and pharmaceutical industries able to prepare the reagent needed to carry out rRT-PCR tests, especially in light of the increasing trend to off-shore such manufacturing capabilities to developing countries (see, e.g., 
    <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, 
    <xref rid="bib0042" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>).
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="lstitem0011">
   <label>3.</label>
   <p id="p0072">Reagent-independent laboratory capacity, i.e., the test capacity deriving by the number of available machines and personnel. This corresponds to the full laboratory capacity in the ideal case in which any amount of reagent were immediately available.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="lstitem0012">
   <label>4.</label>
   <p id="p0073">The logistic capabilities of the country, i.e., how labs can procure reagent from manufacturing facilities and transfer swabs away from saturated labs.</p>
