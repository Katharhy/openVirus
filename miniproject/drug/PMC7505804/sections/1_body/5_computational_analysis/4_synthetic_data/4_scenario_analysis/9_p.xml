 <xref rid="tbl0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows how the quantity of swabs tested changes depending on the quantity of swabs moved. Indicator “% swabs moved” is the percentage of swabs sent from one lab to another, over the total number of swabs collected. The table shows the correlation between swabs sharing and the effectiveness of the test campaign, independently from how swab sharing was achieved. In our simulations swab sharing depends on instance generation parameters, but in real life it can depend on actions taken by the planner.
