 <bold>Lab capacity and inter-regional capacity sharing.</bold> Other two factors which impact the amount of swabs tested are lab capacity and the degree to which regions can share this capacity by transferring swabs between each other. Parameter 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>LC</sub> clearly influences testing capabilities: for 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>LC</sub> &lt; 1 largely less than half of the swabs are tested within the end of the time horizon. When 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>LC</sub> ≥ 1, i.e., when the total lab capacity is at least as large as the average demand, gains are marginal, as exhibited by the curve flattening in 
 <xref rid="fig0009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>. It is at this point that we would expect capacity sharing via increased inter-regional collaboration to have the greatest effect. The extent at which capacity is shared depends on parameter 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>LL</sub>. It might appear, looking at 
 <xref rid="fig0009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>, that the impact of 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>LL</sub> is small. However, if we divide the analysis of its impact between instances with 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>LC</sub> &lt; 1 and instances with 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>LC</sub> ≥ 1, the situation is different, as reported in 
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> . Note how the curve referring to instances with 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>LC</sub> ≥ 1 is much steeper, corresponding to a larger percentage increase in swabs tested. We can conclude that countries with insufficient lab infrastructures should primarily focus on procuring test machinery and training personnel to carry out rRT-PCR tests. Countries which already have a developed test lab network, on the other hand, benefit more from inter-regional collaboration and centralised planning than they do from increasing lab capacity.
