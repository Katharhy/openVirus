 <xref rid="sec0008" ref-type="sec">Section 5.2</xref>. Transshipments’ effect is larger if we focus on instances with bumpy reagent production. In this case they increase the number of swabs tested by

 </inline-formula>. This result suggests that transshipments can smooth irregular production patterns: a country which cannot procure reagent steadily should increase internal collaboration by moving both swabs and reagent. The percentage of swabs tested decreases when there are fewer, larger regions (parameter 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>L × R</sub>). This is because, with fewer regions, the impact of one region being critical, i.e., with larger demands 
 <italic>m

 </italic>, is proportionally larger. The effect of region size is rather modest, as indicated by a small regression coefficient associated with 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>L × R</sub>. Regarding the planning horizon length |
 <italic>T</italic>|, its impact is unclear. On one hand, a longer time horizon allows more opportunities for optimisation. On the other hand, there is a reduction in tested swabs when moving from

In practice, a planner would want to balance the advantages usually conferred by longer-term planning with the quality of the demand predictions that he can obtain from epidemiological models. Finally, while the signs of the regression coefficients in the two regression analyses tend to coincide (meaning that parameters which have a positive impact on the number of swabs tested also have a positive impact on shortening wait times), the signs disagree for parameters

 <sub>L × R</sub> and |
