<p id="p0083">We report the results of our scenario analysis, highlighting how the parameters affect the testing capacity and commenting on which real-life decisions a planner can take to increase the number of swabs tested. A better testing capacity depends on both structural factors (such as a strong reagent industrial base) which require long-term decisions, and organisational factors (such as more inter-regional collaboration) which are influenced by operational decisions.</p>
