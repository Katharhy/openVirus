 <sub>PP</sub> is the one with the largest impact in our analysis: a steady availability of reagent allows the laboratories to operate without interruptions, testing more swabs and with shorter delays. The average percentage of swabs tested when

 </inline-formula>. Recall that a factory in our model can represent a real production site, but also a warehouse or a shipment from abroad. A physical factory will be able to maintain a steadier production rate, while relying on shipments will resemble more the “bumpy” scenario. The analysis, thus, hints to the fact that a solid industrial sector and a well-function supply chain can have the greatest impact on testing capacity; not necessarily because they allow to procure more reagent in total, but because they provide a steadier flow of it. A country that cannot count on such production capacity can mitigate the adverse effects of irregular supply with larger orders (see the positive impact of parameter 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>FP</sub>), more inventory capacity and a quick dispatch of reagent to labs.
