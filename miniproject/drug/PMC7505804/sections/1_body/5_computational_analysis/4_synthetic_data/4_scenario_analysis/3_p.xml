 <xref rid="fig0009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> shows the percentage of swabs tested within the end of the time horizon, over all the swabs collected and available for testing. In other words, if the planner manages to allocate swabs to laboratories in such a way that all swabs are tested within the considered time horizon, then this percentage would be 100%. Each chart corresponds to one parameter; we use line charts for the seven numeric parameters, and box plots for 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>PP</sub> and 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>TS</sub>, which are categorical. In each chart, the 
 <italic>x</italic> axis reports the value taken by the parameter. The 
 <italic>y</italic> axis reports the percentage of swabs tested when solving instances generated with the corresponding parameter. For the line charts, the solid line denotes the average percentage of swabs tested over all instances generated with the given parameter value, while the shaded area is the 95% confidence interval obtained via bootstrapping (using 1000 iterations). For the box plots, each box denotes the two central quartiles, the horizontal line is the median, and whiskers extend to the rest of the distribution.
