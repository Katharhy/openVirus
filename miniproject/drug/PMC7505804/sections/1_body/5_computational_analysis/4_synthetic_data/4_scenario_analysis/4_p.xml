<p id="p0085">Two linear regression analyses provide additional findings. They use the instance parameters as independent variables. We centre and standardise numeric parameters, and transform

 <sub>PP</sub> and 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>TS</sub> into numeric parameters, respectively, with value 0 if the production was steady and 1 if bumpy, and 0 when transshipments are not allowed and 1 when they are. The percentage of swabs tested and the average time a swab spent in a lab waiting to be tested are, respectively, the dependent variables in the two analyses. 
 <xref rid="tbl0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> reports the results, while in the following we comment on the insights obtained.
