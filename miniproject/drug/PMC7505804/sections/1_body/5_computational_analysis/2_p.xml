<p id="p0061">We want to assess the impact of optimising the allocation of reagent and swabs to laboratories on the testing capacity of a country. We present two case studies. In the first, we perform an analysis on a realistic dataset relative to the Italian response to the COVID-19 pandemic, during the period from April 1st to April 13th, 2020. In the second, we use synthetic data to do a sensitivity analysis highlighting the decisions a planner can take to most increase testing capacity and lower waiting times. The datasets and the code used are available at 
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. We use the Hierarchical Model, which we solve using commercial solver Gurobi 
 <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> with a time limit of 15 minutes for the primary and 5 minutes for the secondary objective, on a laptop equipped with a 4-core Intel i7 processor running at 1.6GHz. This time limit proved enough to solve to optimality the majority of instances, while those that remain open all show gaps smaller than 5% and, often, smaller than 1%.
