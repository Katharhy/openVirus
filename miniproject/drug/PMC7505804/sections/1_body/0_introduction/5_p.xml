<p id="p0008">Viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 are RNA viruses, i.e., they contain a single strand of nucleotides rather than the “double helix” typical of DNA. For this brief introduction, we call the four nucleotides composing the RNA chain with their initials: A, C, G, U. The quickest available test for RNA viruses uses 
 <italic>real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction</italic> (rRT-PCR). A popular test consists in collecting a sample of nasal secretions on a swab 
 <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, looking for an RNA subsequence which is unique to the virus. To identify this subsequence, the tester uses inverse RNA: a sequence of nucleotides which pairs those they are looking for (remember that A pairs with U and C with G). If the sample contains viral RNA, it will pair with the chain injected by the tester. Once the nucleotides are paired, they effectively transform the single-strand RNA into double-strand DNA. To detect a significant presence of the viral DNA, the genetic material goes through an amplification process, the polymerase chain reaction

 <italic>reagents</italic>. While this simplified description is enough to introduce our problem, we refer the reader to the reviews of
