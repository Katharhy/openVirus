   <p id="p0011">We introduce the problem of maximising a country’s test capacity for rRT-PCR tests, during the outbreak of an epidemic. In such a situation, (i) reagent scarcity is often a bottleneck for testing, and (ii) some regions are foci of the disease, requiring more tests than others. These two conditions provide an opportunity to optimise the allocation of reagent and swabs, with the aim of maximising the number of swabs tested and reducing the wait time for results.</p>

   <p id="p0012">We provide an Integer Programming formulation for this problem, extend it to consider the real-world case in which the health-care system is decentralised at the regional level, and consider a hierarchical multi-objective version of the problem. Because commercial software such as Gurobi solves the formulation in a few minutes, this model is suitable for direct use by public health decision makers and to run what-if analyses.</p>

   <p id="p0013">We conduct two case studies to validate our approach. In the first one, we use real-life data referring to the Italian situation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis confirms that fostering inter-regional collaboration can increase by up to

    </inline-formula> the number of swabs tested during a 13-day planning horizon. In the second one, we use synthetic data to determine the most important factors which impact testing capacity. We conclude that a strong industrial network able to provide a steady supply of reagent provides the greatest advantage, vs. procuring reagent via sporadic shipments, even when the total purchased quantity stays the same. Further, countries with limited lab infrastructure should prioritise acquiring more machines and training more personnel, while increasing inter-regional coordination helps those countries with a developed laboratory network.
