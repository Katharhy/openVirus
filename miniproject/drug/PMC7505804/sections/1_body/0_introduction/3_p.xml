<p id="p0006">Viruses cause a host of human diseases, ranging from the common cold to AIDS. Of particular interest for this work is the recent 
 <italic>Coronavirus disease 2019</italic> (COVID-19) pandemic. Under particular circumstances, a virus (and the disease it causes) can spread to a large part of a population in a short time, leading to an 
 <italic>epidemic</italic>. When the epidemic spreads across national borders and infects people worldwide, it is termed a 
 <italic>pandemic</italic>. SARS-CoV-2, the virus spreading COVID-19, for example, possessed the right characteristics to turn its associated disease into a pandemic: people carrying the virus do not show symptoms for an average of five days, during which they can spread the virus to others 
 <xref rid="bib0044" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>; its basic reproduction number has been estimated between 1.4 and 5.7, i.e., each infected person in turns infects an average of up to 5.7 people 
 <xref rid="bib0033" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>; up to 44% of patients show no symptoms at all during the infection period, making their diagnosis difficult
