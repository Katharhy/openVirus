<p id="p0005">Viruses are pathogens that replicate after penetrating the living cells of other organisms. Outside cells, a virus is nothing more than genetic material (DNA or RNA) surrounded by protective layers of proteins and lipids. Once inside a host cell, the virus uses the cellâ€™s structures to replicate its genetic material and assembly its protective layers, thus creating a copy of itself. At the end, it kills the cell to release both the original and the copy.</p>
