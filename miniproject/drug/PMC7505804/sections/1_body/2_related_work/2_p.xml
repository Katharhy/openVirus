<p id="p0023">Our problem, described in 
 <xref rid="sec0002" ref-type="sec">Section 2</xref>, resembles superficially problems in the area of production planning, material requirement planning and supply chain optimisation (for a complete overview on these topics see, e.g., Pochet and Wolsey 
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>). In our case, carrying out tests corresponds to manufacturing a product using two raw materials (swabs and reagent); for us, though, the finished product demand (tested swabs) always matches one of the raw materials’ availability (swabs), while the other (reagent) acts as a bottleneck for production. As in production planning, we deal with the flow of goods over time, including shipments of raw material and inventory carry-over. We also allow the creation of backlogs, i.e., the storage of swabs which cannot be tested on the day of collection. Other characteristics of our problem, however, are not frequently considered in production planning optimisation: the geographic position of suppliers and production facilities (in our case, laboratories) and their regional subdivision; the possibility of reassigning orders between facilities, subject to logistics constraints; the uneven demand between regions.
