<p id="p0026">In the wake of the COVID-19 epidemics, the optimisation community has rushed to provide decision support tools for decision-makers involved in the fight against the virus. Similar to our work, researchers at MIT’s Operations Research Center 
 <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> have shown the advantages of inter-regional collaboration in sharing automatic ventilators across U.S. states. Mehrotra et al. 
 <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> consider the same problem and use a stochastic model to show how sharing ventilators across states, even when each state is averse to the risk of not having enough machines for its own patients, can reduce the probability of shortages. The problem of allocating ventilator during influenza epidemics was already considered in the literature, e.g., by Huang et al.
