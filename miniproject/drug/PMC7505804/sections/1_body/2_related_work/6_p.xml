The authors consider the problem of deciding how many swabs each region should collect to provide an accurate estimate of the prevalence of the disease among its population, while restricted by a nation-wide capacity limit on the number of tests performed. The problem is motivated by the practice employed in Italy during the early period of the epidemic, of double-checking at one single central laboratory (located in Rome) the results of each positive test conducted by local labs. The capacity of the central lab limits, in this case, the number of total expected positive results coming from all other labs in the country. Note how a decision maker working under the assumptions of
