<p id="p0024">Most importantly, unlike problems in production planning, we disregard costs and focus exclusively on maximising production (in our case, number of tests). To this end, we do not consider transport, production, storage, raw material, order placement, personnel, nor opportunity costs, which instead have a prominent role when optimising commercial supply chains and production processes. In the standard case, in fact, the aim of the planner is pure cost minimisation 
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and satisfying the demand in full could even be sub-optimal, if the cost of producing one more unit is larger than the opportunity cost of missing a sale. Other approaches commonly used in production planning include multi-objective optimisation in which cost minimisation is tackled together with secondary objectives, such as demand satisfaction 
 <xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, steadiness of production rates 
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> or environmental performance 
 <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Even in the healthcare sector, if considering times when authorities are not responding to an emergency, costs are taken into account. For example, Zhao et al. 
 <xref rid="bib0048" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> consider a drugs production planning problem in which they minimise both costs (avoiding over-production of drugs) and the duration of the trial. Other works (e.g., 
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>) have considered the production and supply optimisation problems in the clinical area, but have focused on production and distribution of drugs in “normal” times, rather than during an emergency response to a sudden epidemic event.
