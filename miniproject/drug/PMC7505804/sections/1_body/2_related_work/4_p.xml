<p id="p0025">Literature focusing specifically on allocation of medical resources during emergencies mainly concentrates on the distribution of (life-saving) medical devices. As such, most models optimise the assignment of existing material to hospitals or individual patients, rather than the production and allocation of new material. Xiang and Zhuang 
 <xref rid="bib0046" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, for example, consider the problem of assigning medical resources to patients, taking into account that the conditions of patients left untreated will deteriorate over time. Cao and Huang 
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> use a simulation approach in which they consider different strategies to allocate scarce medical resources (e.g., milder patients first, critical patients first, randomly) and complement an analysis of the utility of each strategy with ethical considerations on prioritising some patients over others.
