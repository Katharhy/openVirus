<p id="p0115">At present, over 40 antiviral agents are accessible for the treatment of viral infections. Unfortunately, the most commonly used antiviral drugs are accompanied by severe obstacles including insufficient selectivity, resistance, promotion of latency, toxicity, or experimental difficulties (

Drug repurposing approaches related to infectious diseases incorporate a variety of applications by harmonizing key bioinformatics and cheminformatics methods to discover a drug target that could be repurposed in the combat against a viral pathogen (

In addition to indisputable cost-effective benefits in the practice of drug discovery, recycled drugs gain access into clinical trials instantly or are taken up with compassionate use programs, particularly in the context of untreatable viral diseases or pandemics. Furthermore, drug repurposing provides an alternative source of data for a novel understanding of metabolic reprogramming in viral infections, as well as the organic compounds with previously unrecognized antiviral behaviors that are possible to expand in unveiling properties of virus biology (
