<p id="p0130">Computational drug repurposing approaches can be broadly categorized as (1) signature based, (2) molecular docking, (3) network based, and (4) genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Signature-based drug repositioning is comparison of the pattern of gene expression profiles of a drug against that of another drug (i.e., drug-drug comparison), disease (i.e., drug-disease comparison), or clinical phenotype by using high-throughput omics data (transcriptomic, proteomic, or metabolomic), molecular structures, or adverse effect profiles (

Second, molecular docking is a key method in structure-based computational drug repurposing approaches based on predicting the ligand and the target complementation based on position and relative orientation of one molecule in the binding site of another molecule to generate a stable complex. Existing information of a receptor target associated with a disease enables researchers to inspect various potential drugs for a range of conditions. Reversely, libraries of compounds could be screened against receptor targets to investigate unknown interactions to discover candidates for drug repurposing process (

Another key approach for computational drug design is network-based drug repurposing, which is based on the construction of the biological networks by using different data types such as gene expression patterns, protein interactions, or disease pathology (

Finally, GWAS seek to determine the differences in genetic material related with common diseases and accordingly contribute a better understanding to the physiology of the diseases. The collected knowledge may also assist to define novel targets, a number of which could be allocated among diseases treated by medicine, and observable characteristics of the disease revealed by GWAS and therefore give rise to repurposing of drugs (
