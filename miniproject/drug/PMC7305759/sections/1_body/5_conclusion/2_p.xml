<p id="p0160">COVID-19, similar to all other pandemics throughout history, does not discriminate in terms of geopolitical borders, nationality, religion, creed, or color. A reliable forecasting of impact size and time of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, whether by epidemiological models or artificial intelligence-inspired methods, would be helpful in efficient management of SARS-CoV-2 repercussions. Accordingly, an international effort and unanimity are crucial to diminish the destructive effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care systems, casting a shadow of doubt on the futures of many nations. In spite of swift progress in virological and epidemiological knowledge of SARS-CoV-2, therapeutic challenges escalated rapidly as well. Daily changes in the number of studies and complementary results of ongoing clinical trials, including successes and failures, indicate the promising outcome in close future.</p>
