 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Xue et al., 2008</xref>) and papain-like protease (PLpro) (
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kilianski et al., 2013</xref>), as candidate drug targets. An appealing biological target for coronaviruses is the main protease by virtue of its crucial role in viral gene expression and replication. Taking this into account, Zhang et al. published the crystal structures of the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 and docked it with a pyridone-containing α-ketoamide inhibitor. The assessment of pharmacokinetic results on mice revealed a noticeable lung tropism, which promises this lead compound as a suitable candidate for further drug development process (
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020b</xref>). In addition, inhibiting the function of this enzyme blocks the viral life cycle. The absence of homologs in humans means that Mpro is an attractive non-toxic target for antiviral drug design that is not prone to off-target effects. Furthermore, virtual screening of main protease offers emergence of a powerful strategy for the rapid identification of candidate compounds from existing drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2, gaining the attention of other research teams. For instance, Jin et al. developed a data-driven drug repositioning framework, which applies both structure-based drug design and high-throughput screening approaches to inform putative drug candidates against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2.
