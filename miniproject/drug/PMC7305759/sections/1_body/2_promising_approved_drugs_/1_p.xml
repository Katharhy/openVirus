No specific therapy for COVID-19 is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) so far, but many previously approved drugs, as an efficient approach to drug discovery named drug repurposing, are being tested on COVID-19.

In particular, the ongoing clinical trials sponsored by the WHO named Solidarity will compare different treatment options, namely, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir dual treatment, lopinavir/ritonavir dual treatment with interferon beta 1-alpha, and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (paused temporarily due to the concerns raised about the safety of the drug) against standard of care. As of May 10, 2020, more than 100 countries have been confirmed to contribute in this investigation.
