  <p>Deadliest Pandemics and Outbreaks in Recorded History</p>
  <p>Left: Pandemic clock, a comprehensive illustration of the most deadly pandemics through the history sorted by date. Right: Pandemic outbreaks and natural reservoir hosts sorted by the number of mortalities. In some outbreaks, the exact duration is not precisely determined (ND) because the outbreak died out and recurred multiple times in the same region and era.</p>
