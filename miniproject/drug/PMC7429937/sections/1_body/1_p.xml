<p id="Par2">Patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 are characterised by poor oxygenation with a various extent of pulmonary alterations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Ventilation strategies for COVID-19 patients have been suggested basing on the pathophysiological evidence to date [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]; however, there are no data regarding the use of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO). We report herein our experience of iNO administration in COVID-19 mechanically ventilated patients with refractory hypoxaemia and/or right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. Refractory hypoxaemia was defined as PaO
