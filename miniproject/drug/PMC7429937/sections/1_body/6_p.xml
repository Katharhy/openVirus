<p id="Par7">iNO is a free radical gas that diffuses across the alveolar-capillary membrane into the subjacent smooth muscle of pulmonary vessels enhancing endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and improving oxygenation by increasing blood flow to ventilated lung units [

 <sub>2</sub> and oxygenation index, although it failed in reversing acute lung injury, reducing mechanical ventilation days and mortality [
