<p>There are few studies on the incidence of COVID-19 in pregnant women. In a study by Chen et al. [

Although none of the women have previously had concomitant diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, or hypertension, single cases of infection have resulted in pregnancy hypertension and pre-eclampsia. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 were similar to those in other adults: fever (7/9), cough (4/9), muscle pain (3/9), sore throat (2/9), malaise (2/9), gastrointestinal symptoms (1/9), and dyspnea (1/9). Laboratory tests showed elevated CRP (6/9), lymphopenia (5/9), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (3/9). CT scans of the thorax were abnormal in 8 of 9 women. In all women, the pregnancy was terminated by cesarean section, 4 women gave birth prematurely, but none before 36 weeks of pregnancy [
