<p>In the vast majority of cases, the immune system of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus can cope with the infection, and patients recover without the need for experimental antiviral treatment. In the context of being at risk of further CoV infections with high mortality rates, pregnant women seem to be in a special situation. Pregnancy is a period of far-reaching physiological adaptation of a womanâ€™s body to ensure proper development of the fetus. The immune system is particularly subject to changes, as on one hand it must be ready to combat infections and, on the other hand, it must tolerate antigenically foreign fertilized egg cells. According to current knowledge, this is caused by immune mechanisms associated with functional regulation of the elements of specific and non-specific maternal immunity and by immunoregulation of placenta and fetal origin. The most important immunological mechanisms ensuring the correct development of pregnancy include weak trophoblast antigenicity, the immunoregulatory role of cytokines (e.g., predominance of Th2 over Th1 immune response), the immunoregulatory effect of progesterone, the immunoregulatory role of blocking antibodies, and immunoregulation at the temporal level [
