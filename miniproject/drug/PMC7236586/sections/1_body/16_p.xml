 <xref rid="b15-medscimonit-26-e924725" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] described 7 women aged 29–34 years, with gestational age from 37 to 41 weeks. Clinical symptoms included fever (86%), as well as cough, dyspnea, and diarrhea (14%). All patients had normal leukocyte count and elevated C-reactive protein level. Bilateral pneumonia was present in 86% and 14% had unilateral pneumonia. In 71%, neutrophil counts were higher than normal, and lymphocyte counts were lower than normal. In total, 29% had various degrees of liver function abnormalities, low platelet count, and D-dimer level above normal. Antiviral treatment including oseltamivir (75 mg every 12 hours, orally), ganciclovir (0.25 g every 12 hours, intravenously) and interferon (40 μg daily, spray inhalation), and arbidol tablets (200 mg 3 times per day, orally) was administered. All patients received treatment with antibiotics (cephalosporin, quinolones and macrolides). Methylprednisolone was also used after cesarean section in 71%. All women had a cesarean section within 3 days of COVID-19 clinical symptom onset. The birth weights of newborns and the Apgar scores were normal. Three newborns were tested for SARS-CoV-2, with 1 being infected – it had minor symptoms of dyspnea, and an X-ray of the thorax showed mild pneumonia. The authors emphasized that although they administered antiviral treatment, no data concerning their safety and efficacy in COVID-19 treatment in general and in pregnant women have been published so far [
