<p>Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="b13-medscimonit-26-e924725" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] described a 28-year-old pregnant woman (30
 <sup>th</sup> week) who reported to the hospital with a week-long fever. A throat swab test for SARS-CoV-2 was negative. After 2 days, a CT scan of the thorax showed pneumonia. Repeated testing for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, where she was placed in isolation. On the third day of hospitalization, the fetus’ movements decreased; therefore, a cesarean section was performed. The newborn (1.83 kg) received 9 and 10 points on the Apgar scale after 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Samples were taken from the placenta, amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood, swab cultures from the infant’s gastric juice, and throat – all results for SARS-CoV-2 were negative. Seven and 9 days after delivery, the smears from the throat of the mother and infant were negative [
