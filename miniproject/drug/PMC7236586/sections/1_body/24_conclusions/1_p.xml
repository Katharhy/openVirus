<p>During any epidemic of infectious diseases, pregnant women constitute an extremely sensitive group due to altered physiology and immune functions, and thus altered susceptibility to infection. In an epidemic situation, special care should be taken in pregnancy management and in making decisions on termination of pregnancy and handling of the newborn baby in order to minimize the risk of subsequent health consequences. Further analysis is needed of the incidence of COVID-19 among pregnant women and its consequences. This will allow us to develop recommendations on management of patients in case of repeated epidemic emergencies.</p>
