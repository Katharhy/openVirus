<p>Changes in the immunology of a pregnant woman’s body are discussed in relation to further emerging infection risks. The reaction of a pregnant woman’s body to an infectious agent may be slightly different. During the SARS and MERS epidemics, heavier courses of infections and higher mortality rates were observed among pregnant women than among non-pregnant ones [

Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there will be a more severe course of this infection among pregnant women compared to non-pregnant ones. On the contrary, Dashraath et al. assumed that changes in the hormonal environment during pregnancy that affect the immune response to viral pathogens, together with the physiological predominance of Th2, may promote the expression of the anti-inflammatory effect of cytokines (e.g., IL-4 and IL-10), and, together with other unidentified mechanisms of immune adaptation, may affect the immune response associated with SARS-CoV-2. This may result in lower intensity of COVID-19 symptoms in pregnant women compared to non-pregnant women [
