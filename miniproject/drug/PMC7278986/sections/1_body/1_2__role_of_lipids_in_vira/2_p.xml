<p>Coronaviruses firstly seize host cell intracellular membranes to create new compartments known as double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) needed for viral genome amplification. A specific phospholipid composition is required by different viruses to form the perfect replicative organelles that are suitable for their replication [

Similarly, increased expression of age-dependent phospholipase A2 group IID (PLA2G2D), an enzyme that usually contributes to anti-inflammatory/pro-resolving lipid mediator expression, resulted in worsened outcomes in aged mice infected with SARS-CoV, suggesting that inhibition of such factor could represent a potential therapeutic option [
