<p>Earlier reports have shown that most RNA viruses such as rhinoviruses show an enhancement of glucose uptake and dependence on both extracellular glucose and glutamine for optimal viral replication [

This glucose uptake enhancement and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-regulated glucose transporter (GLUT1) upregulation were found to be PI3K driven and reversible by PI3K inhibitor. Moreover, metabolomic studies revealed increased levels of metabolites associated with glycogenolysis, a process that has not been described so far in the context of viral infections. Lipogenesis and nucleotide synthesis were found to be elevated as well. Lack of both glutamine and glucose impaired high-titer rhinoviruses replication in cells, and the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) effectively repressed viral replication and reversed the rhinoviruses-induced alterations of the host cell metabolome. These findings underscore the potential of metabolic pathways as a target for host-directed antiviral therapy [
