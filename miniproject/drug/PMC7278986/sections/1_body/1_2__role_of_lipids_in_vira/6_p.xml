<p>In another study, Nguyen et al. explored changes in the lipidome of primary human epithelial cells infected with rhinoviruses [

Post-infection untargeted lipidomics analysis of infected cells showed time-dependent changes in multiple lipid pathways and in the length of fatty acid saturation and class. These pathways implicate multiple lipid modifying enzymes, which were increased upon infection including lysocardiolipin acyltransferase (LCLAT), phosphoinositide phosphatase (PIP), and D.G. kinase amongst others that present good antiviral targets [

Other studies have also looked at changes in the lipidome profile after infection with viruses such as Enterovirus A71 and coxsackievirus and found that 47 lipid species/classes such as arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid were consistently upregulated after infection [
