<p>As previously shown, the impact of viral infection on various lipid species has been dramatic. Wu et al. showed that the effect of treatment on SARS patients was long-lived and could significantly impact their serum metabolites. In their study, Wu et al., recruited 25 SARS survivors 12 years after their infection and compared them to healthy controls [

They demonstrated that SARS survivors were more susceptible to lung infections, tumors, cardiovascular disorders, and abnormal glucose metabolism compared to controls. More importantly, to this review, SARS survivors had a higher level of phosphatidylinositol and lysophosphatidylinositol compared to uninfected controls. This increase in metabolites was believed to be caused by the high dose of steroid treatment using methylprednisolone [
