<p>One important pathway in the viral replication is lipid metabolism that is hijacked by viruses and upregulated to meet the increased demand for viral structural elements such as the viral cell membrane [

Statins reduce cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting the activity of HMG-CoA reductase. Multiple studies have eluted to the role of statins in treating different infections [
 <xref rid="B55-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Tleyjeh et al. have performed a meta-analysis to investigate the role of statins in infections. They examined nine cohorts that looked at the role of statins in treating infections like bacteremia, pneumonia, and sepsis [
 <xref rid="B56-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In conclusion, they showed that the adjusted effect estimate was 0.55 (95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.83; I (2) = 76.5%) in favor of statins [
 <xref rid="B56-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The authors concluded that statins were effective in reducing the infection; however, due to the heterogeneity in the analyzed data, they highlighted the need for randomized clinical trials [
 <xref rid="B56-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In another study, Douglas et. al., have shown that statins can protect against all caused mortality within six months of diagnosis with pneumonia with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.67 (0.49 to 0.91) in favor of statins therapy [
 <xref rid="B57-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In a randomized clinical trial, Makris et al. studied the impact of using pravastatin on reducing the frequency of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Moreover, they studied if the treatment had favorable outcomes in patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (ICU severity scoring classification) increasing the probability of the survival of the treated group when compared to the untreated group [
 <xref rid="B58-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. However, another randomized clinical trial showed no benefit for statin therapy [
 <xref rid="B59-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Moreover, other studies looked at the effect of a combination therapy using atorvastatin (40 mg/day) and irbesartan (150 mg/day).
