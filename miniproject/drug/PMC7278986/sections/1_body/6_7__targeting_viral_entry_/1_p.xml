<p>Inhibitors of virus cell entry and endocytosis as well as inhibitors of certain cellular pathways involved in the viral cycle constitute an important reservoir of antiviral drugs, such as methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), which works by depleting cholesterol [
 <xref rid="B83-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. In vitro cell models expressing ACE2 showed that cholesterol depletion by MβCD dramatically decreased the number of bonds with the S protein and reduced ACE2 expression in a dose-dependent manner leading to reduced SARS-CoV replication [

Similarly, phytosterols, which are lipophilic molecules that can interact with the lipid raft and reduce membrane cholesterol and destabilize the membrane structure, impact viral infectivity significantly. Other direct inhibitors of the endocytosis process, such as chlorpromazine, chloroquine, and umifenovir (Arbidol), have also shown promising results [
