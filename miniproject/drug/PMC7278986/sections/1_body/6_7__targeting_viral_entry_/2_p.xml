<p>Another example of a broad-spectrum antiviral drug is LJ001, which is a membrane-binding compound [

 <xref rid="B88-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. LJ001 possesss a very promising antiviral mechanism that can selectively impact viral membranes but not host cellular membranes at very low antiviral doses (IC50 ≤ 0.5 µM) [

 <xref rid="B89-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. This compound is astoundingly capable of inhibiting a wide range of enveloped viruses including HIV, influenza, and Ebola, amongst many others [
 <xref rid="B89-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Vigant et al. showed that LJ001 targets unsaturated phospholipids in a manner that was dependent on light and molecular oxygen [
 <xref rid="B89-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. It was postulated that LJ0001 leads to increased unsaturated fatty acid hydroxylation that primes the formation of a hydroxyl group in the middle of the hydrophobic lipid bilayer, thus impacting the viral membrane properties [
 <xref rid="B89-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. This drug is viral membrane-specific due to the intrinsic mechanisms in host cellular membranes that are protective against phospholipid hydroperoxides. While the effects of LJ0001 are limited to in vitro activity, since it is a light activated compound, newer compounds such as oxazolidine-2,4-dithiones with membrane-intercalating photosensitizers were designed. These examples clearly highlight the importance of the viral membrane as antiviral targets [
