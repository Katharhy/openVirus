<p>Lipids play a central role in viral infection, as they represent the structural foundations of cellular and viral membranes [
 <xref rid="B17-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Viruses attack lipid synthesis and signaling to modify host cells to produce lipids for their envelopes [
 <xref rid="B18-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Lipid involvement in membrane fusion, envelopment, and transformation are important for viral replication, and molecules that impact lipids such as cholesterol and sphingolipids could be targeted to selectively impede viral replication [
 <xref rid="B17-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Viruses replicate within the host cell; hence, they must cross the host cellular membrane for entry and exit [
 <xref rid="B17-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Lipids have several roles in viral invasion, as they can act as direct and indirect viral receptors, fusion cofactors, and entry cofactors [
