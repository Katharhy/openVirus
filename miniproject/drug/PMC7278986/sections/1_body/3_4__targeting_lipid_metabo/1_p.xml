<p>The continuous emergence of new strains of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 constitutes a major challenge as global efforts are in a race with time to identify treatments and develop new vaccines. These are generally slow processes that require extensive research and development and ultimately delay the responses to such emerging epidemics. On the other hand, the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs could constitute an important first response to such epidemics and enhance the impact of such responses. Pathways that are fundamental to viral attachment and fusion as well as pathways involved in the viral replication and assembly are the foundations for drug discovery. Please see
