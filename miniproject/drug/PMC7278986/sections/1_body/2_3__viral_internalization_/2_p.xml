<p>SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus in the subgenus Sarbecovirus, which includes SARS-CoV but not MERS-CoV, which belongs to Merbecovirus subgenus [
 <xref rid="B49-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The genome structure of SARS-CoV-2 has a gene order of 5′-replicase ORF1ab-S-envelope(E)-membrane(M)-N-3′, which is shared by other Betacoronaviruses [
 <xref rid="B50-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The Spike (S) protein is made of two functional subunits (S1 and S2) both of which are necessary for virus entry into host cells. While S1 contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) required for viral attachment to host cell receptors, S2 facilitates the fusion of the cell and viral membranes. The RBD of the S protein from SARS-CoV-2 is well-suited for binding to the human ACE2 receptor, which is also used by the SARS-CoV albeit more efficiently in the former virus [

 <xref rid="B52-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, unlike other Betacoronaviruses, contains a characteristic insertion of polybasic cleavage site (residues PRRA) for furin (alias PCSK3) at the junction of S1 and S2 subunits. Furin is a proprotein convertase, which is a serine proteinase. Proprotein convertases are involved in posttranslational processing of the precursors of a vast number of cellular proteins [
 <xref rid="B53-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. It was recently reported that SARS-CoV-2 uses the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming and it is speculated that furin-mediated precleavage at the S1/S2 site in infected cells might promote subsequent TMPRSS2-dependent entry into target cells, as reported for MERS-CoV [
