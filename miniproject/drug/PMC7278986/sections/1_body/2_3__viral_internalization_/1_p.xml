<p>Endocytosis is the process of internalization of various materials into the cell. It is used to internalize fluids, cellular components as well as various solutes. This happens through the invagination of the plasma membrane and the internalization of various components into cells through membrane vesicles. Viral entry is dependent on the attachment and fusion of viral membrane with plasma membrane through an endocytosis-mediated process [

Lipid rafts are sphingolipid-, cholesterol-, and protein-rich microdomains of the cell membrane. Lipid rafts have been found to be important to multiple viruses including SARS-CoV, especially during the early replication stage, although there was no increased angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) localization in such rafts [

This could be compensated by the presence of caveolins, clathrins, and dynamin that are important for the endocytosis process and viral entry. This process facilitates the fusion as well as the release of the viral genome into the host cell, where many enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses, take advantage of the low pH inside the endosomes to facilitate the fusion and viral genome release [
