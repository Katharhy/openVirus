    "BACKGROUND:Albeit primarily a disease of respiratory tract, the 2019 coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) has been found to have causal association with a plethora of neurological, neuropsychiatric and psychological effects. This review aims to analyze them with a discussion of evolving therapeutic recommendations. METHODS:PubMed and Google Scholar were searched from 1 January 2020 to 30 May 2020 with the following key terms: \"COVID-19\", \"SARS-CoV-2\", \"pandemic\", \"neuro-COVID\", \"stroke-COVID\", \"epilepsy-COVID\", \"COVID-encephalopathy\", \"SARS-CoV-2-encephalitis\", \"SARS-CoV-2-rhabdomyolysis\", \"COVID-demyelinating disease\", \"neurological manifestations\", \"psychosocial manifestations\", \"treatment recommendations\", \"COVID-19 and therapeutic changes\", \"psychiatry\", \"marginalised\", \"telemedicine\", \"mental health\", \"quarantine\", \"infodemic\" and \"social media\". A few newspaper reports related to COVID-19 and psychosocial impacts have also been added as per context. RESULTS:Neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 are abundant. Clinical features of both central and peripheral nervous system involvement are evident. These have been categorically analyzed briefly with literature support. Most of the psychological effects are secondary to pandemic-associated regulatory, socioeconomic and psychosocial changes. CONCLUSION:Neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations of this disease are only beginning to unravel. This demands a wide index of suspicion for prompt diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 to prevent further complications and mortality."
