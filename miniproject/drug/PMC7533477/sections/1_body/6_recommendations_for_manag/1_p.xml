<p>First, apart from the regular screening methods used by paramedics before transferring the patient to appropriate centres, COVID-19 pandemic mandates the use of additional screening protocol, including that of an infection control screen and a travel history screen for all patients, based on the recommendations of WHO or CDC.

 </sup> They must complete screening the patient for infection, assessing for features such as fever, cough, chest pain, headache, myalgia, shortness of breath and gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting or diarrhea.

 </sup> Travel history includes any recent (≤14 d) travel abroad or contact with someone who has travelled abroad, bearing in mind that as the pandemic unfolds worldwide, travel history becomes less and less important. The protected stroke code should be activated in any confirmed or suspect cases of COVID-19, as per WHO or CDC definitions.

 </sup> One of the challenges faced at this step is the inability to extract relevant information from the patient or relatives concerned. Approximately 10–12% of stroke patients are known to suffer from cognitive dysfunction, dysarthria, aphasia or the absence of near relatives.

 </sup> Moreover, acute stroke patients may also be in the prodromal phase of infection or being asymptomatic carriers. The paramedics should be instructed to activate institutionally and regionally recognised protected stroke code systems for such patients also and continue with such protocols until screening can be reliably completed or COVID-19 ruled out with formal testing. Efficient communication across transfer sites and adherence to local screening procedures needs to be highlighted at this point.
