<p>Seventh, being an invasive procedure, mechanical thrombectomy, on the other hand, will pose greater challenges. Rapid transfer between different places, even within the same hospital, may be difficult at present, given the stringent protocols that need to be followed. After measuring out pros and cons of thrombectomy, and if the patient meets all the usual inclusion criteria, thrombectomy may be considered as a therapeutic option, given that it can be performed with appropriate safety precautions assuming the patient to be a case of COVID-19. Consent from relatives may be obtained via digital communication media. Patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy often require mechanical ventilation during or after the procedure, and more so in the setting of COVID-19. A low threshold for using general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation is advocated during these times. A tracheobronchial aspirate may be sent for SARS-CoV-2 detection at the same time. Given that several steps in introducing endotracheal intubation are aerosol-generating procedures, it may be considered favorable to intubate the patient prior to arrival at an angiographic suite.</p>
