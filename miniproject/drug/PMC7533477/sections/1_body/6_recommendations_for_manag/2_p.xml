<p>Second, once this modified stroke code is activated, it alerts the stroke care team of the receiving institution. Members of the stroke team must make certain that basic measures to stop disease transmission are donned at the earliest. This includes wearing of personal protective equipment and maintaining a safe distance (at least 2 m) from the patient unless necessary. Given the acute shortages of personal protective equipment in most regions, the use of filtering face-piece respirator should be advocated to the ones most in need. Stroke evaluation often does not expose the healthcare professional to aerosol-generating procedures. In such instances, the use of filtering face-piece respirator may be reconsidered based on availability, regional prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and institutional practices. As a routine, full-sleeved gown, extended cuff gloves overlapping the sleeves of the gown, eye protection (either in the form of face shield or goggles) and surgical mask, in the least, should be worn by the involved healthcare professional. Aerosol-generating procedures, for example, intubation, oropharyngeal/nasal suctioning, bag-valve-mask ventilation, proving cardiopulmonary resuscitation, non-invasive ventilation or nebulisation, will require upgrading the personal protective equipment to include a filtering face-piece respirator. A surgical mask must also be placed on the patient and should always remain so during transportation. Supplemental oxygen may be provided as required via nasal prongs, placed below this mask.</p>
