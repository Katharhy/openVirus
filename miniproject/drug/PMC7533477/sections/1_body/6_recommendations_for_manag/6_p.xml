 </sup> showed that patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as those with neurologic complications, had leucocytosis, higher C-reactive protein and D-dimer levels. Previous studies have shown that the use of rt-PA in patients with ischemic stroke and higher levels of inflammatory markers has foreseen a greater risk of ICH and poorer prognosis.

 </sup> The presence of hepatic dysfunction may further add to the potential threat of ICH, as rt-PA is metabolised in the liver,
