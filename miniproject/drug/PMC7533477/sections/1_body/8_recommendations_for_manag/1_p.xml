<p>On the flip side, we have patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease or other types of dementia and movement disorders, most of whom belong to the geriatric population and are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and sadly are often seen to not understand the measures of hygiene and social distancing laid down by the authorities. Sometimes, even if they understand, they fail to remember them or are unable to implement them effectively. It thus becomes the responsibility of caregivers to continuously reinforce these rules and practices in a soothing and empathizing manner. These patients should be kept informed about the ongoing situation, keeping in mind their vulnerability. With the advent of modernization and growing urbanization, as more and more nuclear families are coming up, older generations are frequently found to be living alone or in residential accommodations, nursing homes and old age care facilities away from their near and dear ones. Currently, when the authorities are enforcing orders of lockdowns and social isolation, it is only natural for these people to feel more distant and isolated from their loved ones. Modes of tele-communication can serve a “modus operandi” in keeping in touch with their family members as well as provide self-help guidance like meditation and relaxation exercises and psychological counselling. Furthermore, nursing homes and long-term stay facilities must restrict the number of visitors and outsiders and prohibit group activities to contain the spread of infection.</p>
