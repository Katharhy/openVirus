<p>So how do we terminate this relentless turn of events? Or are we going to be dragged into this unfathomable abyss of destruction eventually? It is what we do today that will reflect in our future. The need of the hour is to identify these potential problems and prepare us to combat them in the face. Timely mental healthcare is necessary. Mental health professionals are facing overwhelming challenges due to a lack of sufficient resources, proper protocols and guidelines and are in quandary as to how to provide mental healthcare in isolation units and hospitals. The integration of mental health crisis interventions with the general disposition of disease prevention and treatment is of indispensable value. Multidisciplinary mental health teams, both at regional and national levels, should be able to provide care to patients and health workers. Clear and accurate information regarding COVID-19 should be communicated to both patients and healthcare personnel to allay their fears and anxiety to some extent. Regular screening of suspected patients, confirmed cases and health workers for mental illness should be made a norm rather than exception. On 27 January 2020, the central health authority of China issued the “Principles for Emergency Psychological Crisis Intervention for COVID-19 Pneumonia Epidemic”.

 </sup> More than 20 specific guidelines and expert consensus were made available to frontline healthcare professionals in China at the end of February 2020.

 </sup> Extensive adoption of online education systems, psychological counselling and hotline services were set up for those in need. Consequently, two surveys conducted in China, one at the end of January and the other towards the end of February, showed remarkable improvement in mental health status among frontline healthcare professionals following dramatic changes in approaches to provisions of mental healthcare and psychological support.

 </sup> Considering these recent events, it is imperative that China shares its protocol of emergency mental health services with the rest of the world. As it stands today, it is indeed the collective responsibility of governments and the civil society with the support of the whole United Nations system to fight this growing concern. International academic organisations such as the World Psychiatric Association and Pacific Rim College of Psychiatrists should aim at developing updated guidelines. Large-scale studies need to be conducted and references taken from previous experiences of pandemics to guide appropriate action. It is critical that people continue to have access to treatment and be provided with the correct information to reduce discrimination and social stigmatization. The real need is to build community-based capacities that strengthen social cohesion and reduce loneliness and aim to build resilience among adolescents and young children. Laying out newer guidelines and imposing such large-scale reforms is inevitably associated with drawbacks and limitations. Despite all these measures, it is highly probable that older individuals are unable to access the internet effectively, or healthcare professionals are faced with time constraints to avail of these services. Nevertheless, unless this pandemic is attended to at this critical hour itself, the post-COVID-19 landscape will be a fertile breeding ground for an increase in chronic stress, anxiety, depression, alcohol dependence
