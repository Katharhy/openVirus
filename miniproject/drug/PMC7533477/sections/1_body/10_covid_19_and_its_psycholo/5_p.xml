<p>Any calamity of this magnitude is known to shake up the extremes of age to a greater degree than the rest of the population. In addition to the growing concerns regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection and its precariousness faced by the general population, older individuals face some other specific worries. Elderly people suffering from multiple comorbidities require regular visits to the physician for health check-ups and getting prescriptions for underlying conditions. Public transport being halted in most places has reduced visits to the clinics, and more and more use of online and telemedicine is being encouraged. Older adults have limited access to the internet and smartphones, and consequently most are unable to benefit from such provisions. Besides, many countries are facing acute shortages of drugs because of interruption of manufacture, transport and business. Likewise, people already living with a chronic psychiatric problem are unable to access care they would normally require to function in a stable way. Undoubtedly, mental health services have been suppressed to a large extent under present circumstances. In many regions, mental healthcare facilities have been converted to care facilities serving patients with COVID-19; face-to-face services that are of utmost importance in psychiatric treatments have been stopped. People already living with an existing mental illness are more vulnerable to continuous media reporting about the wavering situation. Inability to acquire their maintenance medicines, being coerced into a confined situation, lack of psychological counselling sessions, shut down of outpatient departments and reduced visits from caregivers have put those most in need at risk of falling through the cracks and have inflicted on countless others new-found grief, anxiety and depression and inclination towards self-harm. 32% of known psychiatric patients from UK have been reported worsened psychiatric symptoms during this phase.
