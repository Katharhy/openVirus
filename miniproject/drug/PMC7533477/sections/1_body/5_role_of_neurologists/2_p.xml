<p>Of the several critical situations faced by neurologists in this present situation, the diciest remains the management of acute stroke. In the context of COVID-19, the ability to provide timely and efficacious care needs to be weighed against the risk of exposure to infection, and this becomes especially crucial in patients of acute stroke, given that specific treatment therapies within specified time windows (thrombolysis/thrombectomy/medical therapy) are known to affect the functional recovery and long-term outcome of these patients. Stroke patients may have symptomatic as well as asymptomatic COVID-19 infection or may develop fever during an hospital stay due to urinary tract infection or aspiration pneumonia as a complication of stroke, thus necessitating rapid evaluation for COVID-19 infection. Quite expectedly, these will burden the already overstressed healthcare system. Healthcare providers involved in providing care to patients of acute stroke with COVID-19 infection do have a risk of contracting the infection from them, although the exact risk is yet to be ascertained. Under these circumstances, it therefore becomes essential that recommendations and guidelines on stroke care be modified as per emergency medical situations, and neurologists follow what may be aptly termed as a “protected stroke code” instead of the regularly practised stroke codes.
