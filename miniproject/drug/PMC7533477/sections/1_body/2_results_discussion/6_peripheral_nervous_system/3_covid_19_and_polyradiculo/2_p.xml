<p>Cases of COVID-19 presenting with ophthalmoparesis from multiple cranial nerve palsies and Miller-Fisher (MFS) variant of GBS have been reported.

 </sup> Anti-Gd-1b antibodies were found to be positive in one of the cases reported by Gutiérrez-Ortiz et al.,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="r121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>
 </sup> instead of the more common anti-Gq1b antibody. Anti-Gd1b antibody is associated with a better prognosis,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="r123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>
 </sup> but it is too early to conclude any definite association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and this milder variety of MFS.

 </sup> RT-PCR tests done on oropharyngeal swabs taken from both patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and CSF studies in both were negative, hence perpetuating our previous knowledge about MFS being an autoimmune process rather than resulting from a direct viral invasion.

 </sup> Finsterer et al.

 </sup> claimed that SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced GBS is not triggered by a direct attack of the virus on nerve; rather damage of myelin due to an immune-mediated mechanism is more likely.
