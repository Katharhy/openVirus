<p>A much more crucial area of thought, which deserves a greater attention of neurologists, is the appearance of cerebrovascular events in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
 <sup>

 </sup> Evidences of cerebrovascular events attributable to previous coronavirus epidemics have already been documented.

  <xref rid="r73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>
 </sup> Decidedly, it has also been established that a history of cerebrovascular events is associated with a longer duration of hospital stay, almost always associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and associated with a poorer overall outcome.

 </sup> Predictably enough, in the wake of this ongoing medical catastrophe, there have been several studies reporting cerebrovascular events in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mao et al.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
 </sup> reported that six out of 214 patients suffered such neurologic compromise later in the course of their illness, five of whom reportedly had more severe disease. A larger proportion of this subset were shown to have acute ischemic stroke, with only one patient having an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), who succumbed subsequently to respiratory failure.

 </sup> In divergent studies conducted across China during this pandemic, cerebrovascular events have been reported in a multitude of observations, ranging from as low as 2% to as much as 17%.

 </sup> Predictably enough, the larger proportion of these were acute ischemic stroke.

 </sup> In a single-centre observational study from China, apart from the 5% of COVID-19 patients who had acute ischemic stroke, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and ICH were also documented in one patient each.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>
 </sup> Thirty-eight per cent of total deaths in this study occurred due to cerebrovascular events. In a more recent British study reporting about neurological and neuropsychiatric complications of COVID-19, a mighty 62% of patients presented with cerebrovascular events, 74% with acute ischemic stroke and 12% with ICH, and one patient with CNS vasculitis.

 </sup> In a majority of studies, strokes were noted in older patients, having multiple comorbidities, mainly hypertension, diabetes and prior stroke. They had a severe course of illness and later perished to an ominous outcome.

 </sup> On the contrary, a few studies have documented cerebrovascular events in patients aged &lt;50 years, sometimes occurring earlier in the course of viral infection as compared to an average duration of 10–12 d

 </sup> as reported by Mao et al.

  <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
 </sup> It has also been noted that stroke patients who were positive for COVID-19 had significantly higher in-hospital mortality, incidences of delirium and a greater morbidity compared to those without COVID-19.
