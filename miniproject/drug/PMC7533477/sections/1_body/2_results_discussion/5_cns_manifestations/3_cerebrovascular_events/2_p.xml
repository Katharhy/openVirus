<p>Research has proved, time and again, that recent viral or bacterial infection is quite a plausible cause of cerebrovascular ischemia,

 </sup> and it is only pertinent under the given circumstances that we consider the linkage of COVID-19 infection with the occurrence of coagulopathy and increased risk of thrombotic events. Several cases of thromboembolism, both arterial and venous, have been reported in numerous studies.

 </sup> But how SARS-CoV-2 incites this hypercoagulable response remains elusive. There are significant data suggesting the development of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome in these patients. There is substantial proof that increased severity of illness and risk of thrombosis is invariably associated with a higher level of C-reactive protein, fibrinogen and D-dimer. All of this is likely to be a result of endothelial inflammation resulting in upregulated levels of von-Willebrand factor and Factor VIII, and other markers of inflammation.

 </sup> On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2, being primarily a respiratory pathogen, induces fatal hypoxemia in the most severe cases. This again may result in vasoconstriction, reduced blood flow, vascular stasis and vessel occlusion.

 </sup> Another feasible theory lies in the fact that this hypoxemia prompts the activation of several hypoxemia-inducible factors, chiefly HIF-2α, which is known to induce or inhibit several important genes taking part in normal hemostatic mechanisms.

 </sup> Tissue factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 is expected to rise in such situations, which culminates in a reduced capacity to clear fibrinous and other proteinaceous exudates from the system, thus blunting the normally protective fibrinolytic process. This is of paramount importance given that the bulk of patients with cerebrovascular events are also the ones harbouring ARDS.

 </sup> also had 87.7% of patients testing positive for lupus anticoagulant (LA), which is an anti-phospholipid antibody. It was concluded that these were no false-positive LA due to the presence of heparin, as most patients had very low plasma heparin levels, which were adequately neutralised by heparin-neutralising agents present in dilute Russell Viper venom reagents. Cellular damage due to infection possibly causes plasma membrane remodelling and exposure of otherwise masked phospholipids and microparticles to the immune system. This leads to the development of antibodies against them, identified as anti-phospholipid antibodies, whose presence is known to enhance both arterial and venous thromboses.
