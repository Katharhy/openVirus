<p>A rather uncommon manifestation of CNS involvement by SARS-CoV-2 is ataxia.

 </sup> A study conducted from Wuhan in the early times of the pandemic reported ataxia in only one of their cases.

 </sup> reported a 72-year-old patient presenting with acute-onset cerebellar ataxia followed by encephalopathy. Neurological manifestation in this case was antecedent to a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

 </sup> Post-viral acute cerebellar ataxia is quite familiar in history and is often seen to be associated with varicella, mumps, Epstein-Barr virus and parvovirus B19, to name a few. Pathological examination of extra-pulmonary organs in patients infected with severe SARS had shown changes in the cerebellum as well.

 </sup> Consideration of similar findings in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is thus not far-fetched. It does need contemplation, given that patients developing ataxia will need caregiver support to maintain ambulatory autonomy, which can be a potential problem at present.
