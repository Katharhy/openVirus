<p>Encephalopathy in patients with COVID-19 does not involve a diagnosis of viral encephalitis. Other causes behind an encephalopathy-like clinical presentation – replete with mental confusion, delirious states and impaired levels of consciousness, agitation or signs of corticospinal tract involvement – are acute toxic encephalopathies, metabolic imbalances, hypoxic encephalopathies, strokes, as discussed above, or seizures with post-ictal confusion.

 </sup> noted agitation in 40% of their patients of COVID-19, all of whom were admitted in the ICU due to ARDS. More than half of these patients showed confusion of varying degrees, and 67% of cases demonstrated diffuse corticospinal tract signs.

 </sup> Subsequently, 13 of them were subjected to MRI of the brain, and 8 out of 13 showed evidences of leptomeningeal enhancement.

 </sup> CSF samples of all these patients were negative for SARS-CoV-2.

 </sup> However, data specifically designating a particular symptomatology to a specific etiology are still inconclusive. Elderly patients with chronic underlying conditions or prior neurological ailments have been seen to suffer from more severe infection and are at a greater risk of encephalopathy at initial presentation.

 </sup> Reportedly, children are being considered to harbour a less severe form of SARS-CoV-2.

 </sup> An index case of acute hemorrhagic necrotising encephalopathy, most likely due to cytokine storm in the setting of SARS-CoV-2, has been described.

 </sup> Another case of acute necrotising encephalitis has been reported by Virhammer et al.

 </sup> wherein SARS-CoV-2 RNA was isolated from the CSF of the patient. It is therefore imperative on the part of the neurologist to keep in mind SARS-CoV-2 infections while dealing with such cases as expeditious isolation of positive cases is deemed indispensable to stall further spread of the infection.
