<p>Data regarding spinal cord involvement are scarce. Post-infectious myelitis is not uncommon with several organisms ascribable to its cause, 
 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> being the most common.

 </sup> Myelitis following an infection with Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, measles virus or rhinovirus is common. CoV-OC43 has been associated with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.

 </sup> Since all coronaviruses share a structural homology to an extent, in all probability, SARS-CoV-2 can only be expected to cause similar spinal cord involvement. Only one case of acute myelitis following COVID-19 infection has been described from Wuhan hitherto.

 </sup> It is only reasonable to assume that the virus gained entry to the spinal cord by attaching itself to ACE-2 receptors present on spinal cord neurons as well.
