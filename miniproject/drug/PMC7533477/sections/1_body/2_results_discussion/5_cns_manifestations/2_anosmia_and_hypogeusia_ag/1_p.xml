<p>Post-viral anosmia, one of the leading causes of olfactory dysfunction in adults, accounts for up to 40% of cases infected by SARS-CoV-2.

 </sup> Previous coronavirus epidemics have reported 10–15% of cases with similar symptomatology.

  <xref rid="r63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>
 </sup> Reports of similar associations are seen in more than one study from China, South Korea, France, Italy, Iran, UK and USA, and it is frequently combined with hypogeusia/ageusia.

 </sup> An Italian study published reports of 33.9% of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients having at least one symptom of olfactory or taste disturbances, and 18.3% had both.

 </sup> In a study by Heidari et al.

 </sup>, 83% of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients had anosmia as their first symptom, and two-thirds of them were female. Noticeably, in some cases of COVID-19, olfactory disturbances occurred even without significant nasal inflammation and coryzal symptoms.

 </sup> Hence, it might be concluded that the virus directly targets odour-processing mechanisms.

 </sup> Keeping in view of this, it was seen that in human and mouse, the olfactory sensory neurons do not express the two key genes required for SARS-CoV-2 entry: ACE-2 and transmembrane protease serine-2.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="r69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>
 </sup> In contrast, olfactory epithelial support cells and stem cells are found to express both, as do cells in the nasal respiratory epithelium.

 </sup> Based on these findings, Brann et al.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="r69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>
 </sup> have postulated several plausible mechanisms of viral entry into the olfactory epithelium. Firstly, local infection of the vascular and sustentacular cells in the nasal epithelium could result in significant inflammation that effectively blocks the conduction of smell and alters the functions of olfactory sensory neurons.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="r69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>
 </sup> Secondly, damage to these cells also brings into being water and ionic imbalances in them, indirectly influencing signalling from olfactory sensory neurons to the brain.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="r69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>
 </sup> Vascular damage causing hypoperfusion may also be responsible for olfactory bulb dysfunctions. Despite all these findings, the exact mechanism of involvement of the olfactory system remains obscure. Then again, the most implicated receptor, ACE-2, has been found to be present in abundance in the oral mucosal epithelium, thus proving an entry source to the virus.
