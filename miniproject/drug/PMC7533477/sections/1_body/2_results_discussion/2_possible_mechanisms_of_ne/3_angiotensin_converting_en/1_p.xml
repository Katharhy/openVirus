<p>Binding of the virus to ACE-2 both in the bloodâ€“brain barrier and in the meninges covering the spinal cord attenuates the protective capacity of this enzyme towards neural tissue, thus making them more susceptible to injury leading to encephalitis or myelitis.

 </sup> There have been reported cases of intracerebral hemorrhages occurring due to SARS-CoV-2, also attributable to the viral binding to ACE-2 present in the cerebral blood vessels, thus raising luminal pressure.

 </sup> Similarly, binding to these receptors in the skeletal muscles has resulted in skeletal myopathies.

 </sup> Reports demonstrate that binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE-2 receptors leads to a decrease in the levels of ACE-2 and a subsequent surge in ACE-1 within the nervous system.

 </sup> ACE-1 is known to result in neuronal damage, inflammation, degeneration and death of neurons.

 </sup> Notably, these receptors are highly concentrated in the sub-fornical regions, nucleus tractus solitarius, rostral ventro-lateral medulla and the paraventricular regions.

 </sup> Additionally, ACE-2 receptors are also found to be present on the endothelial cells across multiple organs, including the nervous tissue, binding of SARS-CoV-2 to which would lead to widespread endothelial dysfunction, systemic endotheliitis associated with apoptosis, culminating in neuronal cell death. The presence of viral elements inside endothelial cells substantiates the hypothesis of a direct causative role of SARS-CoV-2 in pathogenesis.
