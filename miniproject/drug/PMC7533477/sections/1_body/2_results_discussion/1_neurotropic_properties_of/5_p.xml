<p>It is a well-established fact that coronaviruses are known to infect a wide variety of animal species, mostly exhibiting selective tropism towards the respiratory tract or the gut. Notably, some among these, the feline coronavirus and porcine hemagglutinating encephalitis virus variants, have also been implicated in neurological diseases, infecting the brain, meninges or even the spinal cord.

 </sup> The close structural and biological similarities of the human coronavirus (HCoV) to the neurotropic animal coronaviruses have led to the speculation about possible involvement of HCoV in neurological diseases. Data confirming such association is still largely elusive. However, HCoV-22 E and HCoV-OC43,
