<p>SARS-CoV-2 may infect the endothelial cells of the bloodâ€“brain barrier or the leucocytes to get disseminated to other tissues. HCoV-229 E and HCoV-OC43 have been shown to infect the human monocytes/macrophages.

 </sup> Additionally, HCoV-229 E has also been reported to infect murine dendritic cells expressing human aminopeptidase-N.

 </sup> Following infection of these cell lines, monocytes get activated, differentiate into macrophages and serve as reservoirs for the virus, thus facilitating its passage to other tissues, including the nervous system.

 </sup> On the other hand, infection of dendritic cells results in wavering of innate immunity, and further perpetuating spread.
