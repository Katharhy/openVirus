<p>Coronavirus belong to a family of enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses. Taxonomically, grouped in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, they are further classified within four different genera, namely Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta coronaviruses.

 </sup> However, it has now been proven indubitably that they do possess neurotropic and neuroinvasive properties in various hosts, including humans, rats, pigs, rodents and fowls.

 </sup> Their non-segmented 30 kb positive, single-stranded polyadenylated RNA, the largest among RNA viruses, possesses four or five genes encoding structural proteins (S, E, M, N and hemagglutinin-esterase for the genus betacoronaviruses) and several genes encoding non-structural proteins, all of which play well-defined roles in determining the pathogenicity of the virus.

 </sup> The spike protein (S) is a type-1 glycosylated transmembrane protein, which helps in recognising the host cell receptor, thus enabling the virus to infect a susceptible cell. The envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) protein and the nucleocapsid (N) protein are responsible for maintaining the shape and structure of the virion.

 </sup> Some species of the betacoronaviruses express a special protein-0, the hemagglutinin-esterase that interacts with different types of sialic acid, thus plausibly playing a role in hemagglutination.

 </sup> It also possesses an acetyl-esterase function, which may be important during early infection or during the release of viral particles from the infected cells at the end of the replication cycle of betacoronaviruses.
