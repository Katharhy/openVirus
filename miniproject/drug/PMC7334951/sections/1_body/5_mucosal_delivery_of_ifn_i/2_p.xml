<p id="par0095">Since the respiratory mucosa is the primary portal of entry for SARS-CoV-2, there is increasing interest in developing mucosal treatments for either prevention or treatment of COVID-19. The first attempts to deliver IFN-I to the nasal mucosa to counteract respiratory infections date back in the 1970s [
 <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Since then, intranasal administration of IFN-I has been repeatedly explored as prophylactic measure against respiratory infections with variable results that mostly depended on the dose and on the type of patients [
 <xref rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The intranasal route has also been explored for the delivery of IFN-I [
 <xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] or IFN-I-inducers [
 <xref rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] as adjuvants for influenza vaccines in animal models. In all these studies, intranasal IFN-I was well tolerated and devoid of any evident toxicity. However, concerns exist towards the possibility that the intranasal route may unwantedly deliver compounds to the central nervous system, thus causing toxicity [
 <xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Among mucosal routes, sublingual administration is gaining interest due to the rapid bioavailability of the applied compound and the lack of hepatic or neural toxicity. In healthy individuals an oral low dosage IFN-α preparation proved safe and effective as prophylaxis against respiratory viral infections [
 <xref rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The data available thus far suggest that the beneficial effects of sublingual IFN-I may reside in the local interactions between the cytokine and specific cell populations, including the intraepithelial γ
 <italic>δ</italic> T cells, which enter the circulation to mediate the antiviral effects of IFN-I [
 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In contrast to the parenteral administration, mucosal administration of IFN-I may have the advantage of being less toxic (if any) and easy to perform, while retaining the capability of inducing both local and systemic effects potentially protective in the very early phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several clinical trials using inhaled IFN-α either as monotherapy or in combination with other treatments have been authorized so far worldwide [
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In a study recently published on MedRxiv, intranasal administration of IFN-α to medical staff at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection results in complete protection [
 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Since the beneficial effects of mucosal IFN-I are critically dependent on the timing of administration with regard to the stage of the immune or inflammatory stimulus, further studies are needed to confirm IFN-I efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection and to better characterize the biological activities, the mechanisms of action and the optimal modalities of mucosal administration.
