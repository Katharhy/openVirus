<p id="par0035">Since COVID-19 outbreak, more than 2000 clinical trials have been authorized to identify the drugs or drug combinations capable of attenuating the virulence of the disease [
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Some of these trials include the use of Interferons (IFN) alone or in combination with other compounds. IFN are a cytokine family linking innate and adaptive immune responses, with an important role in the inhibition of viral replication, through different receptor molecules and effector proteins [
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There are three types of IFN, Type I (IFN-α/β), Type II (IFN-γ), and Type III (IFN-λ). Although all three are likely involved in protection against CoV infection, Type I IFN (IFN-I) and IFN-λ are the most studied in this area [
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Interestingly, although IFN-α and β share the same receptor and exhibit similar biological activities [
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], their diverse receptor affinity may be responsible for some differential effects [
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Some studies point to IFN-β1b and IFN-β1a as the most potent subtypes for SARS-CoV inhibition and likely even more for SARS-CoV-2 [
