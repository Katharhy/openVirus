<p id="par0110">In the majority of the proposed studies, IFN-α and -β are being combined with other drugs, mainly antivirals, although in some cases the rationale for combination is poorly defined. In a recent randomized, phase 2 trial examining the combination of IFN-β1b, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin compared with lopinavir/ritonavir alone, the investigators observed significant symptoms alleviation, shortening of the duration of viral shedding and of hospital stay only in IFN-treated patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 [

Notably, due to the absence of single treatment arms in this clinical study, it cannot be discerned whether the specific contribution of IFN-β1a to clinical outcome improvement was a direct antiviral or immune-mediated effect. Thus, further studies to investigate the clinical impact of IFNβ-1b alone in COVID-19 patients are warranted [
