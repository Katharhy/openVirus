<p id="par0060">Although our knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 biology is still limited, the overall genomic similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS- and MERS-CoV, as well as the immunologic changes observed during infection [
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] point to a dysregulated IFN-I response in COVID-19 pathogenesis and disease outcome [
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Diminished levels of IFN-I were already detected during the course of SARS and MERS infections. In particular, SARS patients revealed no expression of IFN-I or IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting a viral-induced inhibition of their expression [

 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Furthermore, a downregulated expression of IFN-α and of some ISG (RIG-I, MDA5 and IRF3/7) was associated with the severity of disease and fatal outcomes in MERS patients [
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Likewise, SARS-CoV-2 infection (either in cell lines, primary cell cultures, ferrets, and COVID-19 patients) drives a lower antiviral transcriptional response that is marked by low IFN-I and IFN-III levels and elevated chemokine expression, which could explain the proinflammatory disease state associated with COVID-19. In patients with severe COVID-19, an impaired IFN-I signalling associated with persistent blood viral load and an exacerbated inflammatory response was recently reported [
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Along these lines, IFN immune profiling in critically ill COVID-19 patients revealed a peak in IFN α2 production 8–10 days after symptoms onset. A small group of patients had suppressed IFN-I production, in particular, patients with no IFN-α production presented poorer outcome and longer intensive care unit stay [
