  <bold>Sandra Gessani</bold> is Senior Researcher at the Center for Gender-specific medicine of the Istituto Superiore di Sanità. She has a long lasting experience on the mechanisms regulating IFN expression, both in the antiviral and the antitumor response. An important achievement was breaking the dogma that type II IFN expression was a prerogative of lymphoid cells by demonstrating its constitutive expression in macrophages and providing the first example for its autocrine regulation in myeloid cells (Di Marzio et al., J. Exp. Med. 1994). Dr. Gessani’s group also pioneered studies on the functional interaction between human DC and γ
  <italic>δ</italic> T lymphocytes (Conti et al., J. Immunol. 2005). Her recent work focused on the relationship among diet, inflammation and cancer (Donninelli et al., Frontiers Immunol. 2017; Del Cornò et al. Frontiers Immunol. 2019).
