<p>Our doses are based in an article recently published by Ramos et al. (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). The authors demonstrated that when we extrapolated effective animal doses to human for a 70 kg adult, the results ranged from 19 to 1,527 mg per day. As there is no time or clinical trials to test the efficacy of melatonin at different concentrations, we suggest the use of melatonin (100 or 400 mg per day) as an adjunct, especially if no efficient direct anti-viral treatment is available (
