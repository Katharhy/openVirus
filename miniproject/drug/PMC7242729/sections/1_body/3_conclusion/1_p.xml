<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has infected hundreds of thousands and killed tens of thousands of individuals worldwide. Time is not a luxury that this crisis has. The high mortality is caused by the uncontrolled innate immune response and destructive inflammation. Melatonin is a molecule that negatively regulates the overreaction of the innate immune response and excess inflammation, promoting adaptive immune activity. Moreover, the indole is an endogenous molecule, produced in small amounts, whose synthesis diminishes with increased age. These finding, together with those recently summarized by Anderson and Reiter (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) and Zhang et al. (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), support the use of melatonin in patients with COVID-19. We agree with the suggestion by those authors that melatonin should be given consideration for prophylactic use or treatment alone or in combination with other drugs, and propose a therapeutic algorithm for use in patients. Melatonin is readily available, can be easily synthesized in large quantities, is inexpensive, has a very high safety profile and can be easily self-administered.
