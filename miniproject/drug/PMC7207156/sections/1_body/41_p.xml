 <bold>RR:</bold> The only information we have is that in China, Korea and Singapore, we have been able to contain the first wave of COVID‚Äê19. However, the majority of the population in these countries is still susceptible to infection. Given that this virus is already present in most countries worldwide, it is unlikely that it will disappear. We may see secondary waves of infections, and eventually, it may become endemic. My hope is that by that time we will be ready with vaccines and drugs.
