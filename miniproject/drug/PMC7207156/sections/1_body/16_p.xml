   <p>RNA vaccines: These can be developed very quickly (in 2013, we had a vaccine against H7N9 to immunise mice in 1 week). The platform is not yet mature, there is no vaccine approved with this technology, and safety is still in question. However, depending on the risk/benefit ratio, it could be the fastest approach. Indeed, an RNA vaccine against SARS‐CoV‐2 is the first one to go to phase I clinical trial.</p>

   <p>Viral vectors (Adeno, ChAd, measles, VSV….): The platform is more mature than RNA, and it is easy to splice a synthetic gene into a vector. One product (Ebola) is already licensed, others are in phase III, and safety is reasonable. Some manufacturing capacity is available. This can also be fast.</p>

   <p>Traditional protein‐based vaccines: the recombinant spike protein to be expressed in mammalian cells, baculovirus or plant cells +/− adjuvants. The spike protein will probably be engineered to stabilise the prefusion form. I am sure this technology is going to work. Initially, it will require more time to get to phase I, but given the experience we have in developing and manufacturing protein‐based vaccines, this is probably the technology we need to count on, if we need a very large number of vaccine doses. Very likely, any protein‐based vaccine will require an adjuvant to improve the immunogenicity and for dose sparing.</p>
