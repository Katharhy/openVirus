 <bold>SA:</bold> There is always a social component to an epidemic and perhaps even more to a pandemic. In the case of the 1918â€“1919 influenza pandemic, the world was exiting a World War and the average health in the populations was much lower than it is today. Furthermore, it is possible that a significant fraction of the mortality was due to coinfection by bacterial infections (antibiotics were not available then).
