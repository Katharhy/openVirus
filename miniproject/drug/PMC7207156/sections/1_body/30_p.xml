 <bold>RR:</bold> To my knowledge, the R0 of the 1918 Spanish Flu was not lower than the one of COVID‚Äê19 which has been estimated to be 2.6. We do not know the reason for the high mortality of the Spanish Flu, but secondary bacterial infections and lack of hygiene may have increased the lethality of the infection.
