 <bold>RR:</bold> Under normal conditions, vaccine development requires 15–20 years. This is mostly because we want to be absolutely sure that vaccines are safe and effective. When there is an emergency, the risk/benefit ratio changes and vaccine development can be accelerated. In the case of Ebola, 5 years were sufficient to develop and licence a vaccine. For COVID‐19, the new technologies and the experience gained with Ebola are going to help to further accelerate the development of a vaccine; however, I believe it will be difficult to get any available to people before at least 12 months.
