 <bold>Samuel Alizon (SA):</bold> To date, we are lacking detailed models to know for sure. Regarding “optimality”, there is a strong policy matter involved because one strategy can be to slow the virus spread in the population to achieve the herd immunity threshold (~ 60% for COVID‐19) through natural immunity and another is to halt its spread as long as possible for a safe and efficient vaccine to be ready to implement. Furthermore, factoring in the health cost of the lockdown itself is as crucial as it is difficult.
