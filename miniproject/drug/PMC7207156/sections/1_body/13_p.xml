 <bold>AI:</bold> We will not know whether a vaccine is effective for a year or so. The phase 1 trial for the mRNA vaccine has already begun in the USA. Since no vaccines have been tested even in animal models for efficacy, it is difficult to know what the most promising approaches are yet. The problem is that we really don't know the ideal immune response that would confer best protective response against SARS‐CoV‐2 and how best to achieve it.
