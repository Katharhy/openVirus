 <bold>RR:</bold> We know that the infection is very mild in children and young adults, and that the severity of the disease increases with age, becoming life‐threatening above 80 years of age. The severe disease is mostly caused by a cytokine storm produced by immune cells that migrate to the lungs to combat the virus. Children usually have a lower cellular response, and this could explain the milder disease. Wide testing makes sense to follow the contacts of cases or in small populations. When an entire country is affected, wide testing becomes hard to implement.
