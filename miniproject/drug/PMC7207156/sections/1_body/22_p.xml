 <bold>SA:</bold> If all control measures are lifted before the herd immunity threshold is reached, a second wave is likely. However, maintaining looser control measures could decrease the R0 sufficiently to slow down a future epidemic spread and make it more controllable by targeted policies. The quasi‐absence of documented reinfection points to the existence of acquired immunity. The question is, how long does it last? Earlier data on SARS‐CoV‐1 suggest it might not be as long‐lived as we would hope.
