 <bold>Rino Rappuoli (RR):</bold> I believe that all western countries initially underestimated the impact that COVID‚Äê19 was going to have on the healthcare system, mortality and the economy. Quarantine and social distancing work much better if rigorously implemented very early, before the cases are widespread. At this point, all countries are implementing measures similar to those implemented in Italy.
