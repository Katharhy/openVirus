  <p>The emergence of pandemic IAV strains in humans, showing known host relationships, host proteins that influence infection and the viral proteins that are affected or which allow a barrier to be overcomeâ€”their exact roles and order of contact and evasion are not specifically shown. The possible role of swine as an intermediate host is indicated, but the adaptation process in humans versus swine is still unclear.</p>
