  <p>The known host relationships of SIVs and the pathways to the emergence of the two epidemic HIV strains in humans, the M and O strains. The viruses derive from the recombination of viruses infecting three monkey hosts, transfer through chimpanzee for the HIV M strain, and through both the chimpanzee and gorilla for the O strain. The known host barriers and the viral proteins that they interact with are listed; their exact roles and order of contact and evasion are not specifically shown.</p>
