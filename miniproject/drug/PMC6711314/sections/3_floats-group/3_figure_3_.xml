  <p>The known host relationships of CPV with the viruses that were long known in other hosts, including cats. The viruses circulate among several carnivore hosts, and cats are likely the major reservoir of FPV. This indicates the possible origin of the ancestor of the CPV in dogs from another host that has not yet been identified.</p>
