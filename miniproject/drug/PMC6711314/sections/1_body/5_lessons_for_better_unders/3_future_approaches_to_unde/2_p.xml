<p>New experimental and computational approaches will further clarify the processes involved. Better analysis of sequence and biological data using the tools of population genetics will also sharpen the conclusions and produce more general insights into the mechanisms of host restriction and how viruses may overcome those. Studying known host range models clarifies the mechanisms that allow specific host entry, replication, transmission and shedding, and reveals the key evolutionary events that have occurred in previous outbreaks. Integrated models of spillover and early transmission can be paired with a knowledge of animal and human viruses. Key challenges include methods to distinguish cases infected directly from animal spillovers (primary cases) and secondary cases resulting from human-to-human transmission, and methods to estimate transmissibility, which are often difficult to obtain at the start of an epidemic. By clarifying the series of steps that are required to go from exposure to spillover to epidemic or pandemic, new models should identify multiple points where strategic interventions could allow us to forestall new viruses before they can emerge to create widespread epidemics.</p>
