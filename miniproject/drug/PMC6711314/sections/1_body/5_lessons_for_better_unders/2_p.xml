<p>Emerging and re-emerging epidemic viruses are among the greatest threats to the health and wellbeing of humans and other animals (as well as to plants and microbes). The transfer of viruses into new hosts involves the traversing of complex fitness landscapes between old and new hosts and/or invertebrate vectors. Models of emerging epidemic viruses, including those outlined here, show that the process is complex and generally involves multiple steps. Each epidemic examined initiated from a single ancestral virus that made the transition to successful replication and spread in the new host by overcoming a number of barriers, in the form of host-specific proteins or processes that differed between the reservoir and the new outbreak host. Transferred viruses, therefore, had low fitness in their new hosts, and that was improved by the acquisition of multiple mutations, more often in several genes. Intermediate hosts are clearly involved in many examples that have been examined, and those may both give greater exposure to the new outbreak host, and reduce the fitness valley that must be traversed.</p>
