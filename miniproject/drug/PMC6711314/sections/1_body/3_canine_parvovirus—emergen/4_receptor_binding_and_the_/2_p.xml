<p>It is now clear that the canine host range of CPV was primarily associated with changes in the capsid protein gene, with only a few key residues on the capsid surface allowing the virus to infect dog cells [

 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The main host range variation and emergence events are outlined in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20190017F3">figureÂ 3</xref>. CPV uses the cellular transferrin receptor type-1 (TfR) as the receptor for entry [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Comparing the sequences of the TfRs from different hosts identified a key change in the canine TfR as an additional glycosylation site in a position where it blocks the binding of FPV-like viruses [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. That additional glycosylation site is found in a few animal hosts closely related to dogs (wolves, coyotes, possibly golden jackals) [
