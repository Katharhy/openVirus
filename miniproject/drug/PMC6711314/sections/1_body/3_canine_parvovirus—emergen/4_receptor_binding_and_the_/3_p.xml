<p>CPV is a true pandemic virus, and most of the dogs in the world were infected by the new virus within 1 or 2 years of it becoming widespread [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. While the CPV-2 strain spread widely in dogs, a variant that contained five additional mutations (named CPV-2a) arose by early 1979 which completely replaced the CPV-2 strain worldwide [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and that appears to represent a fine tuning of the pandemic virus. All of these viruses cause a systemic infection in animals, infecting through the oro-nasal route, replicating in and spreading between tissues that contain dividing cells, including the lymphoid tissues and the rapidly dividing cells in the crypts of the small intestinal villae [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The virus is shed in the faeces of the infected animal, where it is able to survive for long periods allowing efficient transport on fomites. While FPV-like viruses do not bind and infect canine cells in tissue culture, they may replicate in dogs in some tissues after natural exposure, primarily in the thymus [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Replication in those internal tissues did not result in efficient shedding of the virus, so those infections are dead-end spillovers. The initial group of capsid changes in CPV-2 gave it the ability to bind the glycosylated canine TfR [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], and allowed infection of the intestinal cells that resulted in efficient shedding and transmission.
