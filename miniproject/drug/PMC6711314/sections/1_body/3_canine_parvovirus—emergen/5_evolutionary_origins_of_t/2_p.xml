<p>In this example, there is frequent exposure of dogs to viruses from other hosts, particularly cats, yet CPV has only arisen once to give a sustained epidemic. It is therefore likely that there are limited combinations of mutations that allow successful use of the canine TfR for efficient cell infection, and that those mutations do not commonly arise in other hosts that produce viruses that expose dogs. The CPV-2 strain that emerged in 1978 did not infect cats, so that host adaptation likely had to occur after infection of dogs—perhaps during the limited replication in the thymus—to allow it to become transmissible in dogs. The emergence of CPV-2a may have involved adaptation of the virus in another host, possibly raccoons [
