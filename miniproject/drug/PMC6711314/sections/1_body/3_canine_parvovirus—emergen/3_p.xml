<p>The example of interest is the emergence of the pandemic CPV in dogs, where the virus apparently spilled over from another host, gained the canine host range and spread worldwide in 1978. The parvovirus properties and many events surrounding the emergence of CPV have also been reviewed recently [

The viruses that gave rise to CPV have been known to infect many different hosts within the order Carnivora, and they were first found to cause disease in cats in the 1920s, in raccoons in the 1930s and in mink in the 1940s. Those viruses were variously named feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), raccoon parvovirus or mink enteritis virus, although it has long been recognized that those viruses are related and that viruses from one host could infect some other carnivore hosts. In 1978, new diseases of dogs were recognized which were seen in all regions of the world, with some dogs developing severe gastroenteritis with profuse bloody diarrhoea, while neonatal puppies developed a myocardial disease [

The cause was recognized as a parvovirus similar to FPV, which was named CPV type-2 (CPV-2) to distinguish it from the distantly related minute virus of canines, also known as canine bocavirus. Testing of dog sera collected from many parts of the world before 1978 showed positive antibodies in 1974 and 1976 in Europe, but none in other regions of the world until 1978. Sequence analysis showed that CPV was a new virus in dogs, and that all viruses in dogs share a common ancestor present around the mid-1970s, and they were greater than 99% identical to the FPV-like viruses [
