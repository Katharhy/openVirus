<p>CPV is a member of the Protoparvoviruses, in the Family Parvoviridae. The parvoviruses are small non-enveloped viruses, which form a stable capsid of about 26 nm in diameter, that packages an ssDNA genome of about 5100 bases. The viral DNA replicates through linear double stranded DNA intermediates in the nucleus of the cell using the host cell DNA polymerases, most likely Pol
