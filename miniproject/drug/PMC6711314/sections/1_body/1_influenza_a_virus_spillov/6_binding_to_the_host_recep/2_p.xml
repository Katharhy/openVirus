<p>The receptor for IAV is described as sialic acid (Sia), but on more detailed analysis, it is clear that the IAV receptor is complex and may vary in form between hosts [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The Sia found on human cells is the 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetyl neuraminic acid, but in other hosts modified forms such as 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycolyl neuraminic acid are also commonly found, while in some (horses and guinea pigs), there are high levels of an inhibitory Sia, Neu4,5Ac. Those structural differences may influence the binding of HA, and also inhibit the sialidase activity of the viral NA. A second level of receptor specificity comes from the linkage of the Sia to the glycan, which is commonly α2,6 in the upper respiratory tract (and a combination of α2,3 and α2,6 in the lower respiratory tract) in humans, but is most often α2,3 in the intestinal tract of birds and some other hosts. The switch in specificity from the α2,3 to the α2,6 Sia linkage seems to be a requirement for efficient human-to-human transmission [

 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This may affect the binding of HA to the receptor as more branched and multi-Sia glycans can bind virus with higher affinity. The length of the glycan may also require a change in the structure of the NA tetramer, which tends to have shorter sequences in the stalk structure in viruses growing in avian tissues, and longer when the longer glycans in the human respiratory tract are encountered [
