<p>The origins of the 1918 H1N1 virus are still not well documented, but the virus likely arose shortly before 1918 when an avian virus was transmitted to humans or swine. However, we have little information about the viruses circulating in birds or in other hosts prior to 1918, and it is also not clear if the 1918 IAV emerged in humans and then transferred to swine, or vice versa [

However, the H2N2 pandemic strain emerged in 1957 when the haemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) and PB2 gene segments of the H1N1 virus were replaced by reassortment with one or more avian viruses, while in 1968, the HA and PB2 gene segments of that H2N2 virus were in turn replaced by those from an avian virus, giving rise to the H3N2 strain [
