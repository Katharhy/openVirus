<p>IAVs are often at the top of most lists of emerging viruses, having jumped into prominence in 1918 with the global pandemic caused by the H1N1 strain in humans and in swine [

 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This was followed by the emergence of the pandemic H2N2, H3N2 and H1N1 pandemic strains of IAV in humans in 1957, 1968 and 2009, respectively [

 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Other epidemic strains have arisen in horses (H7N7 and H3N8), swine (besides the H1N1, there have been two different H3N2 strains and reassortant forms [

 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Although there are IAVs in bats, those strains are not known to spread to other hosts [
