<p>Many IAVs cause severe infections of new animal hosts, including humans, but without being able to be shed and transmit efficiently. Virion production processes occur with the viral ribonuleoproteins budding from the plasma membrane, and viral release requires the activity of the viral NA, which cleaves the sialic acids on viral glycoproteins and on host materials to allow particles to disaggregate and release efficiently. The processes underlying the transmission of influenza viruses are still not well understood, but likely require optimal receptor interactions and replication, along with the ability to survive in the respiratory secretions of the new host. In humans, the respiratory secretions that the virus is shed in have a relatively low pH (around 5.5), and a number of mutations in the interior of the HA trimer have been found that stabilize the HA at lower pHs and have been associated with the ability to transmit efficiently [
