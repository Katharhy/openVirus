<p>Once the virus has successfully bound to the receptors in the new host and entered the cell, it needs to replicate successfully in the new intracellular environment. IAV replicates in the nucleus of the host and its genome thus needs to be imported into the nucleus using the cellular transport machinery. The IAV PB2 and nucleoprotein proteins interact with the nuclear entry protein importin-Î± in a host-specific manner, and this requires adaption of these viral proteins to the human or other host cells [
