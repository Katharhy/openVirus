<p>Optimal viral polymerase activity depends on interaction of viral ribonucleoproteins with host proteins, and a mutation of the PB2 protein at residue 627 from Glu to Lys is commonly observed in viruses adapted to replicate in humans, due at least in part to the necessity to interact with the cellular protein acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein 32 (ANP32), which also binds other cellular proteins [
