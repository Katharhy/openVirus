<p>While spillovers by IAV are quite common, epidemics are relatively rare, and making the shift from an intestinal infection and faecal–oral transmission in water birds to a respiratory infection and aerosol transmission in humans or other mammals would appear to be a significant problem. Several different host barriers have been identified that were overcome by one or more emerging IAVs, and those have been recently comprehensively reviewed [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20190017F1">figure 1</xref>. Each epidemic in humans and most other mammals has initiated with a single virus genotype, and that virus is assumed to have overcome a number of barriers to become a well-adapted and transmissible virus of mammals. Across these known examples of animal influenza viruses overcoming host-specific differences to cause epidemics in humans, genetic changes have been identified in almost every step of the IAV replication cycle. Those include the animal environments that differ between the avian gastrointestinal tract which is around 41°C, and the upper or lower respiratory tracts of mammals, which are approximately 34 or approximately 37°C. Other differences include the display and binding of specific sialic acid receptors and linkage forms which influence haemagglutinin (HA) binding and neuraminidase (NA) cleavage, release of the viral ribonucleoproteins from the endosome and transport to the nucleus, RNA replication and/or transcription, antagonizing various interferon-associated innate immune responses, viral budding from the cell and release from the cell surface, shedding and transmission among individuals of that host [
