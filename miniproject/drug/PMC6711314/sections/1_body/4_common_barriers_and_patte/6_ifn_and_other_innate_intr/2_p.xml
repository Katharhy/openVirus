<p>Innate immune responses, mainly IFN, vary significantly between different animal hosts and often control infection or replication. Viral-encoded countermeasures to IFN or ISGs or their products are often host-specific, and can influence the success of viral transfers. In addition, arboviruses are required to replicate in insect and vertebrate hosts, and therefore need to evade innate immune pathways of both hosts, potentially making vertebrate host shifts difficult. The finding that bats are reservoirs for a number of emerging viruses such as filoviruses and henipaviruses may be in part due to their differential permissive IFN response to viral infection [
