<p>There are now many thousands of studies of the genetic sequences and variation of viruses, particularly of those that emerge in new hosts. Those confirm that the replication of many viruses is relatively low fidelity and creates many mutations, providing significant amounts of genetic variation in most viral populations. While RNA viruses and retroviruses show frequent mutations and recombination or reassortment, it is now clear that sequence variation is also common in both ssDNA and double-stranded DNA viruses [

 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. As described above, and reviewed elsewhere [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], the emergence of new epidemic viruses requires host adaptive mutations, recombination or reassortment, or the acquisition of modifications and accessory genes. Retrospective analysis indicates that those changes occur during the early stages of infection and spread in the new host or within an intermediate host, and that those are required to give increased replication and transmission. It is not generally possible to identify those key mutations before virus emergence, but we can now identify adaptive mutations required for initial epidemic spread, or for additional ‘fine tuning’ of the host range [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The functional expression of mutations may be dependent on the sequence context of the virus, creating a significant historical contingency, so that low-risk mutations in one strain may be high risk in even closely related strains.
