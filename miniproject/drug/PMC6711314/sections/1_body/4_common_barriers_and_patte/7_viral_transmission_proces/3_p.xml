<p>The host population structures (of both donor and recipient) play key roles in viral emergence. The density and connectedness of the new host population may determine whether viruses emerge rather than die out. This is particularly true for viruses causing acute infections, which are more prone to burn out before spreading to new patches of host population [

Changes in hosts and host populations that alter the likelihood of emergence include population size, density, mobility, behaviour such as sexual practices, and connectedness. Transmission heterogeneity is likely important early in outbreaks of new viruses, when stochastic events will often determine the outcome, and in particular, ‘superspreaders’ may create a large number of secondary infections that allow viruses to overcome demographic barriers [

 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Specific control or reduction in those events may be particularly effective in the early control of outbreaks, but that hinges on the identification of potential superspreaders early.
