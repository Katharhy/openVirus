<p>Efficient transmissibility between individuals of the new host is a critical hurdle that must be cleared for an emerging virus to create an epidemic. Processes involved may include the structures and functions of the respiratory secretions that generate aerosols, droplets, or dried particles, materials in faeces and the environment that influence faecal–oral transmission, the nature of the virus-containing materials involved in direct transmission, as well as other viral, host or environmental factors. Persistent infection and shedding provides prolonged opportunities for transmission (e.g. by HIV), while acutely infecting viruses (such as IAV and CPV) are only shed for a few days, so that contact is required (IAV) or survival in faecal matter (CPV). There are many details of transmission that need to be determined, including the physical nature of the shed virus and host components, and the roles of different regions of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract (or other sites) in facilitating transmission. Invertebrate vectors may impose an addition level of host adaptation, but they may facilitate the spread of a virus in a new host population. All of these potential interactions are still poorly understood—and studying combinations of factors is challenging in experimental animal models of infection and transmission.</p>
