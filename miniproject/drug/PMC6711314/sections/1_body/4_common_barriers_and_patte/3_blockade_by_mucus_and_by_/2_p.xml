<p>Many viruses enter the host at mucosal surfaces, and extracellular mucus, therefore, acts as the first barrier to viral infection. Mucus is composed of a variety of different glycans and proteins, which differ widely between various hosts and their tissues. Mucus composition and susceptibility to viral infection also vary depending on the health of the individual, the presence of resident commensal microflora and co-infections, and physiological stressors. Many viruses carry glycosidases, sialidases, or esterases that act as countermeasures against mucin glycans upon entry as well as during egress and shedding of viral particles. Mixed infections of newly transferred viruses with other viruses or bacteria may alter the host mucus and facilitate infection.</p>
