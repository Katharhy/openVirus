<p>Many viruses have glycosylated proteins on their surfaces which are host-specific. Viruses produced in one host will carry an imprinted source glycosylation that is determined by the specific cell or tissue they are produced in. Upon exposure to a new host, these variant glycans (e.g. 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycolyl neuraminic acid (Neu5GC) or α1,3-galactose (α-gal)) may be targeted by preexisting host antibodies to these glycan forms and block the viral infection.
