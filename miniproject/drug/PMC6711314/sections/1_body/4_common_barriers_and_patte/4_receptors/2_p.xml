<p>Viral receptors are often key determinants of host and tissues tropism and therefore of host range, and those may be expressed at the cell surface or within the entry pathway. The specificity of virusâ€“receptor interactions may involve host-specific structural interactions that control the affinity of binding, progression to internalization, triggering cell infection, along with key roles for co-receptors where those are present.</p>
