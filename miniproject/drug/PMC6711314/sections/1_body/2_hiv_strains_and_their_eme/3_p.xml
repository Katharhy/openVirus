<p>HIV has killed more than 40 million people through the development of AIDS and infections that are facilitated by the viral immunosuppression, and around 1.8 million people are still being infected each year despite the development and use of effective antiviral drugs [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. HIV is a lentivirus within the retrovirus family, meaning that it packages two copies of the RNA genome, along with a reverse transcriptase that converts the genome into DNA once the virus enters the cell; the HIV DNA genome is then integrated into the host chromosome, and new viral genomic RNA and mRNAs are produced from that integrated copy.
