<p>The emergence of HIV-1M and O strains each resulted from the transfer to humans of a single virus, which became the ancestor of all the subsequent viruses of that type. The main pathways of emergence in humans and barriers defined are outlined in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20190017F2">figureÂ 2</xref>. Each strain exemplifies the model where virus spillover from original reservoirs (multiple monkey species) into an intermediate host (chimpanzee for the M strain, in addition to gorilla for the O strain) allowed the virus to gain several changes that allowed it to counteract or become better adapted to several host factors that would otherwise interfere with the virus infection, replication and/or release. The transfer to humans of the M strain was also associated with efficient cell infection, replication and transmission. Similarly, the transfer of the ancestor of the O strain from chimpanzees into gorillas appears to have allowed some additional adaptation, after which the virus transferred to humans. The genetic changes and sequence combinations that allowed successful replication and spread in humans were acquired by complex combinations of recombination, gene rearrangement and acquisition, and point mutations as outlined below. It is assumed that the genetic variation derives from the error- and recombination-prone natures of the viral reverse transcriptase and of the RNA polymerase that produces the viral RNA from the integrated cDNA.
