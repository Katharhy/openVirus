<p>The ancestral viruses that eventually gave rise to HIV were common and well-established simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) in old world monkeys and hominoids, which have been infecting those animals for millions of years and are now mostly associated with little or no disease [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. There have been at least four strains of HIV-1 identified, that each represents a single transfer from either chimpanzees (M and N strains from the SIVcpz) or from gorillas (O and P strains from SIVgor [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]); the M (major) strain is the pandemic strain and responsible for greater than 98% of human infections [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. There appear to be many strains of SIV in old world monkeys and the SIVcpz viruses in chimpanzees arose from an ancestral virus that included portions of three different SIVsâ€”from an SIV of an unknown host, an SIV of greater spot-nosed, Mona and mustached monkeys and an SIV from sooty mangabey [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although it is clear that all SIVcpz strains were derived from one common ancestor that contained sequences derived from SIVs from several other species, it is not clear whether that ancestor emerged in chimpanzees, in a previous simian host, or through some combination of co-infections. This virus eventually gave rise to the M and N strains that infected humans, and it also infected gorillas and, in gorillas gave rise to the HIV-1 O and P strains, that were then transmitted to humans. The HIV-1 M strain has caused the global pandemic, while the O strain has caused infection in hundreds of thousands of humans in Central Africa. Other spillovers of lentiviruses from other primates are named HIV-2, and those infect fewer individuals in limited outbreaks. This complex genetic background of HIV shows that the emergence of broadly sustained epidemic or pandemic primate lentiviruses in humans is a difficult process, that only the M and O strains have accomplished.
