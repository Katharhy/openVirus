<p>Beyond the initial spillover infection, there is likely a second level of adaptation that is required to spread efficiently and cause an epidemic or pandemic. This review addresses both steps leading to successful emergence by outlining the host and viral factors that were associated with the emergence of three different viruses which have given rise to pandemics in new hosts. Those include an enveloped negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus (IAV), an enveloped RNA-genome retrovirus that replicates through a DNA intermediate (HIV) and a non-enveloped small single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) virus that replicates using host DNA polymerases (canine parvovirus (CPV)). Despite their different structures and replication strategies, each of those emerging viruses had to overcome common barriers to efficiently replicate and transmit in their new hosts, so that they illuminate the common, as well as the virus-unique, processes involved. Because of the limited space and the vast literatures that describe many of these viruses and their properties, we largely reference selected recent reviews; many specific references are contained within those reviews.</p>
