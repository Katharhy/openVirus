<p>Humans and other animals are constantly exposed to viruses shed from other animals, yet the vast majority of virus exposures never result in any detectable infection in humans [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For example, humans are frequently exposed to viruses of domesticated animals and to those of animals that live in our environmentâ€”but most never cause infections. Those exposures may be increasing due to anthopogenic effects (including but not limited to habitat destruction or climate change). Even for many known zoonotic viruses, it is likely that hundreds or even thousands of people are exposed for every person who is infected and who develops detectable disease. It is not always clear where the block to infection occurs, but some of the different possible barriers that viruses may encounter and overcome have been reviewed in [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, it is clear that infection may be blocked at one or more steps in the infection process, including physical barriers, mucus of several types, ciliary and other clearance processes, natural antibodies to some viral glycoproteins or other viral components, innate immune responses that block virus establishment and infection, replication or shedding.
