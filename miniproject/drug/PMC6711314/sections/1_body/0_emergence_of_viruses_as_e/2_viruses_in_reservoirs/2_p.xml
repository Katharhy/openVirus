<p>Recent virus discovery projects using various deep sequencing approaches have revealed a large number of distinct viruses and virus-associated sequences in animals of all types, including vertebrates and invertebrates, and there are likely millions of viruses in mammals and birds (e.g. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]). Most animal viruses appear to have defined host ranges, circulating and maintaining themselves among a specific group of animal hosts in established relationships. Spillovers occur when viruses infect hosts in which they are not commonly found, and most often involve the infection of single animal species with limited (or no) transmission to additional animals of the same species [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the true host ranges (i.e. the animal species that are naturally infected and which can sustain transmission) and onward transmission potentials of many viruses are still poorly defined, because in the past, we did not sample to detect mild or subclinical infections, which appear to be quite common. In addition, our current understanding of the true natural host ranges of most viruses is likely incomplete due to the limited exposure of many animals which are geographically or ecologically isolated from the reservoir species in which the virus naturally circulates.
