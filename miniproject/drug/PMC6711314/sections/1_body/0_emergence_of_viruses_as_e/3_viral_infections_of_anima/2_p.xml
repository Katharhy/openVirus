<p>While disease ecologists have debated the best definition of a reservoir, one useful definition is an animal population that can maintain a virus in circulation and which may transmit to a target species such as humans [

 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, it is still notoriously difficult to identify true reservoirs in natural systems, and furthermore, our knowledge of the viruses infecting different animal species and populations has been changing rapidly in recent years, but we have little information about the likelihood of human infection for most viruses of animals. Before the advent of high-throughput sequencing techniques, most viruses were known due to their associations with disease or as a result of isolations in laboratory culture. More recently, unbiased metagenomic analysis of animal-associated samples, including tissues and faeces, has resulted in the discovery of many more viruses based on finding their nucleic acid sequences [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Most of the viruses now being identified likely have low or no pathogenicity in their natural hosts and are of unknown risk to humans. However, we have clear examples from a number of examples of viruses that cause little disease in their reservoirs but which are highly pathogenic when transferred to new hosts, causing serious disease outbreaks. Among the known emerged viruses in humans, this appears to be true for Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses, Nipah virus, Hendra virus and avian influenza A viruses (IAV). In addition to emergence in humans, there are many cases of viruses transferring between animals to cause outbreaks or epidemics in new hosts. Some human viruses can also be transferred to animals (as reverse zoonoses) to cause outbreaks directly, or to recombine or re-assort with sequences from other viruses of those animals to introduce altered host range properties—this has been commonly observed for IAVs [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], as well as for metapneumovirus [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Some animals can be infected simultaneously by different viruses from humans and other animals, allowing recombination or reassortment, and those animals may therefore sometimes be referred to as ‘mixing vessels’ [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190017C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Those resulting viruses may have new host range, antigenic or transmission properties compared to either of their parental strains.
