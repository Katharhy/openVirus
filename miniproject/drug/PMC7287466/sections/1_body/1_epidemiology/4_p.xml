<p id="p0060">MERS-CoV neurological symptoms are likely to present in 1 out of every 5 MERS-CoV cases before or after the viral confirmation 
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In one of the first retrospective studies assessing the intensive care unit (ICU) MERS-CoV cases, severe neurological syndrome with fluctuating rates of altered consciousness, ataxia, localized motor disturbances, and hyperintense lesions bilaterally was observed among MERS-CoV confirmed cases 
 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Nevertheless, the resulting small retrospective research showed more than 25% of MERS cases to present with confusion and more than 8% with seizure presentation 
 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Neurological pathologies secondary to MERS treatment abundantly observed 
 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Similar to SARS-CoV, the MERS-CoV infection exhibits systemic complications, and CNS involvement appears to be another target
