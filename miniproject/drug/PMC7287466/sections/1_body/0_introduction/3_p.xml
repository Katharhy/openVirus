<p id="p0030">The coronaviruses (CoVs) were recognized 60 years ago and are associated with human and diverse animal infections. They acquired the name due to unique presentation of virions under electron microscopy, which manifests a fringe of extensive, bulbous covering prominences forming a model implicative of the solar corona. Further, CoVs considered clinically inconsequential until the emerging of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the most recent COVID-19. However, family Coronaviridae in which CoVs apply, befall in the order Nidovirales, which extra redivided into three genera, namely alpha, beta, and gamma; moreover, CoVs are single-strand RNA genome of relatively 30 kb, enveloped, round, with a diameter of approximately 120 nm

The normal human CoVs Betacoronavirus HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, as well as Alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E, causative agents of common colds in pediatrics and geriatrics and Alphacoronavirus HCoV-NL63 the causative agent of pediatrics bronchiolitis, furthermore, for the past 18 years, 3 emerging CoVs (ECoVs), the Betacoronavirus affecting animals have emerged and provoked epidemics in humans, namely, SARS CoV in 2002 (in the subgenus Sarbecovirus), and MERS-CoV in 2012 (under the subgenus Merbecovirus) and SARS-CoV-2, subfamily
