<p id="p0025">The emergence of an infectious disorder usually involves multiple factors, for instance, vectors' ecological remodelings, micro-organisms genomic material mutation, weather modification, natural calamities, and anti-microbial usage 
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Furthermore, emerging viruses (EV) appear when individuals traverse new boundaries and become jeopardized to infection, EV transmitted to humans from distinct species where they happened to be typically benign. Further, the mammalian host often is an intermediate transmission agent 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Additionally, EV diseases are extraordinarily infectious and proficient of inducing epidemics as evidenced by outbreaks of Filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) virus in 1967 and 1976 respectively, Paramyxoviruses (Hendra and Nipah) virus 1994 and 1998 sequentially, and CoV: coronaviruses (SARS-CoV: severe acute respiratory syndrome, MERS-CoV: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and SARS-CoV-2) in 2003, 2012 and 2019 successively
