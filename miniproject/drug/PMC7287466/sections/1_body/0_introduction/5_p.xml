<p id="p0040">Even though CoVs commonly recognized for inducing respiratory ailments, both clinical and experimental research types have illustrated their solid tropism towards the neurological system, with inherent neuropathological outcomes in genetically or susceptible cases, with or without supplementary environmental outrages. The evidence supporting pathogenesis is still unclear, hence understanding the mechanisms and the outcomes of CoV interactions with the neurological system is fundamental to appreciate likely pathological outgrowths fully

However, there is actual proof that human respiratory CoVs can manifest with extra respiratory manifestations, including neuroinvasive features; indeed, SARS-CoV, the OC43 CoV, and 229E CoV detected in the brain tissues of autopsied SARS cases and multiple sclerosis cases
