<p id="par0115">Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) have been developed for the treatment of various cancers including renal cancer. The drugs decrease the effects of endothelin peptide isoform 1 (ET-1), which increases human tumor growth via activation of epidermal growth factor receptor, and direct angiogenic effects on endothelial cells through autocrine and paracrine pathways. In this way, ERAs have been shown to be effective cancer therapeutics

 <sub>A</sub> and ET
 <sub>B</sub> G protein-coupled receptors, inducing sodium retention, inflammation, and fibrosis

 <sub>A</sub> receptor antagonists such as ERAs have been shown to be promising agents in the treatment of chronic kidney disease as well
