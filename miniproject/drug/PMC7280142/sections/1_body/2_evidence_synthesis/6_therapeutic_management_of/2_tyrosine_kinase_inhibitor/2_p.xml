<p id="par0100">A majority of cases with RCC are associated with the gene inactivation of von Hippel-Lindau, which normally regulates the levels of hypoxia-inducible factors. With the inactivation of this gene, the result is a subsequent downstream upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factors, which then causes angiogenesis and proliferation, mostly through the activation of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 
 <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Antiangiogenesis treatment of RCC includes the use of monoclonal antibodies that bind and deplete VEGF ligand, or bind to the VEGFR and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that block the intracellular domain of VEGFR. TKIs, specifically sunitinib and paxopanib, were first to be approved for frontline treatment of metastatic RCC (mRCC)
