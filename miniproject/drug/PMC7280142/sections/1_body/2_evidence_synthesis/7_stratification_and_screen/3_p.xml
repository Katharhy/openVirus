<p id="par0125">Evidence on SARS-CoV-2 assessment suggests that urine contains almost no detectable COVID-19 viral RNA load, and only a small amount of viral RNA copies are present in blood (current tool of diagnosis is a nasopharyngeal swab followed by a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) 
 <xref rid="bib0360" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. However, elevated serum creatinine, BUN, and hematuria shown during hospitalization of COVID-19 patients are associated with higher mortality, pointing to an indirect mechanism of kidney damage in COVID-19–infected patients 
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This evidence supports that liquid biopsy–assisted stratification and screening of COVID-19 patients with pre-existing RCC must focus on monitoring RCC biomarkers before and after COVID-19 infection.
