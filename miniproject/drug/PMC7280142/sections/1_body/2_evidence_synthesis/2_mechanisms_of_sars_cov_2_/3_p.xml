<p id="par0030">Structural Spike (S) proteins drive the entry of the CoVs SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 into target host cells by engaging the cellular receptor ACE2. Analogous to SAR-CoV infection, interaction of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 with cellular ACE2 facilitates the attachment of the virus to target cells 
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. This step is also functionally associated with the activation of cellular TMPRSS2, a type-II transmembrane serine protease that drives the entry of virus into the target cell and is regulated by androgens (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). SARS-CoV infection is dependent on the proteolytic activity of TMPRSS2 and results in cleavage of SARS S protein at multiple sites 
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Proteolytic cleavage of SARS S protein by TMPRSS2, known as S priming, mediates efficient virus-host cell fusion and decreases virus sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies
