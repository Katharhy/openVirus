<p id="par0025">The novel zoonotic coronavirus (CoV) SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the subfamily Coronavirinae and genus 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>. The 30 kb genome of SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded positive-strand RNA (+ssRNA; 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). Sixteen nonstructural proteins (NSPs; NSP1–16) derived from pp1a/pp1ab play specific roles in the replication of CoVs and in the formation of replication-transcription complex that facilitates synthesis of minus-strand messenger RNA called subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs; 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). While NSPs are conserved among CoVs, there is diversity between structural proteins of CoVs, implicating their functional contribution to the infectivity, adaptation, and transmission. Based on phylogenetic and genomic analysis of the 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> clusters, the SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the β-coronaviruses bat‐SL‐CoV ZC45 and bat‐SL‐CoV ZXC2, and can cause infection of lower respiratory track and pneumonia in humans.
