<p id="par0040">Both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are coexpressed on ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes, epithelia of small intestine, and podocytes and the border of proximal tubule cells of the kidney, thus making these organ sites easy routes for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection 
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In particular, ACE2 expression is higher in the kidneys than in any other organ, with potentially 100 times higher expression than in the lungs 
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Podocytes and proximal straight tubule cells of the kidney share similar homology and have highly enriched signatures for kidney diseaseâ€“related signaling pathways 
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. It is therefore of critical importance to investigate the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on patients with prior kidney issues as well as assess the potential risk of developing kidney injury once infected with COVID-19.
