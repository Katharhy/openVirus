<p id="par0035">The ACE2 enzyme plays an important role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), as it counteracts the effects of angiotensin (Ang) II, a vasoactive peptide responsible for vasoconstriction and aldosterone release systemically. Ang I is converted to Ang II by ACE. However, ACE2 depletes Ang I and II levels by directly catalyzing the compounds and converting Ang I to Ang 1–9 and Ang II to Ang 1–7, known vasodilators acting through receptor Mas (MasR) with antifibrotic, antiproliferative, and anti-inflammatory effects

 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis), which block the conversion of Ang I to Ang II, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which block the downstream interaction of Ang II with the Ang II type I (AT
 <sub>1</sub>) receptor, are used to treat hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases 
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. While these treatments do not directly modulate ACE2, they cause an increase in ACE2 expression 
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Other medications, such as thiazolidinediones and ibuprofen, are speculated to increase ACE2 levels also 
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Further, ACE2 levels are elevated in patients with multiple cardiovascular conditions, diabetes, and hypertension, those who are at a greater risk of mortality in COVID-19
