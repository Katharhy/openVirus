 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> studied a single HD center in Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University. The authors found that 37 of 230 patients on HD and four of 33 staff members developed infections in a 1-mo span from mid-January to -February. Patients on HD with COVID-19 had less lymphopenia, lower serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, and milder clinical disease than other patients with COVID-19 infection. Although six patients on HD died from the CoV infection, the presumed causes of death were not related to pneumonia but rather to cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular issues, and hyperkalemia
