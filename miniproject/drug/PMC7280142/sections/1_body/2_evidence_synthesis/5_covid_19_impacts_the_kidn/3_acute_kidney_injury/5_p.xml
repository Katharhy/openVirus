 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Clinically, proteinuria in a large number of patients can be caused by virus-inducted cytopathic effect on podocytes, as podocyte injury induces heavy proteinuria 
 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Increased creatinine levels could also indicate indirect effects on renal function caused by the virus, such as hypoxia, shock, and rhabdomyolysis

 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Specifically, the effects of CoV-infected ACE2 can cause kidney damage through a heightened inflammatory response by depleting Ang 1–7 and Ang 1–9 levels. A systemic cytokine storm–induced inflammatory response can also cause multiple organ damage 
 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. It is unlikely that kidney injury arises from deposition of immune complex of viral antigen or virus-induced specific immunological effector mechanisms because glomeruli microscopy imaging has appeared normal in COVID-19 patients
