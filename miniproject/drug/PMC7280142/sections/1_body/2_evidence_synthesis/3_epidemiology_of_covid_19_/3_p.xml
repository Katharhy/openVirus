<p id="par0050">To reduce cancer patients’ risk of exposure, difficult clinical decisions have to be made by physicians about for whom, how, and when to provide cancer treatment and follow-up care 
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, delays in cancer management might lead to missed opportunities for curative treatment and increased risks of cancer progression to metastasis, anxiety, and stress. For patients experiencing metastatic or recurrent cancer, considerations should include how such delays may lead to immediate need for hospital-based palliative care and symptom management 
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. For patients receiving treatment with chemotherapy or immunotherapy, or those who have undergone recent surgery, the risks are even higher because of the reduced immune system function. Reinforcement of the strict “stay at home” policy, although efficient in reducing the risk of exposure and contamination, is likely to increase patient clinical care (eg, managing disease and comorbidities), financial (eg, loss of job and medical insurance), and psychosocial (eg, social isolation, fear of contamination, stress, and anxiety) needs, thus worsening the quality of life and emotional well-being in a population already burdened by cancer and treatment impact.
