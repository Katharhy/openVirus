<p id="par0130">For several of the patients with renal disease and AKI, treatment course proceeds similarly to that of most COVID-19 cases, although we are following a learning curve. General management including quarantining, use of protective personal equipment, nutritional and fluid support, ICU admission when necessary, and other treatments for complications are essential for all cases. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has been shown to be effective in those with renal issues as well as other patients for SARS, MERS, and sepsis
