    <td align="left">Surgical patient triage</td>
    <td align="left">Depending on local transmission patterns and hospital needs, lower-risk kidney tumors should be postponed, while larger and aggressive tumors should be treated as the risk of progression must be weighed against the risks of COVID-19.</td>

    <td align="left">COVID-19 testing</td>
    <td align="left">All patients planning to undergo surgery for kidney cancer should be tested prior to surgery, depending on local community access to testing.</td>

   <tr>
    <td align="left">COVID-19â€“positive patients</td>
    <td align="left">If the patient is COVID-19 positive, every effort should be made to delay surgery until full recovery of the patient and viral shedding risk is reduced.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="left">Operating room personnel</td>
    <td align="left">Limit personnel in the operating room during surgery, allowing only essential personnel, and limit traffic in and out of rooms.</td>

    <td align="left">PPE is mandatory and should include N-95 masks to mitigate transmission risk.</td>

   <tr>
    <td align="left">Operating room risk reduction</td>
    <td align="left">Efforts should be made to reduce transmission during intubation and extubation, with only ESSENTIAL personnel present during these times. In addition, surgical transmission via surgical plume should be reduced by lowering cautery settings, application time, and total duration of tissue desiccation.</td>

   <tr>
    <td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="2">Special considerations for minimally invasive surgery</td>
    <td align="left">During minimally invasive surgery, CO
     <sub>2</sub> pressure should be maintained as low as safely possible, and gas leak or release from ports during surgery should be minimized. Every effort should be made to suction any residual CO
     <sub>2</sub> at the end of procedure prior to tumor extraction.
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="left">A closed insufflation system should be used to reduce escape of CO
     <sub>2</sub> into the OR. Filters vary in size; the smallest filter available should be implemented to the suction system.
