<p id="par0045">Mainly, the SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for bilateral interstitial pneumonia with DAD and primary pulmonary hypertension from direct alveolar and endothelial damage. The morphological changes are represented in the first phase by an interstitial inflammatory infiltrate, diffuse vascular congestion, edema, and subsequently from proteinaceous edema with or without hyaline membranes lining alveolar walls, inflammatory mononuclear infiltrate with multinucleated giant cells, exfoliation to also intra-alveolar granulocyte inflammation and position of fibrinoid material which are the true signs of direct damage. The foci of reactive alveolar epithelial hyperplasia, fibroblastic proliferation with fibrosis, and of alveolar rupture are present as a consequence [

These changes in the parenchyma induce primary pulmonary hypertension due to an increase in lung resistance and overload of the right and left circulation. The clinical manifestation is characterized by systemic hypertension and ventricular hypertrophy, as it happens in all lung diseases from direct damage with increased of resistance.
