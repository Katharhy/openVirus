<p id="par0060">Only a few cases with myocarditis and pericarditis involvement were reported, without consistent histological evidence [
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It is clear that in a condition of myocarditis during COVID-19, with inflammatory infiltrate and myocardial necrosis according to Dallas criteria [
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death can occur as occurs in enterovirus or adenovirus myocarditis due to an exuberant inflammatory response in subjects without pre-existing diseases. Only one case of cardiac tamponade in a 47-year-old man SARS-CoV-2 infected without cardiovascular risk is reported in the literature as a complication of myocarditis and pericarditis [
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The causes of hydropericardium and cardiac tamponade also include infectious and inflammatory causes (15 %) and mechanical complications of myocardial infarction (12 %) [
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our autoptic experience leads us to some considerations. Myocarditis is a cause of sudden death in children and in young adults with undiagnosed or underestimated viral infections [
 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Patients who died for complications of COVID-19 are old and have often comorbidity due to cardiovascular diseases. We can, therefore, hypothesize that myocarditis with the presence of inflammatory infiltrates in the myocardial interstitium and with the structural damage validated by the laboratory markers of damage and cardiac necrosis, can be a secondary complication of the immune response and not of the direct action of the virus on cardiomyocytes. To date is not evidence of RNA coronaviruses in the heart. Considering the reported presence of ACE2 in different cell types and also in the heart [
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], we can only hypothesize a hematogenous diffusion of the pathogen and a similar interaction as happens in the lung; the hypothesis remains that the SARS-CoV-2 action on the heart in old people is mediated by systemic imbalance caused by the alteration of the functioning of the RAAS on comorbidity background.
