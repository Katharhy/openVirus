Large and more recent studies have reported that previous myocardial infarction, diabetes, dyslipidaemias, hypertension, and other cardiovascular risk factors can predispose to an acute ischemic event in respiratory virus infections such as recently reported during the pandemic COVID-19 [

The results of the study showed that out of 416 hospitalized patients, 19.7 % had heart damage, and, compared to patients without heart damage, these patients were older with comorbidity, leukocytosis, high sensitivity troponin I increase regardless of abnormalities in electrocardiography and echocardiography. The study demonstrated that cardiac injury and mortality in patients with COVID-19 were significantly associated [
