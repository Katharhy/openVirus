<p id="par0080">It is crucial to emphasize that in this context, only biopsy and autopsy studies could provide information to understand the disease. Acute myocardial infarction has been indicated as a complication, as well as laboratory parameters reported as the increase in cardiac troponin. The clinical data do not explain the type of heart damage. The increase in cardiac troponin is a marker of myocardial damage without distinguishing between necrosis and apoptosis. The identification of histological features could certainly be useful. We believe that it is fundamental to be able to distinguish in the heart between necrosis from hypoxic, ischemic damage, myocarditis and direct virus damage, or other cardiomyopathies responsible for heart failure and sudden death. There is currently no evidence of the presence of CoV-19 in human myocardiocytes with the PCR method. Some autopsies were performed on old subjects (&gt; 60 years old) and the morphological data highlighted the presence of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, degeneration, and necrosis of some cardiomyocytes, mild hyperemia and edema of the interstitial cells and infiltration of a small amount of lymphocytes CD4+, macrophages neutrophils but no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in tissue [
