<p id="par0055">Some authors have paid attention to surface structural proteins and non-structural proteins of CoV-19 not only in the mechanism of integration into the host cell but also indicated inhibition of the normal metabolic pathway of heme with competition mechanism for the binding of porphyrin to iron. Heme is the degradation product of hemoglobin through the link with porphyrin [
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This mechanism is not yet clear, but it explains the finding of the virus also in biological liquids such as urine, saliva, feces, and blood. The reported data requires clinical and experimental demonstration. ACE2 is the putative receptor of SARS viruses which is present mainly in the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory district, in pulmonary endothelium and pulmonary alveolar pneumocytes, but also present in other cell types in different organs as heart and kidneys [
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It is possible to hypothesize direct cardiac damage mediated by the interaction of the virus with ACE2 or much more reasonably mediated by the imbalance caused by the alteration of the functioning of the RAAS. Based on these considerations, it is difficult to distinguish between death from direct cardiac or systemic vascular damage induced by SARS-CoV-2 in patients without comorbidity and death in patients with previous cardiovascular disease. Because the pandemic infection broke out in a very short time, there are no large autopsy studies able to shed light on the real damage to the cardiovascular system in subjects who died from COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Can SARS-CoV-2 induce new heart conditions or can it only exacerbate pre-existing cardiovascular diseases? We believe that attention must be paid to three fundamental entities that can cause sudden death in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2: myocarditis, coronary syndrome, thromboembolism.
