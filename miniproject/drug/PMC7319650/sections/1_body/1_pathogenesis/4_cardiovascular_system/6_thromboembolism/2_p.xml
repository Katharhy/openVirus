<p id="par0085">It is known that patients with cardiovascular disease have a higher risk of a thrombo-embolic event as it is known that all viral infections have a potential role in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) The endothelial damage, the blood flow turbulence, and hypercoagulability are the basis of the mechanism. Some clinical studies have highlighted that SARS-CoV-2 positive and symptomatic patients have more thrombus-embolic and DIC risk. There is evidence for abnormal coagulation parameters with significantly higher levels of D-dimer and fibrin degradation, longer prothrombin times, and activated partial thromboplastin time in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 and non-survivors; DIC diagnosis was performed according to clinical and laboratory criteria [

 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>]. The greatest incidence of an adverse event is however detected in patients with underlying diseases including cardiovascular disease. Vascular inflammation and hemodynamic instability can contribute to the hypercoagulable state and endothelial dysfunction resulting in thromboembolism or DIC in patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases. Also, in this case the literature is deficient in the morphological data that could be taken from an autopsy case study.
