<p id="par0165">The absence of important predisposing factors in COVID-19 pneumonia seems to confirm the role of serious infections as a precipitating factor for acute thromboembolism and heart failure through the inflammatory state and dysregulation of the immune response. The presence of cardiovascular comorbidities seems to aggravate the prognosis until death by myocarditis, coronary syndromes, and diffuse thromboembolism or DIC. No large autopsy studies able to shed light on the real damage to the cardiovascular system in subjects who died from COVID-19 and our autoptic experience suggests that the autopsy exam is very important [

The role of anticoagulants can be useful especially in people with cardiovascular disease. HQC therapy appears to be effective and the risks for cardiovascular complications are related to the long-term cumulative dose.
