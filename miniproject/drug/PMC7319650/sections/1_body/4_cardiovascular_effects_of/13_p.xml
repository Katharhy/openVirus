<p id="par0155">The scenario is very confusing regarding anti-RAS and ACE inhibitors, but even more so regarding the use of statins. As the mechanisms of the inflammatory and immune response are still unclear and even less so if blood sugar can alter virulence or if the virus interferes with insulin secretion, there is little data on the development of acute diabetes complications in patients with Sars-CoV-2 disease. Statins inhibit the synthesis of endogenous cholesterol by acting on the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase. Cholesterol plays important role in the entry of viruses into cells and statins are reported to block the infection of many enveloped viruses by inhibiting the cholesterol pathway [
