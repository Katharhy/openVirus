<p id="par0130">Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was originally developed and used for the treatment of malaria and it is increasingly used in the management of a variety of autoimmune disorders, with well-established roles in dermatology and rheumatology and emerging roles in oncology [

 <xref rid="bib0315" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. HCQ is a modulator of the immune response through several mechanisms. HCQ inhibits the toll-like receptors 7 and 9 in dendritic cells, inhibiting the production of interferon-alpha, counteracts the effect of extracellular oxidants, and stops the signaling of T cell receptor-dependent calcium within T cells and hence antigen processing. It also induces apoptosis and interferes with lysosomal function, influencing the processing of antigenic peptides necessary to trigger autoimmune responses [
