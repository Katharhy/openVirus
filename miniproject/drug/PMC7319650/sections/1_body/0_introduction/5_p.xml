From the literature, it emerges that many deceased patients are old, with oncological, immunological, or dysfunctional systemic diseases linked to the cardiovascular system; it also emerges that multi-organ complications take place in the lung infection, including cardiovascular complications especially that often constitute the real cause of death. This scenario is a survival challenge for patients and a challenge for all those who work to find the right therapy and prevent the unfortunate event of death. Here, we examine pathophysiological effects of SARS-CoV-2, on the cardiovascular system as well as drug mechanisms with side effects on cardiovascular complications.
