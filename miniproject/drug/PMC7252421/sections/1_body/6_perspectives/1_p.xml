<p id="Par27">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic after an outbreak of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus occurred in Wuhan, China. Meanwhile it has spread throughout the world and is associated with mortality rates between 1 to about 5%. Cardiovascular disease is an important risk indicator for adverse outcomes and COVID-19 might affect the cardiovascular system directly. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been shown to be a coreceptor for viral entry downregulating ACE2 with cardiovascular consequences. Cardiovascular disease with dyspnea as a prime symptom like in heart failure, myocardial ischemia or hypertensive emergency is an important differential diagnosis, should not be ignored in COVID-19 and needs to be recognized as an important indicator of poor outcome. While there is no evidence for changing cardiovascular therapy, a complete cardiovascular workup is necessary in COVID-19 patients and, in particular, in patients with cardio-respiratory symptoms and even in acute respiratory distress syndrome. In turn, cardiopulmonary symptoms should not distract physicians from an unbiased work-up of cardiovascular conditions as these patients could suffer from life-threatening cardiovascular conditions in the absence of COVID-19. Healthcare providers in high, middle and low income countries need to be aware of the importance of cardiovascular disease in patients with SARS and COVID-19 infections by providing optimal cardiovascular care.</p>
