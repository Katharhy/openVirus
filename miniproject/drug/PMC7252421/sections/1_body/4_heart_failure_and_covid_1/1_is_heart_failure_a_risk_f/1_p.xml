<p id="Par22">It has long been known that patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) are at increased risk for adverse consequences of seasonal influenza [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>] and other causes of pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. Conversely, infections and in particular pneumonia are frequent triggers of heart failure exacerbations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Of note, influenza vaccination decreases mortality in CHF patients and the beneficial effects of repetitive influenza vaccinations may even exceed those of guideline-directed pharmacotherapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Severe coronavirus infections such as with SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to result in a more severe course of disease in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease, including heart failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Thus it is not surprising that COVID-19 is associated with higher morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. Yet, likely due to the lower prevalence of (known) CHF in China, there is still limited specific information on patients with preexisting heart failure. Nevertheless, some early reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] indicate that COVID-19 associated myocardial injury (s. below) is more frequent in patients with heart failure and other cardiovascular comorbidities.
