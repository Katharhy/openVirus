<p id="Par23">Up to 30% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] reveal elevated troponin levels as a marker of myocardial injury. While the precise mechanisms for myocardial necrosis in the context of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown (s. below), troponin elevations are potent predictors of an adverse outcome. Shi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] reported that increased troponin levels were associated with a higher likelihood for mechanical ventilation, development of ARDS and acute kidney failure. Remarkably, 42 of 82 patients with myocardial injury died (51.2%), whereas only 15 of 334 troponin negative patients had a lethal outcome. Similarly, Guo et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] showed that an elevated troponin predicted ARDS, ventricular arrhythmias such as VTs VFib and death. Interestingly, a continuous increase in NT-proBNP and troponin T and was observed in those patients that ultimately died, while survivors revealed constant levels. Of note, troponin elevations appear to be more predictive of prognosis than the presence of comorbidities as patients with higher troponin levels but without preexisting cardiovascular or pulmonary disease have a significantly worse prognosis than troponin negative patients with cardiovascular comorbidities (Guo). It seems likely that myocardial injury is not only a marker of an adverse outcome but also a direct cause. This notion is supported by data that show that COVID-19 non-survivors frequently develop heart failure (52%) and shock (70%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Similarly, Ruan et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] reported that in 68 patients who died of COVID-19, myocardial dysfunction was the sole or a contributing factor for death in 40% of the cases.
