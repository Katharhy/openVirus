<p id="Par26">Multiple clinical trials are underway which test antiviral agents potentially effective against SARS-CoV-2, such as remdesivir and several antivirals previously shown to be effective eg in HIV infections (reviewed in [

As myocardial injury is associated with a dramatically worsened outcome in COVID-19, the question arises whether therapy should also be specifically aimed at the prevention of myocardial damage and/or hyperinflammation. Indeed, the limited experience with inhibition of the cytokine storm by immunosuppression points towards this possibility. For example, interleukin-1 blockade by anakinra has been shown to reduce mortality in sepsis with hyperinflammation [

Finally, it has even been proposed that angiotensin receptors blockers eg. losartan may not only be not harmful (s. above) in COVID-19, but in fact beneficial as they upregulate ACE2, which could ameriolate tissue damage due to SARS-CoV-2 [
