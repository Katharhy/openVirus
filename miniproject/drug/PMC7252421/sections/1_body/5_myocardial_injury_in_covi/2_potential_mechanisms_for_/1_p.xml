<p id="Par24">An obvious reason for an elevated troponin level could be acute coronary syndrome that obviously may also occur in COVID-19 patients, and which is likely to be underdiagnosed due to reluctance for invasive management (s. above). However, the high proportion of typically rather moderately increased high sensitive troponin levels in hospitalized COVID-19 patients renders other explanations more likely, including acute myocarditis due to SARS-CoV-2 or myocardial damage due to proinflammatory cytokines (“cytokine storm”). ACE2 as a potential receptor for Coronavirus infection (s. above) is highly expressed in cardiomyocytes and in vascular pericytes [

Thus, it seems plausible that SARS-CoV-2 may directly cause viral myocarditis with associated cell death and subsequent myocardial injury as measured by increased troponin levels. Indeed, the first still anecdotal autopsy and endomyocardial biopsy reports describe evidence for an acute lymphocytic myocarditis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. However, the SARS-CoV-2 genome could not be detected in the myocardium of several of these early cases, indicating that other mechanisms of myocardial injury must be involved, at least in a subset of patients with myocardial injury.
