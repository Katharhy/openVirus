<p id="Par25">Another attractive hypothesis how myocardial injury in the context of COVID-19 may be explained is a hyperinflammatory state where dysregulated cytokines mediate cardiomyocyte stress and ultimately cell death. Such a “cytokine storm” is a well-known [

Its clinical characteristics include multiorgan failure associated with persistent fever and lymphopenia as well as high levels of ferritin and several cytokines such as interleukin-6. For example, elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels closely correlate with mortality in sepsis and IL-6 has been shown to directly impair contractile function of cardiomyocytes [
