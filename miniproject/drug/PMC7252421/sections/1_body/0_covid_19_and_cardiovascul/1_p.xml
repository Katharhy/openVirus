<p id="Par2">After the first cases of respiratory illness were reported in December 2019, a novel coronavirus, designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified to cause the so-called coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which meanwhile has become a worldwide pandemic [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In general, three distinct phases characterize progression of COVID-19: an initial infection phase followed by a respiratory distress phase and finally culminating in a severe hyperinflammation state with more than 80% of SARS-CoV-2 infections showing only mild or even absent symptoms [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] provided important lessons with respect to cardiovascular involvements both as a primary target as well as a comorbidity. The infection phase marks virus infiltration and proliferation of the epithelium and lung parenchyma accompanied by mild symptoms and monocyte / macrophage activation as the initial immune response. The ensuing inflammatory processes like vasodilation, endothelial leakiness and leukocyte extravasation lead to pulmonary distress with pulmonary damage, fluid extravasation and hypoxemia, which in turn augments cardiovascular stress. Finally, further amplification of the host inflammatory response will essentially culminate in systemic inflammation up to eliciting a cytokine storm [
