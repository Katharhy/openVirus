<p id="Par3">Importantly, the cardiovascular system emerges as both a primary target as well as the most important secondary co-morbidity factor during all three of the COVID-19 progression phases (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). There is accumulating evidence that the heart itself might be a direct target for viral infection with SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Previous studies examining the cardiovascular effects of viral respiratory infections during influenza epidemics revealed a profound up to sixfold increased incidence ratio for acute myocardial infarction within 7 days of infection, in part due to the heightened prothrombotic activity leading to intracoronary thrombotic events [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Hypotension and tachycardia will further imbalance the metabolic demand of a diseased heart. Exaggerated systemic inflammation with profoundly increased circulating levels of prototypical inflammatory markers such as IL-6, IL-2, TNFalpha; MCP-1 or CRP are well established to contribute to cardiac injury irrespective of the presence of hypoxemia. Indeed, some of these biomarkers were shown to be associated with high mortality in retrospective clinical series of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], indicating potential serious bystander effects on other organs, including the heart. In support of such collateral damage to the heart, increased inflammatory markers do correlate with electrocardiographic abnormalities and biomarkers of cardiac injury [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Finally, elevation of cardiac biomarkers documenting cardiac involvement is not only a prominent feature in COVID-19, but is also associated with a profoundly worse clinical outcome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Myocardial damage and heart failure contributed to almost 40% of deaths in a critically ill cohort hospitalized in Wuhan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Cox regression analyses revealed that the mortality risk associated with acute cardiac damage was significantly higher than age, chronic pulmonary disease or prior history of cardiovascular disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, both direct and indirect mechanisms of cardiovascular injury most likely play a pivotal role for the deleterious consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in addition to the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
