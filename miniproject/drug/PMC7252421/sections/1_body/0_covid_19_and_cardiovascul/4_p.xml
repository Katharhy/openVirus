<p id="Par5">Taken together, cardiovascular involvement is both highly prevalent and of significant prognostic importance in COVID-19. Therefore, it is not only important to fully involve cardiologists for managing cardiovascular complications in severe cases of COVID-19, but also to pay particular attention to cardiovascular protection of patients at risk to develop COVID-19. It will be essential to allocate sufficient resources for cardiovascular diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, even at times when the health care systems are globally overwhelmed and hospitals are guided by measures to contain and treat this infectious disease. We need to advice patients that cardiovascular emergencies like STEMI, decompensated heart failure or life-threatening arrhythmias need immediate attention and treatment and emergency calls should not be delayed out of fear for being admitted to a hospital with the potential to acquire COVID-19. We do need to set-up emergency treatment strategies for non-COVID-19 patients in-hospital and assure protection of these patients from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Additionally, we need to make sure to that hospital staff and health care workers in general are adequately protected and diagnostic and interventional procedures in COVID-19 patients are guided by clinical necessity. Fortunately, all major cardiovascular professional societies are meanwhile in the process of publishing guidance for various aspects of cardiovascular care in COVID-19 patients, including how and in whom to perform diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Some of these guidance publications will be referenced to in the following chapters of this article. This will without any doubt lead to greater awareness of the immediate cardiovascular implications of this infectious disease.</p>
