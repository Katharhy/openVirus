<p id="Par6">Nevertheless, we should not stop here. Hospitalization for pneumonia was previously shown to be associated with a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease up to 10Â years of follow-up [

We need to monitor COVID-19 patients with acutely elevated markers of cardiac damage with respect to long-term consequences on cardiac function, including definite proof of SARS-CoV-2-induced myocarditis by myocardial biopsy. Likewise, it will be important to assess potential long-term cardiotoxic effects of antiviral therapy. Thus, cardiovascular care during the COVID-19 pandemic should already implement strategies to capture longer-term implications by prolonged clinical follow-up.
