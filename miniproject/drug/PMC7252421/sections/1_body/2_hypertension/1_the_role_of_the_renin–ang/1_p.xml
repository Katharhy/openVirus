<p id="Par9">The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) regulates blood pressure and is also involved in cardiovascular endorgan damage like myocardial hypertrophy, interstitial myocardial fibrosis, atherosclerosis and plaque rupture in acute coronary syndromes. Therefore, blockers of the RAAS are recommended for the use in hypertension to prevent cardiovascular events and heart failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The protease renin cleaves angiotensin to angiotensinogen I (Ang 1–10), which then is processed to angiotensin II (Ang 1–8) by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Angiotensin II stimulates AT1-receptors, which results in adverse cardiovascular effects like vasoconstriction, cell proliferation and hypertrophy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In contrast, the AT2-receptor mediates vasodilation, anti-proliferative actions and apoptosis and has been suggested to be involved in anti-proliferative effects upon binding of angiotensin II [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Angiotensin II [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] is cleaved by the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) into angiotensin (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23"> 23</xref>), which exerts directly a stimulation of the so called “MAS-receptor”, mediating vasodilation, anti-proliferative effects and anti-inflammatory responses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It is now well established that the CORONA virus family binds via its spike protein to ACE2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] with well characterized binding residues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. After proteolytic modification of ACE2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and the coronavirus spike protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] by a membrane-bound proteinase (ADAM17), the virus is internalized by clathrin-coated pits and, after trypsin cleavage, viral RNA is released into this cellular cytoplasm causing SARS infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. ACE2 is degraded and shedfrom the cell membrane into the circulation after cleavage by ADAM17 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. As a result, there is a downregulation of ACE2 by the CORONA virus itself [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The role of ACE2 in CORONA virus infection is scrutinized by the fact that several animals cannot be infected by the CORONA virus when there is a knockout of ACE2, which renders them resistant to infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The role of ACE2 is not specific for the CORONA virus as ACE2 is also used by the respiratory syncytial (RS) virus and some types of influenza viruses [
