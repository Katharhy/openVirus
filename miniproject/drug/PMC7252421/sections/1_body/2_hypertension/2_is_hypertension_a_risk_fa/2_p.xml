<p id="Par12">The next question arises of whether cardiac treatments and treatments with the renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi), in particular ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are associated with a differential outcome in COVID-19. The Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], but also Chinese guidelines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and Guidelines of the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] recommend ACE and ARBs for the treatment of hypertension as these drugs have been shown to be effective in secondary prevention, heart failure and protection against adverse renal outcomes. In Germany, as in other countries in Europe, the prescription rate of ACE and ARBs are higher than all prescribed daily doses of other anti-hypertensive drugs combined [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. However, adequate blood pressure control in China in the age group, where COVID-19 is most prevalent, was only 34.9–35.6% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] according to the 2010 Chinese guidelines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and 15,2–16,0% according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In particular, the frequency of ACE-inhibitor treatment is particularly low in an Asian population (in particular in females), because the ACE-induced coughing is more prevalent than in other populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Therefore, the low density of treatment with RASi does not argue in favor of a significant role of these drugs in the likelihood of COVID-19. The upregulation of ACE2 by RASi does not allow to argue in favor or against the use of RAS-inhibitors in hypertension as recently expressed in various short communications and letters causing a lot of discussion and media attention [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Although, a large body of evidence has been generated in cell models, animal models and observational studies, further data are necessary to scrutinize the definite role of ACE2 in infection frequency and causation of pulmonary complications after CORONA infections. At this moment, there is thus no compelling evidentiary background to change RASi therapy for hypertension or other cardiovascular conditions.
