<p id="Par11">Arterial hypertension is the most prevalent risk factor in cardiovascular disease, in particular in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In several early trials of COVID-19 populations, hypertension is the most prevalent cardiovascular risk factor and comorbidity is amounting to approximately 30–40% in the overall population of diseased individuals in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and Italy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In those patients, who have complications or even died, hypertension is more prevalent as was diabetes, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive lung disease or malignancies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As hypertension is the comorbidity with the highest prevalence in deceased patients, it has been claimed to be a risk factor for COVID-19. However, this would only be the case, if there is a deviation from the overall prevalence of hypertension in the Chinese population. In China, the prevalence of hypertension is high. By comparing Chinese populations age-matched to those in reports on COVID-19 (approximately 55–74 years), it becomes clear that the overall prevalence in hypertension is 44% with a further increase in populations at higher age [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Therefore, the prevalence of the comorbidity hypertension in COVID-19 patients is lower and does not exceed the overall prevalence in the relevant populations in China. Therefore, there is no evidence that hypertension increases the likelihood to suffer from COVID-19. Cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities are elevated in patients who have fatal outcomes after COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, all cardiovascular comorbidities in concert add to myocardial injury, which has been shown to be closely associated with death as measured from cardiac troponin levels [
