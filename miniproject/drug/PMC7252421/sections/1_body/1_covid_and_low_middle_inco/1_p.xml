<p id="Par7">COVID-19 has spread to almost all countries of the world. Unexplained is the different impact of the disease in different countries. There has been a slow increase in infections in Africa and South-East Asia with a surprisingly low fatality rate. 14th April 2020 South Africa had 2272 infections with 27 deaths despite a detailed surveillance system (

It is currently unknown why there has been so far a slower than expected rise in cases and case mortality in low-to-middle income countries. The population demographics and underlying co-morbidities are vastly different in those countries. The mean age of many low-to-middle income countries is more than 2 decades lower than in higher income countries. For example in Uganda the life expectancy at birth for males and females is 60 and 65 years (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.who.org</ext-link>), 48.5% of the population is in the age range of 0–14 years old with just 2% of the population being older than 60 years. This age pyramid influences the current Uganda cardiovascular health challenges which does include hypertension and coronary artery disease, mainly in urban areas, but rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and heart failure due to cardiomyopathies remain enormous challenges. Most of the patients do not have access to balloon valvotomy or surgery [

The country-by-country difference in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality could possibly be explained by national policies on Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination. BCG is a live attenuated strain derived from an isolate of myocobacterium bovis used widely across the world as a vaccine for tuberculosis, with many low-to-middle income countries but also some high-income countries such as Japan having a universal BCG vaccination policy in newborns. BCG vaccinations have been shown to produce non-specific immune effects leading to an improved response against other non-myocardial pathogens. Another possible protective mechanism could be the high number of people living with HIV/AIDS on anti-retroviral therapy. South Africa has a population of 57 million with &gt; 12% being HIV-infected. SA has the world’s largest antiretroviral therapy (ART) program, subsidized by the government and provided free-of-charge. Only time will tell if low-to middle income countries will ‘catch up’ on the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 or remain relatively spared [
