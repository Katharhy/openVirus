<p id="Par13">The cardiac manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection include acute myocardial injury, heart failure, myocarditis, and ventricular tachyarrhythmias [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Along with ARDS, acute myocardial injury was identified as an important independent predictor of outcomes, associated with a 3.4-fold higher risk of death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In a cohort of 416 hospitalized patients, the prevalence of cardiac injury-based on the presence of elevated hs-cTnI values above the 99th percentile of a healthy reference population—was 19.7%, and the risk of death increased with the magnitude of myocardial injury, expressed as multiples of the reference value of hs-TnI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Unequivocally, other cohorts investigating the prevalence and prognostic implications of myocardial injury during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, reported very similar rates of acute myocardial injury ranging between 7.2% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], 12% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], 17% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and 27.8% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] at presentation based on elevations of hs-cTn above the ULN. In a report on 138 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], patients who received care in the intensive care unit were more likely to have cardiac injury than non-ICU patients (22.2% vs 2%). ´Consistently, in another study on 41 admitted hospital patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the proportion of patients requiring care on the intensive care unit (ICU) was significantly higher among patients with evidence of acute myocardial injury (31% vs 4%). Several studies demonstrate an association between acute myocardial injury and mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In a study on 187 patients with COVID-19 that evaluated the role of hs-cTnT relative to the presence of cardiovascular disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], mortality rates were highest among patients with elevated hs-cTnT above ULN and history of cardiovascular disease and lowest among those with normal hs-cTn, irrespective the presence or absence of CV disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In a survey on 416 hospitalized patients in Wuhan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], only 26.2% of patients (22 of 82 patients) received an ECG, particularly during periods of elevation of cardiac biomarkers while imaging tests such as echocardiography were not reported. Consistently other reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] did not report on rates of ECG or other imaging tests, except lung CT, at all. Hence, the limited diagnostic workup and selection bias precludes any speculations on the etiology of hs-cTnI elevation.
