<p id="Par16">Based on findings from Corona and Influenza infections in the past, it has been speculated that acute myocardial injury might be triggered or facilitated in COVID-19 infection [

A previous study on the incidence of myocardial infarction after the outbreak of Influenza infections in Ontario reported a sixfold higher incidence ratio of AMI within 6Â days after a positive Influenza test as compared to a negative test during the same time frame [

It was hypothesized that an exaggerated inflammatory response mediated by viral infection with Influenza A or B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or other virus had the potential to trigger acute plaque rupture. In addition, anecdotal evidence from sporadic case reports raised the suspicion of acute myocarditis, although a direct SARS-CoV-2 infiltration of the heart has not been confirmed in the absence of histological confirmation by endocardial biopsy, or by detection of viral genome in myocardial tissue, yet [

Previously, a decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LV-EF) and a highly prevalent reversible, subclinical diastolic left ventricular impairment that was reported in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and was attributed to the cytokine storm syndrome that is characterized by an uncontrolled and dysfunctional immune response [
