<p id="Par14">Discordant to the recommendations of the 4th version of the universal myocardial infarction (MI) definition (UDMI) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], the investigators of the Wuhan studies used a different definition for acute myocardial injury and did not differentiate acute from chronic myocardial injury by a concentration change (“rise and/or fall”) of hs-cTnI. Acute myocardial injury was rather defined as blood levels of high sensitivity troponin T or I above the 99th percentile upper limit of normal (upper limit of normal (ULN) &gt; 28 ng/L), or new abnormalities shown on electrocardiography and echocardiography [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The investigators did not report on rates and subtypes of acute myocardial infarction based on criteria of the 4th version of the UDMI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Interestingly, hs-cTn values increased during serial monitoring in patients with a fatal outcome whereas persistently low values were observed among survivors allowing to speculate whether monitoring of hs-cTn might be useful even in the absence of a suspected acute coronary syndrome [
