<p id="Par17">Acute myocardial injury may occur independently from COVID-19 and may manifest as type 1 myocardial infarction (STEMI or NSTEMI), type 2 MI in the absence of plaque rupture or intracoronary thrombus, or as an acute myocardial injury independent of myocardial ischemia (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Cases of acute MI on autopsy during hospitalization for COVID-19 have been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] but a systematic evaluation is lacking. Given the paucity of data on the exact prevalence and reasons for an acute myocardial injury during COVID-19, our interpretation of hs-cTn elevations has to be discussed on knowledge previously derived from other acute critical conditions, foremost severe infections causing sepsis or septic shock [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. In an investigation on hs-cTnT in setting of severe infection, median concentrations of hs-cTnT were found to increase from 14.4 ng/L in sepsis to 52.6 ng/L in severe sepsis and 64.1 ng/L in septic shock [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Likewise, the prevalence of hs-cTnT &gt; ULN increased from 51.6% in sepsis to 80.4% % in septic shock [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Very similar to COVID-19, mild elevations of hs-cTnT were associated with a high mortality rate at 30 days [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. However, the risk associated with myocardial injury at baseline persisted over 5 years after the index event suggesting a major prognostic role of pre-existing structural heart disease on long-term outcomes. Similar to SARS-CoV-2 infection, an impairment of right and left ventricular function on echocardiography was common during other severe infections and there was a clear association between myocardial injury, cardiac overload or hemodynamic stress as indicated by natriuretic peptides and inflammatory response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Significant elevations of hs-cTn have been demonstrated following rapid atrial pacing, irrespective the presence of inducible myocardial ischemia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. In an experimental human model that utilized the trans-cardiac production of lactate for objective evidence of myocardial ischemia, hs-cTnT increased in the absence of CAD and lactate suggesting that tachycardia itself is capable to induce an acute myocardial injury. Likewise, administration of catecholamines was found to release hs-cTnT in healthy volunteers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Other mechanisms that have been related to the release of cTn include respiratory failure due to severe hypoxemia, sepsis, acute kidney failure, hypertension or hypotension, bradycardia, fever, anemia and many other causes [
