<p id="Par21">Moreover, in order to reduce the length of stay in an ED, and to dedicate monitoring capacities for other critically diseased patients, accelerated rapid rule-out and/or rule-in of MI seem to be particularly helpful [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Timing of invasive coronary angiography depends on individual estimation of anticipated risk of death, heart failure or other infarct-related complications. Factors that are supposed to favor an immediate or early coronary angiography under full protection of medical staff include STEMI, high risk non-ST segment elevation MI as suggested by either unstable hemodynamics, dynamic ST segment changes, rhythm instability, or a very high clinical score as recommended in 2015 ESC guidelines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Cardiac troponin values should be interpreted as continuous variables since risk of death and benefits from an early invasive strategy incline with increasing values [

It is unclear whether the benefit of revascularization outweighs the potential disadvantages of contamination of medical staff in patients with small-to-intermediate elevations of hs-cTn, or whether a yet unsettled, more refined risk stratification is required to identify those patients who are likely to benefit most [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Hence, patients with NSTEMI at lower risk should be managed according to local expertise and capability to deliver echocardiography and invasive procedures effectively to the patient without exposing the medical staff to an increased risk of contamination [
