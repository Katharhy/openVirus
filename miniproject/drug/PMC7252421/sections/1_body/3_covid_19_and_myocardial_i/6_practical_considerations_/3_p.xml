<p id="Par20">Regarding the measurement of cardiac biomarkers, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) has released statements against the liberal use of troponin in COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Given the frequency and non-specific nature of abnormal troponin results among patients with COVID-19, clinicians are advised to measure cardiac troponin only if acute myocardial infarction is suspected on clinical grounds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) expands these recommendations by restricting the measurement of cardiac troponin T/I concentrations to patients with suspected Type 1 MI, because this infarct type is more likely to benefit from adjunctive antiplatelet therapies and early revascularization therapies (personal communication, paper under revision).
