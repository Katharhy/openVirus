<p id="Par19">In patients with suspected ACS without ST-segment elevation, or in the absence of hemodynamic or rhythm instability and when COVID-19 cannot be ruled-out due to suspicious clinical presentation, the personal recommendation of the author is to obtain nasopharyngeal swabs for real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and, if available, to perform a CT lung scan while waiting for the PCR result. COVID-19-associated pneumonia provides a typical picture that is characterized by bilateral lung infiltrates, glass ground opacities, consolidation, reticular pattern and the so-called crazy paving pattern [
