<p id="Par15">Overall, the presence of myocardial injury in ED populations is not uncommon, occurring in as many as 20% of consecutive patients presenting with chest pain, dyspnea, or less specific symptoms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. However, only a fraction of elevations was ultimately attributed to a type 1 or type 2 MI and the majority of cases were unrelated to myocardial ischemia, often multifactorial, or the exact reason remained unsettled [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. In stable or asymptomatic cardiovascular or ischemic heart disease, cardiac troponin elevation may be explained by the presence of underlying structural heart disease, stable CAD, and chronic kidney disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Accordingly, in Western countries, the presence of hs-cTn above the 99th percentile ULN has been reported in as many as 20% of asymptomatic patients with or without cardiovascular disease presenting for routine outpatient visits [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], and across different sub-specialities in patients hospitalized for reasons other than an acute coronary syndrome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Regardless the underlying reason or acuity of clinical presentation, the presence of myocardial injury as indicated by hs-cTn above the 99th percentile is uniformly associated with adverse long-term outcomes and patients with elevated hs-cTn at baseline have a higher risk to die acutely during the precipitating event due to their cardiovascular morbidity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Accordingly, the data from the pandemia in Wuhan, confirm current knowledge but do not provide fundamental new information to our interpretation of troponin elevations.
