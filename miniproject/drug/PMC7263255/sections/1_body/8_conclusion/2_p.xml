<p id="p0270">With the rapid increase in COVID-19 cases through out the world, the research for development of drugs and vaccines have gained a momentum. During this prevailing condition of pandemic, the fast development of vaccines is required but it will take time as ongoing clinical trials are necessary for assessing the biocompatibility and toxicity of developed vaccines. Drug repurposing has proved to be the most efficient approach towards the treatment of COVID-19. Drugs from various therapeutic category alone or in combination have been explored and many combinations specially antivirals have proved to be effective against the disease although the dose and combination of repurposed drugs has been selected on trial basis and clinical trials on many repurposed drugs have been called off sighting toxicity and efficacy issues. The concept of drug repurposing is quite useful and may have demonstrated effectiveness but this might vary with the severity as well as with subjects on which treatment is being done. In case of vaccines, multiple vaccines have demonstrated positive results and will be goining to next phase soon giving hope for early commercial launch of vaccines against COVID-19. Amongst alternative therapeutic strategy, Indian council of Medical Research recently approved clinical trial for use of herbal formulation against COVID-19 while plasma therapy has demonstrated significant results and may be explored more in near future. With the ongoing pace of research being conducted in this area, the world will be able to tackle this pandemic and life could be normal like before very soon.</p>
