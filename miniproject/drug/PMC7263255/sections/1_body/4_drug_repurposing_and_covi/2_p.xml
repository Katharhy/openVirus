<p id="p0135">Currently, there is no particular antiviral therapy suggested for COVID-19 and no vaccine is presently available as its pathogenesis and proliferation pathways still remain unknown. The treatment is based on symptoms, and oxygen therapy is the main treatment method for severely infected patients. In cases of respiratory failure refractory to oxygen therapy and artificial ventilation may be required while hemodynamic assistance is important for septic shock management [

There are many choices for containing or avoiding emerging COVID-19 infections, involving vaccines, oligonucleotide-based drugs, monoclonal antibodies, interferon treatments, peptides, and small-molecule medicines [
 <xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. However, it's likely to take months to years to develop new drug/vaccine associated interventions. Given the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, we here focused on the drug repurposing techniques and the ability to repurpose current therapeutic agents for COVID-19 treatment. Drug repurposing (reprofiling, drug repositioning or re-tasking) is a process to redevelop a compound /drug for the use in a different disease other than that of its original use. It is a strategy of identifying the approved, discontinued, shelved and investigational drugs for new uses that are authorized for the treatment of other diseases [
 <xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. About one-third of the approvals involve repurposed drugs [
 <xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The basic principle involved in drug repurposing is that a common molecular pathway is responsible for many diseases and a host of detailed information is available on the formulation, dose, toxicity, pharmacology and clinical trial data of the approved/ shelved or discontinued drugs. The advantages of drug repurposing are in most of the cases safety assessment, preclinical testing, and in some cases formulation development won't take much time and thus reducing the time required for the drug development. For repurposed drugs the chances of failure will be less as the preliminary stages of evaluating drug efficacy and safety have been already completed and the drug has already been found to be adequately safe in a preclinical and human model. Hence, repurposed drugs open a new avenue for the research of new pathways and targets [
 <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] and finally, investment for repurposing the drug is less as it often bypasses the Phase-1 trial in comparison to the development of a new drug entity [
