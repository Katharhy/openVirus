<p id="p0160">Ribavirin (RBV) is an antiviral purine nucleoside analog approved for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV). It is a broad-spectrum anti-viral drug having activity against hepatitis B and respiratory syncytial virus (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) [
 <xref rid="bb0430" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. RBV is metabolized by adenosine kinase to its prodrug mono, di and triphosphate metabolites. The synthesis of viral mRNA polymerase is inhibited by the direct binding of RBV triphosphate (RTP) to the nucleotide-binding site of the enzyme which results in the reduction in the production of defective virions and decreases the viral load [
 <xref rid="bb0435" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. RBV also competitively inhibits host inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) which further inhibits the guanine nucleotides synthesis. The decrease in guanosine triphosphate leads to the depletion of viral protein synthesis and halts the process of viral genome replication [
 <xref rid="bb0440" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. RBV also has an immunomodulatory effect on the host by promoting the production of cytokines which stimulates the humoral response and enhances immunity towards the virus. The mechanism of action of RBV that includes the inhibition of mRNA capping which results in induction of mutation in the viral replication is the main reason for considering RBV as a potential treatment approach to treat SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bb0445" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. High doses of RBV are required for treatment. RBV, when given as a monotherapy, shows resistance against SARS and MERS and therefore it's given in combination with other antiviral drugs like lopinavir, chloroquine analogs and with interferon-α [
 <xref rid="bb0450" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. A Study on Vero and LLC-MK2 cells showed that the combination of RBV with interferon-α inhibits the replication of novel coronavirus (nCoV) isolate hCoV-EMC/2012 in the cell lines with a lower concentration of both RBV and interferon-α, thus making RBV as a promising treatment for COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bb0450" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The pharmacokinetic profile of RBV is well established. It is rapidly and extensively absorbed orally with an oral bioavailability of 64%. It is metabolized in the liver by adenosine kinase to its mono, di and tri phosphate metabolites. The half-life of RBV is about 120–170 h. For the treatment of COVID-19, intravenous RBV is given in a dose of 500 mg, 2–3 times daily in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir or interferon-α for not more than 10 days [
 <xref rid="bb0455" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. The main adverse effects of RBV are hypocalcemia, hemolytic anemia and hypomagnesemia [
 <xref rid="bb0460" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. RBV should be avoided in patients with preexisting cardiac disease and in patients with poor renal function. RBV is known to cause teratogenic effects and therefore it should be avoided in pregnant women [
 <xref rid="bb0465" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Several clinical trials to assess the potency of RBV in treating COVID-19 are underway. A randomized, open labeled, controlled phase-2 trial to assess the efficacy of combination therapy of lopinavir/ritonavir, RBV and interferon beta-1b has been initiated by The University of Honkong, China. The aim of the study is to assess the effect of combination therapy in suppressing the viral load, shorten the hospitalization time, recovery and reduce the mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection compared with lopinavir/ ritonavir [
