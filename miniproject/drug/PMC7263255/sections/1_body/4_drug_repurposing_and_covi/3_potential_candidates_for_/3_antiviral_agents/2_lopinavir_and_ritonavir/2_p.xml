<p id="p0150">Several kinds of research have concentrated on repurposing existing antiviral therapies, in particular those that have shown previous effectiveness towards MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Authorized protease inhibitors were confirmed to be effective towards SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV such as lopinavir (LPV) and ritonavir (RTV). Clinical trials (e.g., ChiCTR2000029539) are conducted to test HIV protease inhibitors like LPV and RTV in patients with COVID-19 infection [

HIV protease is from the family of aspartic proteases while the two coronavirus proteases belong to the family of cysteine proteases. In fact, HIV protease inhibitors have been precisely designed to match the C2 structure in the HIV protease dimer catalytic site, however, this C2-symmetric structure is missing in coronavirus proteases [

Assuming that HIV protease inhibitors modify host pathways to interact with coronavirus infection indirectly, their potency remains a matter of concern. In the recent study, 51 COVID-19 patients with conventional Chinese medicine, interferon, LPV, RTV and brief-term (3 to 5 days) corticosteroids were successfully treated and 50 patients were recovered and discharged [

A 54-year-old man having COVID-19 was successfully treated with LPV and RTV from day 10 of infection, 2 tablets (LPV 200 mg/RTV 50 mg) every 12 h was mentioned in a study by Lim et al. The viral β-coronavirus load was begun to decrease after the first day of administration and since then, few to no significant coronavirus titers were identified [

The observation suggest that although there are no drugs for COVID-19 at present, the repurposing of antiretroviral drug which have been previously approved by United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is really helpful in supressing the virus as well as treating already infected individual. Similar combination of other retroviral agents with appropriate dose and dosing frequency will be quite helpful in facing this situation.
