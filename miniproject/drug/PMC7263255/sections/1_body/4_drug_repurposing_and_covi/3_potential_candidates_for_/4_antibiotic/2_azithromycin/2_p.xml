<p id="p0195">Azithromycin (AZ) is a semi synthetic broad spectrum macrolide antibiotic approved by FDA for the treatment of genitourinary tract infections, enteric and respiratory tract related infections [
 <xref rid="bb0645" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Along with its anti-bacterial activity, AZ has also shown antiviral activity by inducing the production of interferon-stimulated genes in a rhino virus infected bronchial epithelial cells [
 <xref rid="bb0650" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. Studies showed that AZ is also effective against zika and Ebola virus. AZ acts against the virus by a host of multiple mechanism. AZ inhibits viral genetic shedding from lysosome and blocks endocytosis by getting accumulated intracellularly in the lysosomes and endosomal vesicles leading to the increase in pH levels and thereby limits the replication of viral genetic material [
 <xref rid="bb0655" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. The anti-viral activity of AZ is also attributed to its ability to induce interferon mediated antiviral response which reduces the replication of the virus [
 <xref rid="bb0660" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. AZ also decreases the mucus secretion and enables lung function by directly acting on bronchial epithelial cells [
 <xref rid="bb0650" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. AZ has shown a potential action against SARS-CoV-2. It interacts among SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and host angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) protein and thereby inhibits the viral entry into the host cell [
 <xref rid="bb0665" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. The bioavailability of AZ following oral administration is 37%. It has a high tissue penetration and a longer half life (68 h). It is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted through biliary excretion. The volume of distribution of AZ is 31 L/kg. The side effects of AZ include macrolide antibiotic resistances, hearing loss and cardiac arrythmias (QT prolongation) [
 <xref rid="bb0645" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. There are several reports suggesting that a combination of chloroquine and AZ is effective in reducing the viral load in the treatment of COVID-19. Usually a dose of 1–2 g of azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine is used in the treatment of COVID-19.
