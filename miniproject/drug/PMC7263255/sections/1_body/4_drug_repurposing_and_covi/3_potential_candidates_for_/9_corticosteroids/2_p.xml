The frequency of shock is remarkably low in patients with COVID-19 (5% of cases). Having to deliver oxygenated blood flow and thoracic pressure from breathing results in increased heart activity leading to cardiogenic shock. Corticosteroids can cause damage via immunosuppressant activity during the infection treatment and have failed to offer an advantage in many viral epidemics, including influenza infection, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, MERS and SARS [

With COVID-19, early recommendations for treating chronically ill people indicate when to use minimal-dose corticosteroids and when to stop using corticosteroids. Recommendations rely on the particular clinical condition (e.g. refractory trauma, artificially ventilated Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients); however, they are based on data identified as weak [

Eighty-four (41.8%) patients acquired ARDS and 44 (52.4%) of those died. Methylprednisolone therapy reduced the risk of mortality in ARDS patients [

In another study, Zhou et al. indicated that, in 10 COVID-19 patients, the brief-term optimum-dose corticosteroid (160 mg/day) and immunoglobulin (20 g / day) substantially decreased lung damage, stabilized body temperature, C-reactive protein, lymphocyte, and oxygenation levels [
