<p id="p0230">Tocilizumab is the first humanized recombinant MAb which is used to treat autoimmune and inflammatory conditions like cytokine release syndrome, giant cell arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. TCZ targets and binds to the membrane bound IL-6 receptors thus preventing the interaction of IL-6 with IL-6 receptors. This leads to the reduction of the cytokine's pro inflammatory activity resulting in the blockade of antibody production and induction of T-cell proliferation by IL-6 [

In the course of COVID-19 disease progression, the patients develop conditions like acute interstitial pneumonia, fever, lung injury, arthralgia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, myocarditis and biological inflammatory changes which is caused due to the hyper production of cytokines resulting in a cytokine storm [
 <xref rid="bb0815" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. This cytokine storm is induced by the replication of the virus which activates the innate immune system to produce ILs. TCZ binds to these IL receptors and blunts the hyper secretion of ILs thereby reducing the inflammation and other related conditions [

A host of clinical trials have been initiated to investigate the use of TCZ in the treatment of COVD-19. A multicentred, open-labelled, phase-II, single arm clinical trial study has been initiated by the National Cancer Institute, Naples to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of TCZ in treating COVID-19 pneumonia [
 <xref rid="bb0830" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. Another open-label, multi-centre clinical trial has been initiated with the main aim to evaluate the use of TCZ when given in combination with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine in treating the patients hospitalized with COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bb0675" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. A clinical study design to investigate the use of TCZ in manging COVID-19 patients with suspected pulmonary hyperinflammation has been initiated. It is an open-label, randomized multi centred, two arm study with the aim to test the hypothesis that TCZ can effectively reduce the inflammation caused as a result of virus induced cytokine storm and resulting in the rapid improvement of clinical conditions [
