<p id="p0220">Baricitinib is an immunosuppressant approved by the FDA for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. It is a janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor which acts by selectively and reversibly binding to JAK receptors there by inhibiting JAK1 and JAK2. This inhibition leads in halting the signal transduction from growth receptors or cytokines leading to reduction in immune cell function and haematopoiesis. Baricitinib also prevents the formation of viral particles and intracellular passage of viral cells by binding to associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) [

The use of JAK inhibitors like baricitinib will aid in reducing the inflammation and it also prevents the viral infection and endocytosis by inducing a inhibitory effect o AAK1 receptors [

The bioavailability of baricitinib upon oral administration is 80% and it reaches a peak plasma concentration within 1 h. the half life of baricitinib is 12.5 h with a volume of distribution of 76 L and its 50% protein binding. It is metabolised in liver by oxidation mediated through CYP3A4 and it is eliminated unchanged from the urine [

There are several ongoing clinical trials for determining the exact role and the efficacy of baricitinib in the treatment of COVID-19. A phase-II, non-randomized, open labelled clinical trial has been initiated to investigate the safety and efficacy of combination therapy of lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine sulphate and baricitinib in the treatment of moderate to severe COVD-19 in hospitalized patients [

Another randomized, phase-II, open labelled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of drugs in treating SARS-CoV-2 associated pneumonia has been initiated. The aim of this current study is to design a study design with drugs of different classes and investigate their efficacy in treating COVID-19. A combination of hydroxychloroquine (200 mg), ritonavir (50 mg), baricitinib (4 mg) and imatinib (400 mg) will be administered to the patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia for 7 days and the efficacy and safety of this combination therapy will be evaluated [
