<p id="p0215">Sirolimus is a potent immunosuppressive agent obtained from 
 <italic>Streptomyces hygroscopicus</italic>. It is commercially available as Rapamune (Pfizer) and is mainly used in treating lymphangioleiomymatosis and as a prophylactic agent to prevent organ transplant rejection. The immunosuppressive activity of sirolimus is mainly due to its ability to inhibit T-lymphocyte proliferation/ activation and cytokine production by selectively blocking the transcriptional activation of cytokines. Along with possessing antineoplastic and anti-fungal properties, it also has anti-viral activity. Sirolimus binds to immunophilin in the cell to form a immunosuppressive complex and inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase which in turn halts the formation of mTORC1 protein complex which is said to play an important role in viral replication. Studies showed that sirolimus successfully inhibited mTOR signalling pathway and there by inhibited MERS-CoV [

The University of Cincinnati has been granted approval for performing a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial on the use of sirolimus in treating COVD-19. The aim of the study is to determine the efficacy of sirolimus in improving the clinical outcomes among the patients hospitalized for the treatment of COVD-19 pneumonia [

The main of this trial is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, virological efficacy, tolerability and safety of sirolimus as an adjuvant therapy in treating patients with COVID-19 [
