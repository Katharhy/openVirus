<p id="p0235">Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum anti-parasite drug which is approved for the treatment of onchocerciasis and intestinal strongyloidiasis. Ivermectin acts by selectively binding to the glutamate-gated chloride on channels of the parasite and leads to hyperpolarization of the cell which results in the paralysis and death of the parasite. The anti-viral activity of ivermectin was first discovered with its ability to block the interaction between the nuclear transport receptor importin α/β(IMP) and integrase molecule of HIV [
