<p id="p0140">The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) host interactions can be modulated by small-molecule agents authorized for other human diseases. Chloroquine (CQ), a commonly used anti-malarial drug and authorized immune modulator, has been recently identified as a possible broad-spectrum antiviral drug [
 <xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. CQ is reported to prevent virus infection by elevating the endosomal pH needed for virus/cell fusion and by interacting with the glycosylation of SARS-CoV cell receptors [
 <xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In one of the recent findings, CQ demonstrates inhibitory activity towards COVID-19 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.13 μM in Vero E6 cells) [
 <xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and is examined in an open-label trial (ChiCTR2000029609) [
 <xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Subsequently, a number of clinical trials (ChiCTR2000029542, ChiCTR2000029559, ChiCTR2000029609, ChiCTR2000029740, ChiCTR2000029760, ChiCTR2000029761, ChiCTR2000029762, ChiCTR2000029803, ChiCTR2000029826, ChiCTR2000029837, ChiCTR2000029868, ChiCTR2000029898, ChiCTR2000029899, ChiCTR2000029935 and ChiCTR2000029939) were immediately carried out in China for the safety and efficacy of CQ and hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19 linked pneumonia [
 <xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Reports have so far shown that chloroquine phosphate is preferred in managing the treatment by constraining the worsening of pneumonia, increasing lung imaging tests, encouraging virus-negative transformation, and reducing the duration of illness [
 <xref rid="bb0335" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. CQ is an inexpensive and effective drug and has been in use for over 70 years, making it potential and clinically beneficial towards COVID-19.
