<p id="p0145">Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which demonstrates a highly related structure (as shown in 
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> ) and antiviral activity to that of CQ, may function as a safer treatment method for COVID 19, as it demonstrates anti-SARS-CoV activity

 <xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Both compounds can interact with ACE-2 glycosylation and decrease the binding capacity between ACE-2 on the host cells and the COVID-19 surface spike protein. They may also raise the pH of lysosomes and endosomes, by preventing the virus fusion mechanism with host cells and corresponding replication. When HCQ enters antigen-presenting cells (APCs) it inhibits the development of antigen and the autoantigen exposure to T cells controlled by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. It represses subsequent stimulation of T cells and CD154 expression and other cytokines. Furthermore, HCQ disrupts DNA / RNA's interaction with toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the cGAS nucleic acid detector, and thus the expression of pro-inflammatory genes cannot be triggered. Consequently, CQ and HCQ administration is not only expected to alleviate COVID-19's extreme development by preventing its replication and invasion but it also reduces the risk of cytokine storm by blocking T cell stimulation as depicted in

 <xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In a more recent study, an open-label non-randomized study investigating the impact of HCQ (EU Clinical Trial Number: 2020-000890-25) reported on a group of 36 patients. It stated a substantial decrease in nasopharyngeal swab viral positivity, relative to control, 6 days following inclusion in the HCQ group. However, 16 patients were assigned as controls in a deviation from their chart defined protocol, and 6 patients obtained simultaneous azithromycin (AZM) treatment to avoid bacterial superinfection. Patients who received AZM were chosen based on clinical assessment. After 6 days, the subgroup getting AZM had negative virus swabs relative to 57% (8/14) with HCQ alone and 12.5% (2/16) with control [
 <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. It shows that AZM added to HCQ has been significantly more effective in eliminating the virus. However, this study is constrained by its low sample size and lack of randomization which gives a lot of room for study with a larger sample size.
