<p id="p0100">Spike protein being the first contact site between viruses and cells is subjected to tremendous evolutionary pressure. Any changes in spike protein would have a profound effect on the infectivity and transmission of viruses. In the spike protein of the present pandemic SARS-CoV-2, changes acquired such as furin-like cleavage site, structural changes at the receptor binding sites are being correlated for the species jumping and efficient human-to-human transmission. The virus is also found to form syncytium which enables virus spreading by cell-cell fusion which might also leads to the rapid infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus [
