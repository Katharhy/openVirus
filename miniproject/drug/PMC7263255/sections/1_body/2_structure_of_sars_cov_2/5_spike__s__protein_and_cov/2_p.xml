<p id="p0090">Spike protein is a densely glycosylated class I fusion protein on the surface of virus particles. It comprises of a large ectodomain, a single-pass transmembrane domain that anchors the protein to lipid bilayer and a small intracellular segment. The ectodomain has two subunits S1 and S2 both forming homotrimers. The C-terminal functional domain of S1 subunit is involved in receptor binding and S2 subunit includes a fusion peptide, HR1 and HR2 (hepted repeat 1 and 2), a transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic domain that aids in viral envelope fusion with host cell membrane via the endosomal pathway.</p>
