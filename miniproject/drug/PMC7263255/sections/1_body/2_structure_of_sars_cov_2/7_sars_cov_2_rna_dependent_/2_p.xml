<p id="p0110">Viral replication and transcription of SARS CoV-2 is carried out by complex protein machinery. Proteins of this complex are translated from ORF1a and ORF1b and are the part of large polypeptide chain. Overall architecture of RdRp complex of SARS-CoV-2 is found to be analogous to that of SARS CoV. The key constituent of this enzyme complex is RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12). It forms the complex with other co-factors such as nsp7 and nsp8 and catalyses the development of viral genomic RNA. The complex has a central groove where template-directed RNA synthesis id catalysed. The nascent RNA strands exit path is positively charged which bring about electrostatic interaction between nascent RNA strand and enzyme complex. This exit path is also accessible to the solvents [
