<p id="p0045">This virus was identified as β-CoV on 7th January. It had 96.2% homology to bat coronavirus namely RaTG13 genome whereas 79.5% homology to SARS coronavirus. The samples taken from the surroundings of the Huanan market showed positive results for this virus, confirming its origin. This CoV used the same receptor as of SARS-CoV i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptor, to infect the humans [

Later on, the 11th February, WHO termed the disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and CSG (Coronavirus Study Group) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses changed the virus name officially from 2019-nCoV to SARS-CoV-2, due to a lot of similarities with SARS-CoV [

 <sub>0</sub> value (basic reproduction number) for SARS-CoV 2 in a range from 1.4 to 6.5 [
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. R
 <sub>0</sub> value (represents an average of new infections produced by an infectious person in a total population) gives the warning for virus transmission with respect to an epidemic i.e if R
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 1, the infected number could escalate and if R
 <sub>0</sub> &lt; 1, the transmission will die out soon.
