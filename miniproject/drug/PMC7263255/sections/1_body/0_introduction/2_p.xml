<p id="p0035">Coronavirus (CoV) belonging to the Coronaviridae family has spikes on the outer surface, making it look like a crown, thus deriving its name (Corona in Latin is Crown). These enveloped viruses are made up of a single-stranded RNA genomic material along with a helical nucleocapsid bound to the RNA in a bead and string type continuous conformation. They have a diameter size range of 65–125 nm and length varying from 26–32 kbs. This virus family has subgroups based on their genomic structure namely α, β, ϒ and δ CoV [

Till now, four CoVs were identified in human circulation which have low pathogenicity and caused mild respiratory symptoms viz NL63 and 229E which are α CoVs; OC43 and HKU1 which are β-CoVs. In the 21st century, two severe respiratory tract infection (RTI) viz. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV (β-CoV) emerged in Guangdong province of China in 2002–2003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV (β-CoV) emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Both these CoVs were of bat origin and had a fatality rate of 11% and 34%, respectively. The intermediary hosts between bats to humans in SARS were palm civet cats and in MERS were dromedary camels. SARS and MERS caused respiratory distress and lung injury leading to pulmonary failure and fatality [
