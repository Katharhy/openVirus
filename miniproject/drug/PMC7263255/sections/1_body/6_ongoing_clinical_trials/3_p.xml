<p id="p0260">On the other hand, the development of vaccines is hard and takes relatively more time than repurposing an existing drug especially when the novel technologies available have not been tested for safety. In the pipeline of vaccines, an mRNA-based vaccine developed by Modera and Vaccine Research Center at NIH expresses target antigen after being injected in the form of lipid nanoparticle encapsulated mRNA. It has reached a phase I clinical trial (

Curevac is currently in the preclinical phase working on a similar vaccine. Additional strategies which are still in the preclinical phase include S protein-focused vaccines such as viral-vector based vaccines (Geovax, CanSino Biologics, Vaxart and the University of Oxford), recombinant-protein based vaccines (Novavax, University of Queensland, and Biopharmaceuticals), DNA vaccines (Applied DNA sciences and Inovio), inactivated virus vaccines and live attenuated vaccines (Serum Institute of India with Codagenix). Johnson &amp; Johnson is working on an experimental adenovirus vector that is not yet a licensed vaccine [
