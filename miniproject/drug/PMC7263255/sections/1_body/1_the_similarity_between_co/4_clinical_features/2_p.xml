<p id="p0065">With comparison to the current clinical characteristics of COVID-19, it does not appear to be different from SARS and far less lethal than MERS, even though it spreads in the community at a rapid pace. Common symptoms include cough, sore throat, fever, and dyspnoea, with at least one symptom in all the infected patients.

Research laboratory results do not vary significantly in patients infected with COVID-19 than those diagnosed with other CoVs infections, the most common being lymphopenia together with low platelet amount and lower levels of albumin while the levels of creatine kinase, aminotransferases, lactic dehydrogenases, and C-protein increased [

Patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV had an adverse clinical path with the onset of dyspnoea within 5 days followed by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome within 30% of the cases within a span of 5 days and need of mechanical ventilation in 17% of the cases. Due to the abundance of DDP4 receptors in tubules and glomeruli, a serious complication for MERS appears to be acute kidney injury, however, it rarely occurs in COVID-19 and SARS [
