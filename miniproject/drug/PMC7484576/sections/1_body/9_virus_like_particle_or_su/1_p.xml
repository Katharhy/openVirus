 </sup> These vaccines closely imitate attenuated vaccines by destroying host cells or the induction of endogenous antigens and thus results in the generation of both T-cell and antibody-mediated immune responses.

 </sup> The candidate vaccines under research and development for COVID-19 include the large spike protein or receptor-binding domain subunit vaccines and replicating or non-replicating viral vector-based vaccines with the expression of large spike protein or receptor-binding domain.

 </sup> Patent application WO2015042373 revealed an immunogenic preparation comprising MERS-CoV nanoparticles virus-like particle vaccines that contained at least one trimer of an S protein secreted by overexpressed baculovirus in Sf9 cells.

 </sup> The following administration together with proprietary adjuvant Matrix, this VLP composition provoked a counteracting antibody response in transgenic cattle and mice. Furthermore, the injection of sera preparations from vaccinated cattle (SAB-300 or 301) into Ad5-hDPP4 transduced BALB/c mice were capable of protecting these mice from MERS-CoV attack by using only one prophylactic inoculation. On February 26, 2020, Novavax has announced starting animal testing on COVID-19 vaccine candidates because of their earlier experiences with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
