<p>SARS-CoV-2 possesses a large positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome (29.88 Kb) consisting of about 12 open reading frames. Similar to all other CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also encodes genes responsible for the production of four major structural proteins, explicitly the nucleocapsid related to the RNA genome, and a set of three other membrane proteins. These proteins include the integral membrane glycoprotein, large spike glycoprotein, and the envelope protein. The large spike protein comprises the receptor-binding domain and plays a significant role in the membrane fusion and viral attachment to host cells. It also helps to induce viral neutralizing antibodies, which might inhibit interactions with the host receptors.

 </sup> It is the major focus for vaccine research and development. The integral membrane glycoprotein can also trigger neutralizing antibodies, and the nucleocapsid protein comprises T-cell epitopes also indicates an important vaccine target for SARS-CoV.
