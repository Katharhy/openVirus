<p>Live-attenuated CoV vaccines are produced by reverse genetics from infectious virus clones by deleting numerous key pathogenicity factors to avoid reversion. These vaccines have considered the immunologically most robust that induce systemic, mucosal, humoral, and cellular-mediated immune responses and broad cross-protective immunity.

 </sup> The best approach to produce an attenuated vaccine for COVID-19 would be first constructing a temperature-sensitive virus mutant with replication constrained to the upper respiratory tract, and then generate additionally-conserved attenuated mutations by applying reverse genetics. In blending with a parental heterologous RNA genome-associated nucleocapsid and large spike glycoprotein booster vaccine, such kind of attenuated vaccine can profoundly provoke cross-protection against different strains like bat SARS-CoV-like strains 1. The live-attenuated coronavirus or Toro virus vaccines are disclosed in patent application US20060039926.

 </sup> Insertion of a mutation (Y6398H) into the Orf1a/b polyprotein (p59/nsp14/ExoN) abolished the pathogenicity of mouse coronavirus (MHV-A59). The resultant attenuated MHV virus showed weaned reproduction in the tested mice after intracerebral vaccination.
