<p>Emodin is a natural anthraquinone compound that can act as a virucidal agent,

 </sup> and considerably interfere with the binding interactions between the ACE2 and SARS-CoV S-protein. Thus, it is thought that emodin could eliminate SARS‐CoV triggered disease conditions by acting as a competitor for the same binding region of S-protein with ACE2.

 </sup> Promazine is an anti‐psychotic medication that shares a structural similarity with emodin. It has been shown a pronounced suppressing activity to inhibit the growth of SARS-CoV.

 </sup> In contrast to emodin, promazine is a more potent inhibitor of the attachment of spikes glycoproteins to ACE2. The investigation portrays that promazine and emodin might inhibit SARS‐CoV disease by interfering with the binding of ACE2 and S protein.

 </sup> Consequently, the mAbs of promazine and emodin can be employed as alternatives to treat COVID‐19.
