 </sup> In addition, they also provide benefits such as the capability to inducing a more powerful immunological response and the aptitude of combining several mRNAs into a single vaccine. The patent application (WO2017070626)

 </sup> by Moderna demonstrated mRNA vaccines consists of mRNAs encoding antigenic viral full-length S, S1, or S2 proteins from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV viruses, and prepared in cationic lipid nanoparticles. It was found that mice inoculated with mRNA encoding coronavirus full-length S protein resulted in much greater titers of neutralizing antibody than that to mRNA encoding the S protein S2 subunit. On February 24, 2020, Moderna declared the release of the first batch of mRNA-1273 against COVID-19 for utilization in humans, formulated according to the strategies and methods delineated in their earlier patents.
