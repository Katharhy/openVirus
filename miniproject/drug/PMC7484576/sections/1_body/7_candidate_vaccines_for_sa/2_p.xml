<p>The newer anti-viral vaccines commonly fall into following types such as inactive or live-attenuated viruses, viral vectors, virus-like particle (VLP), DNA-based, mRNA-based, and protein-based vaccines.

 </sup> It is documented that viral S protein subunit vaccines generate elevated titers of neutralizing antibodies and provide more protection compared to full-length S protein, DNA-based S protein and live-attenuated SARS-CoV vaccines.

 </sup> It is not surprising that approximately half of the patented reports have focused on the viral S protein subunit vaccine and those explicitly directing the RBD of the S1-subunit. Notably, S gene/protein is considered as the preferred targeting site in the development of the SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV vaccine, and thus, this approach can also be used in designing vaccines for SARS-CoV-2.
