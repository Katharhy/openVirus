<p>Although DNA-based vaccines are recognized as stable, safe, and produced at a fast rate, their protective efficiency and immunogenicity in humans have not yet confirmed. DNA vector vaccines for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have often shown better effectiveness heterologous prime-boost (inactivated virus particles, S/S1 proteins, and recombinant viral vectors) regimens.

 </sup> However, the administration of DNA vaccine by an electroporation technique and its possible host genome integration and persistence are the issues to be solved.

 </sup> The compositions and approaches for boosting up immunological responses, predominantly antigen-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell-assisted responses against SARS-CoV infection are documented in patent application WO2005081716.

 </sup> Immune responses, particularly cytotoxic T cell-mediated immune responses, are enhanced in vivo by chimeric nucleic acids encoding endoplasmic reticulum chaperone polypeptides, which are connected to at least one antigenic protein from SARS-CoV. The effective delivery of DNA-based gold particles by using a gene gun method, immunization of mice against a calreticulin−nucleocapsid fusion protein showed powerful T cell-mediated immune and nucleocapsid-specific humoral responses. The titer of a vaccinia vector with the expression of N protein of the SARS-CoV was significantly reduced in vaccinated animals. Immunogens containing consensus proteins originated from the spike protein of MERS-CoV for utilization in MERS-CoV specified DNA-based vaccines are patented in application WO2015081155.

 </sup> The consensus spike protein considerably enhanced both cellular and humoral immune responses, such as high-tittered neutralizing antibodies and specific immunoglobulins. Induced cell-mediated immunity involved amplified responses of CD3+ CD4+ and CD3+ CD8 + T cells, which result in the production of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, or both TNF-α and IFN-γ.
