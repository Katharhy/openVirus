<p>Angiotensin‐converting enzyme‐2 (ACE2), a type I essential membrane protein, catalyzes the role of a carboxypeptidase. Reports have revealed that it serves as a functional receptor of SARS-CoV coronavirus and facilitates the entry of the virus into target cells via binding with spike (S) glycoprotein.
