 </sup> Combination of an emulsion adjuvant with engineered ectodomain immunogen produced high-tittered anti-SARS-CoV IgG2a or IgG2b as well as specific neutralizing antibody responses in studied animal models. Patent application US20060002 947 unveils the formulation methodology for Ii-Key/MHC II SARS-CoV hybrids comprising of three components namely an invariant (Ii) chain peptide for antigen presentation improving activity, a chemical structure connecting the Ii with antigen epitope, and an antigenic epitope, which binds to an MHC class II molecule.
