    "Background: Emergence of new multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is thought to be associated with COVID-19 pandemic. Covid-19 morbidity and mortality variances among countries have been suggested by previous works to be influenced by BCG and previous latent TB infection (which is reflected by TB prevalence) possibly through inducing heterogeneous immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Aim: To examine influence of BCG status and TB prevalence on variances among countries which report new multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Methods: We choose all countries which report MIS-C till 23/6/2020, number of cases for each 10 million inhabitants was examined among 3 categories of countries classified according to BCG program status. TB prevalence, MIS-C no. / 10 million (M) population and Covid- 19 deaths/M are taken as markers. Receiver operation characteristic - (ROC) curve, with some relative indicators such as (sensitivity and specificity rates), estimation area of trade - off between sensitivity and specificity, and cutoff points are used with different studied markers for discriminating different three pairs of countries (which have different BCG practices). Results: BCG vaccinations and high TB prevalence are found to be associated with decrease MIS-C no. and COVID-19 deaths Conclusions: Findings might explain variances in MIS-C incidence and in COVID-19 mortality among countries worldwide. Further studies to confirm this relation and to confirm possible similar relations in Kawasaki disease(KD) in previous epidemics is recommended."
