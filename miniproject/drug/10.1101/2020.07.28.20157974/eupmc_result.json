    "Background Effective antiviral treatments are required to contain the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A previous report in 814 patients COVID-19 positive in Cuba provided preliminary therapeutic efficacy evidence with interferon alpha-2b (IFN alpha-2b) from March 11 to April 14, 2020. This study, re-evaluates the contribution of IFN-Î±2b on the evolution of all patients, after 98 days of the epidemic, in a period from March 11 to June 17, 2020. Method A prospective observational study was implemented to monitor a therapeutic intervention with IFN alpha-2b used in the national protocol for COVID-19 attending in Cuba. Were included patients with positive throat swab specimens by real time RT-PCR who gave informed consent and had no contraindications for IFN treatment. Patients received therapy as per the Cuban COVID protocol that included a combination of oral antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine) with intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of IFN alpha-2b The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients discharged from hospital, secondary was the case fatality rate and several outcomes related to time variables were also evaluated. Results From March 11th until June 17th, 2295 patients had been confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive in Cuba, 2165 were treated with Heberon Alpha R and 130 received the approved protocol without IFN. The proportion of fully recovered patients was higher in the IFN-treated compared with non-IFN treated group. Prior IFN treatment decreases the likelihood of intensive care and increases the survival after severe or critical diseases. The benefits of IFN were significantly supported by time variables analyzed. Conclusions This second report confirm the preliminary evidences from first for the therapeutic effectiveness of IFN alpha-2b for SARS-Cov-2 infection and postulated that Heberon Alpha R is the main component within the antiviral triad used as a therapeutic intervention in the Cuban protocol COVID-19."
