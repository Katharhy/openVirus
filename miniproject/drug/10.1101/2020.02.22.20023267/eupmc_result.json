    "The CoViD-19 outbreak has escalated to a pandemic in the last few months. Pharmaceutical solutions based upon virologic studies, at this point, remain inconclusive, with no proven pharmaceutical solution so far. In contrast, this paper looks towards creating more accurate epidemiological models during this phase of viral growth in order to provide better feedback measures to public health officials and agencies, in particular, by providing a responsive, timely model of the R value based on the previous few days' results. Such an R value, although bearing less statistical precision due to limited sampling, could allow R to become a more effective, responsive standalone measure of infectious transmission. It demonstrates that the R value can be used as a dynamic, time-dependent indicator without the use of curve-fitting, and also estimates the most recent R-value of the CoViD-19 outbreak to be between 1.32 and 1.35."
