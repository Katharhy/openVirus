    "Abstract Background The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a highly infectious viral disease that has spread to over one hundred and eight countries, including Nigeria. Governments across the globe have been implementing preventive measures towards curbing the spread of the virus. These measures have continued to interfere with the general lifestyle of the people. Hence, this study was aimed at examining the socio-demographic predictors of adherence to prescribed recommendations and the psychological impacts of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown among Nigerian social media users. Methods This research implemented a cross-sectional survey using an online Google-based questionnaire to elicit required information from potential respondents via social media platforms. An external link to the questionnaire was shared among Nigerian social media users between for a month, and a total of 1,131 respondents participated in the survey. The explanatory and outcome variables were displayed by frequency and percentage distribution, while chi-square analysis was used to show the relationship between the explanatory and outcome variables at a 5% level of significance. Results The study showed that 99% of the respondents reported following some of the prescribed recommendations; however, only 40.4% of the respondents followed all the recommendations. More than three fifths (63.4%) of the respondents also reported that they feel stressed during the lockdown. All the selected socio-demographic characteristics were not predictors of the outcome variables as p>0 . 05 except the professional background of the respondents (P<0 . 05) . Conclusion We concluded that most Nigerian social media users were complaining to the prescribed recommendations and that the younger age group, female respondents and respondents who are more educated had a higher proportion of reporting psychological impacts of lockdown."
