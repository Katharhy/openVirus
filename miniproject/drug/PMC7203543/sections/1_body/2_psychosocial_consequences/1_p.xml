<p id="Par3">To address concerns related to medication disruption, hospitals and HIV clinics in China have developed protocols to mail antiretroviral drugs to PLWH in care. However, mailing has resulted in significant challenges related to unwanted exposure of one’s HIV status as well as potentially other stigmatized identities (e.g., sexuality) to other household members. This risk was heightened as the quarantine measures took place during the Spring Festival (i.e., Chinese lunar new year), the most important holiday in China in which people travel to their hometowns to gather with family members. PLWH who concealed their HIV status due to fear of stigma and discrimination face the threat of unwanted exposure of their HIV status to family members due to mailing of medicine and interpersonal proximity during this time. Anecdotal records show that some PLWH chose to discontinue their medicine during quarantine due to the need to conceal their HIV status from parents. In addition to individual- and family-level stigma, the spread of unfounded conspiracy theories—e.g., local claims that COVID-19 was engineered by human effort through inserting HIV to a coronavirus—has led to heightened societal stigma and fear of HIV. Medication uptake and HIV care disruption, risk of status exposure, and heightened HIV stigma, may have contributed to worsened mental health among PLWH during the COVID-19 outbreak. In our survey with 703 PLWH in China (data collected in February–March 2020), 60.8% reported depression, 49.8% noted anxiety symptoms, and 38.5% reported recent insomnia. These psychosocial issues may further create a syndemic condition exacerbating adverse health outcomes among PLWH [
