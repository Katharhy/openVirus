<p id="Par2">Due to the city-level centralized management of infectious diseases in China (e.g., PLWH are often assigned to certain hospitals designated for HIV care), strict quarantine enforcement and transportation lockdown in many regions across China beginning in late January 2020 may have caused massive disruption in HIV care. Due to the growing number of COVID-19 cases and the shortage of medical resources, departments of infectious diseases in many hospitals in China were designated for COVID-19 and suspended on taking new patients with HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. With the dual epidemics (COVID-19 and HIV) and increased burden on the health system, it was extremely difficult for PLWH with severe opportunistic infections or other comorbidities to seek medical help, especially when hospital admissions were needed. For PLWH in care, maintaining HIV treatment and achieving viral suppression were also challenging during the COVID-19 outbreak. For instance, the Wuhan LGBTQ Center received calls from more than 2,000 people living with HIV (largely sexual minority men) in Wuhan city during February 2020 seeking help to resolve issues in insufficient medication and care disruption. In February and March 2020, we conducted a survey with PLWH from 25 provinces in China (
