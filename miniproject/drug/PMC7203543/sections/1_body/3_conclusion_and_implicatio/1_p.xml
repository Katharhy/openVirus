<p id="Par4">Lessons from China may inform HIV care for PLWH globally during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current note attends to Chinese PLWH, yet attention is also needed for key populations at risk for HIV (e.g., men who have sex with men, commercial sex workers) in terms of HIV prevention, testing, and linkage to care. Informed by current knowledge on salient challenges in HIV care among PLWH in China, follow-up research with PLWH and populations affected by HIV are needed to learn key lessons and further identify the scale of impact by COVID-19. Chinaâ€™s massive and strict quarantine efforts have achieved much success to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. However, to sufficiently address the dual epidemics of COVID-19 and HIV, the healthcare system in China may need to adopt more flexibility, allocate resources successfully, and develop effective strategies to reach vulnerable populations such as communities affected by HIV during another infectious disease epidemic. This may also be an opportunity to engage and educate the public as well as PLWH in reducing HIV stigma and improving coping and mental health issues related to COVID-19 and HIV.</p>
