<p>As published data that support the use of tocilizumab are currently limited, properly designed, randomised trials are essential to understand the true impact of this therapy in COVID-19. Two non-randomised clinical trials are currently ongoing in China, evaluating the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in larger groups of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, a phase III study (COVACTA) will enroll hospitalised adults with severe COVID-19 pneumonia globally, starting from April 2020. This study will be a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial. A US-based phase II/III trial will evaluate the efficacy of sarilumab (Kevzara), another IL-6 receptor antagonist, in adults hospitalised with serious complications from COVID-19. In the double-blind phase II trial, the primary endpoint will be reduction of fever and the secondary endpoint the decreased need for supplemental oxygen.</p>
