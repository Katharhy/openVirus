<p>Tocilizumab (Actemra) is a humanised interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist that was approved to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A non-peer reviewed report describes the results of a single-arm Chinese trial in which 21 severe or critical COVID-19 patients received tocilizumab.

 </sup> On the first day after receiving tocilizumab, the body temperature of all patients returned to normal conditions and remained stable for the next days. In addition, the need for supplemental oxygen decreased in 75% of the treated patients. Although promising, the lack of a control group makes it difficult to interpret the true benefit of this therapy. Based on these results, China updated its treatment guidelines and approved the use of tocilizumab to treat COVID-19 patients with serious lung damage and high IL-6 levels.
