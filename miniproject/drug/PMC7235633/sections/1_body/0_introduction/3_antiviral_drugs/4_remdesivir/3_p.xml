 </sup> This patient initially presented with mild symptoms including a cough and low-grade intermittent fevers, without evidence of pneumonia. However, by illness day 9 the patient progressed to pneumonia. As the clinical status of the patient worsened, compassionate administration of remdesivir was pursued. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir was initiated on day 11 of illness. On illness day 12, the clinical condition of the patient improved. Supplementation with exogenous oxygen was stopped. Although encouraging, the apparent success of remdesivir treatment in this one patient does not prove that the drug is effective. Remdesivir is now being evaluated in COVID-19 patients in five clinical studies worldwide: two studies in China, and studies in the United States, Singapore and South Korea. Results of these trials are not available yet.
