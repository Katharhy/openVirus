<p>Favipiravir was evaluated in clinical trials for influenza virus infections, mainly in Japan, in which the drug was well tolerated. Reported side effects were mild to moderate diarrhoea, asymptomatic increase of transaminases, and uncommonly decreased neutrophil counts. Importantly, favipiravir is contraindicated in women who might be or are pregnant and in lactating women because of its association with embryonic deaths and teratogenicity in animal studies.
