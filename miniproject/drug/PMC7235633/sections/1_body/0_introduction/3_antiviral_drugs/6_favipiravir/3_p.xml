<p>Favipiravir has modest antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture (EC

 </sup> Activity against other coronaviruses in cells or animal models has not been reported. Despite the rather weak scientific base for the use of favipiravir as an anti-coronavirus drug, clinical trials with favipiravir have been conducted in China. In an open-label, non-randomised controlled study, 35 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were treated with oral favipiravir (day 1: 1600 mg twice daily; days 2–14: 600 mg twice daily) plus interferon-alpha by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily).

 </sup> In the control group, 45 patients were treated with LPV/r (days 1–14: 400 mg/100 mg twice daily) plus interferon-alpha by aerosol inhalation. Both treatments were continued until viral clearance was confirmed or until 14 days after the start of treatment. The median time of viral clearance for the patients treated with favipiravir was 4 days, which was significantly shorter than the time for patients in the control group with LPV/r (11 days). The report of this study does not clarify in which type of samples viral clearance was studied. Chest computed tomography scans improved in the favipiravir-treated group (91.4% vs. 62.2% in the LPV/r treated group).
