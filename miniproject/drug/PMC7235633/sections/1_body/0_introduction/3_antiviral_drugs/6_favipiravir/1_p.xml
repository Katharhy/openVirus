<p>Another molecule that is being evaluated in COVID-19 patients in China is favipiravir. Favipiravir (T-705) is an antiviral drug that has been approved in 2014 in Japan to treat pandemic influenza virus infections. It acts as a prodrug which is converted intracellularly into its ribofuranosyl 5â€²-triphosphate metabolite (favipiravir-RTP).

 </sup> Interestingly, this molecule is able to inhibit a broad range of other RNA viruses.

 </sup> The exact mode of action that underlies this broad-spectrum anti-RNA virus activity has not been completely unravelled. It is hypothesised that favipiravir-RTP could be misincorporated in a growing viral RNA chain, or that it could act by binding to conserved polymerase domains, thus preventing viral RNA replication. Incorporation of favipiravir-RTP in the nascent viral RNA could result in lethal mutagenesis by ambiguous base-pairing or in chain termination.
