<p>A number of clinical trials has been conducted in more than 10 hospitals in China to assess the efficacy of chloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients. In a recent publication,
 <sup>

 </sup> it was stated that ‘according to the news briefing’, ‘results from more than 100 patients have demonstrated that chloroquine phosphate is superior to the control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promoting a virus negative conversion, and shortening the disease course’. However, no data from these clinical trials have yet been released to support this announcement, making it impossible to draw firm conclusions. In France, 26 COVID-19 patients were treated for 6 days with hydroxychloroquine (200 mg, three times per day).

 </sup> Six of these patients also received azithromycin. Sixteen patients were used as the control group. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was measured in nasopharyngeal swabs daily during the treatment. During the study, six patients from the treated group had to be excluded and were not considered in data analysis. Three patients had to be transferred to intensive care units, one left the hospital because the patient tested negative, one stopped treatment due to side effects and one person died during the treatment. The authors reported clearance in SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal swabs in 57% of chloroquine-treated patients compared to 12.5% of untreated patients at day 6 post-inclusion in the study. In addition, a synergistic effect of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine was suggested, because all patients treated with this combination cleared viral RNA by day 6 post-inclusion. However, as not all patients entered the study at the same stage of the disease, it is difficult to assess whether the clearance in viral RNA was due to the treatment or due to the immune system of the patient. Furthermore, the combination of chloroquine and azithromycin is associated with severe QT prolongation and should thus be considered with care. Before chloroquine can be considered safe and effective as a treatment for COVID-19, more studies are needed.
