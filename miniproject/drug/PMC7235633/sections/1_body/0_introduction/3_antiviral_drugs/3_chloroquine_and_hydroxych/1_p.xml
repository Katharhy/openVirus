<p>Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are anti-malaria drugs that have been widely used to treat malaria patients. Due to the emergence of chloroquine-resistant 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites, the use of chloroquine to treat malaria has been more restricted. Hydroxychloroquine is also administered to patients with auto-immune disorders such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are considered as safe drugs and the side effects are usually mild and transient. However, it is important to note that the window between therapeutic and toxic doses is narrow. Chloroquine poisoning has been associated with cardiovascular symptoms and can be life-threatening. Self-treatment with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is therefore not recommended.
