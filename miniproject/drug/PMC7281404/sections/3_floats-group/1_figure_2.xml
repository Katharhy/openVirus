  <p>Inflammatory responses triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two inflammatory pathways may be distinguished. The primary pathway occurs as an early response to viral infection before the development of neutralizing antibodies (NAb). The secondary pathway begins with the release of Nab, which signifies the development of adaptive immunity. Triggering the FcR-mediated-inflammatory response is mediated by the virus-NAb complex and may lead to acute lung injury through several pathways including the release of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-8 (IL-8) from macrophages.</p>
