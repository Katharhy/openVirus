<p>Receptor-mediated endocytosis is the most common pathway for virus entry to the cells. ACE2, a cell surface protein expressed by cells in the kidney, blood vessels, heart, and, most importantly, lung AT2 alveolar epithelial cells, is the receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to infect lung cells [

AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) is a pivotal regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis; thus, the disruption of AAK1 would interfere with the virus passage into the cells and further prevent the intracellular assembly of virus particles [
