<p>Logically, low cellular membrane ACE2 expression may reduce the chance of cells to be entered by SARS-CoV-2, but at the same time, it leads to the activation of AT1R with subsequent lung tissue injury. However, the higher the expression of ACE2 on the lung cell surface, the higher the chance of viral entry and the lower chance lung injury, due to minimal AT1R activation. This is the main reason why ACEi/ARB or rhACE2 may be useful in COVD-19 treatment. These opposing effects of ACE2 and, hence, ACEi/ARB or rhACE2, treatment in SARS-CoV-2 infection need more investigation.</p>
