<p>Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) are two related categories of antihypertensive treatment that are extensively used to treat hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. ACEi and ARB increase the expression of ACE2 on the lung epithelial cell surface [

 <xref rid="B129-pharmaceuticals-13-00096" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Therefore, it has been suggested that treatment with ACEi or ARB could have a higher expression of cell membrane-bound ACE2, exposing essential binding sites to SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. However, the reduction of ANGII synthesis by ACEi or the inhibition of ANGIIâ€™s physiological effect via ARB is thought to leave AT1R in interaction with ACE2 [
