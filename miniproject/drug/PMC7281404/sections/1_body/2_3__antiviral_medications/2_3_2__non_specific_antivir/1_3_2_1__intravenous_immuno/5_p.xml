<p>FcR can be blocked by IVIG, thus suppressing and pacifying the exuberant immune response. Several clinical trials have been registered to investigate the use of intravenous immunoglobulins (NCT04261426 and NCT04264858) or the convalescent plasma of recovered patients (NCT04342195) to treat severe cases of COVID-19. The role of IVIG in severe infections and sepsis is still controversial and warrants further well-designed clinical trials. While a previous randomized trial showed no benefit of IVIG on sepsis-related mortality [
