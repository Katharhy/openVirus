 <xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-13-00096" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It was found to be a promising antiviral drug against a broad range of viruses (RNA viruses including coronaviruses, e.g., SARS/MERS-CoV5). The drug acts in the post-entry phase, mainly by inhibiting the key enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), [
