In contrast, in a study that included 199 adult patients admitted to the hospital with severe COVID-19, lopinavir/ritonavir treatment did not show any benefits compared with the conventional care regarding the time to clinical improvement, viral load, or mortality [

However, the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir was included in two arms of the SOLIDARITY trial (with and without the addition of interferon-β). It was also included in another smaller study (150 participants were recruited) in comparison to hydroxychloroquine and a control (no intervention group) for 7–10 days (NCT04307693); see
