<p>Oseltamivir is a competitive viral neuraminidase enzyme inhibitor. The enzyme inhibition interferes with the release of progeny influenza virus from the infected host cells; thus, new viral cycles are inhibited. After the replication of the virus, progeny virions bind to the infected cell via sialic acid moieties on cell surface glycoproteins. Neuraminidase removes the sialic acid and allows for the release of progeny virions. Thus, neuraminidase inhibitors interfere with the final process of new virion release [
