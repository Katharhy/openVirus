<p>The S protein is extensively glycosylated, forming a homotrimer. It mediates virus entry through binding to specific receptors (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)) and fusion with the cell membrane of the host (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00096-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The S protein harbors the major antigen that stimulates the formation of neutralizing antibodies, in addition to targets of cytotoxic lymphocytes. The membrane (M) protein has a major role in viral assembly [

The nucleocapsid (N) protein is responsible for the regulation of viral RNA synthesis—it interacts with M protein during the budding of the virus. It forms part of the nucleocapsid (in association with the RNA). SARS-CoV-2 has sequence homology with the influenza virus through hemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein (HE). The HE binds to neuraminic acid on the host cell surface, leading to the adsorption of the virus on the cell surface. Such homology may denote an early recombination between the two viruses. Finally, the function of the envelope (E)protein is not fully elucidated. Proteins M, N, and E are essential for the virus’ assembly and release [
