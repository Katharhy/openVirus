<p>The incubation period is thought to be 14 days after exposure [

However, in 14% of cases, especially in the elderly, the symptoms of dyspnea and hypoxia may develop (with more than 50% lung involvement on computed tomography (CT) scan). In around 5% of cases, in a late phase of the disease, respiratory failure (due to acute lung injury), shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction (due to the cytokine storm) may develop [

Severe cases of COVID-19 that require intensive care unit (ICU) admission have been shown to have increased plasma levels of key inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-2 (IL-2) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±), among many others, thus indicating a cytokine storm that correlates with disease severity [
