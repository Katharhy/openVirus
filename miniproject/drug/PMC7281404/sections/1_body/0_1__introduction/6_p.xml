<p>The broad strategies for COVID-19 treatment include the targeting of key enzymes of SARS-CoV-2, thus interfering with the viral cycle inside the host cell by using repurposed antiviral drugs previously tested for other coronaviruses like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other RNA virus infections, e.g., HIV and HCV. Other anti-infective agents have also been proposed. In addition, targets on the host cell surface may represent potential COVID-19 therapy-inhibiting virus entries. The second strategy is immunomodulation by using non-specific immunoglobulins and interferons or specific agents, e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies. Immunomodulation is particularly needed early in the disease to boost antiviral immunity, as well as in severe cases where an uncontrolled immune response may lead to acute lung injury and other organ damage.</p>
