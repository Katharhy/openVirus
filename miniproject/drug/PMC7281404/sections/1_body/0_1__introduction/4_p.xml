<p>The significant advances and continuous progress of computational analysis have greatly served the study of epidemiological aspects COVID-19 through data collection, compilation, and dissemination. In parallel, advances in molecular technology and the availability of the virus genome database have allowed for the identification of the virus and its mutations. An important approach to drug discovery is the screening of chemical libraries, including a large number of available molecules or databases of transcriptional signatures in various cell lines. Ongoing studies are conducted to validate such molecules as potential therapies [
