<p>Ivermectin has numerous medical uses in which antiviral activity is considered one of the experimental targets. Ivermectin in sub-nanomolar range EC
 <sub>50</sub> inhibits the replication of the yellow fever virus [

Ivermectin is also able to inhibit other flavivirus replication, including: dengue, tick-borne encephalitis, and Japanese encephalitis viruses. One of the mechanisms involved in this inhibition is the targeting of the activity of the non-structural enzyme 3 helicase [

Ivermectin has also been demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of importin α/β, which mediates the nuclear transport of several RNA viruses. Thus, ivermectin blocks the nuclear trafficking of RNA viral proteins. Ivermectin has been shown to have potent antiviral activity against HIV-1 and dengue viruses. Both types of viruses depend on the importin protein system. Ivermectin may also disrupt the HIV-1 integrase in HIV-1 in addition to the NS-5 (non-structural protein 5) polymerase in dengue viruses [
