<p>To investigate the effect of ivermectin on SARS-CoV-2, Vero/hSLAM cells with SARS-CoV-2 that were isolated Australia/VIC01/2020 were treated with ivermectin [
 <xref rid="B117-pharmaceuticals-13-00096" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Ivermectin administration resulted in a successful viral loss by 48 h with no further reduction in viral RNA at 72 h. The authors hypothesized that ivermectin exerts its antiviral activity by inhibiting the nuclear import of viral proteins that is mediated by importinα/β1—the same mechanism discussed before for other RNA viruses.
