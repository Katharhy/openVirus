<p id="Par6">The precise effect of treatment with various oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents on the severity of COVID-19 is not known, though there are some theoretical considerations. Metformin has shown modest benefits in lower respiratory tract infections and pulmonary tuberculosis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, propensity of thiazolidinediones to cause fluid retention and the risk of congestive heart failure in COVID-19 would make these agents unfavourable for treatment. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists have has been shown to increase ACE2 and increase surfactant in experimental animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Practical significance of changes in ACE2 levels with use of thiazolidinediones and glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists is not known. Sulfonylureas are effective, but the risk of hypoglycaemia especially in the setting of irregular meals might preclude their use. Nevertheless, sulfonylureas can be considered whenever blood glucose monitoring is possible.
