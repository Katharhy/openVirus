<p id="Par8">There is increasing use of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors worldwide and in India. Interestingly, SGLT-2 inhibitors could also activate ACE2 indirectly especially if used along with ACE inhibitors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. There is a hypothetical possibility of SGLT-2 inhibitors reducing lactate production because of reduction in oxygen demand of tissues, which could reduce viral entry by raising cytosolic pH [

Further, caution about dehydration and the possibility of euglycaemic ketoacidosis need to be observed when using SGLT-2 inhibitors in sick patients with COVID-19. Insulin has also been shown to increase ACE2 expression by attenuating the effect of a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM-17) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Practical relevance of these findings is not known at present. In any case, insulin remains the agent of choice to control sugars in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. This however necessitates frequent monitoring of blood glucose and poses some practical concerns in terms of increasing the exposure of healthcare provider to the COVID-19 patient. Strategies like single dose of basal insulin and self-monitoring of glucose by patients are worth considering in that context. Further, technologies like remote continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pump could be useful.
