<p id="Par18">There have been several commentaries on the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, several unanswered questions remain, about which the knowledge and information is limited. Clearly, further research could lead to important insights (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Some of these are discussed below.

   <p id="Par19">What is the natural history of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes? The natural course of the disease after infection of patients with diabetes with SARS CoV-2 has not been documented well. For example, we don’t know if the incubation period is different in people with diabetes. It is also possible those patients of diabetes who are young, have short duration of diabetes, and well controlled may have less severe COVID-19 infection. There is a possibility of reduced viral clearance in diabetes as has been reported in patients who are on corticosteroids [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This could have public health implications as the patients with diabetes could remain infectious for a longer period than those without diabetes.

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Chloroquine has a weak anti-hyperglycaemic effect and there is a theoretical risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with other anti-hyperglycaemic drugs.

      <p id="Par25">There are restrictions on movement of people and ‘lockdowns’ in several parts of the world in order to contain the pandemic. This poses some challenges in the evaluation and treatment of patients with diabetes. There are limited opportunities for exercise as regular walks and visits to gyms or swimming pools are not possible. Dietary irregularity could occur because of staying at home.</p>

A prediction model of the effect of lockdown in India on blood glucose showed a 3.6% increase in HbA1c at the end of 45 days of lockdown and future increase in diabetes-related complications [

   <p id="Par30">Use of remote education and advice: Telemedicine (also emails, texts) can be very helpful in these times to impart education and has been shown to improve glycaemia. Telemedicine guidelines for physicians in India have been published [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Patients need to be educated about the need to visit the hospital urgently in emergency situations like vomiting, drowsiness, shortness of breath, chest pain, weakness of limbs, altered sensorium, etc [

   <p id="Par31">COVID-19 testing for all patients with diabetes? Given the increased severity of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes, a case could be made for testing of all people with diabetes for the presence of disease. That would be a humongous task considering the high prevalence of diabetes. High-risk groups like those with high HbA1c, those with comorbidities, long duration of diabetes or elderly could be chosen for testing, however, utility of this approach remains to be proven, There are frequent false negative tests and repeated testing may be required in asymptomatic individuals. Since there is no treatment currently recommended for asymptomatic people, therefore apart from isolating them, detecting these patients might not prove meaningful clinically.</p>

   <p id="Par32">Ethnic variations in severity of COVI19 in patients with diabetes? In the United States, the disease has caused disproportionately more fatalities in Blacks and Asians compared with Whites [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. South Asia, Africa and Korea have seen much lower mortality than rest of the world. Whether it is because of the different approaches topublic health measures, innate immunity or due to some ethnicity-specific variability in response to viral infection, or availability of good medical resources, remains to be studied. Interactions between ethnicity, diabetes and severity of COVID-19 will be of interest, considering the racial disparities in the prevalence of diabetes. According to a recent report, prevalence of COVID-19 and mortality due to the disease correlated significantly with frequency of D allele in ACE gene [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Such polymorphisms in ACE gene as well as several other genes involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 might be responsible for individual and ethnic variations in disease course.
