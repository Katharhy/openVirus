<p id="Par11">There has been a lot of interest in ACE inhibitors and ARBs following the identification of ACE2 as the receptor for SARS CoV-2. ACE inhibitors and ARBs increase the levels of ACE2 by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 2. Increased ACE2 expression could theoretically increase viral binding and entry into cell, though there is no clinical evidence to support this otherwise attractive hypothesis. Reduced angiotensin 2 as a result of ACE inhibition and increased angiotensin 1–7 as a result of increased activity of ACE2 could reduce the cytosolic pH, which could result in more favourable environment for viral endocytosis [
