<p id="Par5">In this respect role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in pathogenesis of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes is intriguing. SARS CoV-2 enters the cell by binding to ACE2, a process which involves many steps and several enzymes and proteins [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], which may predispose to more severe lung injury. On the other hand, ACE2 is a receptor for SARS CoV-2 and this downregulation might reduce the entry of virus into cells. These issues are further discussed below in context of use of anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hypertensive drugs.
