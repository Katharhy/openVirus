<p id="Par3">Patients with diabetes who develop COVID-19 have been seen to have a worse prognosis and increased mortality in most studies. In 201 Chinese patients with diabetes a hazard ratio of 2.34 (95% CI, 1.35–4.05; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.002) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] has been reported. Further, meta-analysis of nine studies from China (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1936) showed a significant correlation between severity of COVID-19 and diabetes (OR, 2.67, 95% CI; 1.91–3.74; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Similarly, case fatality rate was 7.3% in patients with diabetes as opposed to 2.3% in those without diabetes in a report of 44,672 patients of COVID-19 by Chinese Centre for Disease Control [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A recent study in 1122 patients with COVID-19 in 88 centres across the USA found diabetes to be associated with more than fourfold increase in mortality [
