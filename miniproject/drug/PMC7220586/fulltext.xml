Several factors especially the impaired immune response, heightened inflammatory response and hypercoagulable state contribute to the increased disease severity. However, there are many contentious issues about which the evidence is rather limited. There are some theoretical concerns about the effects of different anti-hyperglycaemic drugs. Similarly, despite the recognition of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), and the role of ACE2 in lung injury; there are conflicting results with the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) in these patients. Management of patients with diabetes in times of restrictions on mobility poses some challenges and novel approaches like telemedicine can be useful. There is a need to further study the natural course of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes and to understand the individual, regional and ethnic variations in disease prevalence and course.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Diabetes complications</kwd><kwd>Epidemiology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par2">The high prevalence of diabetes globally makes it a frequent comorbidity in patients with coronavirus-associated disease 2019 (COVID-19). Though diabetes increases the risk of infection in general, most studies have reported prevalence of diabetes almost similar to that in general population in patients with COVID-19. A meta-analysis of eight trials in China showed that diabetes was present in 8% of 46,248 patients with COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Understandably, prevalence of diabetes in patients with COVID-19 varies by region, age and ethnicity. It is not known whether patients with diabetes with well-controlled blood glucose levels have an increased risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Why patients with diabetes have increased severity and mortality?</title><p id="Par3">Patients with diabetes who develop COVID-19 have been seen to have a worse prognosis and increased mortality in most studies. In 201 Chinese patients with diabetes a hazard ratio of 2.34 (95% CI, 1.35&#x02013;4.05; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] has been reported. Further, meta-analysis of nine studies from China (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1936) showed a significant correlation between severity of COVID-19 and diabetes (OR, 2.67, 95% CI; 1.91&#x02013;3.74; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Similarly, case fatality rate was 7.3% in patients with diabetes as opposed to 2.3% in those without diabetes in a report of 44,672 patients of COVID-19 by Chinese Centre for Disease Control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A recent study in 1122 patients with COVID-19 in 88 centres across the USA found diabetes to be associated with more than fourfold increase in mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">How diabetes increases severity of COVID-19 is unclear, though several factors may be responsible (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Poor glycaemic control impairs several aspects of the innate and adaptive immune response to viral infections and to the potential secondary bacterial infection in the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Defects in immunity namely inappropriate T-cell action, impaired natural killer cell activity and defects in complement action could reduce viral clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Interestingly, ARDS in patients with COVID-19 is driven by severe hypoxaemia despite relatively well-preserved lung mechanics. Pre-existing proinflammatory state could accentuate the cytokine storm, which is believed to be responsible for ARDS as well as multi-organ dysfunction in COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In this context, it is important to note that there is strong association between type 2 diabetes, obesity and abnormal secretion of adipokines and cytokines like TNF-alfa and interferon, which may further impair immunity and predispose to severe infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Further, diabetes is associated with increased plasminogen levels which has been postulated to increase the virulence of SARS CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Presence of these inflammation and prothrombotic factors has been shown in a study in 174 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China; significantly higher serum levels of interleukein 6, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C&#x02010;reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen and D&#x02010;dimer were reported in patients with diabetes compared with those without diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Increased viral replication in diabetes may also due to an increase in furin, which is a type&#x02010;1 membrane&#x02010;bound protease involved in the entry of coronaviruses into the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, pre-existing comorbidities associated with diabetes like hypertension, coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease further worsen the prognosis. Lastly, hypoglycaemia which could occur during treatment of diabetes may additionally worsen the clinical outcomes.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Reasons of increased severity of COVID-19 in diabetes based on various studies (mostly unadjusted analyses).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Established</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;(1) Glycaemic instability: hyperglycaemia and possibly hypoglycaemia</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;(2) Immune defects especially impaired T-cell response</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;(3) Associated comorbidities like obesity, heart and kidney diseases</td></tr><tr><td>Postulated</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;(1) Chronic subclinical inflammation, increased interleukin 6</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;(2) Increased plasmin</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;(3) Reduced ACE2</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;(4) Increased furin (involved in entry of virus into cell)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par5">In this respect role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in pathogenesis of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes is intriguing. SARS CoV-2 enters the cell by binding to ACE2, a process which involves many steps and several enzymes and proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. There is experimental evidence for downregulation of ACE2 in diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], which may predispose to more severe lung injury. On the other hand, ACE2 is a receptor for SARS CoV-2 and this downregulation might reduce the entry of virus into cells. These issues are further discussed below in context of use of anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hypertensive drugs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Anti-hyperglycaemic drugs: correct selection and potential problems</title><p id="Par6">The precise effect of treatment with various oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents on the severity of COVID-19 is not known, though there are some theoretical considerations. Metformin has shown modest benefits in lower respiratory tract infections and pulmonary tuberculosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], though gastrointestinal tolerability in sick patients is of concern. Thiazolidinediones have been shown to increase ACE2 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, propensity of thiazolidinediones to cause fluid retention and the risk of congestive heart failure in COVID-19 would make these agents unfavourable for treatment. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists have has been shown to increase ACE2 and increase surfactant in experimental animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Practical significance of changes in ACE2 levels with use of thiazolidinediones and glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists is not known. Sulfonylureas are effective, but the risk of hypoglycaemia especially in the setting of irregular meals might preclude their use. Nevertheless, sulfonylureas can be considered whenever blood glucose monitoring is possible.</p><p id="Par7">There is some data regarding use of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors from previous viral epidemics. DPP4 is the prime receptor for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus responsible for its entry into cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Hence the possibility of DPP4 facilitating the entry of SARS CoV-2 into the cell cannot be ruled out. In that context, it is an interesting postulation that widespread use of DPP4 inhibitors in India and many other countries might be protecting individuals with diabetes from this infection. On the other hand, DPP4 inhibitors can potentially interfere with immune response which may be harmful, but clinical data from DPP4 inhibitors has shown that this is generally not the case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">There is increasing use of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors worldwide and in India. Interestingly, SGLT-2 inhibitors could also activate ACE2 indirectly especially if used along with ACE inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. There is a hypothetical possibility of SGLT-2 inhibitors reducing lactate production because of reduction in oxygen demand of tissues, which could reduce viral entry by raising cytosolic pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Further, caution about dehydration and the possibility of euglycaemic ketoacidosis need to be observed when using SGLT-2 inhibitors in sick patients with COVID-19. Insulin has also been shown to increase ACE2 expression by attenuating the effect of a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM-17) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Practical relevance of these findings is not known at present. In any case, insulin remains the agent of choice to control sugars in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. This however necessitates frequent monitoring of blood glucose and poses some practical concerns in terms of increasing the exposure of healthcare provider to the COVID-19 patient. Strategies like single dose of basal insulin and self-monitoring of glucose by patients are worth considering in that context. Further, technologies like remote continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pump could be useful.</p><p id="Par9">Thus, it appears safe to continue the usual anti-hyperglycemic medications in most patients who have mild infection, good general condition and normal oral intake. However, SGLT-2 inhibitors might need discontinuation due to the risk of dehydration and euglycaemic ketoacidosis. Metformin may also need to be stopped if there is vomiting or poor oral intake. Doses of other anti-hyperglyacemic drugs like sulfonylureas and insulin may have to be altered depending upon the blood glucose levels. Hospitalised patients especially those requiring intensive care would need insulin for glycaemic control.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Drugs for treatment of comorbidities in diabetes</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB)</title><p id="Par10">These are commonly used drugs in patients with diabetes, especially in those with hypertension and kidney dysfunction.

ACE inhibitors and ARBs increase the levels of ACE2 by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 2. Increased ACE2 expression could theoretically increase viral binding and entry into cell, though there is no clinical evidence to support this otherwise attractive hypothesis. Reduced angiotensin 2 as a result of ACE inhibition and increased angiotensin 1&#x02013;7 as a result of increased activity of ACE2 could reduce the cytosolic pH, which could result in more favourable environment for viral endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Also, angiotensin 1&#x02013;7 has been shown to increase sympathetic activity by acting on Mas receptors in the brainstem, which could contribute to cardiovascular morbidity observed in these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, most of these concerns are hypothetical with minimal evidence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Scientific experimental data that support benefit due to ACE inhibitors/ARB in COVID-19</title><p id="Par12">Increased ACE2 might not result in increased viral entry because of the limited availability of the serine protease TMPRSS2, which is required for viral binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Increased ACE2 and consequently angiotensin 1&#x02013;7 have vasodilatory and antifibrotic effects and have been shown to be protective against lung injury in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Treatment with ARBs was reported to reduce mortality in Ebola virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

It is also possible those patients of diabetes who are young, have short duration of diabetes, and well controlled may have less severe COVID-19 infection.
