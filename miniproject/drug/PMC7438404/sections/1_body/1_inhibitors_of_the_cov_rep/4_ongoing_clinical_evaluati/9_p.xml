<p>Chloroquine is a 9-aminoquinole that increases the pH in acidic vesicles (
 <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">Mauthe et al., 2018</xref>) and possesses antiviral activities against HIV and other viruses (
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">Jacobson et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Al-Bari, 2017</xref>). Chloroquine was described as an entry inhibitor of SARS-CoV infection in Vero cells and prevented cell-to-cell spread of the virus (
 <xref rid="B228" ref-type="bibr">Vincent et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, it affected the entry and post-entry stages of the replicative cycle of FCoV in 
 <italic>Felis catus</italic> cells and monocytes. Additionally, an 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study in cats demonstrated that treatment with chloroquine improved the clinical score of treated groups when compared to the untreated group (
 <xref rid="B211" ref-type="bibr">Takano et al., 2013</xref>). Chloroquine also had its anti-CoV activities tested in Vero cells (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 5.47 μM) (

 <xref rid="B251" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2020b</xref>). Despite the performance of chloroquine 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, clinical studies conducted in China and France showed contradictory clinical data (

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Chen Z. et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">Molina et al., 2020</xref>). Gao and collaborators indicated that chloroquine phosphate was recommended to treat COVID-19-associated pneumonia only during urgent clinical demand because of its antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2020</xref>). Hydroxychloroquine is an analog of chloroquine that was described as having antiviral activity, inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.72 μM (
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B251" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2020b</xref>). In clinical trials, an open-label non-randomized study by Gautret and colleagues affirmed that hydroxychloroquine reduced symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 patients and that association with azithromycin could reinforce its effects (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Gautret et al., 2020</xref>). However, these results have been questioned. The study had a small sample size, and there were limitations in the methodologies (
