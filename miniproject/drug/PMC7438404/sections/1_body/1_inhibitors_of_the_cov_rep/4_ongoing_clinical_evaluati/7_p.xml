<p>Broad-spectrum drugs used against parasitic infections such as Ivermectin (

 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">Laing et al., 2017</xref>) have also been investigated due to their antiviral activity against Dengue virus (DENV), Influenza A viruses, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and HIV (

Caly and collaborators assessed the effect of Ivermectin on SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells, showing that, at 5 μM, the compound presented no toxicity to cells and inhibited up to 99% of viral replication by a possible antiviral effect on viral release, which is consistent with previous data on its activity against other RNA viruses (

Clinical trials have been conducted in different medical centers in Argentina (NCT04381884), Mexico (NCT04391127), Spain (NCT04390022), and the United States (NCT04374279) to assess the clinical implications of the use of Ivermectin for COVID-19. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no published results on this topic. NCT04343092, a phase 1 clinical trial in Iraq, was conducted to its completion and evaluated the efficacy of Ivermectin in COVID-19 patients, so the results might be published soon.
