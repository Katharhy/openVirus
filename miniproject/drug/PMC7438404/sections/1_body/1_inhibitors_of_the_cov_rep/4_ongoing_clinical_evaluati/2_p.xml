<p>The nucleoside analog Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a monophosphoramidate prodrug that has been described as having antiviral activity against the EBOV in non-human primates (
 <xref rid="B236" ref-type="bibr">Warren et al., 2016</xref>, 57). Its activity was assessed in human airway epithelial (HAE) cells infected with SARS-CoV (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.069 μM and CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 10 μM) and MERS-CoV (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.074 μM and CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 10 μM) and was demonstrated to inhibit RdRp of these viruses. Also, GS-5734 reduced infectious virus production of bat CoV by 1.5 to 2.0 log
 <sub>10</sub> in HAE cells and reduced virus titers and virus-induced lung pathologies in a SARS-CoV assay

The clinical efficacy of GS-5734 has been assessed by several clinical trials in different countries like France (NCT04365725), Canada (NCT04330690), and the United States (NCT04292899), which have been conducted based on the first reported treatment of COVID-19 with Remdesivir in Washington, United States (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Holshue et al., 2020</xref>). In the first findings from Wang and coworkers, which were from a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, and placebo-controlled trial with 255 patients, Remdesivir did not present significant antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2, nor did it improve clinical outcomes (
 <xref rid="B234" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020d</xref>). To date, there are several active clinical trials registered in the PubMed database involving this compound. However, most of them presented no conclusive outcomes.
