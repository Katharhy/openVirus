<p>Other potential antiviral peptides were selected by Struck and colleges. Through the exploitation of bioinformatics tools, the authors were able to predict sixteen peptides with effective binding onto the receptor-binding domain (RDB) present in S proteins of CoVs. These compounds were then synthesized, and the hexapeptide Tyr-Lys-Tyr-Arg-Tyr-Leu at 14 mM inhibited SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 infection in Vero cells without triggering cytotoxicity (
 <xref rid="B208" ref-type="bibr">Struck et al., 2012</xref>). This peptide was designed specifically to bind to the site of interaction with S protein and does not interfere with ACE2 receptor activity, so it might be a good candidate for blocking SARS-CoV-2 entry without impairing host metabolism. Taking into consideration that cellular factors such as the Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) converting enzyme (TACE) facilitate SARS-CoV entry (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Haga et al., 2008</xref>), it is reasonable to suggest that TACE inhibitors could hinder SARS-CoV infection. In this context, TAPI-2, a compound able to inhibit TACE, has shown potent antiviral activity, promoting a 65% blockade of SARS-CoV entry in HEK-293T cells. However, the compound did not affect the virus titer in
