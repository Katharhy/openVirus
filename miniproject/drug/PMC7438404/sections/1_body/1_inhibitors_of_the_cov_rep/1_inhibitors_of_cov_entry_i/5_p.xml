<p>An extensive study screened a library of compounds following Lipinski’s rule (
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">Lipinski et al., 2001</xref>) and identified three noncytotoxic compounds capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV pseudoparticle entry into 293T cells (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Adedeji et al., 2013</xref>). 
 <italic>N</italic>-(9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydroanthracen-2-yl)benzamide (SSAA09E1) blocked early interactions of SARS-CoV S protein with ACE2 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 6.7 μM and CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 μM), whereas 
 <italic>N</italic>-[[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]-1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide (SSAA09E2) affected cathepsin L activity (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.1 μM and CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 μM). Conversely, [(Z)-1-thiophen-2-ylethylideneamino]thiourea (SSAA09E3) prevented the fusion of the viral envelope with host membrane cells by direct interaction with spike protein (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 9.7 μM and CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 20 μM) (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Adedeji et al., 2013</xref>). The compound SSAA09E3 presented the highest cytotoxic, probably due to the interactions with host proteins. The authors suggested that since these three compounds are derived from molecules with antiviral activities and presented good oral bioavailability and rapid systemic distribution in animal models, they might exhibit interesting pharmacokinetics (
