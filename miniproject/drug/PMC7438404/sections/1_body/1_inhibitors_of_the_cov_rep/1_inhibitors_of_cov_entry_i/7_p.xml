<p>The exploitation of other natural compounds such as proteins as potential anti-CoV drugs has also been performed. Griffithsin (GRFT) is a protein isolated from the red alga 
 <italic>Griffithsia</italic> sp. that has shown powerful viral entry inhibition against several enveloped viruses, such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). GRFT is capable of binding to terminal mannoses of oligosaccharides and also to glycans localized on the viral envelope glycoproteins (
