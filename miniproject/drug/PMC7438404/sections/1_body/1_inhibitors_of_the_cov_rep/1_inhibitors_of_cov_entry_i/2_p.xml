<p>In this context, a survey encompassing 
 <italic>in silico</italic> studies of more than 140 thousand potential S-protein-inhibiting drugs indicated that the molecule 
 <italic>N</italic>-(2-aminoethyl)-1 aziridineethanamine (NAAE) showed the highest docking grade (-23.7 kcal/mol) (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Huentelman et al., 2004b</xref>). The activity of NAAE was further confirmed by employing an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> enzymatic inhibitory assay, using a human recombinant ACE2. In this assay, ACE2 removed the C-terminal dinitrophenyl moiety that quenched the inherent fluorescence of the 7-methoxycoumain group, increasing the fluorescence when ACE2 was active (

 <sub>50</sub>) of 57 μmol mL
 <sup>−1</sup> (

In addition, 293T cells expressing ACE2 receptor were incubated with NAAE and then with S glycoprotein-expressing 293T cells, and measurement of β-galactosidase activity (reported gene in cell-cell fusion) was performed. NAAE at 0.5 μM inhibited 50% of SARS-CoVs spike protein-mediated cell fusion, suggesting that NAAE might be a candidate for treating SARS infection by impairing viral attachment via interference with ACE2 (
