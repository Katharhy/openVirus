<p>Other biomolecules that are promising as drug antivirals are interference RNAs (iRNAs). These macromolecules are small non-coding RNAs associated with controlling the expression of genetic information (
 <xref rid="B243" ref-type="bibr">Wilson and Doudna, 2013</xref>) and have been described as promising candidates for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV), HCV, HIV, and human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) infections (
 <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B195" ref-type="bibr">Shah and Schaffer, 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B190" ref-type="bibr">Sanan-Mishra et al., 2017</xref>). Short interference RNAs (siRNAs) were described as being effective for

 <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr">McDonagh et al., 2011</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Most recently, Li and colleagues designed and synthesized siRNAs that targeted the M and N genes of swine and porcine coronaviruses (SECoV and PDCoV, respectively). These siRNAs inhibited up to 99% of the expression of these proteins in both Vero and LLC-PK1 infected cells (
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, synthetic siRNAs targeting the structural proteins E, M, and N of SARS-CoV have also been developed and showed reductions of the target gene expressions in Vero cells (
 <xref rid="B201" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, siRNAs targeting the structural proteins 7a, 7b, 3a, 3b, and S reduced SARS-CoV progeny in Vero cells by approximately 70% (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Åkerström et al., 2007</xref>). The different authors propose that treatment with siRNAs can improve treatment-resistance among viruses and that these molecules can be designed to target multiple proteins, aiming at broad-spectrum activity.
