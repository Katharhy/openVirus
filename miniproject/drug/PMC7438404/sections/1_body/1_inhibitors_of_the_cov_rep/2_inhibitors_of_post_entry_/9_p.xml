<p>An additional potential compound is mycophenolic acid (MPA), an antibiotic derived from penicillium fungal species (
 <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">PubChem, 2005b</xref>), which inhibited MERS-CoV replication in Vero cells with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2.87 Î¼M (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Hart et al., 2014</xref>). However, MPA was not active against SARS-CoV in either 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> or 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assay (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Barnard et al., 2006</xref>). The data suggested that MPA inhibits the enzyme IMP dehydrogenase, inducing apoptosis on alveolar macrophages and consequently inhibiting or suppressing cellular immune responses that are important for preventing or limiting viral infection (
