<p>In terms of other drug options for the post-entry stages of the viral replicative cycle, it is possible to report the activities of Niclosamide, a drug used in antihelminthic treatment (
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">Katz, 1977</xref>). Niclosamide presented antiviral activity on post-entry steps of SARS-CoV infection in Vero cells, with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1–3 μM and CC
 <sub>50</sub> of 250 μM (
 <xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, this compound suppressed the cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV at a concentration &lt;1 μM and inhibited viral replication with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of less than 0.1 μM in Vero E6 cells (
 <xref rid="B238" ref-type="bibr">Wen et al., 2007</xref>). Both authors suggested that Niclosamide impairs post-entry steps. However, this effect seems to not be related to an interaction with 3CLpro.
