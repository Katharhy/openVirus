<p>Finally, the nonstructural protein 10 (nsp10) of CoVs was described as being responsible for a stimulatory effect on nsp16, a classical S-adenosylmethionine-dependent (nucleoside-2’-
 <italic>O</italic>)-methyltransferase that acts in RNA binding or catalysis. The peptide TP29 was designed as a ligand to MHV nsp10 and presented broad-spectrum activity, inhibiting SARS-CoV (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 200 μM) and MHV (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 60 μM) replication in infected cell lines (
 <xref rid="B235" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). The authors also assessed TP29 activity in MHV infected mice and demonstrated that treatment improved survival, decreased viral load in liver, and induced type 1 IFN. Based on these data, it was suggested that TP29 impaired nsp10/nsp16 2’-
 <italic>O</italic>-MTase activity, dysregulating the genome replication process.
