<p>What is more, a nucleoside analog based on the acyclic sugar scaffold of acyclovir showed antiviral potential against coronaviruses (
 <xref rid="B213" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2004</xref>). Peters and contributors demonstrated that this compound has powerful antiviral activity against MERS-CoV (EC
 <sub>50</sub> and CC
 <sub>50</sub> of 23 and 71 μM, respectively) and HCoV-NL63 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> and CC
 <sub>50</sub> of 8.8 and 120 μM, respectively) (
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">Peters et al., 2015</xref>). However, the authors did not suggest mechanisms by which this analog impairs viral replication, leaving open to question whether it acts like its precursor acyclovir, impairing viral replication or by an alternative mechanism of action.
