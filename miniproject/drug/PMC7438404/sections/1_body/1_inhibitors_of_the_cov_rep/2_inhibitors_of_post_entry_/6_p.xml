<p>Ribavirin is a synthetic nucleoside analog of guanosine used for the treatment of patients chronically infected by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) (
 <xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">PubChem, 2005c</xref>). The antiviral activities of ribavirin against several RNA viruses have been described, and it also presents broad-spectrum antiviral activities for CoVs (

 <xref rid="B200" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2016</xref>). Its activities were described for SARS-CoV

 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Ferron et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, ribavirin showed good results for the treatment of critical MERS-CoV patients (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Al-Tawfiq et al., 2014</xref>), and the combined treatment of ribavirin with type I Interferons (IFN-I) in primate models improved MERS disease symptoms (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Falzarano et al., 2013b</xref>). Although ribavirin has been given as part of treatment regimens for SARS and MERS patients, meta-analyses of cases of study have found limited efficacy of its activities in treating patients with highly pathogenic coronavirus respiratory syndromes (
