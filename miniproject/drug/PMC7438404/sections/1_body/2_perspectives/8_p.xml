<p>Ongoing studies have been evaluating IFN-β and Ivermectin as treatments against COVID-19. IFN- β can be associated with other drugs, collaborating to control immune response against the viral infection (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). On the other hand, corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, sound promising, but there are some issues related to their use. These compounds induce immunosuppression and, when administered during initial phases (viral replication), might dysregulate T-cell production and activation of B cells for antibody secretion, which are essential for viral clearance (

Furthermore, convalescent plasma therapy is an alternative approach that presented positive effects in studies on SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 patients. However, its safety is not well defined due to donor-dependent variability and compatibility (antibody titers and other factors vary among donors), which might cause severe adverse effects in lung and cardiovascular system and, in some cases, may even transmit diseases (
