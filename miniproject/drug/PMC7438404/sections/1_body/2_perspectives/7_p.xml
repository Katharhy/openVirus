<p>Regarding clinical trials, most drugs discussed in this review presented adverse effects such as nausea, headache, diarrhea, urticaria, pathologies related to the gastrointestinal system, and interference with liver enzymes (

Remdesivir, Lopinavir and Ritonavir, and Umifenovir are drugs employed for the treatment of other viral infections such as EBOV and SARS-CoV, but, in the clinical trials with COVID-19 patients, these treatments did not reduce symptoms and/or decrease viral load. Tocilizumab, Chloroquine, and Hydroxychloroquine have been demonstrated to inhibit SARS-CoV-2
