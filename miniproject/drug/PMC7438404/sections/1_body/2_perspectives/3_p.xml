<p>Among the strategies for drug design, targeting host-immune factors or using iRNAs figure as promising alternatives for antiviral drug development. Also, the exploitation of 
 <italic>in silico</italic> studies for drug screening to seek specific targets, as well as for a better comprehension of their interactions with viral biomolecules, has been shown as a promising tool for expediting drug development. By narrowing down the number of drug candidates, 
 <italic>in silico</italic> studies have the potential to avoid the laborious and generally costly synthesis of many of these compounds (

 <xref rid="B227" ref-type="bibr">Villegas-Rosales et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, several predicted compounds in the literature have only been screened by 
 <italic>in silico</italic> and/or interaction assays (

 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">Kaeppler et al., 2005</xref>;

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Arya et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Balasubramaniam and Reis, 2020</xref>), which ultimately hinders the proper assessment of the antiviral activities of the compounds. Therefore, it is imperative that these studies be associated with 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assays in order to confirm the predicted activities in biological models and also to evaluate pharmacological outcomes (
 <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">National Research Council (US) Committee on Applications of Toxicogenomic Technologies to Predictive Toxicology, 2007</xref>). Therefore, this review encompassed only compounds that have been evaluated by, at least, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models (
