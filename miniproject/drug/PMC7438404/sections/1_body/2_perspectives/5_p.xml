<p>Here, we also described compounds that were evaluated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> to elucidate their role in the pathogenesis of CoVs as well as to assess possible adverse effects. It is important to emphasize that there is a lack of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> model assays, representing a delay in anti-CoV drug development, which directly impacts the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Here, we identified some studies that employed animal models, such as in Balb/c mice and C57BL/6, to evaluate the antiviral effect of compounds in CoV infection (

 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Hart et al., 2014</xref>). The 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assays allow the gathering of knowledge regarding the ADMeTox profile of these compounds in complex biological systems, the viral titers in different organs, host immune responses to the infection, and also potential tissue damage caused by the viruses in the presence or absence of candidate drugs, which represents an advance in understanding pathologies caused by viral infections (

It is also important to emphasize that protocols used in studies of animal-related viruses are not easily translated onto human CoVs, since these viruses are classified to different biological safety levels, representing a risk of infection to scientists (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">CDC, 2020b</xref>). Additionally, the pathologies induced by animal CoVs are mostly related to gastrointestinal symptoms, differently to what is observed for human-related CoVs, which mostly affect the upper respiratory system (
 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr">Pedersen et al., 1984</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Coleman and Frieman, 2014</xref>). The development of refined and secure protocols to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and its treatment options is required. Bearing in mind the obstacles cited above, assessment of the effect in animal models and further translation to humans remains one of the main challenges.
