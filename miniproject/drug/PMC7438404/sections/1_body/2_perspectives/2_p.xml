<p>As previously mentioned, most human-related CoVs emerged by zoonotic transmission from animals (

 <xref rid="B141" ref-type="bibr">Madhugiri et al., 2018</xref>), it is possible to hypothesize that compounds with antiviral activities against different human and/or animal CoVs (broad-spectrum activity) could be potential candidates for SARS-CoV-2 treatment. In a less optimistic scenario, the chemical structures of such compounds and their pharmacological outcomes have the potential to set some light on the drug design of possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.
