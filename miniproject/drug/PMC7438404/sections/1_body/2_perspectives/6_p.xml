 <sup>4</sup>-hydroxycytidine (NHC), TP29, Cyclosporin A (CsA), Alisporivir, iRNAs, Saracatinib, Tizoxanide, Nitazoxanide, Niclosamide, and Ribavirin. These compounds abrogated CoV infection

In addition, Saracatinib, Tizoxanide, Nitazoxanide, Niclosamide, and Ribavirin are molecules licensed to treat diseases such as those from viral and helminthic infections or Alzheimer’s disease, representing possibilities for clinical trials as repurposed drugs.
