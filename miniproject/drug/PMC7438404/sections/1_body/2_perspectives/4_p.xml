<p>In this context, from the molecules and drugs described as having 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity, we highlighted the most promising to suggest further evaluation using 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> systems of CoV infection, especially SARS-CoV-2 infection. The compounds are: NAAE, Glycyrrhizin, 2-acetamido-Î±-
 <sc>D</sc>-Glucopyranosylamine derivative, Tetrahydroquinoline oxocarbazate (CID 23631927), SSAA09E1, 2 and 3, Emodin, Eremomycin 27 and 29, Mucroporin-M1, Monoclonal antibody 47D11, AVLQSGFR, Phe-Phe dipeptide inhibitor C (JMF1521), GC373 and 376, 6-azauridine, Acyclic sugar scaffold of acyclovir, and Bananins. As described above, these compounds were capable of significantly impairing CoV infection in cell cultures and might enable important progress into the treatment of described CoVs as well as viruses that might be responsible for future viral outbreaks.
