<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) were first identified in 1960 (
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">Kahn and McIntosh, 2005</xref>) and were classified as members of the family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>. CoVs are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses with a genome varying from 25 to 32 kb (
 <xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">Payne, 2017</xref>). The viral structure is primarily formed by the structural spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The S, M, and E proteins are embedded in the viral envelope, which is a lipid bilayer derived from the host cell membrane. The N protein, on the other hand, interacts with the viral RNA into the core of the virion (
