<p>CoVs are linked to a zoonotic transmission due to their ability to infect different species. This can lead to host jumps, allowing the emergence of new coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 (

 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">Kipar et al., 2010</xref>). In humans, CoV transmission occurs by direct contact with droplets when infected and recipient individuals are in close contact (about one meter). These infectious oral and respiratory droplets produced by talking, coughing, sneezing need to contact the mucosae (mouth and nose) or conjunctiva (eyes) of the recipient person. Additionally, indirect transmission can occur by touching a surface with viable CoV and subsequent contact with mouth, nose, or eyes (
