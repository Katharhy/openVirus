<p>These viruses can infect vertebrate animals, causing acute to chronic diseases in the respiratory, cardiac, enteric, and central nervous systems, both in animals and humans (
 <xref rid="B237" ref-type="bibr">Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005</xref>). In animals, the most common CoVs are infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), feline CoV (FeCoV), and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), which infect chickens, felines, and rodents, respectively (

To date, there are seven known CoVs that cause diseases in humans: HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and, most recently, SARS-CoV-2 (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">CDC, 2020a</xref>). The CoVs HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 cause mild symptoms, similar to a common cold (
