<p>The high transmissibility and viral variability of the novel SARS-CoV-2, along with the lack of a vaccine or drugs to treat the infected patients, threaten the global health system. In this context, the development of effective antivirals is critical to provide short-term therapies able to reduce the severity of clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we summarize compounds described, from 2005 to date, to possess antiviral activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and/or 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> against CoVs and critically compare molecules that could be further investigated by their clinical applicability (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We also discuss the compounds that have reached clinical trials (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) as well as the potentiality of other molecules for application in (re)emergent CoVs outbreaks. Finally, we aim to encourage further research encompassing these compounds as potential SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates.
