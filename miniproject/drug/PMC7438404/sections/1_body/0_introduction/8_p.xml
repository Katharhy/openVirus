<p>Based in previous results in vaccine development for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV and the similarity of those viruses with SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Dhama et al., 2020</xref>), the current vaccine candidates are more focused on the S protein, since is a major inducer of neutralizing antibodies in infected patients (
 <xref rid="B230" ref-type="bibr">Walls et al., 2020</xref>). For this reason, efforts are concentrated on using approaches such as mRNA, DNA, viral vectors, or virus-like particles vaccines with a full-length S protein or S1 receptor-binding domain (RBD) to stimulate immune response and immunization (
