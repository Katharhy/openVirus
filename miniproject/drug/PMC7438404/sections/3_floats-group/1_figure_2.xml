  <p>Schematic representation of SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle in host cells. SARS-CoV-2 attaches to the host cells by interaction between the ACE2 receptors and spike proteins. After entry, viral uncoating process results in the release of viral genome and replication stage occurs (translation and transcription). Structural proteins are produced in intermediate compartment of endoplasmic reticulum with Golgi complex and forwarded to assembly, packaging and virus release. Compounds with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 are indicated in each step of virus replication cycle.</p>
