<p>As described above, ESCRT machinery might contribute to the release of other types of EVs besides exosomes, because it is involved in remodeling of plasma membrance (Assil et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). To date, many studies have reported that viral assembly and EVs biogenesis share some similarities, implying that the “hijacking” behavior of viruses in host cells could be in charge of sorting the viral proteins and RNAs into EVs. HIV is a typical example, it can assemble and release from infected cells via ESCRT machinery (Schorey et al., 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Influenza viruses bud from the plasma membrane of host cells similar to microvesicles (Lakdawala, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), and the similarities of protein profile between influenza virions and microvesicles secreted by uninfected cells have been confirmed by Hutchinson and colleagues, suggesting that influenza viruses can manipulate certain pathway normally used for microvesicles formation (Hutchinson et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). However, current evidences have suggested that no core ESCRT component involved in IAV particles assembly and budding, implying influenza virus may utilize the ESCRT-independent pathways to facilitate transportation of virus particles to the plasma membrane for release (Bruce et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Watanabe and Lamb, 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Alenquer and Amorim, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Bruce E. A. et al. (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) found that Rab 11 involved in the formation of virus particles of IAV by budding from the apical plasma membrane. Morphologically, the virus particles of IAV can take the shape of pleomorphic spheres or vastly elongated filaments. In the study of Bruce et al., Rab11 depletion caused defective budding, low formation of filamentous virions, and virus particles failed to pinch off from the plasma membrane, leading to virus particles apparently stalled in the process of budding. Those results suggested that Rab11 pathway was important in directing vesicular traffic, and influenza virus utilizes the Rab11 pathway for budding. Thereafter, other scholars suggested that Rab 11 was a critical host factor with an essential contribution to transport of vRNPs cargo to the plasma membrane in IAV-infected cells, revealing the potential mechanism of influenza virus genome delivery via a Rab11-dependent vesicular transport pathway (Amorim et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Eisfeld et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Given Rab family proteins are essential regulators of intracellular vesicle transport between different compartments and vesicle budding, especially RAB11 was the first Rab reported to be involved in exosome secretion (Colombo et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Existing studies have shown that the Rab 11 vesicle trafficking is one of the similarities in EVs biogenesis and release of influenza virus particles, implying that influenza virus RNPs may access a Rab11-dependent vesicular transport pathway in recycling endosome (RE) that contributes to the budding of influenza virus particles via EVs secretion.
