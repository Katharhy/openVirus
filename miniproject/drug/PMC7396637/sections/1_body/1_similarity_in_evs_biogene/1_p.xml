<p>Exosomes are the smallest one of EVs with round double membrane structure in appearance (Hessvik and Llorente, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). As the best-characterized subclass of EVs, exosomes have been arouseing general concern and widely researched. Besides mature red blood cells, nearly all eukaryotic cells can secrete exosomes depending on their endocytic capacities (Vidal, 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Exosomes are the only EVs formed from internal membrane, and the biogenesis of them starts from early endosomes mature into late endosomes, and budding into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) after encapsulating selected cargo composed of proteins, nucleic acids, and other bioactive molecules (Anderson et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). ILVs are a direct result from parts of the limiting membrane bud into the lumen of the endosome, and encapsulated into mulitivesicular bodies (MVBs) (Sch√∂neberg et al., 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). MVBs are fused with autophagosomes for delivering them to lysosomes, or directly fused with lysosomes where their contents can undergo degradation, or directly transported to fuse with the plasma membrane for ILVs release to extracellular environment as exosomes (Gruenberg, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Kalluri and LeBleu, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The above process can be regulated through ESCRT-dependent pathway or ESCRT-independent pathways (e.g., Rab GTPases, tetraspanin complexes and ceremide pathway; Tkach et al., 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The ESCRT machinery consists of approximately thirty proteins, and those proteins assemble into core four complexes (e.g., ESCRT-0, -I, -II, and -III) and some associated proteins (e.g., VPS4, ALIX, and VTA1), especially the ESCRT-II subunits can bind to RNA resulting in the cytoplasmic mRNA and miRNA to sort into exosomes during the biogenesis process (Kouwaki et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).
