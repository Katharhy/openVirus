<p>Microvesicles are also named as ectosomes or microparticles, and less known in their biogenesis process compared to exosomes. In general, microvesicles are formed by direct budding of the outward plasma membrane via ARF6 and RHOA-dependent rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), and Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-activated scramblases (Cocucci and Meldolesi, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The formation of microvesicles seems to be affected by some other mechanisms in different cells. In cancer cells, Rab GTPases Rab5 locating at the plasma membrane of cells, might play vital roles in microvesicles biogenesis (Das et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Rab22a and hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) can also regulate microvesicles formation in the cancer cells under hypoxia condition (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The ESCRT-III Pathway participates in microvesicles formation in cardiomyocytes. Like exosomes, microvesicles can also transfer mRNA and miRNAs to recipient cells, however, the mechanisms underlying the sorting of RNAs in microvesicles biogenesis remain unclear.
