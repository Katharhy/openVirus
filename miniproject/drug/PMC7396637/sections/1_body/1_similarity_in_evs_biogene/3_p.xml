<p>Apoptotic bodies are the only EVs formed during programmed cell death (PCD) (St√•hl et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Apoptotic bodies biogenesis starts from budding of the outward plasma membrane through apoptotic pathway. After the critical morphological changes of apoptotic cells (e.g., membrane blebbing and membrane protrusion), apoptotic bodies encapsulateing chromatin, low molecular weight RNA, glycosylated proteins, nuclear fragments and even intact mitochondria, and are ultimately released into extracellular environment as a product of apoptotic cell disassembly. Moreover, apoptotic bodies not only modulate the response of immune system, but also transfer bioactive molecules to recipient cells that represent certain signaling pathway in cell-cell communication (Hristov et al.,
