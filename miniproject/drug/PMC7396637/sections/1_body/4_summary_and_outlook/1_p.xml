<p>Overall, current evidences suggest EVs play an important role in influenza virus infection. During the process of influenza virus infection, EVs can deliver virus particles that serve as regulators of host defense and mediators of immune evasion, or that serve as antigens of innate immune receptors to stimulate host defense and immunity. Moreover, Exosomes could potentially be used as cell-free vaccines to help people prevent influenza. Many scholars suggested that EVs can not only be a source of diagnostic markers in influenza virus infection, and may also be used as a kind of cell-free therapy, for instance, isolated EVs from swine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could inhibit the HA activity of influenza viruses and suppress the replication of influenza viruses (Khatri et al.,
