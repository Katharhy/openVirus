<p>So far, however, some limitation would still affect the EVs studies. For example, nomenclature of EVs have been originated in many literature in accordance with their size, origin and functions, such as microvesicles, microparticles, exosomes, ectosomes, oncosomes, and so on (Colombo et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Jurj and colleagues had a detailed introduces of the classification of EVs and their main characteristics (e.g., size, appearance, marker, release process, pathways, etc.) in their recently published review (Jurj et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). On the basis of the recently updated guidelines of ISEV, “EVs” was defined as the “generic term for particles naturally released from the cell that are delimited by a lipid bilayer and cannot replicate,” but not all EVs researchers agree with the nomenclature of EVs (Théry et al., 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Witwer and Théry, 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Hence, the exact meaning of EVs cannot be discerned immediately from the names' constituent parts without further explanation. Heterogeneitythe is an inevitable challenge associated with the studies of EVs, which may explain to the confusing and sometimes even conflicting results between laboratories (Suptawiwat et al., 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Maemura et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Exosome and other EVs usually have various compositions and size will vary depending on their origin, donor cell culture conditions (e.g., glucose levels, fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, mycoplasma and other microbes.) and even physiological or pathological environment of donor cells or tissues including hypoxia, hyperthermia, infections, circadian rhythms, hormones, and stage of cell cycle, etc. (Burger et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Németh et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Gaurivaud et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Ludwig et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Pegtel and Gould, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Kalluri and LeBleu, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Zubair et al., 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Moreover, the existing isolation and purification technologies (e.g., ultracentrifugation, nanoscale flow cytometry, immunoprecipitation/affinity capture, Exosome Isolation Reagent, etc.) do not meet the special requirements in isolate large quantities of pure and specific EVs from mixtures of different vesicle types in cell culture medium or body fluids (McNamara and Dittmer, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Notably, influenza virus particles and EVs share similarities in density, diameter, etc (McNamara and Dittmer, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Thus, it is sometimes difficult to discriminate the roles of exosomes and other EVs in influenza virus infection and completely explain the specific role of EVs' subtype.
