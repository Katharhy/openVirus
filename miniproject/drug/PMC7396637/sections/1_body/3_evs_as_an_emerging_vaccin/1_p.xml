<p>The occurrence of new influenza viral strains by continually antigenic variation of influenza viruses usually make them resistant to currently used antiviral drugs. Vaccination is the best prophylactic measures for combating influenza virus infection (Okamoto et al., 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), and recommended for all residents age 6 months and older regardless of the state of their health in United States. During the 2018–2019 influenza season, in United States, the overall adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) against all influenza virus infection associated with medically attended ARI was 47%, and VE was 61% in children aged 6 months−17years. VE was estimated to be 74% against illness caused by H1N1, and 26% against H3N2 (Doyle et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). It is estimated that vaccination could prevent 300–4,000 deaths annually in the United States alone, however, vaccination rates remain low, only 37% of employed adults were vaccinated in 2016 (Mossad, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The currently available influenza vaccines, including inactivated viral particles, M2e-based vaccine, live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and virus like particle (VLP), are effective against influenza pandemic (Keshavarz et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). LAIV and VLP vaccines can stimulate both humoral and cellular immune responses, while inactivated vaccines can only induce systemic humoral responses. With the emergence of new influenza viral strains each year, these above vaccines just can provide limited protection. Exosome-based vaccines have been regarded as a new platform as influenza vaccines which have many advantages over traditional vaccines produced in cell culture or eggs (Jungbauer, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). For example, avoiding glycosylation directly affect recombinant proteins immunogenicity in avian eggs or endogenous viruses in avian-derived cell lines interfere with the structure of the introduced exogenous virus, causing an allergic reaction after the vaccination. Anticoli et al. (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) employed an exosome-based vaccine platform to elicite a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunity against influenza virus. Murine muscle cells were transfected with DNA vectors expressing the Nef mutant/Influenza virus A-NP (Nef
 <sup>mut</sup>/Flu-NP) in this subject, and the murine muscle cell-derived exosomes were purified and injected in mice can lead to a well detectable antigen-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell response associating with a cytotoxic activity potent enough to kill peptide-loaded and/ or antigen-expressing syngeneic cells, suggesting that this kind of vaccine platform was applicable for further pre-clinical and clinical investigations or applications. Schorey et al. have enumerated the potential advantages to using exosomes as vaccines in their review (Schorey et al., 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), (1) exosomes are capable of providing a more stable conformational conditions for the proteins. (2) the ability of exosomes to circulate and reach distal organs can improve molecular biodistribution in body fluids. Thirdly, the expression of adhesion molecules on exosomes can provid a more efficient presentation to the antigen-presenting cells. (3) exosomes act one of the body's “natural” mechanisms to transpor antigens between cells, and may play a role in cross-priming. Interestingly, EVs from Gram-negative bacteria, what are now referred to as outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) (Coelho and Casadevall, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), have received increased attention as emerging and feasible vaccine carriers (Acevedo et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Yu et al., 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Kis et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Numerous studies have shown that OMV-derived vaccines could induce protective immunity against influenza viruses (Rappazzo et al., 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Watkins et al., 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).
