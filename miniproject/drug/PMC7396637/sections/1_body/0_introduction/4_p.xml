<p>Many 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> infection studies have shown that an elevated concentration of blood EVs was along with infection, and viral components (e.g., proteins and genome) were found on the EVs released from infected cells, demonstrating a functional relevance of these vesicles with virus dissemination in the body during an infection (Schorey and Harding, 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Recently, the relationship of EVs and viral infection has also been extensively investigated, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), human papilloma virus (HPV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), and members of the herpesvirus family (Meckes,

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Studies confirmed that EVs encapsulating viral materials could stimulate host response in the absence of direct infection of cells. For example, HIV-1 accessory protein Nef targets the MAL, a tetraspanning membrane protein, and then exploits MAL-dependent passway of exosome biogenesis for hijacking exosome release into Jurkat T cells to educate quiescent T cells permissive to HIV-1 replication (Ventimiglia et al.,

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Based on the above, not surprisingly, viruses have evolved to hijack the biosynthetic machinery of EVs as an astute survival strategy. The sorting and release of virion or viral components have to use or require the endosomal-sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) pathway (Schorey and Harding, 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), as well as exosome and other EVs, implying that there exist some similarities between viral assembly and biogenesis of EVs in host cells. The EVs carrying viral proteins and genetic material, play a significant role in viral infection (Nolte-'t et al., 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
