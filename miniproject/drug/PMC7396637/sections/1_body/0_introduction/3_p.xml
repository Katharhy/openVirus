<p>It was widely believed that cell-cell communication is critical for maintaining homeostasis in body under many different physiological and pathologic conditions, not just viral infection, and can be mediated by direct cell-cell contact via transferring some soluble factors including hormones, cytokines, and inflammatory mediators (Schorey and Harding, 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Extracellular vesicles (EVs), a heterogeneous group of natural membrane vesicle released from various cells, are found in the plasma and other body fluids, such as saliva, sputum, urine, semen, and breast milk. EVs are initially regarded as cellular waste (Kalamvoki and Deschamps, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Pleet et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), however, recent research has highlighted that EVs can also as an important mediator play autocrine/paracrine role in intercellular communication (Fujita et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). EVs attach to the surface of recipient cells by means of adhesion molecules, and then release their contents (e.g., proteins, lipids, and RNAs) into cytosol of recipient cells by phagocytosis, endocytosis, and macropinocytosis or direct fusing with cell membrane (Villarroya-Beltri et al., 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Tkach and Th√©ry, 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Currently, EVs are called by different names in many articles according to their size and biogenesis, but only three main classes of EVs have been indentified, namely exosomes, microvesicles/ectosomes and apoptotic bodies (Hessvik and Llorente, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Vidal, 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Exosomes, &lt;150 nm in diameter, are released into the extracellular environment after fusion of multivescular bodies (MVBs) with the plasma membrane. Nevertheless, microvesicles and apoptotic bodies, both larger than 100 nm in diameter, are directly formed by plasma membrane outward budding and then released from living and dying cells, respectively (Palmulli and van Niel,
