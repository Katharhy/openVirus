<p> Most guidelines suggest azathioprine (AZA) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as first-line steroid-sparing agents for treatment of pemphigus rather than other adjuvant immunosuppressants (

We recommend that these drugs only be discontinued in proven cases of COVID-19. It is noteworthy that there are reports of atypical presentation of Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) in patients who received immunosuppressive drugs; therefore, careful monitoring of patients for atypical symptoms should be taken into account (
