<p>It should be noted that protective humoral immunity in the central nervous system (CNS) requires peripheral CD19-dependent germinal center formation following neurotrophic coronavirus infection (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and there are evidence that show SARS-CoV-2 targets CNS (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Although the expression of ACE 2 (the host cell-surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2 envelope spike glycoprotein) in the brain has been proposed, the exact mechanism of CNS involvement in COVID-19 is not known, yet (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Accordingly, since the characteristic of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified, the potential risks of treating pemphigus with rituximab should be taken into account. Special attention must be paid to close monitoring of the patients and tapering concurrent corticosteroids to minimize susceptibility to life-threatening infections. This risk should be weighed against the prominent and effective role of RTX in treatment of pemphigus and reducing the number of follow up visits (
