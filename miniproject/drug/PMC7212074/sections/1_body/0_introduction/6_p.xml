<p>Considering the effect of systemic corticosteroids on suppressing inflammation and the presence of lung inflammation induced by host immune responses in influenza, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infections, these therapeutic agents have been of interest to physicians during the outbreaks of these infections (

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Existing clinical data have not confirmed the beneficial effect of corticosteroids in treatment of respiratory infections due to SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The observational studies had reported increased mortality and secondary infection rates in influenza, impaired clearance of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and complications of corticosteroid therapy (e.g. diabetes, avascular necrosis, and steroid-induced psychosis) in survivors (
