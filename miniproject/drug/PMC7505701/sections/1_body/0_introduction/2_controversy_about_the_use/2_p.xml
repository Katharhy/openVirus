<p>Although generally safe when used for officially approved indications like autoimmune disorders or malaria, the risk and benefit of these drugs are poorly assessed in COVID-19. A multinational, observational world study on hospitalized patients with COVID-19 found that the employment of a regimen containing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (with or without a macrolide) was related to no evidence of benefit but instead was related to a rise in the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and death of patients in the hospital. This study recommended that these drug regimens should not be used unless urgent confirmatory findings from randomized clinical trials are obtained.
