<p>The first randomized controlled clinical trial that tested chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in Brazil, Spain, and Mozambique also concluded that these drugs are not safe when used in high doses to treat patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19.
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This clinical trial was prematurely halted as the higher dosage of chloroquine diphosphate for 10 days was associated with more toxic effects and lethality. The study recommended that the higher chloroquine dosage should not be suggested for critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential safety hazards, especially when taken concomitantly with azithromycin and oseltamivir.
