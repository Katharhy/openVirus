<p>Although WHO and other international organizations recommend to do not use these drugs, both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine with or without macrolide are frequently used in several African countries for the treatment of COVID-19. Many African countries have already permitted at the government level to use these drugs to treat COVID-19 patients by opposing WHO warnings. Even the regional organization such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has officially approved for the use of chloroquine to treat coronavirus infected patients.

In addition to the toxic effects, shortages and increased market prices of these drugs lead African countries vulnerable to substandard and falsified medical products due to their poor healthcare system.
