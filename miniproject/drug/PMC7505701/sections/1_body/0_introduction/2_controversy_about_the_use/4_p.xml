<p>Although large-scale clinical and basic researches are still required to clarify its specific mechanism and to optimize the treatment plan, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization to use chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. According to the FDA, these drugs have shown good activity in laboratory studies and anecdotal reports suggest they may offer some benefit to hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Since there is no other better option currently, it is a hopeful practice to use these drugs to COVID-19. FDA also allowed hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate products to be distributed and used for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The FDA has warned that these drugs should only be used in hospitals or for clinical trials because they have been connected to a risk of heart rhythm problems, especially when paired with the antibiotic azithromycin.
