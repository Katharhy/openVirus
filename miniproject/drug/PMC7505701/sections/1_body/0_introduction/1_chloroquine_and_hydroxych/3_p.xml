<p>Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have serious adverse events. They potentially cause heart rhythm problems, and this could be exacerbated if the treatment is combined with other medicines, such as the antibiotic azithromycin, that have similar effects on the heart. Also, hypoglycemia, neuropsychiatric effects (such as agitation, confusion, hallucinations, and paranoia), interactions with other drugs, metabolic variability are some of the problems related to these drugs. The overdose of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are highly toxic and can cause seizures, coma, and cardiac arrest.
