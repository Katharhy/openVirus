<p>Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination with azithromycin, have been highly advertised as possible therapies for COVID-19.
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Chloroquine phosphate stood out among possible personalized pharmacological therapies for COVID‐19 due to the antiviral effect confirmed in preclinical studies and its high specificity towards the SARS‐CoV‐2 receptor: angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE‐2). Large dissemination within lung tissue (the major organ affected in COVID‐19), and the consequences described in case series of severely ill COVID‐19 patients with promising clinical outcomes after being treated with chloroquine have recommended its possible use as an appropriate pharmacological option.
