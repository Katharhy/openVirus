<p>Chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine are old drugs used for the treatment of malaria and inflammatory diseases, and even have potential chemosensitization and radiosensitization activities. Chloroquine was discovered in 1934 by a German scientist called Bayer.
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Although the mechanism continues to be not well understood, it has shown to inhibit the parasitic enzyme heme polymerase that converts the toxic heme into non-toxic hemozoin, thereby leading to the buildup of toxic heme within the parasite. These drugs may also interfere with the biosynthesis of parasitic nucleic acids. Hydroxychloroquine was first synthesized in 1945 by introducing a hydroxyl group into chloroquine. Animal studies showed that hydroxychloroquine is much less (around 40%) toxic than chloroquine.
