<p>Data on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 disease in African countries were sourced from online electronic databases of published scientific literature. The clinical case reports and clinical trials of these drugs related to COVID-19 were searched from credible sources including Scopus, PubMed, Hindawi, OVID, Google Scholar, EMBASE, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL], and Cochrane Methodology Register) from the beginning of COVID-19 until 15 June 2020. Some studies were also identified with a manual Google search. The utilization pattern of these drugs in African countries was also sourced from different local and international media. Primary search terms were “COVID-19”, “Chloroquine”, “Hydroxychloroquine” “Off-label”, “Africa” and “WHO recommendation”. These search terms were adapted for use with different bibliographic databases in combination with database-specific filters for studies, if available. The search strategy was used to obtain the titles and the abstracts of the relevant studies in English, and they were independently screened and subsequently retrieved abstracts, and if necessary, the full text of articles to determine the suitability.
