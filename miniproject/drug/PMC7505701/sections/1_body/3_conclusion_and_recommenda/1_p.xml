<p>According to this review, many African countries use chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as both a preventive measure and for treating patients with COVID-19 regardless of WHO caution and toxicity findings of several clinical trials. Falsified and substandard chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine drugs are started to emerge in some African countries by considering the COVID-19 pandemic as a good opportunity. The health branches of the African government should assess the risks and benefits before providing these drugs to their people to treat COVID-19. African countries should strongly consider implementing prescription monitoring outlines to ensure that any off-label chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine use is appropriate and beneficial during this pandemic. The World Health Organization should intervene in this off-label use practices of antimalarial drugs in many African countries against their licensed purpose. If the existing global efforts worthful, much work is needed in Africa by the continental collaborated and coordinated production, distribution, and post-marketing surveillance aligned to the low-cost distribution of any approved COVID-19 drug to prevent use off-label and falsified drugs.</p>
