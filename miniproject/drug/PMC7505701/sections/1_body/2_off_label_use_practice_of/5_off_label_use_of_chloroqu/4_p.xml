<p>Morocco also continues the use of chloroquine for COVID-19 treatment despite the controversy and warnings raised by the WHO. They were treating Covid-19 patients with chloroquine since April 8 and appear to have no intention of stopping. As the Minister of Health of Morocco, Khalid Ait Taleb has confirmed to AFP that though the WHO has decided to momentarily suspend clinical trials with hydroxychloroquine, Morocco maintains its use. He was explaining and defending the effectiveness of chloroquine by involving viral inactivation. According to his statement, the use of chloroquine provides good results and everyone can see it from the ground. The Minister told that 4841 COVID-19 patients out of the 7584 cases recorded in Morocco have recovered from the virus after following chloroquine treatment. According to Ait Tayeb, this treatment can reduce the viral load very quickly. Moroccan Health authorities also started safeguarding a satisfactory stock of chloroquine by purchasing from an international pharmaceutical company just two weeks after the declaration of the first COVID-19 case in the country. In addition to this, the Health Ministry initiated chloroquine therapy along with complementary medicine to enhance efficacy.
