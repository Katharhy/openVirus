<p>Although there are several ongoing hopeful clinical trials for antiviral and immune-based therapies, there are no scientifically confirmed, clinically effective pharmacological treatments for COVID-19. The commonly used old antimalarial drugs, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine have become the attention of global scientific media and political focus regardless of a lack of randomized clinical trials supporting the drugâ€™s efficacy and safety. The efficacy, as well as the safety of both of these drugs, is still not defined by clinical trials as well as WHO for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19.
