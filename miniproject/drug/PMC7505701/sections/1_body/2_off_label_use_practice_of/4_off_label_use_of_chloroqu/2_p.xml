<p>Djibouti is one of the African countries which is extremely infected with COVID-19. There are around 4207 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people until June 13. However, as health officials of the country said that a death rate is just 0.5%. The top official of Djibouti’s main COVID-19 response center said that giving the anti-malarial drug, chloroquine, for COVID-19 patients is the main reason for the country’s low death rate. The government approved to treat all COVID-19 patients with chloroquine by ignoring WHO caution. Ahmed Zouiten, the WHO representative for the Djibouti country office, told via VOA that while the WHO has no scientific evidence to support the utilization of antimalarial drugs to treat COVID-19, observationally their use alongside antibiotics does seem to be working to Djibouti’s case. He believed that treating all COVID cases with antibiotics (azithromycin) and antimalarial drugs (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine) has shown a positive impact. Dr. Maad Nasser Mohammed, a specialist in tropical infections who is chargeable for Djibouti’s main COVID-19 response center at the Arta Regional Hospital, also confirmed that the Djiboutian approach of treating all positive COVID cases with antibiotics and anti-malarial drugs provides a positive result.
