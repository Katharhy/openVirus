<p>African news reported that the Senegal government also continues treating COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine despite the ineffective and potentially harmful results of the recent study. They believed that the antimalarial drugs, chloroquine, and its derivative hydroxychloroquine, have been considered cheap and safe when used correctly for COVID-19 treatment. The head of Senegal’s Centre for Health Emergency Operations, Abdoulaye Bousso, told the AFP that the country’s hydroxychloroquine treatment program would nonetheless continue, without offering further details about the drug toxicities as well as warnings of WHO. Seydi, the Senegalese infectious-diseases doctor, also believed that hydroxychloroquine can be taken only after offered consent to patients and after performing a cardiogram by the medical staff.
