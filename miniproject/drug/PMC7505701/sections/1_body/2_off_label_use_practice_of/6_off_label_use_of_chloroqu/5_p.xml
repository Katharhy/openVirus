<p>The Director-General of the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) warning to do not use chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment as well as for the prevention of coronavirus disease. The director noted that the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the management of COVID-19 disease has not been validated and approved by the WHO. Furthermore, Nigerians should know that self-medication and misuse of these drugs can cause harm and may lead to death. As the Lagos state officials told CNN, three people were hospitalized in the city after taking chloroquine. One witness also told CNN that in a pharmacy near his home in Lagos, the price of chloroquine rises by more than 400% in a matter of hours after Trump endorses it for coronavirus treatment. Finally, the Director-General of NCDC concluded that there have been promising results by researchers, but until now both drugs have not been licensed to treat COVID-19 related symptoms or prevent infection.
