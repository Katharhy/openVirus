<p>The worldwide controversial reports that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may be effective against COVID-19 have received great attention, increasing the risk of the introduction of falsified versions of these medicines mainly in African countries due to their poor health system. For instance, five different types of falsified chloroquine tablets were discovered between March 31, 2020, and April 4, 2020, in Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo by liquid chromatographic and mass spectrometric analysis. Such products represent a serious risk to patients. These events exemplify that once new medicines, regimens or vaccines against COVID-19 developed, its falsified product forms will enter the market immediately, especially in low- and middle-income countries.
