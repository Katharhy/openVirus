<p>Covid-19 complicates the tracing and treatment of malaria and compromise the wider public health programs in Zimbabwe. World Health Organization said that Zimbabwe reported that mosquito-borne diseases are significantly spiked in the country. WHO’s Global Malaria Programme said that in malaria-endemic countries, COVID-19 could make malaria more deadly. Zimbabwe’s ministry of health has already reported that there are three times more malaria cases than last year. As the ministry of health told that the occurrence of these elevated malarial cases is due to the similarity of symptoms, their main symptom, fever, between COVID-19 and malaria. This makes the country’s malarial management very complicated. The malaria cases are much higher than current Covid-19 cases in the country. Like other African countries, anti-malarial drugs, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine are being used to treat Covid-19 in Zimbabwe. However, Zimbabwe’s doctors advised their population to do not use chloroquine as there is insufficient data on their use for that purpose and high doses of the drugs can be life-threatening.
