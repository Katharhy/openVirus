<p>Like that of other countries of the world, COVID-19 is becoming highly pandemic in most African countries. According to the latest data of John Hopkins University and Africa Center for Disease Control, there are more than 200,000 confirmed cases and 6000 deaths due to coronavirus in Africa until June 13, 2020. Despite the relatively lower number of COVID-19 cases in Africa, the pandemic remains a major threat to the continent’s poor health systems.

Egypt has 13 trials ongoing which specifically focus on COVID-19 therapeutics and around two trials on vaccines. Egyptian scientists are also doing nutritional support especially with honey and some immunotherapy trials. Zambia has one trial ongoing with hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, which advertised as a potent remedy for coronavirus. South Africa is also looking at the efficacy of chloroquine, interferon, and remdesivir. Like in the case of Egypt, Nigeria has a trial in progress for different therapeutic agents. There are also two trials ongoing in Tunisia.
