    "It is an urgent priority for advanced materials researchers to help find solutions to eliminate the COVID-19 pandemic. The transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is majorly through touching the contaminated surfaces and then the vulnerable mouth and eyes besides the direct contact with the infected person. This lesson inspired us to propose a strategy from the view of materials scientists on designing effective antiviral surfaces to prevent the transmission of infectious coronaviruses by disrupting their survival on various surfaces. In this perspective, based on current progress in antiviral and antibacterial coatings, we put forward some general principles for designing effective antiviral surfaces by applying natural viral inhibitors, physical/chemical modifications, and bioinspired patterns, with the mechanisms of direct disinfection, indirect disinfection, and receptor inactivation. This work maps possible solutions to inactivate the receptors of the coronavirus spikes and resist the transmission of the COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, and contribute to the prevention of future outbreaks and control of epidemics.
