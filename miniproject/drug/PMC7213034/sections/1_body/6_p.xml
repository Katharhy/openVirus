<p>Neurological manifestations are more likely in those with severe infections.[
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The neurological manifestations may be secondary to systemic effects of the virus or directly mediated by the virus. The altered sensorium that occurs in the infection may due to hypoxia, metabolic derangements or multi-organ dysfunction. The direct viral-mediated effects, as evidenced by the presence of SARS-CoV 2 in the cerebrospinal fluid, are probably mediated through hACE2 receptors. The viral access to the CNS may be facilitated hematogenously (probably infected macrophages acting as Trojan horses) or contiguous spread through the cribriform plate.[
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] These manifestations include anosmia, dysgeusia, cerebral infarct, Intracerebral hemorrhage, aseptic meningitis, seizures, acute necrotizing encephalopathy. seizure and ataxia. It may also involve the peripheral nervous system causing Guillain Barre syndrome and muscle injury.[
