<p>Treatment options for COVID-19 include chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (inhibits virus entry into the cell by changing the glycosylation of hACE 2 receptor), remdesivir (RNA polymerase inhibitor), favipiravir (RNA polymerase inhibitor), lopinavir-ritonavir (protease inhibitors), tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody and preventing the effects of cytokine storm), ivermectin (inhibits the interaction between the viral integrase protein (IN) and the importin (IMP) a/b1 heterodimer responsible for IN nuclear import) and azithromycin (probable mechanism- inhibits mRNA expression and protein production, it is also immunomodulatory and decreases inflammatory response) [
