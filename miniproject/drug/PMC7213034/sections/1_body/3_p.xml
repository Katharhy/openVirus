<p>The receptor for entry of SARS- CoV- 2 is human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE 2) receptor present in respiratory epithelium and type II pulmonary pneumocyte which is the same as that of SARS CoV whereas MERS CoV utilizes the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor for binding and entry.[
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The hACE 2 receptors are also expressed in the heart (cardiac myocytes, endothelium of myocardial vessels), kidney (proximal tubule, distal tubule) and major blood vessels (endothelium and smooth muscle cells). In the brain, the above receptors are seen in endothelium and smooth muscle cells of blood vessels. Animal studies (rat) have shown that the receptors are also seen in neurons.[
