<p>The incubation period of SARS-CoV- 2 ranges from 1-14 days (mean incubation period: 5-6 days). SARS- CoV- 2 spreads via air-borne droplet particles/aerosols (coughing and sneezing) or direct contact with the secretions of the infected individual producing human to human transmission. The droplet particles do not travel beyond 2 meters and do not remain in the air. Thus far, there is no evidence of intrauterine transmission or transmission during delivery.[

 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] SARS- CoV- 2 has been extracted from stool samples however faeco-oral transmission has not been documented.[
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Basic reproduction number (R
 <sub>0</sub>) indicates the ability of an organism to spread. R
 <sub>0</sub> of SARS- CoV- 2 is 2-2.5. The serial interval (SI) is the time taken for successive cases to be infected. The mean serial interval for SARS- CoV- 2 is 3.96 days (4-7 days) which much lower than 8.4 days documented for SARS CoV.[
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Majority of infections (approximately 81%) are mildly symptomatic, although these patients can spread the disease. R0, SI and large number of mildly symptomatic patients are epidemiologically significant and responsible for the exponential spread of the virus.
