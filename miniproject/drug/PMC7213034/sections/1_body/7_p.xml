<p>Laboratory findings of SARS- CoV- 2 infection include normal total blood count with lymphopenia which is the most consistent finding (reduced immunological response to the virus), reduced albumin (impaired liver function) with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin (liver injury), elevated creatine (kidney injury), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (severe lung injury/multisystem involvement), elevated cardiac troponin (cardiac injury), elevated levels of D- dimer, prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time and thrombocytopenia (consumption coagulopathy), elevated ferritin (severe inflammation), elevated c- reactive protein (severe viral infection) and elevated interleukin-6 (cytokine storm) and procalcitonin (secondary bacterial infection). Detection of viral nucleic acid from nasopharyngeal swab by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (r RT-PCR), is now the GOLD STANDARD for confirming a suspected COVID-19 patient is now the GOLD STANDARD for confirming a suspected COVID-19 patient (sensitivity: 50-79%). The swab specimens are collected from the following sites: nasopharynx, oropharynx, expectorated sputum, lower respiratory tract aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage and rectal swab. Rapid IgG/IgM antibody test has been developed, which can detect the presence of antibodies from blood, serum or plasma (sensitivity: 85.6%, specificity: 91%)[

Imaging modalities like chest X-ray shows ill defines opacities in lower zones of lung with the tendency to involve perihilar and upper lung fields in severe disease, CT chest reveals bilateral ground glass (air space) opacities in peripheral zone with predilection to involve lower zones and in some patients fine reticular opacities are also seen. USG lung revealed subpleural consolidation and B lines.[
