<p id="d1e232">The areas beneath epidemic curves represent total numbers of infections. The onset, shape and area beneath these curves all depend on the basic reproduction number, which must be greater than one for epidemics to occur. The smaller this number, the longer the delay to peak incidence, the lower the peak, and fewer the total number of infections (
