This is the mechanism underlying the “treatment as prevention” approach to reducing HIV infection rates. Treatment of infected people with anti-retroviral drugs reduces their viral load, preventing their progression to AIDS. Authorities believe that it also reduces their infectiousness, which would lower the effective reproduction number. This is the rationale for the US national initiative, “Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America” (
