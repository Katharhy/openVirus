<p id="d1e212">The most recent community mitigation guidelines for pandemic influenza 
 <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> include a graphic illustrating the goals of non-pharmaceutical interventions, slowing the rate at which new infections occur (incidence), reducing the peak number of infected people (prevalence) and concomitant demands on healthcare facilities and personnel, and decreasing overall infections and deaths. Antimicrobial drugs generally are administered solely for the benefit of individual patients, but may also reduce the magnitude or duration of infectiousness, affecting transmission to others. Similarly, vaccines and monoclonal antibodies may reduce infectiousness as well as susceptibility. Accordingly, we include pharmaceutical interventions in our description of mechanisms underlying efforts to flatten the curve.
