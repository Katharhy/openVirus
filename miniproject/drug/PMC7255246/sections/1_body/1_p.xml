<p id="d1e220">Plots of daily numbers of new infections, called epidemic curves, are affected by several factors, including under-reporting. Individual responses to infection by the same pathogen differ, and mild infections are less likely to be reported than those requiring medical attention. Absent widespread testing, few asymptomatic infections would be reported. In the ongoing pandemic, people with few if any symptoms may be infectious

Social distancing – increasing inter-personal distances, reducing the number of people attending meetings – involves everyone, reducing the risks of being infected if susceptible and of infecting others if infectious.
