<p id="d1e274">Should some infected people not live long enough to cause the average number of secondary infections, the basic reproduction number and generation time would no longer be independent. Be that as it may, the goal is not just to delay and reduce the peak number of infections, possibly below surge capacity as some figures in the media have suggested, it is also to reduce the total number of infections. Social distancing accomplishes all three objectives: (a) reducing the peak incidence of infections, (b) delaying the occurrence of this peak, and (c) reducing the total number of infections during epidemics.</p>
