  <p>Epidemic curves with varying latency. Intervals from infection to the onset of infectiousness or latent periods increase from 10 to 26 in 4-day increments (left to right), all corresponding to a basic reproduction number of 2.5. Note that the thick red curves are identical in both figures and that, in this one, while the curves differ in shape, the same total percent of the population, 89% is infected.</p>
