<p>The coronavirus derives its names from its physical form: a spherical virion with spike (S) proteins (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). There are four subfamilies of coronaviruses, namely α-, β-, χ-, and δ-coronaviruses; SARS-CoV-2 is a β-coronavirus like its predecessor, SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The relationship between the current strain and previously identified strains through high-throughput sequencing has allowed epidemiologists to trace the evolution of the virus. A closely related strain found in bats, RaTG13-2013, shares 96% of the genome (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). This has led scientists to believe that the virus jumped between host species from the bat, or an intermediate animal, before spreading amongst the human population (
