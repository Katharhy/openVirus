<p>There are two phases to the immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>): (1) an initial specific adaptive immune response and (2) uncontrolled inflammation. The adaptive response is required during the early stages of incubation to prevent the progression of disease and eliminate the virus. When the protective immune response is ineffective, the virus propagates, inducing destruction of the affected tissues leading to severe disease progression (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). An uncontrolled inflammatory response is also implicated in COVID-19, as a mechanism responsible for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The release of a cytokine storm may promote apoptosis or necrosis of T cells, and consequently lead to their reduction (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). This violent assault can be seen in patients with severe disease who's plasma levels of IL-6, TNFÎ±, and IL-10 are higher, and circulating CD4 and CD8 T cells are lower than patients with mild COVID-19 or healthy controls (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). This trend is even stronger in elderly patients. Intriguingly, most severe COVID-19 cases also have increased percentages of T cells with exhaustion phenotype. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that uncontrolled inflammation, while promoting ARDS, impairs viral clearance by inducing T cell exhaustion (
