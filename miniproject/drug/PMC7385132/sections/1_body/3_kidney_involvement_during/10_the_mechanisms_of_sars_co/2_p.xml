<p>Kidney biopsies in two Afro-American patients with high-risk APOL1 genotype and COVID-19 infection showed a collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (

 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). However, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in the kidney tissue raining the intriguing hypothesis that cytokine storm increased APOL1 expression leading to podocyte injury (
