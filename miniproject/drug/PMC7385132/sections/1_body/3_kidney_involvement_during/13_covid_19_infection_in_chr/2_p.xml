<p>Wang et al. (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>) described the outbreak of COVID-19 in the hemodialysis (HD) center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University. They identified COVID-19 in 37 individuals among 230 HD patients (16.09%) and 4 individuals among 33 staff (12.12%). They presented mostly mild symptoms, and no one required admission to the ICU. During the observation, 7 HD patients died âˆ’6 with COVID-19 and 1 without- but deaths were not directly related to pneumonia. The causes of death, in fact, were heart failure, hyperkalemia, and cerebrovascular disease (not peer-reviewed) (
