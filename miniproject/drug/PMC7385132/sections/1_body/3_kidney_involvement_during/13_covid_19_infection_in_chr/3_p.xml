<p>Circulating CD4 and CD8 T cells, NK cells, and proinflammatory cytokines are significantly lower in COVID-19 HD patients, compared to non-HD COVID-19 individuals (

 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). However, the reduced inflammatory response in HD patients suggests that they may be at higher risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, additional prevention measures are essential in managing the epidemic in HD centers (
