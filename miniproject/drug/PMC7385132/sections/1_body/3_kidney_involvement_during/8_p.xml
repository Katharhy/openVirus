<p>Due to the hypercoagulability state associated with COVID-19, systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin or regional citrate anticoagulation is advised (

Since these patients experience higher filter clotting, it might be useful to choose predilution replacement fluid administration for hemofiltration, and consider using a heparin bolus together with pre-filter heparin at higher rate than usual -monitoring PTT before and during hemodialysis to avoid bleeding- in order to maintain higher blood flows (
