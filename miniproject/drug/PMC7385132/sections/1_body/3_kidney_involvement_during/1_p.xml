<p>Li et al. (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) analyzed kidney function in 193 COVID-19 patients and found that 31% of patients had an elevated level of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and 22% had increased serum creatinine. These authors also found also that in 147 patients, 60% exhibited proteinuria and 48% exhibited hematuria (not peer-reviewed) (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In the first studies during the pandemic spread, incidence of AKI was reported from 3 to 9% of patients, but more recent studies reported an incidence rate of 15% (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). In one observational study of 5,449 hospitalized patients, the incidence of AKI was 36.6 with 14.3% of patients requiring dialysis and was even higher in patients admitted to the ICU (
