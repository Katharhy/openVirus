<p>Experimental animal models showed that, although ACE inhibitors and ARBs do not directly affect ACE2 activity, these agents can upregulate the expression and activity of the receptor in heart and kidney tissue (
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>). These drugs are commonly prescribed for patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease who have higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease which has raised concern for the use of these drugs during the infection (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, the increased expression of ACE2 could limit the viral spread because it is not accompanied by an increase of TMPRSS2, so the virus could be tied to the receptor but could not enter the cells (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Experimental animal models of acute lung injury, including a model of SARS-CoV infection, showed that ARBs reduce Ang II-mediated lung damage and therefore attenuate COVID-19 infection (
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>). In a retrospective study of 6,272 patients with COVID-19 and matched COVID-19 negative controls, infected patients were associated with increased use of RAAS inhibitors, but these drugs did not correlate with a more severe disease after multivariable adjustment (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>). The study by Reynolds et al. (
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>) did not find any correlation between the use of anti-hypertensive drugs, such as RAS inhibitors (both angiotensin-receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors), calcium-channel blockers, beta-blockers or thiazide diuretics and the risk of infection or of having a severe disease in 5,894 patients.
