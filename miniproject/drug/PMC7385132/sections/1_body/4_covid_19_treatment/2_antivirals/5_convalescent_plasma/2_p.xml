<p>Shen et al. (
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>) administered convalescent plasma transfusions to 5 patients with COVID-19 and ARDS. The donors had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 and had been asymptomatic for at least 10 days with documented anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In all patients, the neutralizing antibody titers significantly increased after plasma transfusion, the viral load declined, and the clinical conditions improved (

One study of 10 patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma transfusion, with improvement of clinical symptoms, reduction of pulmonary lesions, increase of lymphocytes count and titer of neutralizing antibodies, disappearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and a better clinical outcome compared to 10 matched control patients (
