  <p>SARS-CoV-2 replicates in HAE cultures. (A) Replication of SARS-CoV-2 in HAE and Vero E6 cultures was evaluated using RT-qPCR, and the data are presented as RNA copy numbers per ml. The experiment was carried out twice, each time in triplicate, and average values with standard deviations are presented. (B) Plaque assay of SARS-CoV-2 stock collected from HAE and Vero E6 cells. The assay was performed using A549 cells overexpressing the ACE2 protein. (C) Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication by patient serum evaluated using RT-qPCR. The data are presented as log reduction values (LRVs) compared to results for the untreated control. The experiment was carried out in triplicate, and average values with standard deviations are presented.</p>
