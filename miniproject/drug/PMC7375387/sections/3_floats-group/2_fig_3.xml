  <p>SARS-CoV-2 infects ciliated cells of the human airway epithelium. Three-dimensional immuno-RNA FISH demonstrating localization of SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA in ciliated HAE cultures. Three-dimensionally reconstructed confocal image stacks of mock-inoculated control cells (A) or cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (B). The bottom lanes of panels A and B show the 
   <italic>xz</italic> plane in orthogonal views. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was visualized by FISH using a set of probes against viral nucleocapsid RNA and is shown in red. Cilia were visualized by an anti-β5 tubulin antibody and are shown in green. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and are shown in blue. Bar = 20 μM.
