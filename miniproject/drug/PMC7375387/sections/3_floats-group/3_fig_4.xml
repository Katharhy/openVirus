  <p>Specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA FISH assay in HAE cultures. Three-dimensionally reconstructed confocal image stacks of mock-infected control cells (A) and cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (B), NL63 (C), and HKU1 (D) subjected to RNA FISH using a set of probes against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid RNA. SARS-CoV-2 RNA is shown in red. Nuclei were stained with DAPI and are shown in blue. Bar = 20 μM.</p>
