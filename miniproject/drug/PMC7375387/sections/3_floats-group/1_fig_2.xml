  <p>sgmRNAs of SARS-CoV-2 in HAE cultures. The presence of the N sgmRNAs 4 days p.i. in the HAE cultures infected with SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated using RT-PCR. NC, negative control; PC, positive control. (A) N sgmRNA in HAEs obtained after the first PCR. (B) N sgmRNA obtained after the second PCR. An additional band of ∼600 bp represents sgmRNA8. The experiment was performed three times, each time using cells obtained from different donors.</p>
