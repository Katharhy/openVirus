<p>A549_ACE2+ cells were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured for 24 h at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Virus samples were serially diluted 10-fold in culture medium and layered on the cells in triplicate. Following 1 h of incubation at 37°C with gentle rocking, cells were overlaid with agarose medium (2% FBS with 0.05% agarose). Cells were cultured for 72 h at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 1 h. The supernatant was discarded, and cells were stained with crystal violet to visualize the plaques.
