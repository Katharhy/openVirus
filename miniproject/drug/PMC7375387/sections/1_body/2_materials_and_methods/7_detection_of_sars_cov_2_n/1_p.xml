<p>Total nucleic acids were isolated from virus or mock-infected cells at 4 days p.i. using Fenozol reagent (A&amp;A Biotechnology, Poland) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Life Technologies, Poland) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Viral cDNA was amplified in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 1× Dream 
 <italic>Taq</italic> green PCR master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Poland) and primers (500 nM each). The following primers were used to amplify SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA): common sense primer (leader sequence, 5′-TAT ACC TTC CCA GGT AAC AAA CCA-3′) and nucleocapsid antisense primer (5′-GTA GCT CTT CGG TAG TAG CCA AT-3′). The conditions were as follows: 3 min at 95°C; 35 cycles (30 cycles for second PCR) of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 55°C, and 20 s at 72°C; followed by 5 min at 72°C and 10 min at 4°C. The PCR products were run on 1% agarose gels (Tris-acetate-EDTA [TAE] buffer) and analyzed using molecular imaging software (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
