<p>Viral RNA was quantified using quantitative PCR (qPCR; CFX96 Touch real-time PCR detection system; Bio-Rad, Poland). cDNA was amplified using 1× qPCR master mix (A&amp;A Biotechnology, Poland), in the presence of probe (100 nM; FAM/BHQ1, ACT TCC TCA AGG AAC AAC ATT GCC A) and primers (450 nM each; CAC ATT GGC ACC CGC AAT C and GAG GAA CGA GAA GAG GCT TG). The heating scheme was as follows: 2 min at 50°C and 10 min at 92°C, followed by 30 cycles of 15 s at 92°C and 1 min at 60°C. In order to assess the copy number for the N gene, standards were prepared and serially diluted.</p>
