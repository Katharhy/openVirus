<p>Human epithelial cells were isolated from conductive airways resected from transplant patients. The study was approved by the bioethical committee of the Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland (approval no KNW/0022/KB1/17/10, dated 16 February 2010). Written consent was obtained from all patients. Cells were mechanically detached from the tissue after protease treatment and cultured on plastic in bronchial epithelial growth medium (BEGM). Subsequently, cells were transferred onto permeable Transwell insert supports (ϕ, 6.5 mm) and cultured in BEGM. After the cells reached full confluence, the apical medium was removed and the basolateral medium was changed to an air-liquid interface (ALI). Cells were cultured for 4 to 6 weeks to form differentiated, pseudostratified mucociliary epithelia. All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.</p>
