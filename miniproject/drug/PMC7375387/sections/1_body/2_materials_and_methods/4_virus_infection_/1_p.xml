<p>Fully differentiated human airway epithelium (HAE) cultures were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 at a TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of 1,000 per ml (as determined on Vero E6 cells). Following 2 h of incubation at 37°C, unbound virions were removed by washing with 200 μl of 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and HAE cultures were maintained at an air-liquid interface for the rest of the experiment. To analyze virus replication kinetics, each day postinfection (p.i.), 100 μl of 1× PBS was applied at the apical surface of HAE and collected following a 10-min incubation at 32°C. For the neutralization study, patient sera (1:200 dilution in PBS [HAE] or culture medium [Vero E6]) were used. All samples were stored at −80°C and analyzed using RT-qPCR.
