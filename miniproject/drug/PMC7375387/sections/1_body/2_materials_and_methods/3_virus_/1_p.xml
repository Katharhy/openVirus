<p>SARS-CoV-2 (isolate 026V-03883; kindly granted by Christian Drosten, Charité–Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany, and provided by the European Virus Archive–Global [EVAg]). The virus stock was prepared by infecting fully confluent Vero E6 cells at a 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) of 400 per ml. Three days after inoculation, the supernatant from the cultures was aliquoted and stored at −80°C. Control Vero E6 cell supernatant from mock-infected cells was prepared in the same manner. Virus yield was assessed by titration on fully confluent Vero E6 cells in 96-well plates according to the method of Reed and Muench (
