<p>The next day, cells were subjected to an RNA-FISH protocol using hybridization chain reaction (HCR) technology from Molecular Instruments, Inc. Briefly, cells were permeabilized with 100% methanol overnight and then subjected to grated rehydration with methanol-PBS and 0.1% Tween 20. The set of DNA HCR v3.0 probes complementary to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid RNA was incubated for 12 h at 37°C, extensively washed, and hybridized with HCR amplifiers for 12 h at room temperature in the dark. Next, cells were subjected to immunostaining with antibodies against mouse β5-tubulin from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-134234; 1:100) and rinsed three times with PBS and 0.1% Tween 20, followed by 1 h of incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibodies (1:400; Invitrogen). The cells were finally washed three times with PBS and 0.1% Tween 20, cell nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (D1306; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and cells were mounted on slides with Prolong diamond antifade mounting medium (P36970; Invitrogen). Fluorescent images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH) with ZEN 2012 SP1 black edition software and processed in ImageJ Fiji (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).</p>
