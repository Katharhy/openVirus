<p>Here, we used fully differentiated epithelium cultures to study infection with the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. We observed efficient replication of the virus in the tissue, with maximal replication at 2â€‰days postinfection (p.i.). At the time of the study, no antibodies were available. Therefore, we developed immunofluorescent 
 <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (immunoFISH) to show that the virus primarily infects ciliated cells of the respiratory epithelium.
