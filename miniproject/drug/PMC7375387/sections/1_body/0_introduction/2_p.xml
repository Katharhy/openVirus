<p>At present, studies on the virus are carried out using a surrogate system based on the immortalized simian Vero E6 cell line (

While this model is convenient for diagnostics and testing of some antiviral drugs, it has serious limitations and does not allow for understanding of virus biology and evolution. For example, the entry routes of human coronaviruses vary between cell lines and differentiated tissues, as do immune responses and virus-host interactions (
