<p>Coronaviruses constitute a large family of RNA viruses that mainly infect mammals and birds. In humans, there are four species associated with mild-to-moderate respiratory infections. While these viruses have been infecting humans for a long time, they are believed to have entered the human population by zoonotic events, and one may speculate that they may have caused epidemics similar to the one observed for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Analysis of the time to the most recent ancestor suggests that human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is the oldest species in humans, followed by its cousin HCoV-229E and two betacoronaviruses, which emerged in humans in the relatively near past (

In the 21st century, we have already faced the emergence of three novel coronaviruses in humans, of which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) disappeared after one season, never to come back, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) never fully crossed the species border, as its transmission between humans is highly ineffective (

The 2019 zoonotic transmission, however, resulted in the emergence of a novel human coronavirus which seems to carry an optimal set of features allowing for its rapid spread with considerable mortality. Whether the virus will become endemic in humans is an open question (
