<p>Human airway epithelium (HAE) cultures reconstitute the tissue lining the conductive airways of humans. Being fully differentiated, they are among the best tools for studying viral infection in a natural microenvironment (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). These air-liquid interface cultures contain a number of cell types (e.g., basal, ciliated, and goblet). At the same time, they also functionally reflect the natural tissue with extensive cross talk and production of protective mucus and surfactant proteins (

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). For example, human coronaviruses were shown some time ago to use a very different entry pathway in immortalized cell lines than in the natural human epithelium. In immortalized cell lines, coronaviruses enter via the pH-dependent endocytic pathway, whereas in the natural human epithelium, they utilize surface serine proteases, such as TMPRSS2 or kallikreins, for activation, and fusion occurs on the cell surface. This difference may affect not only understanding of their basic biology but also antiviral drug development, including that of chloroquine (
