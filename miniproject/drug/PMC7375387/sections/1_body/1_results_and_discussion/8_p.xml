<p>In summary, we show that SARS-CoV-2 effectively replicates in HAE cultures and that this 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> model constitutes a convenient tool for studying this viral infection. We also show that the virus infects ciliated cells. The infection is polarized: infection and release occur at the apical side of the epithelium. It is worth noting that in the absence of immunodetection tools, the new generation of immunoFISH tools offers an interesting alternative.
