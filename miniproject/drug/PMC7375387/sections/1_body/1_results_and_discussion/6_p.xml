<p>Next, we made an effort to visualize infection in the tissue. Because at the time of the study no antibody for confocal microscopy was available, we developed an immunoFISH assay, where the viral RNA was visualized in the context of the cell using 20 sequence-specific probes and signal amplification. At the same time, Î²-tubulin was labeled using specific antibodies to visualize ciliated cells. The obtained results are shown in
