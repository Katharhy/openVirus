<p>Clearly, the increase in virus titer on the apical side is visible at 24 h postinoculation and reaches a plateau at 48 h postinoculation. Also, the virus yield was comparable to that obtained 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> using permissive cells. We did not observe any release of the virus from the basolateral side of the HAE culture, and therefore, we have not shown the relevant data on the graph. The results we observed are consistent with the previously reported polarity of the HAE cultures and apical infection/apical release reported previously for other human coronaviruses. Similarly as for other human coronaviruses, the apical-apical polarity of SARS-CoV-2 infection release restricts the virus to the airway lumen (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> was effectively blocked by serum obtained from patients who had recovered from COVID-19 (
