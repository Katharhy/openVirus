<p>Here, we sought to verify whether HAE cultures may be used to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and identified cellular targets in the tissue. First, HAE cultures or Vero E6 cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 stock and cultured for 4â€‰days. Every day (days 0 to 3), the apical and basolateral release of the virus was evaluated by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and the results for the apical release of the virus are presented in
