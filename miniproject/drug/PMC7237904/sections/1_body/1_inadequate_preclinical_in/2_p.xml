<p id="p0015">Inadequate preclinical studies impose a high risk of failure in clinical trials. For example, sofosbuvir, targeting hepatitis C virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), was shown to inhibit hepatitis E virus (HEV) in cell culture model by one experimental study [
 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This immediately triggered clinical application for treating HEV cases, generating inconclusive and controversial results [
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A follow-up clinical trial to test efficacy demonstrated that sofosbuvir was unable to cure any patients with chronic HEV infection [
 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Recent 
 <italic>in silico</italic> molecular docking has indicated that sofosbuvir may inhibit RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Without further extensive preclinical studies, sofosbuvir has already entered clinical trials for treating COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Widening testing of experimental therapies in patients with COVID-19 which have not been concretely evaluated will likely produce contradictory results.
