<p>As virus entry is a crucial step for the pathogenesis of the COVID‐19, we provide a comprehensive list of repurposed drugs/chemicals that have been reported to block viral entry via different mechanisms (Table 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Monotherapy or combined therapy of these drugs are in preclinical, Phase 1, Phase 2, or Phase 3 clinical trials. Hoffmann et al. (
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0076" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) showed that Camostat mesylate interferes with TMPRSS2‐mediated viral entry, thus reduces the severity of the COVID‐19 disease. Similarly, Arbidol, an antiviral that inhibits the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus and blocks the entry into the cell, is recommended to use against influenza viruses and arboviruses (Kadam &amp; Wilson, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0083" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0180" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). An open, prospective/retrospective, randomized controlled cohort study is underway at Tongji Hospital, China, to study the safety and efficacy of Arbidol Hydrochloride and Arbidol Hydrochloride combined with interferon atomization in humans (Table 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In this study, the interventional subjects will be given a standard supportive therapy with Arbidol Hydrochloride (0.2 g, three times a day) or Arbidol Hydrochloride combined with Interferon (PegIFN‐α‐2b) atomization (45 g) (NCT04254874). Trials with Arbidol Hydrochloride, along with other drugs, are also undergoing at Ruijin Hospital, China, and Tongji Hospital, China (NCT04260594, NCT04255017). Moreover, a recent study has demonstrated that a fusion protein made of rhACE2 and an Fc (Fragment crystalization) region of the human immunoglobulin IgG1 shows high‐affinity binding to the receptor‐binding domain of SARS‐CoV‐2 and potently neutralized SARS‐CoV‐2 in vitro, which provides a basis for further drug development (Lei et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0101" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Monteil et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0128" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). This fusion protein can be considered for further studies in animals and humans to see its effectiveness. Moreover, S protein‐specific monoclonal antibodies can be generated to neutralize the spike protein, which may lead to the inhibition of viral entry. Recently, Tian et al. (
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0169" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) identified a monoclonal antibody, CR3022, which binds with the RBD of the spike protein of SARS‐CoV‐2 in vitro. CR3022, therefore, might be a potential drug candidate against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Despite the role of ACE2 in viral entry, targeting interruption of ACE2 may not be the best strategy to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 (Guo et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0071" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) because ACE2 also maintains blood pressure. So, the entry inhibition strategy must be pathogen‐specific rather than host‐specific. Further studies should be carried out to discover potential entry inhibitors that block that viral entry without disturbing the maintenance of the blood pressure. Some other potential therapeutics that block the virus entry into target cells are summarized in Tables 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>.
