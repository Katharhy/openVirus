<p>RdRp is a vital enzyme of the viral replication machinery; hence, RdRp blockers could be effective antiviral therapy against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Depending on their mechanism of action, RdRp inhibitors are of two types, that is, (a) nucleoside and nucleotide structural analogs which mimic the structure of the natural nucleoside triphosphate substrates and could interact competitively in the active site of RdRp polymerase and (b) non‐nucleoside inhibitors are allosteric inhibitors which interact in a noncompetitive fashion for the substrates (Brown,

 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0173" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Favipiravir (T‐705) is a broad‐spectrum prodrug that is metabolized into an active ribofuranosyl triphosphate derivative that selectively inhibits the viral RdRp polymerase activity (Velkov et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0173" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Favipiravir was shown to inhibit the replication of the respiratory syncytial virus and also been proven effective against influenza in Japan (Delang, Abdelnabi, &amp; Neyts, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Furuta, Komeno, &amp; Nakamura, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), which indicates that it might be effective against SARS‐CoV‐2. A multicenter, randomized, and controlled clinical trial study with 150 participants is underway with Favipiravir combined with Tocilizumab for the treatment of COVID‐19 at Peking University First Hospital (Table 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Recently, a prospective, randomized, controlled, open‐label multicenter trial (ChiCTR2000030254) involving adult COVID‐19 patients treated with Favipiravir versus Arbidol showed that Favipiravir increased clinical recovery rate, improved the latency to relief for pyrexia and cough along with mild and manageable adverse effects (Chen, Xiong, Bao, &amp; Shi, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Furthermore, Cai et al. (
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) studied the effects of Favipiravir versus Lopinavir/ritonavir for the treatment of COVID‐19. There were two arms (Favipiravir + Interferon‐α versus Lopinavir/ritonavir) in this open‐label control study. The 45 patients registered in the control arm (Lopinavir/ritonavir) and the 35 patients in the Favipiravir arm (Favipiravir + Interferon‐α) where all baseline characteristics were compared between the two arms. The Favipiravir arm showed significant improvement in chest imaging, associated with faster viral clearance with lower adverse events compared with the control arm (Cai et al.,

Remdesivir, an adenosine nucleoside analog prodrug and developed by Gilead Sciences (Foster City, CA) against the Ebola virus, incorporates into nascent viral RNA chains resulting in the premature termination of RNA synthesis (Wang, Cao, et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0179" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Monotherapy and combination therapy of Remdesivir with CQ or Interferon‐beta (IFN‐β) halted SARS‐CoV‐2 replication and treated patients were clinically recuperated (Sheahan et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0150" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Wang, Zhang, et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0183" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). A Phase 3 randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, multicenter study of Remdesivir in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID‐19 is completed (NCT04257656). The primary endpoint of the trial concluded that patients with COVID‐19 receiving Remdesivir showed a faster time to clinical improvement (numerically, not statistically significant) compared to the patients receiving the placebo group (Wang, Cao, et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0179" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Moreover, a double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled clinical trial (NCT04280705) evidenced that intravenous Remdesivir was efficacious compared to placebo in reducing the time to recovery with lower respiratory tract infection (Beigel et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Recently, the FDA approved the emergency use of Remdesivir as an experimental drug. On the other hand, Ribavirin, a synthetic purine nucleoside derivative could interfere in the guanosine triphosphate formation, hinders capping of viral mRNA, and thus inhibits viral RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase activity (Khalili, Zhu, Mak, Yan, &amp; Zhu, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0087" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). It could be used as a broad‐spectrum antiviral therapeutic agent that has already been reported against a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses such as paramyxovirus, Influenza A and B, Hepatitis C, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, and HIV (Elfiky, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Khalili et al.,

 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0165" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Several phases of clinical trials are undergoing to study the efficacy of Remdesivir and Ribavirin for the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2 as alone or in combination with other drugs (Table
