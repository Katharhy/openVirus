<p>Another potential option for reducing inflammation is Siltuximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to and halts the effect of IL‐6 (Sarosiek, Shah, &amp; Munshi, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0142" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Chen et al., 2020). Recently, a study in COVID‐19 patients showed that intravenous administration of Siltuximab improved clinical conditions of 33% patients, stabilized or demonstrated no clinically relevant changes in 43% of patients, whereas condition deteriorated in 24% patients (Gritti et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). These results exhibit the potential role of Siltuximab in treating patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (Gritti et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Furthermore, an observational case–control study with 50 COVID‐19 patients with serious respiratory complications is ongoing in Italy to determine the effectivity of Siltuximab (NCT04322188). Another group of researchers (di Giambenedetto et al., 2020) used Tocilizumab, a humanized anti‐human interleukin‐6 receptor antibody of the IgG1 subclass, for thwarting or treating the cytokine storm in three patients of COVID‐19 and found promising results such as reduction of fever, C‐reactive proteins and quick relief of respiratory symptoms. A clinical trial is undergoing to test whether an anti‐IL6 treatment can be effective in reducing the SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced cytokine storm and improving lung function (NCT04315480). Some other therapeutics which have anti‐inflammatory and immunomodulation property are summarized in Table
