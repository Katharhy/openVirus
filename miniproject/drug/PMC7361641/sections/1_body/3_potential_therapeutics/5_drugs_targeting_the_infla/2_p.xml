<p>Inflammation is an obvious outcome of SARS‐CoV‐2; however, no effective therapeutics targeting the inflammatory responses for SARS‐CoV‐2 has been approved to date. Fu, Cheng, and Wu (
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) reviewed the potential mechanism of Fc receptor (FcR) blockers such as intravenous immunoglobulin, anti‐Fc specific antibodies, small molecules, and so on, which might be a therapeutic tool for reducing SARS‐CoV‐2 induced pulmonary inflammation. Moreover, anti‐inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids might also effectively alleviate early proinflammatory response to reduce SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced inflammatory responses by blocking FcR activation. Besides, the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin against FcR could be effective for an urgent remedy against pulmonary inflammation associated with severe lung injury as it can effectively block FcR activation. These approaches may also be applied with corticosteroids or systemic anti‐inflammatory drugs (Shang, Zhao, Hu, Du, &amp; Cao, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0148" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), which needs further clinical trials to study the effectiveness against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (Russell, Millar, &amp; Baillie,
