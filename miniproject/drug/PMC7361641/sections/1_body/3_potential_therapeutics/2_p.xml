<p>Many potential therapeutics are currently in different stages of clinical trials, to find out an effective treatment for COVID‐19, including drugs that have already proven effective for other viral diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and malaria. Drug repurposing could be a rational strategy to develop urgent therapeutics. More than one drug and treatment strategy might prove its worth, and different strategies might work effectively at different infection stages and risk groups. The big challenge will be conducting clinical trials on an urgent basis, determining the effectiveness of different drugs alone or in combination. However, the scientists should take caution to avoid mistakes that occurred during the West African Ebola epidemic, in which haphazard experiments flourished and randomized clinical trials were framed up so late, resulting in little patients in the trial. Besides, developing new drugs or testing procedures may take several years to develop. That is why the World Health Organization (WHO) and other organizations are emphasizing the repurposing therapeutic candidates that have already been approved for other diseases. Researchers are studying antiviral drugs that have performed well in animal studies against SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV as well to determine their effectivity against SARS‐CoV‐2. Here, we reviewed some of the potential therapeutics and antivirals, which are under preclinical study and clinical trials. This review would help researchers to get quick and collective information regarding potential drugs.</p>
