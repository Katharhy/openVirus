<p>Target‐based drug discovery (TDD) is one of the most successful and efficient strategies to find the remedy of any disease. An estimated 70% of the first‐class drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in between 1999 to 2013 were based on TDD (Croston,

 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). TDD is not only restricted to the discovery of small molecules as drug targets but also extends to protein biologics, genetic materials, and antibodies. The advantages of target‐based strategies over phenotypic approaches include high throughput, convenient, and less expensive (Croston,

 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0201" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Molecular pharmacology, biochemistry, genomics, computational modeling, structural biology, system biology, and mutational analysis are usually employed to carry out the TDD for the complete understanding of any drug candidate and also ensuring the effective therapeutics for upcoming days (Croston,
