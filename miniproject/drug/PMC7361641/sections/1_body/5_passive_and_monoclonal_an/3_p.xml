<p>Another possible treatment option is monoclonal antibody therapy. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, blocks vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to halt the angiogenesis in cancer patients (Ellis,

A Phase 3 randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, multicenter study of Remdesivir in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID‐19 has been completed (NCT04257656). A multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial is undergoing at Qilu Hospital of Shandong University to check the safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in severe or critical patients with COVID‐19 (NCT04305106). COVID‐19 patients encounter severe hypoxia, which can upregulate VEGF. Bevacizumab might reduce the VEGF level and reduce the severity of the disease (Wang, Cai, et al.,
