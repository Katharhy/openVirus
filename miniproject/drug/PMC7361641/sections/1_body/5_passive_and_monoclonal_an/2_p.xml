<p>In the passive antibody therapy approach, the antibodies from the blood plasma or serum (convalescent plasma or sera) of people who have recuperated from SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are used to enhance the immunity of newly infected patients and those at risk of the disease, such as frontline caregivers or essential service providers. These serum antibodies can bind to and neutralize SARS‐CoV‐2 (Casadevall &amp; Pirofski, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). The precise timing of collecting blood from the recovered patient is crucial to boost the immunity of the patients (Casadevall &amp; Pirofski, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Such approaches of using convalescent sera or plasma were used effectively in the past during mumps and measles epidemics (Casadevall &amp; Pirofski, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). This approach has already been applied in China, where five SARS‐CoV‐2 infected, severely ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome were treated with convalescent plasma transfusion from five different recovered patients (Chen, Zhang, et al.,

 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0168" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). This initiative showed promising results and improved the clinical condition of the treated patients (Shen et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0151" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). However, the limited number of participants in this study precludes a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of administering convalescent plasma. It emphasizes the need for an evaluation in clinical trials with a larger sample size and proper randomized study design (Shen et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0151" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Recently, convalescent plasma therapy has started to treat 245 COVID‐19 patients (Casadevall &amp; Pirofski, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>); this study will focus on the feasibility and effectiveness of plasma therapy.
