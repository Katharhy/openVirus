<p>As COVID‐19 spreads rapidly, the shortest and fastest approaches such as drug repurposing could be of the right choice that needs to be employed to discover potential therapeutics. Currently, some repurposed drugs have shown therapeutic promise, and thus Favipiravir, for instance, has already received temporary approval for use in COVID‐19 patients. Other compounds with antiviral potential, for example, β‐d‐N
 <sup>4</sup>‐hydroxycytidine showing inhibitory effects against Chikungunya Virus, also need to be evaluated against SARS‐CoV‐2. However, recent hype on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, for example, as COVID‐19 therapy should be handled carefully, as some studies claimed unprecedented side‐effects posed by these anti‐malarial drugs (Mehra et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0124" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Simultaneously, the path to vaccine development also needs to be minimized for long‐term protection, of course addressing all the possible side‐effects. As viruses are prone to frequent mutation, vaccines based on a single target might not work for a longer time. Recently, in silico studies identified several protein subunits as vaccine candidates, combining them into a single vaccine or multiple epitope vaccines might give better results against SARS‐CoV‐2.
