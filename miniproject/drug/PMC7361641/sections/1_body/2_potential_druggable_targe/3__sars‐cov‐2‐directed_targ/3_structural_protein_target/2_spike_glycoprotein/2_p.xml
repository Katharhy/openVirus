<p>Recently, Wan et al. (

 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0163" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) sequenced and characterized RBD of SARS‐CoV‐2, including its receptor‐binding motif (RBM) that directly associates with ACE2. They also identified some important amino acid residues in SARS‐CoV‐2 RBM (especially Gln493), which facilitates the interactions with human ACE2 and reveals the high capacity of SARS‐Cov‐2 human infection. Moreover, other crucial amino acid residues in SARS‐CoV‐2 RBM, particularly Asn501, contributed SARS‐CoV‐2, gaining some ability for human‐to‐human transmission (Tai et al.,

 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0178" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). It was also found that five important amino acids of RBD are conserved in Pangolin‐CoV and SARS‐CoV‐2 (Zhang, Lin, et al.,
