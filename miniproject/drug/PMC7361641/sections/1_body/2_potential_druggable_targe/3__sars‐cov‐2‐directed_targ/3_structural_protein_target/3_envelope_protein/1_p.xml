<p>E protein of coronavirus is a short polypeptide integral membrane protein that has been involved with different steps of the life cycle of the virus, such as assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis (Masters, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0121" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). It has been reported that the absence or inactivation of E protein could impact either virion morphology or tropism (Khattari et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0090" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Pervushin et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0135" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). E proteins of coronaviruses have shown cation‐selective ion channel activity and thus have membrane permeabilizing property (Wilson, McKinlay, Gage, &amp; Ewart, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0185" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). SARS‐CoVs lacking E protein show lower viral titer, immature, and inefficient progenies (Kuo, Hurst, &amp; Masters, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0097" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>), thereby recommending E protein a suitable drug target to prevent viral replication and infection.
