<p>Proteolytic enzymes play an essential role in viral replication, and hence could be the target of choice for the development of effective therapy against viral infections. PLpro, also termed as NSP 3, had been extensively studied for coronaviruses (Báez‐Santos et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Lei et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0102" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Ratia et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0137" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>) and the efficacy of PLpro inhibitors such as chloroquine and formoterol have been investigated recently for the treatment of COVID‐19 (Rimanshee, Amit, Vishal, &amp; Mukesh, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0138" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Wu et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0188" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). PLpro cleaves the N‐terminal part of the polyproteins producing mature NSP1, NSP2, and NSP3, a process that is crucial for viral replication. The cleavage specificity of PLpro corresponds to the pattern (R/K)L(R/K)GG↓X. Moreover, the enzyme acts as deubiquitinase that removes (poly) ubiquitin units from proteins tagged with them (Barretto et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Lindner et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0112" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). The deubiquitinase activity of PLpro interferes nuclear import of interferon‐regulatory factor 3 and the phosphorylation, thereby preventing the production of type‐I interferons, such as IFN‐α and IFN‐β by the infected host cell and also helps in peptide substrate recognition (Barretto et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Clementz et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Devaraj et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Frieman, Ratia, Johnston, Mesecar, &amp; Baric, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Ratia et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0137" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Additionally, PLpro clears ubiquitin and interferon‐sensitive gene 15 from host‐cell proteins, a mechanism that aids coronaviruses to evade host innate immune responses. Finally, the PLpro has been reported to interfere with the nuclear factor κB pathway, which further assists SARS‐CoV to counteract the innate immune response of the infected cells (Clementz et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Therefore, pharmacological targeting of PLpro by developing PLpro inhibitors might constitute a potential therapeutic strategy that would be advantageous in not only preventing viral replication but also ensuring the normal regulation of signal networks in the infected cells.
