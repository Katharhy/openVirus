<p>ACE2 is a type I membrane protein, which is expressed in the heart, lungs, kidneys, and intestine. An N‐terminal peptidase domain (PD) and a C terminal Collectrin‐like domain (CLD) are usually found in a full‐length ACE2 (Donoghue et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>; H. Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0198" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). A recent report demonstrated that the ectodomain of the SARS‐CoV‐2S protein interacts with the PD of ACE2 (Wrapp et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0187" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Like SARS‐CoV, the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus exploits the ACE2 receptor to gain entry into host cells. Human cell‐derived proteases cleave SARS‐CoV‐2 S protein into S1 and S2, where S1 initially interacts its receptor molecule ACE2, and the other fragment, S2, further leads to the membrane fusion after the cleavage by a human cell surface serine protease (TMPRSS2) (Hoffmann et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0076" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular basis for coronavirus recognition and infection. The S protein of SARS‐CoV‐2 is approximately 10‐ to 20‐fold more likely to bind to human ACE2 protein the S protein of SARS‐CoV (Wrapp et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0187" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). This increase in affinity might have facilitated a more favorable person‐to‐person transmission of the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection than the SARS‐CoV (Hoffmann et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0076" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). ACE2 can thus act as a unique adhesion protein molecule for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and be a promising drug target for the prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Disrupting the interaction between spike protein and ACE2 might, therefore, be a possible way of developing a drug against SARS‐CoV‐2. A Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trial of human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2), a 23‐mer peptide fragment, was carried out recently and suggested to use for the treatment of COVID‐19 (Khan et al.,

 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0197" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). SARS‐CoV‐2 infected Vero‐E6 lines were incubated with hrsACE2 and found that hrsACE2 can preclude the early entrance of SARS‐CoV‐2 infections in host cells perhaps by binding with RBD of S protein (Monteil et al.,
