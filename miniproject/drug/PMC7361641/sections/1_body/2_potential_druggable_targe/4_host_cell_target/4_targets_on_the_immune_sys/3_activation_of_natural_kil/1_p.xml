<p>The innate immune response itself, without the association of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and antibodies, is capable of controlling SARS‐CoV (Frieman, Heise, &amp; Baric, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). NK cells are the part of innate lymphocyte subsets that mediate anti‐tumor and antiviral responses, and therefore have the potential for clinical use (Abel, Yang, Thakar, &amp; Malarkannan, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Previous studies showed that NK cells showed significant roles in mitigating of SARS‐CoV (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; National Research Project for SARS (NSPS), 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0130" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Recent epidemiological studies showed that SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in children is less frequent and lethal compared to that of adults, which might be due to the increased lymphocyte count, especially NK cells and trained immunity in children (Cristiani et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Therefore, the approaches focused on valorizing the innate antiviral immune responses are a possible way to find a remedy against SARS‐CoV‐2. Arabinoxylan treatment resulted in the upregulation of NK cells against neuroblastoma in vitro and in vivo studies (Pérez‐Martínez et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0134" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Arabinoxylan, therefore, possesses potentiality for the treatment of COVID‐19 patients; however, clinical trials are needed to determine its effectivity.
