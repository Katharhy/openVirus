<p>The common cold is due to a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. A total of more than 200 cold-associated viruses are known, and often more than one viral species is involved in the infection at the same time. The most commonly responsible virus is rhinovirus (30–80% of cases), a genus of Picornaviridae with 99 known serotypes; other viral aetiological infectious agents include coronavirus (10–15%) and Orthomyxoviridae (5–15%), human parainfluenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, enterovirus, and metapneumovirus. Besides, similar symptoms can also be caused by bacterial infections (
