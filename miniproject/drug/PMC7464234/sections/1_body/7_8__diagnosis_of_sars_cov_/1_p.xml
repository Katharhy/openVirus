<p>SARS-Cov-2 infection diagnosis is mostly performed by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for viral RNA detection, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention instructions. Although this is the most popular approach, other methods include the CRISPR-based DETECTR assay [
