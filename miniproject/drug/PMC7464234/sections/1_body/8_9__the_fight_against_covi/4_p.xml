<p>Another important finding was that in the small urban town of 
 <italic>Vo’ Euganeo,</italic> where the second outbreak of COVID-19 broke out after Lombardy, it was found that 43.2% of people positive for NPS/OPS were asymptomatic. The experience of the municipality of 
 <italic>Vo’ Euganeo</italic> was, therefore, interesting to analyze because it allowed a closed community to be studied, as the town was quarantined well before the regional and national lockdown that took place three weeks later. Actually, in Veneto and only in this Italian region, there is an epidemiological and biological registry of all the cases, a mapping of the contacts house-by-house, and therefore an ability to act immediately.
