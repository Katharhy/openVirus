<p>The reactions of health systems to COVID-19 in the world differed from country to country. When COVID-19 reached Italy, the first region to be affected was Lombardy, with over 11 million inhabitants. Later, the contagion spread to Veneto and Emilia Romagna and then to all the other Italian regions. Since the beginning of the pandemic, more NPS/OPS have been carried out in Veneto than in Lombardy. This policy has shown that performing a high number of NPS/OPS has led to a greater discovery of positive COVID-19 subjects/patients and to isolate them at home in quarantine, with less overcrowding of hospitals and, therefore, fewer deaths (
