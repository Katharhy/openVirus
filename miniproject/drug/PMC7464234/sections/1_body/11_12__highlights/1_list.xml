  <p>COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has currently emerged as one of the most intense and overwhelming viral infection for the humankind to manage.</p>

  <p>As the number of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 continues to rise globally, rapid diagnostics at earlier stages, therapeutics, and vaccines will become crucial for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

  <p>There is some scientific evidence of efficacy of particular drugs such as antiviral (i.e., RDV), antiparasitic (i.e., hydroxychloroquine), and anti-inflammatory approaches (i.e., tocilizumab) for treatment of COVID-19.</p>

  <p>In the light of the exuberance of the hostâ€™s inflammatory response, a potential cause of lung damage and subsequent mortality, the priority should be to identify drugs with potent and specific antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anticoagulant properties.</p>

  <p>A rational therapy would require careful evaluation of the cytokine profile of selected cohorts of subjects, which include SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with pneumonia or admitted to ICU. COVID-19 clinical evidence has shown that the first seven days of illness are crucial. To initiate therapeutic trials based on the rational use of anti-inflammatory drugs that directly inhibit the synthesis process of inflammatory cytokines including IL-16 and IL-17, would be desirable in the near future.</p>
