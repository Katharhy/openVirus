<p>Compared with the known SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV genome, SARS-CoV-2 shows homology of 92.83%, while on the amino acid sequence of the S protein, the homology is even 97.25% (

 <xref rid="B43-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] may also be a source of infection. There are two main routes of infection: respiratory droplets and close contact. The possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment exists. The existence that superspreaders may exist in the early stage has been postulated [

In the eye, ACE2 receptor is not expressed in the conjunctival or corneal epithelium but is expressed in the retinal and retinal pigment epithelium [

 <xref rid="B46-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 may enter the tears through droplets and then be transferred to the respiratory tract through the nasolacrimal canal. Indeed, conjunctivitis is one of the symptoms of COVID-19, which is often indistinguishable from other viral conjunctivitis. Although further studies are needed, the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through tears is low, even if the virus was demonstrated in tears or conjunctival secretions of symptomatic patients [
 <xref rid="B47-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In addition, it has not been demonstrated that there is a correlation between the presence of the virus in the nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), oropharyngeal swab (OPS), and ocular secretion [
