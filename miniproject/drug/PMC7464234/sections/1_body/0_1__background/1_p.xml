CoVs are a group of highly diverse, enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA enveloped viruses (+ssRNA) that range from 26 to 32 kilobases. The name coronavirus derives from the crown-shaped tips that are present on their surface [

Previously, six CoVs have been identified as human-susceptible viruses, among which α-CoVs, CoV-229E, CoV-NL63, β-CoVs, CoV-HKU1, and CoV-OC43 own low pathogenicity, cause mild respiratory symptoms similar to a common cold, respectively [
