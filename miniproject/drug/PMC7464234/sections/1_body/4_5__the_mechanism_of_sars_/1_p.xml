<p>Previous analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strongly suggests that this new CoV, like SARS, uses ACE2 receptor, a target for the treatment of hypertension [

Accumulating data suggest that the lung is the most important and vulnerable target organ of the SARS-CoV-2. It is possible that the large lung surface area makes the lung highly susceptible to inhaled viruses. Indeed, 83% of the cells expressing human ACE2 receptor are type II alveolar epithelial cells, which can serve as a reservoir for viral invasion, promoting rapid viral expansion and a vicious circle of destruction of the local alveolar wall. This loop results in a rapidly progressive and widespread alveolar damage [
