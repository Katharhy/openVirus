<p>After membrane fusion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-01228-f001">Figure 1</xref>), the viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm, facilitating its replication. The abundant expression of the ACE2 receptor in type II alveolar cells promotes a rapid viral multiplication with the subsequent destruction of the local alveolar wall. This process results with a rapidly progressive and widespread alveolar damage with the occurrence of concomitant cytokine/chemokine cascades (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-01228-f001">Figure 1</xref>). In this setting, females seem to have fewer ACE2 receptors on the lung surface than males and this could contribute, together with some genetic and hormonal factors, to give more protection to COVID-19 infection and make them less susceptible [
