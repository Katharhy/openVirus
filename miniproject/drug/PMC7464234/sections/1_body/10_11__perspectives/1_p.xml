<p>Currently, COVID-19 is only prevented by the use of masks, safety distance, and hand washing. For this disease, there is not yet a vaccine, as was the case for SARS and MERS though several studies are currently underway [
 <xref rid="B94-microorganisms-08-01228" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. To date, there are no medical treatments for COVID-19 with proven effectiveness. Novel treatments and/or vaccines will take time to be developed and distributed to patients. The search for effective treatments for COVID-19 infection is a complex process and not all are recommended in the absence of clear evidence of proven efficacy. SARS-CoV-2 owns potential therapeutic targets similar to those of other RNA CoVs, such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.
