<p id="p0070">During these trying times, it is important to remember that delaying elective surgery is for the greater good of patients as most hospital resources are necessary to prevent and treat the spread of COVID-19 virus. Undergoing a successful hip or knee arthroplasty requires a dedicated team of nurses, therapists, doctors, and other providers. By allowing these medical providers to work in other sectors of health care or simply stay home and promote social distancing, we are fighting this disease as a global team. There is also the unnecessary risk that an asymptomatic patient is brought in for elective surgery and then infects members of the surgical team or other patients. It is paramount that individuals adhere to government recommendations during this time.</p>
