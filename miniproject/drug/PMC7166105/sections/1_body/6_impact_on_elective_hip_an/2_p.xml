<p id="p0065">This has impacted all Americans and has led to the cancellation of many elective hip and knee surgeries. Many urgent and emergent cases are still being performed under the guidance and protocols of individual hospitals. As a rule, if delaying the surgery (such as prosthetic joint infections, periprosthetic fractures/impending fracture, and/or ruptured tendons/ligaments) more than 4 to 6 weeks will cause more harm than good, it is likely in the patientâ€™s best interest to move forward despite the current state of the health care system. However, the risks of being infected with COVID-19 in the perioperative setting must be discussed with the patient, as emerging data suggest a worse clinical outcome if this occurs in the postoperative setting. Furthermore, disposition to a higher risk facility such as a nursing home or rehabilitation facility may place patients in an unsafe environment. In these urgent and emergent cases, preoperative planning to determine where the patient will recover after surgery is imperative.</p>
