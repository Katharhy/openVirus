<p id="p0015">This pandemic has already strained our medical resources and affected all sectors of health care, especially elective surgical procedures. At some point, many orthopedic surgeons will be called on to provide their expertise and compassionate care to COVID-19 patients with fractures, infections, or other emergencies. In various ‘hot spots’ around the country, orthopedic surgeons are being redeployed to the front lines to assist medical teams in the emergency department, hospital floors, and intensive care units. It is an all-hands-on-deck effort to save lives. During this time of need, orthopedic providers can help limit the spread of the illness by educating patients and by following recommended behaviors, such as hand hygiene and avoiding close social contact. This allows us to provide leadership to our patients, staff, families, and communities to make a direct impact in minimizing transmission.</p>
