<p id="p0085">The sample size required for the study was reached (n = 726), with a mean age of 26.9 years (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). A majority of participants were females (71.9%), and not married/single (72.6%). Participants came from private (54.1%) and public universities (45.9%) with the majority having a bachelor's in pharmacy degree (40.2%). Pharmacy students made up 35.3% of the sample while the rest ranged between pharmacy owners, pharmacy employees, hospital pharmacists, pharmacy trainees, academics and others. Most of the participants lived in Amman, the capital of Jordan. If not a student, most of the participants had graduated recently from the university (1–5 years ago, 28.1%), and hence, 1–5 years was the years of experience reported by the majority of participants (78.8%). Many participants did not attend any educational workshop last year (26.6%) while few attended 5 or more workshops (4.4% and 8.8% respectively).
