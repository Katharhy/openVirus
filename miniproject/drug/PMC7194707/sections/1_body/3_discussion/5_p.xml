<p id="p0150">Ibuprofen the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicine, or NSAID, is sold under a number of brand names, including Advil® and Nurofen®. In addition to treating pain, it's often used to manage fever associated with various viral or bacterial infections. At the time of designing this study, it was said that NSAIDs such as ibuprofen can increase the risk of complications when used during viral infections (including the coronavirus infection). However, the WHO declared on March 18, 2020 under a post titled ‘Anti-inflammatory drug has been subject of conflicting reports’ that ‘there's no evidence to suggest that using ibuprofen to manage symptoms of COVID-19 will worsen the condition’. Earlier reports said a spokesperson had cautioned against using ibuprofen to manage symptoms of the illness caused by the coronavirus until WHO experts could investigate’. This case provides a good example on the confusing information provided to healthcare professionals, including pharmacists, via the media regarding COVID-19 pandemic.
