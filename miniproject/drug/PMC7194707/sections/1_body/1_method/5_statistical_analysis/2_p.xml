<p id="p0080">Screening of the factors affecting participants' awareness score about coronavirus pandemic was carried out using linear regression. For multiple linear regression analysis, using entry method, the variable entry criterion was set to 0.25, i.e. any variables found to be significant on the single predictor level (P &lt; 0.25) were entered into the multiple linear regression analysis to explore the variables that were significantly and independently associated with participants’ awareness score. Variables were selected after checking their independence, where tolerance values &gt; 0.1 and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) values were &lt;10 were selected to indicate the absence of multicollinearity between the independent variables in regression analysis. The homoscedasticity assumption for multiple linear regression was checked using Breusch-Pagan test, with a P ≥ 0.05 indicating the absence of heteroscedasticity.</p>
