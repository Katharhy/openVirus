<p>It is noteworthy that while enterotropic polioviruses, and some other NPEVs that cause AFM, often can be isolated from stool for weeks, they, too, like nonenterotropic EV-D68, are uncommonly isolated from the CSF of paralytic cases (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Similarly to epidemic polio, the AFM epidemic has been associated with cases of cranial nerve paralysis, bulbar paralysis, and meningoencephalitis (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Once viral damage to gray matter has occurred—via viral cytopathicity or a pathogenic immune response—intracellular virus may not be released into the (anatomically distant) spinal fluid and thus detected by lumbar puncture. Furthermore, although easily visible on MRI (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), involved cord and bulbar gray matter cannot safely be biopsied to allow for direct virus isolation. For these reasons, EV-D68-induced pathogenic processes associated with early brief low-level viral replication and early transient viremia, or with direct axonal extension to internal cord gray matter, might well lead to AFM without providing good opportunity for viral detection.
