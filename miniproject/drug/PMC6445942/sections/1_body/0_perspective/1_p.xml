<p>In recent decades, new human infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Nipah virus infection, among others have emerged. Well-known diseases also have reemerged because of human movement, crowding, and other population factors (e.g., dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever), warfare and natural disasters (e.g., cholera), and viral evolution (e.g., poultry-adapted influenza A H5N1 and H7N9) (

Joining this list is epidemic acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), characterized by sudden denervation-associated muscle paralysis of healthy children (and occasionally adults) in one or more limbs that mimics poliomyelitis but which is not caused by polioviruses (
