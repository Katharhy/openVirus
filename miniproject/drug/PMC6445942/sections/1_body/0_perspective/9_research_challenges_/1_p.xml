<p>A major challenge in the study of this disease is that AFM is an uncommon, sporadically occurring complication of a common infection that is difficult to diagnose with viral specificity. Moreover, one cannot predict where or when it will strike next, and the site of devastating tissue damage is inaccessible to direct study. Research progress is greatly impeded by lack of understanding of the natural history and pathogenesis of AFM disease, including viral pathogenesis, and by lack of understanding of AFM epidemiology, including aspects of cross-reactive immunity associated with the many and rapidly evolving NPEVs, especially EV-D68 and EV-A71. Perhaps, as has long been predicted, there is a “poliovirus niche” into which one or more NPEVs will evolve as we approach the eradication of polio (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). It is conceivable that we may be seeing the early stages of such an evolution.
