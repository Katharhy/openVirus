<p>As important as determining the cause of AFM is the establishment of optimal interventions to prevent, limit, or reverse neurologic damage that is often advanced at the time of clinical presentation. Attempts at treatment with interventions such as intravenous immunoglobulin, glucocorticoids, plasma exchange, and antiviral drugs such as pleconaril have been largely unsuccessful (

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Specific therapeutic goals targeted loss of flexibility, loss of muscle power, decreased vital capacity, potential for residual deformity, loss of skill, and loss of functional stamina. In recent decades, recognition of the postpolio syndrome, usually developing decades after initial paralysis, and with potential future implications for AFM patients, has led to additional physical therapy approaches (
