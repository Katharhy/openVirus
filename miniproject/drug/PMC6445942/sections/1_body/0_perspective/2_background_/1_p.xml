<p>AFM actually is a newly coined term for a subset of cases of the long-recognized syndrome of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The term AFP subsumes additional causes of flaccid paralysis such as trauma, tumors, and immunopathologic disorders. Clinical descriptions of AFP appeared in medical textbooks in 1789. Clusters of cases began to be recognized in 1840, with larger epidemics documented in Sweden in 1881 and in the United States in 1894. Early, widespread epidemics came to be referred to as “poliomyelitis” (“polio” for short, derived from the Greek words for inflammation of the neural gray matter). In the late 1940s, the breakthrough (and Nobel Prize-winning) technology of viral cultivation in tissue culture led to the isolation of three infectious agents of epidemic polio (poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3), to further clinical and epidemiologic characterization of poliomyelitis, to effective polio vaccines, and to global polio eradication efforts, now in their final stages.
