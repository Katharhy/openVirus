<p>A related question is how to explain the paradox of EV-D68 epidemics in populations with virtually 100% preexisting neutralizing antibody to EV-D68, e.g., 2012â€“2013 preepidemic data from Kansas City, Missouri (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Medical record reviews might identify missed or misclassified prior cases. More likely, perhaps, is that complex cross-reactive and cross-protective immunity of circulating enteroviruses drives viral evolution. It is of note that large epidemics of EV-A71 have in the past been associated with clade and subclade replacement (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Furthermore, as is observed with other human viruses adapted to superficial mucosal infection, e.g., respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), noroviruses, and many others, the correlates of protective immunity to viruses such as EV-D68 may include mucosal immune factors such as IgA and local tissue-resident immune cells.
