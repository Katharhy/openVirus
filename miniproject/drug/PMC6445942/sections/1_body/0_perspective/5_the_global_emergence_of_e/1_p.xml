<p>Although sporadic AFM is not rare, its sudden appearance in epidemic form is unprecedented. Beginning in the summer and fall of 2012, California and other locales began to detect small, unexpected upticks in AFM cases featuring influenza-like respiratory prodromes and associated with various NPEVs. These AFM-associated NPEVs prominently included EV-D68 (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), an historically obscure NPEV that had been reemerging globally since 2008 to cause pandemic respiratory disease (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The reemergence of EV-D68 was itself unprecedented. Although acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis associated with EVA24v and with EV-D70 had caused global tropical air hub-to-air hub spread (
