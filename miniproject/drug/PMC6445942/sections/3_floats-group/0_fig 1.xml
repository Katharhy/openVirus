  <p>Epidemic curve of 551 confirmed cases of AFM reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by month of onset, 14 August 2014 to 31 January 2019 (
   <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The epidemic curves of summer/fall AFM correspond closely to typical seasonal peaks of most NPEVs, including EV-D68 (
   <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
   <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Note that the U.S. epidemics have occurred in 2-year cycles, with peak case onsets in the middle week of September in 2014, 2016, and 2018 but with few cases during any season of the intervening years 2015 and 2017.
