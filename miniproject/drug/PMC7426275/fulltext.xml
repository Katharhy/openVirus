To support the discovery and development of antiviral drugs against YFV, we characterized a panel of rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the three YFV structural proteins and five non-structural proteins and demonstrated these antibody reagents in conjunction with viral RNA metabolic labeling, double-stranded RNA staining and membrane floatation assays as powerful tools for investigating YFV polyprotein processing, replication complex formation, viral RNA synthesis and high throughput discovery of antiviral drugs. Specifically, the proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein can be analyzed by Western blot assays. The predominant nuclear localization of NS5 protein as well as the relationship between intracellular viral non-structural protein distribution and foci of YFV RNA replication can be revealed by immunofluorescence staining and membrane flotation assays. Using an antibody against YFV NS4B protein as an example, in-cell western and high-content imaging assays have been developed for high throughput discovery of antiviral agents. A synergistic antiviral effect of an YFV NS4B-targeting antiviral agent BDAA and a NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor (Sofosbuvir) was also demonstrated with the high-content imaging assay. Apparently, the antibody-based assays established herein not only facilitate the discovery and development of antiviral agents against YFV, but also provide valuable tools to dissect the molecular mechanism by which the antiviral agents inhibit YFV replication.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0015"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Lack of antivirals compromises the efforts to control the yellow fever virus outbreak.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Antibodies of various YFV proteins facilitate study of YFV infection and pathogenesis.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Development of antibody-based assays provide tools for screening of YFV antivirals.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">The set of antibodies and assays is useful for MOA study of YFV antivirals.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Yellow fever virus</kwd><kwd>Antibody</kwd><kwd>Antiviral assay</kwd><kwd>High throughput screening</kwd><kwd>Antiviral</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0030">Yellow fever is a mosquito-borne disease caused by yellow fever virus (YFV) infection and frequently associated with a severe form of hemorrhagic fever and liver injury with jaundice leading to a mortality rate of up to 60% (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Monath and Vasconcelos, 2015</xref>). YFV infection can be prevented by the attenuated 17D vaccine and its derivatives (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Klitting et al., 2018a</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">2018b</xref>). The combination of vector-control and vaccination campaigns has significantly reduced the incidence of YFV infection in the human population. However, the virus remains in a sylvatic cycle between mosquito vectors and nonhuman primates and can occasionally transmit to humans through mosquito bites. This results in tremendous difficulty to manage the disease, not only at individual and local levels, but also globally. Concern has been raised regarding the possibility of yellow fever taking hold in previously unaffected and unvaccinated parts of the world such as Asia, where host, vector, and climatic conditions could conspire to promote YFV dissemination.</p><p id="p0035">In 2016, there were urban yellow fever outbreaks in Angola and Democratic Republic of Congo, which resulted in vaccine shortage and emergent vaccination campaigns using only one-fifth of the regular vaccine dosage in high-risk populations (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Calisher and Woodall, 2016</xref>). In late 2017 and early 2018, there was another urban outbreak in Brazil. While the number of yellow fever cases are significantly underreported due to the undeveloped nature of many endemic areas, it is estimated that up to 1.7 million YFV infections occur in Africa each year resulting in 29,000&#x02013;60,000 deaths (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Douam and Ploss, 2018</xref>). This outnumbers the estimated death toll of global dengue virus infection (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs100/en/" id="intref0010">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs100/en/</ext-link>). The World Health Organization and its partners responded to these recent outbreaks of yellow fever and emphasized the importance of additional research and the development of new vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics as countermeasures (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/emergencies/yellow-fever/response/en/" id="intref0015">http://www.who.int/emergencies/yellow-fever/response/en/</ext-link>).</p><p id="p0040">While improvement of vaccines and vaccination policy remains the best strategy to control global yellow fever endemics and epidemics, it is anticipated that other yellow fever outbreaks will occur in the near future. Therefore, it is crucial to develop safe and highly efficacious antiviral strategies against YFV infection that can be used not only for treating infected patients, but also for the prophylactic treatment of individuals potentially exposed to YFV, since sufficient post-vaccination immunity requires at least a week to develop (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Douam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gaucher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Querec et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, a safe antiviral therapy would be invaluable for visitors to endemic/epidemic regions who cannot safely take the attenuated vaccine (e.g., seniors and immunocompromised individuals). Presently, there is no antiviral drug available for the treatment and/or prevention of yellow fever (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Beasley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Douam and Ploss, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Julander, 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0045">Over the past decades, tremendous industrial and academic efforts have been made toward the discovery and development of vaccines and antiviral agents against emerging flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al., 2013</xref>). However, research on the molecular virology and pathogenesis of YFV, as well as development of novel vaccines and antiviral agents, have lagged largely due to the unrealistic assumption that current vaccination strategies would be sufficient to prevent and ultimately eliminate the disease. Improving yellow fever management through the development of effective therapeutics will require in-depth understanding of the molecular biology and pathogenesis of YFV, knowledge of which remains surprisingly limited given YFV's medical significance.</p><p id="p0050">Like other flaviviruses, YFV has a single positive-strand RNA genome approximately 11&#x000a0;kb in length with a 5&#x02032; cap but no 3&#x02032;-polyA tail. The genome encodes a polyprotein that is co-translationally processed by viral and host cellular proteases into three structural proteins (<italic>i.e.</italic>, capsid (C), membrane (prM/M), envelope (E)) and seven non-structural (NS) proteins (<italic>i.e</italic>., NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5) (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Douam and Ploss, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Lescar et al., 2018</xref>). Few reagents and research tools, particularly the antibodies against YFV proteins, are available for investigating the molecular mechanism of YFV replication and pathogenesis. Currently, the commercially available YFV antibodies are only limited to the envelope and NS1 proteins. A couple of epitope-mapped monoclonal antibodies specific for YFV envelope or NS1 protein were reported, but have not been made available commercially (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adungo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ricciardi-Jorge et al., 2017</xref>). Polyclonal antibodies against capsid and NS1 have been developed as well, which were proposed for use in YFV research and for the development of novel diagnostic tests (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Stock et al., 2015</xref>). Taking advantage of the recently available rabbit polyclonal antibodies against all three YFV structural proteins and five of the seven non-structural proteins (i.e., NS1, NS2B, NS3, NS4B and NS5) from GeneTex, Inc., we established several antibody-based assays and demonstrated their utility, in conjunction with viral RNA metabolic labeling, double stranded RNA staining and membrane floatation assays, in molecular and cellular analyses of viral proteins and RNA synthesis in YFV infection, antiviral drug discovery and mechanistic studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Cell lines and viruses</title><p id="p0055">Vero cells were purchased from ATCC.

The reactivity of these antibodies was initially confirmed by Western blot assays using either recombinant protein or whole cell lysates of 293T cells transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing individual YFV protein, corresponding to the originally used immunogens (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.genetex.com" id="intref0020">https://www.genetex.com</ext-link>). In this study, these ten YFV antibodies were further validated by Western blot assays using cell lysates from YFV 17D-infected Vero cells. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>
A, for the eight antibodies against YFV capsid, NS1, NS2B, NS3, NS4B or NS5, each detected a single predominant protein species with the expected molecular weight of the corresponding structural or non-structural YFV proteins, only in the YFV-infected cell lysate. Each of the two NS1 antibodies, generated by using recombinant proteins encompassing a sequence within either the center or C-terminal region of YFV NS1 protein, detected a protein species with the same electrophoretic mobility. Similarly, the two NS3 antibodies, generated by using synthetic peptides encompassing a sequence within either the C-terminus or center region of YFV NS3 protein, also showed comparable sensitivity and specificity in detecting NS3 protein with approximately 69kD. On the contrary, the YFV envelope antibody revealed not only a specific band of approximately 50kD in YFV-infected cell lysates, but also a cross-reacting band that overlaps the &#x003b2;-actin signal in both YFV-infected and uninfected cell lysates, raising concerns for its specificity in recognizing YFV envelope protein in certain assays. The other situation of detecting multiple bands in Western blot assay was observed when prM antibody was used, which only occurred in YFV-infected cells. It is known that immature flaviviral virions bud into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mature in the trans-Golgi network with acidic pH during transportation toward the cell surface (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2008</xref>). This involves the cleavage of prM protein by cellular furin protease into the &#x0201c;pr&#x0201d; peptide and the M protein (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Stadler et al., 1997</xref>). Accordingly, the membrane protein of YFV should exist as both immature (prM) and mature (M) forms in the lysate of YFV-infected cells. Because the immunogen for the prM antibody is a synthetic peptide encompassing a sequence in the mature M protein, the antibody thus, as anticipated, recognized both prM and M proteins in the lysates of YFV-infected cells. While the upper band has a size corresponding to prM, the lower weaker band is consistent with M (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2014</xref>).<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p><bold>Detection of YFV structural and non-structural proteins by Western blot assay</bold>.

, similar to what was reported for DENV-infected cells, antibodies against the YFV NS proteins (NS1, NS2B, NS3, NS4B) revealed dot-like cytoplasmic structures located in the perinuclear area of infected cells (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>

Furthermore, each of the non-structural proteins co-localized with double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), the putative viral RNA replication intermediates that localize in the replication-hosting vesicles derived from the ER membrane (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Welsch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Yi et al., 2011</xref>).

Therefore, if a similar replication mechanism holds true for YFV, it is not surprising that some of the dsRNAs also co-localize with structural proteins. An exception is NS5, which, in agreement with previous reports in DENV-infected cells (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2006</xref>), localized predominantly in the nuclei of YFV-infected cells. Consistent with its RNA polymerase function, electron tomography has identified DENV NS5 protein also localized in the cytoplasmic vesicles, the presumed sites of flavivirus RNA replication. However, the cytoplasmic DENV NS5 protein is barely detectable by immunofluorescence staining due to its relatively low levels and poor accessibility (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2013</xref>).

It is, therefore, conceivable that investigating the distribution and interaction of viral proteins and host cellular components at the distinct intracellular membrane compartments is essential to understanding the mechanism of flaviviral genome replication and its inhibition by antiviral agents. To analyze the association of viral and cellular proteins with intracellular membranes, we utilized a membrane flotation assay to separate membrane associated proteins and investigate their interactions with cellular lipids and proteins by a membrane flotation assay through sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. As described in Section <xref rid="sec2.6" ref-type="sec">2.6</xref> in detail, YFV-infected cells were lysed mechanically in a hypotonic buffer without detergent to preserve cell membranes. The cell lysate was loaded at the bottom of the gradient, overlaid with the lower densities of sucrose solutions. The cellular membranes floated up during the ultracentrifugation to the gradients equivalent to their own density. At the completion of centrifugation, ten equal volume fractions were collected from the top of gradient. The membrane identity and associated proteins in each fraction were analyzed by Western blot assay with antibodies against organelle markers or viral and cellular proteins of interest. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>
A, as anticipated, viral NS2B, NS4B and envelope proteins were enriched with the ER membrane marker calnexin in fraction 2. Furthermore, treatment of the ER membranes (fraction 2 from the experiment presented in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A) with a strong detergent DDM completely disrupted the ER membrane and YFV NS2B, NS4B and envelope proteins were solubilized and distributed into fractions with soluble proteins (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B), However, treatment of the ER membranes with the mild detergent digitonin only partially disrupted the membrane and a portion of the viral proteins were still associated with the detergent-resistant membrane structure, presumably lipid rafts, while the vast majority of viral proteins were solubilized under this condition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C). This is consistent with our previous finding that YFV non-structural proteins, presumed to be associated with the replication complex, were associated with detergent resistant membranes (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Yi et al., 2012</xref>). The lipid rafts-associated viral proteins have been shown to play distinct role in viral genome replication and virion particle morphogenesis at the ER. As has been demonstrated in HCV infected cells, further analysis of YFV viral and host protein-protein interaction in each of these fractions in presence of different detergents, will allow for determination of direct protein interaction or interactions relying on detergent resistant membrane (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Boyer et al., 2019</xref>).

They should accelerate the discovery of antiviral agents for all the druggable targets, including not only viral components but also cellular factors required for viral replication.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Antiviral activity of BDAA determined by different assays.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0050">Table 2</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Assay</th><th rowspan="2">Measurement</th><th colspan="2">Antiviral activity (&#x003bc;M)<hr/></th></tr><tr><th><xref rid="tbl2fnf" ref-type="table-fn">f</xref>EC<sub>50</sub></th><th><xref rid="tbl2fnf" ref-type="table-fn">f</xref>EC<sub>90</sub></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>Luciferase reporter</bold><xref rid="tbl2fna" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref></td><td align="left">YFV activated IFN-&#x003b2; promoter activity</td><td align="left">0.47&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.02</td><td align="left">1.2&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.15</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>qRT-PCR</bold><xref rid="tbl2fnb" ref-type="table-fn">b</xref></td><td align="left">YFV RNA</td><td align="left">0.18&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.1</td><td align="left">0.28&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.05</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Yield reduction</bold><xref rid="tbl2fnc" ref-type="table-fn">c</xref></td><td align="left">Viral plaque</td><td align="left">0.32&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.15</td><td align="left">1.35&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.13</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>In-cell western</bold><xref rid="tbl2fnd" ref-type="table-fn">d</xref></td><td align="left">YFV NS4B/(GTX134030)<break/>NS3/(GTX133959)</td><td align="left">0.78&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.11<break/>1.10&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.06</td><td align="left">1.75&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.27<break/>2.42&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.17</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>In-cell western</bold><xref rid="tbl2fnd" ref-type="table-fn">d</xref></td><td align="left">YFV envelope/pan flavivirus antibody (4G2)</td><td align="left">0.6&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.04</td><td align="left">1.3&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.11</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>HCI</bold><xref rid="tbl2fne" ref-type="table-fn">e</xref></td><td align="left">% of YFV NS4B&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;cells</td><td align="left">0.42&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.05</td><td align="left">0.61&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.08</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tbl2fna"><label>a</label><p id="ntpara0010">Assay was performed in 293TLR3/IFN&#x003b2;Luc cells as previously described (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2014</xref>).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tbl2fnb"><label>b</label><p id="ntpara0015">Assay was performed in Huh-7 as previously described (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2016</xref>).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tbl2fnc"><label>c</label><p id="ntpara0020">Assay was performed in Huh-7&#x000a0;cells as previously described (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2016</xref>).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tbl2fnd"><label>d</label><p id="ntpara0025">Assay was performed in Huh-7&#x000a0;cells as previously described and in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A legend (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2012</xref>).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tbl2fne"><label>e</label><p id="ntpara0030">Assay was performed in Huh-7&#x000a0;cells as described in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B legend.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tbl2fnf"><label>f</label><p id="ntpara0035">The EC<sub>50</sub> and EC<sub>90</sub> were obtained by plotting dose response curves and using GraphPad Prism 7.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="sec3.6"><label>3.6</label><title>The high content imaging assay is suitable for high throughput screen of antiviral drugs and evaluation of drug-drug interaction</title><p id="p0160">The HCI assay was also evaluated for its performance as a high-throughput screening platform.

A, while mock-treated wells have z-scores ranging from +2 to &#x02212;2, the wells treated with BDAA have scores in the range of &#x02212;8 to &#x02212;9. Furthermore, using BDAA as a positive control and mock-treated cells as a negative control, the assay has a Z&#x02019; of 0.74 in YFV-infected Huh-7&#x000a0;cells in a 96-well format. The results suggest that the HCI assay using the YFV NS4B antibody can serve as a high-throughput antiviral screening assay with a cutoff z-score value of &#x02212;3. As an application of performing the HCI assay in HTS format, we tested the synergistic effect of BDAA that targets YFV NS4B protein and Sofosbuvir, a known nucleoside analog that inhibits YFV NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The experiment was performed in five 96-well plates, with serials of nontoxic concentrations of each compound and their combinations in a two-dimensional 6&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;8 checkerboard matrix fashion, with 5 replicates. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B, consistent with published in vitro antiviral data, Sofosbuvir inhibits YFV at EC<sub>50</sub> of 8.82&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M and EC<sub>90</sub> of 32.4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">de Freitas et al., 2019</xref>). Combination of Sofosbuvir and BDAA, resulted in significant synergistic effect of inhibiting YFV replication, at suboptimal doses of both compounds, between 0.07 and 0.3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M of BDAA and 1.1&#x02013;10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M of Sofosbuvir. This result supports the notion of combination of antivirals targeting two distinct viral proteins to maximize therapeutic benefit.<fig id="fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p><bold>Development of high-content imaging-based high-throughput screening assay for YFV</bold>. (<bold>A</bold>) Huh-7&#x000a0;cells were seeded on 96-well plates and infected with YFV 17D at a MOI of 10 for 48&#x000a0;h. Half of the plate was mock-treated as negative controls, and the other half of the plate was treated with BDAA at 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M concentration as positive controls. The average of the percentage of cells with positive NS4B signals from nine fields per well were quantified and used for the calculation of the z-score for each well. Each dot in the plot represents the z-score of a single well in the 96-well plate. Z&#x02032; value, S/B, S/N and %CV were determined based on the signals from positive and negative control wells. (<bold>B</bold>) Synergistic effect between BDAA and Sofosbuvir identified using high-content imaging-based HTS assay. Huh-7&#x000a0;cells were seeded on 5 96-well plates and infected with YFV at a MOI of 10 for 1&#x000a0;h. The cells were then treated with the indicated concentrations of each compound or their combinations in a two-dimensional 6&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;8 checkerboard matrix fashion for additional 48&#x000a0;h followed by detection of YFV NS4B and quantification of fluorescent signals (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5). The EC<sub>50</sub> values were obtained by plotting mono treatment dose response curves. Synergistic plot was generated using MacSynergy II. The peak above the surface represents synergistic effect with 95% confidence interval.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0040">Fig. 7</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr7_lrg"/></fig></p><p id="p0165">In conclusion, the studies reported herein demonstrated that the availability of antibodies against eight YFV structural and non-structural proteins greatly facilitate detailed molecular analyses of YFV replication at the sub-cellular levels and provide valuable tools for the identification of key interactions between YFV proteins and host cell factors. The antibody-based assays are also proved invaluable in the screening for, and elucidation of the mode of action of, novel antiviral compounds against YFV.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adungo</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kamau</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Inoue</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hayasaka</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Posadas-Herrera</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sang</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mwau</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Morita</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Development and characterization of monoclonal antibodies to yellow fever virus and application in antigen detection and IgM capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</article-title><source>Clin.
