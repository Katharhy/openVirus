<p id="p0045">Over the past decades, tremendous industrial and academic efforts have been made toward the discovery and development of vaccines and antiviral agents against emerging flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) (
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al., 2013</xref>). However, research on the molecular virology and pathogenesis of YFV, as well as development of novel vaccines and antiviral agents, have lagged largely due to the unrealistic assumption that current vaccination strategies would be sufficient to prevent and ultimately eliminate the disease. Improving yellow fever management through the development of effective therapeutics will require in-depth understanding of the molecular biology and pathogenesis of YFV, knowledge of which remains surprisingly limited given YFV's medical significance.
