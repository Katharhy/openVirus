<p id="p0030">Yellow fever is a mosquito-borne disease caused by yellow fever virus (YFV) infection and frequently associated with a severe form of hemorrhagic fever and liver injury with jaundice leading to a mortality rate of up to 60% (

However, the virus remains in a sylvatic cycle between mosquito vectors and nonhuman primates and can occasionally transmit to humans through mosquito bites. This results in tremendous difficulty to manage the disease, not only at individual and local levels, but also globally. Concern has been raised regarding the possibility of yellow fever taking hold in previously unaffected and unvaccinated parts of the world such as Asia, where host, vector, and climatic conditions could conspire to promote YFV dissemination.
