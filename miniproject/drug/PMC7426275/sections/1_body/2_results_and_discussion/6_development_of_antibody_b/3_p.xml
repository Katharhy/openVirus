<p id="p0150">In this study, we modified and/or developed antibody based quantitative YFV antiviral assays. Using two of the YFV antibodies, we modified an in-cell western assay to detect YFV replication, an assay we previously established using the pan-flavivirus envelope antibody 4G2 to detect DENV, ZIKV, and YFV (

 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A, the YFV-specific antiviral compound, 2-((S)-3-((S)-sec-butyl)-7-chloro-2-265 oxo-5-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[e][1,4]diazepin-1-yl)acetic acid (designated as BDAA) (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2016</xref>) dose-dependently inhibited YFV infection as judged by a significantly reduced fluorescence intensity revealed by the YFV NS3 and NS4B antibodies with similar result. The same assay was also performed with the 4G2 panflavivirus antibody in parallel, which demonstrated a comparable dose-dependent response with BDAA treatment. Furthermore, a High-Content Imaging (HCI) assay was also established with YFV NS4B antibody-based immunofluorescence staining in combination with image analysis and processing using a CellInsight CX7 High-Content Screening Platform (ThermoFisher). The assay allows for the detection of host cells with DAPI staining as well as with YFV NS4B signal, and automatically analyzes nine fields per sample in 96-well format or six fields per sample in 384-well format. Thus, we can determine the total number of cells and the number of NS4B-positive cells from two images of the same field. 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B shows representative images and the dose-dependent reduction of NS4B-positive signals following the treatment with antiviral compound BDAA. 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>C shows a quantitative analysis of the images (average of six fields per well in the 384-well plate) using percentage cells with NS4B signal or total immunofluorescence intensity. The two types of analyses reveal a similar dose-dependent response with BDAA treatment.
