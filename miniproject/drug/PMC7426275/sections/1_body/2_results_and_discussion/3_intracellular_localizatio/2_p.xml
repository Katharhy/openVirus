<p id="p0125">Next, we examined the ability of these YFV antibodies to detect the corresponding viral proteins in YFV-infected cells using an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Six of the ten antibodies, including the antibodies against envelope, prM, NS1 (GTX134025), NS2B, NS3 (GTX133959), and NS4B, specifically detected individual YFV proteins after the cells were fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 (

Two additional antibodies against NS1 (GTX134026) and NS3 (GTX133958)) failed to detect YFV proteins in YFV-infected cells under the immunofluorescence assay conditions described above. Both of the antibodies were generated using immunogens encompassing sequences in the C-termini of NS1 or NS3, indicating neither of them was exposed under the experimental conditions.
