<p id="p0130">The flavivirus genome replication takes place in the vesicles formed by ER membrane rearrangement induced by the membrane-associated viral nonstructural proteins such as NS4A and NS4B. This process was investigated primarily in DENV-infected cells (

 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Zmurko et al., 2015</xref>). We used Huh-7 cells infected with YFV at a MOI of 1 for 24 h so that only a fraction of the cultured cells was infected. An immunofluorescence assay was performed to detect the subcellular localization of the various YFV proteins using confocal microscopy. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> , similar to what was reported for DENV-infected cells, antibodies against the YFV NS proteins (NS1, NS2B, NS3, NS4B) revealed dot-like cytoplasmic structures located in the perinuclear area of infected cells (

 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), the putative viral RNA replication intermediates that localize in the replication-hosting vesicles derived from the ER membrane (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Welsch et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Yi et al., 2011</xref>). Previous electron tomography studies of DENV-infected cells revealed that newly synthesized viral RNAs bud through vesicle pores and release of virion particles into the ER lumen occurs in the vicinity of the vesicles (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Welsch et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, if a similar replication mechanism holds true for YFV, it is not surprising that some of the dsRNAs also co-localize with structural proteins. An exception is NS5, which, in agreement with previous reports in DENV-infected cells (
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2006</xref>), localized predominantly in the nuclei of YFV-infected cells. Consistent with its RNA polymerase function, electron tomography has identified DENV NS5 protein also localized in the cytoplasmic vesicles, the presumed sites of flavivirus RNA replication. However, the cytoplasmic DENV NS5 protein is barely detectable by immunofluorescence staining due to its relatively low levels and poor accessibility (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, cytoplasmic YFV NS5 protein was also undetectable by the polyclonal YFV NS5 antibody (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).
