<p id="p0115">A panel of antibodies against all three YFV structural proteins and five of the seven non-structural proteins, including NS1, NS2B, NS3, NS4B and NS5, raised by immunization of rabbits with synthetic peptides or recombinant viral proteins, had become commercially available from GeneTex, Inc.. The reactivity of these antibodies was initially confirmed by Western blot assays using either recombinant protein or whole cell lysates of 293T cells transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing individual YFV protein, corresponding to the originally used immunogens (

In this study, these ten YFV antibodies were further validated by Western blot assays using cell lysates from YFV 17D-infected Vero cells. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A, for the eight antibodies against YFV capsid, NS1, NS2B, NS3, NS4B or NS5, each detected a single predominant protein species with the expected molecular weight of the corresponding structural or non-structural YFV proteins, only in the YFV-infected cell lysate. Each of the two NS1 antibodies, generated by using recombinant proteins encompassing a sequence within either the center or C-terminal region of YFV NS1 protein, detected a protein species with the same electrophoretic mobility. Similarly, the two NS3 antibodies, generated by using synthetic peptides encompassing a sequence within either the C-terminus or center region of YFV NS3 protein, also showed comparable sensitivity and specificity in detecting NS3 protein with approximately 69kD. On the contrary, the YFV envelope antibody revealed not only a specific band of approximately 50kD in YFV-infected cell lysates, but also a cross-reacting band that overlaps the β-actin signal in both YFV-infected and uninfected cell lysates, raising concerns for its specificity in recognizing YFV envelope protein in certain assays. The other situation of detecting multiple bands in Western blot assay was observed when prM antibody was used, which only occurred in YFV-infected cells. It is known that immature flaviviral virions bud into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mature in the trans-Golgi network with acidic pH during transportation toward the cell surface (

Because the immunogen for the prM antibody is a synthetic peptide encompassing a sequence in the mature M protein, the antibody thus, as anticipated, recognized both prM and M proteins in the lysates of YFV-infected cells. While the upper band has a size corresponding to prM, the lower weaker band is consistent with M (
