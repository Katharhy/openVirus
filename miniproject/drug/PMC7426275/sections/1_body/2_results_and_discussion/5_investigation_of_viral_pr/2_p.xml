<p id="p0140">Like many positive-stranded RNA viruses, flaviviruses replicate their genomes in the ER-membrane-derived vesicles and assemble progeny virions at ER or ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) membranes. It is, therefore, conceivable that investigating the distribution and interaction of viral proteins and host cellular components at the distinct intracellular membrane compartments is essential to understanding the mechanism of flaviviral genome replication and its inhibition by antiviral agents. To analyze the association of viral and cellular proteins with intracellular membranes, we utilized a membrane flotation assay to separate membrane associated proteins and investigate their interactions with cellular lipids and proteins by a membrane flotation assay through sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. As described in Section 
 <xref rid="sec2.6" ref-type="sec">2.6</xref> in detail, YFV-infected cells were lysed mechanically in a hypotonic buffer without detergent to preserve cell membranes. The cell lysate was loaded at the bottom of the gradient, overlaid with the lower densities of sucrose solutions. The cellular membranes floated up during the ultracentrifugation to the gradients equivalent to their own density. At the completion of centrifugation, ten equal volume fractions were collected from the top of gradient. The membrane identity and associated proteins in each fraction were analyzed by Western blot assay with antibodies against organelle markers or viral and cellular proteins of interest. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A, as anticipated, viral NS2B, NS4B and envelope proteins were enriched with the ER membrane marker calnexin in fraction 2. Furthermore, treatment of the ER membranes (fraction 2 from the experiment presented in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A) with a strong detergent DDM completely disrupted the ER membrane and YFV NS2B, NS4B and envelope proteins were solubilized and distributed into fractions with soluble proteins (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B), However, treatment of the ER membranes with the mild detergent digitonin only partially disrupted the membrane and a portion of the viral proteins were still associated with the detergent-resistant membrane structure, presumably lipid rafts, while the vast majority of viral proteins were solubilized under this condition (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C). This is consistent with our previous finding that YFV non-structural proteins, presumed to be associated with the replication complex, were associated with detergent resistant membranes (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Yi et al., 2012</xref>). The lipid rafts-associated viral proteins have been shown to play distinct role in viral genome replication and virion particle morphogenesis at the ER. As has been demonstrated in HCV infected cells, further analysis of YFV viral and host protein-protein interaction in each of these fractions in presence of different detergents, will allow for determination of direct protein interaction or interactions relying on detergent resistant membrane (
