<p id="p0165">In conclusion, the studies reported herein demonstrated that the availability of antibodies against eight YFV structural and non-structural proteins greatly facilitate detailed molecular analyses of YFV replication at the sub-cellular levels and provide valuable tools for the identification of key interactions between YFV proteins and host cell factors. The antibody-based assays are also proved invaluable in the screening for, and elucidation of the mode of action of, novel antiviral compounds against YFV.</p>
