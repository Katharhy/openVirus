<p id="p0100">Huh-7 cells were cultured in 24-well plates overnight and infected with YFV at a MOI of 1. At 48 h post-infection, total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). YFV RNA was detected in a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay using a LightCycler 480II apparatus (Roche). β-actin mRNA served as internal control. Primer sequences are as described previously (
