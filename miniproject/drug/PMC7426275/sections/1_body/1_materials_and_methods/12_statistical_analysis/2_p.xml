<p id="p0110">Z′ factor (Z′) was calculated using the following equation: Z’ = 1-((3δ
 <sub>p</sub>+3δ
 <sub>n</sub>)/|μ
 <sub>p</sub>-μ
 <sub>n</sub>|), where μ
 <sub>p</sub> and μ
 <sub>n</sub> are mean values of positive control and negative control, respectively; δ
 <sub>p</sub> and δ
 <sub>n</sub> are the standard deviations of positive and negative control, respectively (

 <sub>n</sub>, where t is value of each test well. Other high-throughput screening parameters were determined as described (
