<p id="p0055">Vero cells were purchased from ATCC. Huh-7 and Huh-7.5 cells (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Blight et al., 2002</xref>) were cultured in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1X non-essential amino acid (NEAA). The 293TLR3/IFNβLuc cell line was established based on HEK293 (ATCC) with reconstituted TLR3 as well as an interferon β promotor driven luciferase, as previously described (

 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Yi et al., 2011</xref>), designated pACNR-2015FLYF-Asibi, the sequence of which has been deposited to GenBank (MT093734). The modifications were based on a comparison of the plasmid sequence to that of Asibi sequences available in GenBank and included three nucleotide changes (nucleotide 6013 was changed from C to T, 6829 from T to C, and 8008 from C to T) to more accurately reflect the Asibi sequence.
