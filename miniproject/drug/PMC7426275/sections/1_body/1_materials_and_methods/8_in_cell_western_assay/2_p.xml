<p id="p0090">Huh-7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates overnight and infected with YFV at a MOI of 1. At 48 h post-infection, cells were fixed as previously described (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2012</xref>) and probed with YFV NS4B (GTX134030), NS3 (GTX133959) antibodies or anti-Flavivirus Group Antigen antibody 4G2 at 1:1000 dilution. IRDye® 800CW Goat anti-Mouse IgG (LI-COR) or IRDye® 800CW Goat anti-Rabbit IgG were used as secondary antibodies at 1:2000 dilution. Cell viability was determined with DRAQ5 from Biostatus and Sapphire700 from LI-COR. Images and data analysis were obtained using LI-COR Odyssey.
