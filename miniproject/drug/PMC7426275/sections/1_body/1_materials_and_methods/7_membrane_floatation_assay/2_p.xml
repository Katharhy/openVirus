 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. After resuspension in 250 μl hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.8], 10 mM NaCl) and swelling (15 min on ice), the cells were disrupted by passing through a 27-gauge needle for 25 times. After centrifugation at 900×
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was mixed with 1.82 ml 72% (wt/wt) sucrose in low-salt buffer (LSB; 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>) and overlaid with 2.27 ml of 55% (wt/wt) sucrose in LSB, followed by 0.68 ml of 10% (wt/wt) sucrose in LSB. The sucrose gradient was centrifuged at 46,000 rpm in a Beckman Coulter SW55 ultracentrifuge rotor for 16 h at 4 °C. Ten equal volume (500 μl) fractions were taken sequentially from the top of the gradient. In some experiment, after the primary membrane floatation, the ER-membrane-enriched fraction was collected and divided into equal volume and treated with 1% n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM; Invitrogen) or 1% digitonin (Promega) for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. The samples were then mixed with 72% sucrose in LSB and overlaid sequentially with 55% and 10% sucrose to form the gradient and centrifuge as described above. Proteins were precipitated from each fraction by adding 4 vol of methanol followed by centrifugation at 12,000×
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. Detection of viral and host proteins in each fraction in a Western blot assay was described in section
