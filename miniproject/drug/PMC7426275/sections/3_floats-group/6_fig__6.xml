   <bold>Establishment of two YFV NS4B antibody-based antiviral assays</bold>. Huh-7 cells were seeded on 96- well (A) or 384-well plates (B) and infected with YFV 17D at a MOI of 1, with either mock or indicated treatment, for 48 h. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> In-cell western assay. YFV proteins were detected with indicated antibody against NS3, NS4B or pan-flavivirus monoclonal antibody 4G2 as primary antibody, with IRDye® 800CW goat anti-Rabbit or anti-Mouse as secondary antibodies. Cells were stained with DRAQ5 and Sapphire700. YFV protein expression (green) and cell viability (red) were visualized in LI-COR Odyssey. 
   <bold>(B and C)</bold> High-content imaging assay. Representative images of NS4B and DAPI staining are shown as a function of doses of BDAA treatment (B). Quantitation of percentage of cells with positive NS4B signal and total fluorescence intensity were calculated based on multiple images taken from each well (n = 6) and expressed as average ± standard deviation. * indicates
