   <bold>Detection of nascent YFV RNA using click chemistry imaging and its co-localization with YFV NS protein</bold>. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Schematic illustration of experimental schedule. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Huh-7 cells were mock infected or infected with YFV at 1 MOI. 24 h post infection, cells were either mock treated (Act D-) or treated with Actinomycin D (Act D+) for 2 h followed by EU labelling for 1 h. EU labeled nascent RNA was imaged after click reaction with florescent labeled azide. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Following the click reaction, the localization of YFV NS4B was detected in YFV infected cells as described in 
   <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. Cell nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst33342. Images were captured by confocal microscopy using a 60 × objective. Scale bar: 100 μM. White arrows indicate uninfected cells.
