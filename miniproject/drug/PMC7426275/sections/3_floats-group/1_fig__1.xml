   <bold>Detection of YFV structural and non-structural proteins by Western blot assay</bold>. Vero cells were mock-infected or infected with YFV 17D at a MOI of 1 for 48 h (
   <bold>A</bold>). Huh-7.5 cells were mock-infected or infected with YFV Asibi at a MOI of 2.5 for 40 h (
   <bold>B</bold>). Proteins in the cell lysates were resolved on 4–12% NuPAGE Novex gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Shown in green are the bands detected after incubation with the indicated rabbit polyclonal primary antibodies against YFV proteins and the IRDye 800CW Goat anti-Rabbit IgG secondary antibody. β-actin, shown in red, is an internal control, and was detected by a mouse monoclonal primary antibody and the IRDye 680RD Goat anti-Mouse IgG secondary antibody. A pre-stained protein molecular weight marker, shown on the left, is used to estimate the size of proteins resolved by gel electrophoresis. The band expected for each of the YFV proteins is indicated on the right.
