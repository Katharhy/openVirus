   <bold>Detection of the subcellular localization of YFV proteins and dsRNAs in YFV-infected cells by immunofluorescence assay</bold>. Huh-7 cells were seeded on round coverslips in 24-well plates and infected with YFV 17D at a MOI of 1 for 24 h. The cells were fixed with either 3.5% paraformaldehyde or 95% ethanol and 5% glacial acetic acid as indicated in 
   <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> legend. YFV proteins were detected by rabbit polyclonal antibodies (NS1 was detected with GTX134025, and NS3 was detected GTX133959) and Alexa Fluor Goat anti-Rabbit 594 IgG (H + L) secondary antibody. dsRNA was detected by mouse monoclonal primary antibody J2 and Alexa Fluor Goat anti-Mouse 488 IgG (H + L). Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Images were captured by confocal microscopy using a 60 × objective. Scale bar: 100 μM. White arrows indicate uninfected cells.
