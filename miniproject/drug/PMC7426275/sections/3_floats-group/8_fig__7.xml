   <bold>Development of high-content imaging-based high-throughput screening assay for YFV</bold>. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Huh-7 cells were seeded on 96-well plates and infected with YFV 17D at a MOI of 10 for 48 h. Half of the plate was mock-treated as negative controls, and the other half of the plate was treated with BDAA at 10 μM concentration as positive controls. The average of the percentage of cells with positive NS4B signals from nine fields per well were quantified and used for the calculation of the z-score for each well. Each dot in the plot represents the z-score of a single well in the 96-well plate. Z′ value, S/B, S/N and %CV were determined based on the signals from positive and negative control wells. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Synergistic effect between BDAA and Sofosbuvir identified using high-content imaging-based HTS assay. Huh-7 cells were seeded on 5 96-well plates and infected with YFV at a MOI of 10 for 1 h. The cells were then treated with the indicated concentrations of each compound or their combinations in a two-dimensional 6 × 8 checkerboard matrix fashion for additional 48 h followed by detection of YFV NS4B and quantification of fluorescent signals (n = 5). The EC
   <sub>50</sub> values were obtained by plotting mono treatment dose response curves. Synergistic plot was generated using MacSynergy II. The peak above the surface represents synergistic effect with 95% confidence interval.
