People on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors seemed to be at higher risk for clinically severe forms of infection. In fact, based on experimental

Such information spread fast thus causing serious alarm and anxiety among users worldwide, who urgently asked their own GPs to change antihypertensive prescriptions straight away. This was stopped, however, by a prompt reaction from most relevant international scientific societies interested to cardiovascular (CV) diseases, which reassured specialists on the absence of any EBM reasons to adopt such measures only on the basis of an experimentally driven hypothesis and alerted them on the CV risk increase caused by inappropriately discontinuing drugs endowed with well-defined and scientifically proven health benefits
