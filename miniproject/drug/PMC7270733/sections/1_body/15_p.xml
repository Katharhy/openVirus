<p id="p0080">AH, ischemic heart disease, heart failure (HF), and end-stage chronic kidney disease were also associated to a higher MERS-CoV-related mortality, which was even further increased by the presence of two or three coexisting above mentioned diseases 
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. This latter consideration deserves special attention. A higher all-cause hospitalization risk observed in people with DM than in those of comparable age and gender due to the higher prevalence of HF (8%) and respiratory failure (6%) has been reported in clinical records during MERS-CoV 
 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and probably it is also the case for COVID-19. Available evidence concerning SARS-COV-2 infection features in subjects with DM comes only from data related to infected hospitalized patients, those transferred to the ICUs and death rates. 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> summarizes results from main retrospective studies on Wuhan and Hubei / Zhejiang provinces. As already outlined earlier, from available references except for Kui’s report 
 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> the infection seems to mostly affect men. Based on available data, however, there is no possibility to assess whether or not this applies to the DM subpopulation. The percentage range of infected people having DM is 2% to 20% but all studies fail to specify disease type (1 or 2), level of glucose control, home treatment regimen and associated chronic complications. Two of them provide data on ICU admission rate for people with DM: 7.7% (1 out of 13,

 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and 22.2% (8 out of 36, 
 <italic>p =</italic> 0.009) in Wang’s report 
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The study from Xu 
 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> found 39.4% comorbidity (3.0% being represented by DM) in 33 patients being symptomatic for over 10 days since disease onset. The one from Yang 
 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, conducted on critically ill patients reported that 21.9% non-surviving patients (7 out of 32) vs 10.0% surviving ones (2 out of 20) had DM. Finally, the Chinese Centre for Disease Control, by analyzing 44,672 confirmed infection cases, reported mortality rate to be 2.3% on the whole, 7.3% in people with DM, 10.5% in those with CV disease and 49% in critically ill patients
