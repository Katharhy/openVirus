<p id="p0105">In fact, when insulin is used at fixed doses or according to the so called “sliding scale”,
 <xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">1</xref> blood glucose is bound to undergo several oscillations around the desirable mean by often getting into the hypoglycemic range and into the hyperglycemic soon after 
 <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, which is technically referred as “glycemic variability” 
 <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Now, hypoglycemia has been shown to potentiate host’s innate immune reaction to endotoxins by mobilizing pro-inflammatory monocytes with negative consequences on cardiovascular mortality 
 <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Hyperglycemia has been known for decades to make people susceptible to infections 
 <italic>per se</italic> by increasing the concentration of several toxic intracellular by-products of the glycolytic pathway 
 <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Moreover, during severe illness glucose overloads and damages cells through the up-regulated expression of glucose transporters on their membranes 
 <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. This means that, despite trying to do their best for infected people, Covid-19-units may even unintentionally end up to make the disease more serious because of glycemic variability. During severe influenza virus infection, pulmonary lesions and mortality are driven by massive cytokine 
 <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, and adhesion molecule release 
 <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> by pulmonary endothelial cells which allows the uncontrolled extravasation of leukocytes in the alveolus thus severely damaging respiratory function 
 <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Glucose variability during the hospitalization may increase these phenomena 
 <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, so worsening the prognosis. The above-mentioned considerations already suggested the urgent need for all of us to understand how diabetes increases influenza severity in order to mitigate the burden of future influenza epidemics 
 <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, and even more of present coronavirus pandemic. It deserves attention the fact that large glycemic variability is predictive 
 <italic>per se</italic> of high ICU mortality 
 <xref rid="b0250" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. So, it has already been suggested that the management of glucose variability has to be part of the more comprehensive approach to the management of hyperglycemia today: it seems that this has to be urgently applied in intensive care units 
 <xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Even though we understand that in such a critic situation this request should be very hard to implement, we also believe that the best possible action to prevent a worse outcome is also essential in any medical act.
