<p id="Par63">Immunization is broadly divided into two types: active and passive. In active immunization, an immune response is induced that is gradual and is dependent on the individual for its potency. In passive immunization, immunity is achieved by providing the recipient with antibodies against a specific disease and is regarded as a safe means of providing immediate immunity against any disease in healthy humans. Unsurprisingly, its history dates back to the 19th century, when it was often the only method used to treat an infectious disease, before the advent of antibiotics in the 20th century [

Similarly, passive antibody therapy would work against SARS-CoV-2 primarily by neutralizing the virus, but it might also contribute to phagocytosis and cytotoxic mechanisms. Not only may therapeutic antibodies be derived from recuperated patients, but monoclonal antibodies or genetically engineered antibodies can also be used [

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), with the numbers of donors increasing as the numbers of survivors increases gradually. Passive immunization in humans is generally associated more frequently with preventative healthcare than with the treatment of a specific disease, when it is used following the manifestation of initial signs and symptoms. It is likely to be most effective in the initial stages of infection when the viral load is lower, allowing neutralization by antibodies to occur efficiently [

A different aspect of passive immunization is the ability of the antibodies to alter inflammatory responses, which again can be controlled more easily in the early stages of infection. Previously, passive antibody therapy against pneumococcal pneumonia was observed to be most efficacious when it was delivered immediately after the development of initial symptoms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>]. Antibodies obtained through passive therapy tend to reach the affected tissues through blood, where they can shield them against subsequent pathogenesis. The period in which this immunity remains viable can vary from weeks to many months, and even years, and is highly dependent on the concentration and composition of the antibodies used.
