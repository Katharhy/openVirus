<p id="Par42">The treatment of mildly infected patients mainly depends upon self-care, and recuperation can occur with routinely used antiviral medicines without any advanced treatment. However, in critically ill patients, the virus wreaks havoc on the immune system of the patients, which demands effective intensive care and a thorough treatment plan [

The patients are put under intensive care, and the treatment plan entails electrolyte balancing, administration of water for hydration, and stabilization of the functioning internal systems. All clinical parameters and vital signs should be closely monitored [

Gas ventilators and nasal oxygen may be helpful for patients suffering from severe respiratory distress. To date, no approved antiviral medicine has been reported. Antibiotics are not generally used for the treatment of the disease. However, patients should be examined for bacterial infections and given antibacterial drugs in cases where there is a risk of bacterial infection [

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) should be used in combination with conventional medicines after determining the infection symptoms through the conventional method of diagnosis. XueBiJing, Huo Xiang Zheng Qi Shui, Lian Hua Qing Wen Capsule, Shu Feng Jie Du Capsule and Jin Hua Qing Gan Granule have been tested for COVID-19 treatment [Song et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020], and these herbal remedies considerably relieved main symptoms, including cough and fever, and were beneficial for the recovery of the patient.
