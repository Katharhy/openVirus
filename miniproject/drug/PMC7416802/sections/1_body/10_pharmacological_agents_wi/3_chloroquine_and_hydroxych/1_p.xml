<p id="Par52">Chloroquine is an anti-parasitic drug that is used against malaria due to its inflammation-reducing properties and its ability to modulate the immune system. Currently, it has garnered attention because of its potential use in treating COVID-19. The potential antiviral activity of chloroquine against COVID-19 was first reported by Wang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] during the early outbreak of the novel CoV. The results obtained corroborated previously published results showing antiviral activity of the drug against similar coronaviruses that caused SARS and MERS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. The findings of Chinese clinical trials have supported the oral use of the drug at a moderate dosage twice every day, although the rationale for using this dosage remains vague. The use of chloroquine has been associated with stability in patients, with better lung functioning found in scans, leading to a better prognosis and shortened duration of infection, with little or no adverse reactions to the drug, as reported by Gao et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The promising results, however, are not sufficient for its widespread use, as supply-related problems and cardiovascular toxicity have restricted their use in countries like the USA. As a substitute, another drug called hydroxychloroquine is being investigated. It differs from chloroquine by the presence of an additional hydroxyl group. It is assumed that this drug will be more effective than chloroquine for treating COVID-19, the prolonged use of which has been associated with a rise in rheumatic disorders. The current data regarding the activity of hydroxychloroquine against CoVs are still inadequate. However, in 2006, a comparison of the antiviral potential of these two drugs in cell lines was examined by Biot et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>], who demonstrated that chloroquine had superior antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-1 compared to hydroxychloroquine. When these drugs were again studied for their activity against SARS-CoV-2 using a pharmacology-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to examine their activity in respiratory organs, the findings were the opposite of the previous ones, with hydroxychloroquine being more effective than chloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 when the “ratio of the free lung trough concentration to the in vitro EC
 <sub>50</sub>” (RLTEC) values were compared [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. The reported efficacious dosage of chloroquine was more than 400 mg, and therefore, the dosage of hydroxychloroquine was set accordingly in another study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], which found two dosages that gave a significant effect, first being an oral dose of more than 1000 mg on the first day, followed by less than 500 mg on each of the following days. This dosage resulted in higher RLTEC values for hydroxychloroquine than chloroquine. The second dosage gave similar results, suggesting that a lower dosage of hydroxychloroquine was also effective [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. However, it is important to note that these drugs have equal half-lives, which would lead to protracted regimens of therapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. It is advised to wait for complete validation and more published data before the administration of the recommended dosage in patients infected with COVID-19. An example can be described to explain the point: If two equally capable compounds were taken and analyzed from the PBPK data for a dosage of hydroxychloroquine less than 1000 mg and varying regimens, RLTEC values would be produced that would be different on consecutive days, which would vary drastically from the dosage of chloroquine taken two times every day with RLTEC values. The majority of clinical trials have used the 400 mg dosage, but the evidence for this remains unclear [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Gautret et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>] reported the effect of oral administration of 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine after the passage of eight hours in patients infected with COVID-19. The study revealed the drug to be more effective in treating COVID-19 from the nasopharyngeal region. Notably, the use of the antibacterial drug azithromycin, which was given in patients to prevent bacterial infection in COVID-19 cases, resulted in a stronger reduction in the viral load than the use of hydroxychloroquine alone. This finding, although significant, is not sufficient, as various aspects still need be taken into consideration. Clinical data were not adequate, although the reduction in viral load was noteworthy. The study included 26 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine therapy, six of which were excluded from the study for various reasons. Lastly, the patients in the study had a much higher viral titer, as demonstrated by CT values, than other patients who had undergone combined therapy. Although these points indicate that caution is needed in the administration of both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, initial studies conducted in China have been hopeful in elucidating the encouraging that both of these drugs might be helpful against COVID-19. It is advised, however, to keep track of the latest study findings by examining works published in peer-reviewed journals until the lack of agreement between studies has been addressed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. In the meantime, the administration of hydroxychloroquine needs to be approached with caution.
