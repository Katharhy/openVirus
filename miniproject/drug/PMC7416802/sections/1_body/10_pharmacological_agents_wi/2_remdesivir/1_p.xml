<p id="Par51">Remdesivir (GS-5734) is an adenosine analog drug that was produced for the treatment of the Ebola virus in Africa by Gilead Science and is currently under study. Its mode of action is to bind to the viral RNA polymerase in its active state, where its primary effect is to cause RNA chain termination. It is also reported to exhibit potent antiviral activity against several CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, with suitable EC
 <sub>50</sub> values. Because it is specific for viral enzymes, it is less likely than some other drugs to be toxic to humans [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. A wide variety of therapeutic index values were obtained for this drug in a human respiratory cell model, according to Sheahan et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. It is effective against CoVs despite the potential for genetic resistance, and it has a long half-life [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. For its use against SARS-CoV-2, the tested dosage for treatment was more than 150 mg, with intravenous administration on the first day, followed by reduction of the dosage by half for ten days. The antiviral potential of remdesivir was first demonstrated against Ebola virus in monkeys, in which it successfully inhibited the replication of the virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. The antiviral effect of remdesivir has also been investigated in mice, which demonstrated a decrease in the viral load in the lungs, in body weight loss, and in overall lung destruction, which suggested that the drug can inhibit viral replication in the initial stages of infection. However, it was not effective when the viral load was high [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. The results of that study agreed with those of another study showing the drug to be effective in reducing virus replication and the eventual onset of disease caused by SARS-CoV-1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. It is important to note that while the results of the studies conducted on animal models were encouraging, human clinical trials cast a disappointing shadow on the drug. A human clinical trial demonstrated the fatality rate of patients infected with Ebola virus to be more than 50% in patients treated with remdesivir and three additional therapies during the Ebola outbreak in 2018, which led to the discontinuation of the drug for the treatment of this disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. The first case of treatment of a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 with remdesivir was reported in the US, where the drug was administered to the patient a week after typical symptoms of COVID-19 were observed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. The drug appeared to ameliorate the patient’s condition, although nasopharyngeal swabs continued to be positive for the virus. On the upside, no side effects of the drug were observed in this patient, which corroborated the safety data from cases of treatment of other viral infections with this drug [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the treatment of three out of twelve COVID-19 patients with remdesivir in the US was carried out under the protocol for compassionate use [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>] due to the lack of sufficient data to evaluate its safety or efficacy. At present, there are four ongoing clinical trials in the US that are enlisting patients for potential treatments. Two clinical trials have been commenced in China for the evaluation of remdesivir against COVID-19. The criteria for compassionate use of the drug allow patients in intensive care requiring ventilation support who are too ill to be included in a clinical trial to receive the drug. If they fail to meet these criteria, suffer from organ failure, have renal and hepatic disease, or receive dialysis, they are exempted from compassionate use. These criteria are subject to change, so patients are asked to review the most recent guidelines prior to being enrolled in a clinical trial program. In addition to the time required for approval from the responsible authorities, clinicians also need to be prepared to issue appropriate prescriptions for administering the drug to patients once it is approved. Critically ill patients can be given other antiviral therapies during the waiting time, but these must be suspended immediately once they begin receiving remdesivir. It has been suggested that remdesivir attains its active state by acting as a substrate for CYP-3A4, indicating a possible interaction with related inhibitors such as ritonavir and voriconazole. It has also been suggested that the activity of remdesivir might be enhanced by hydrolase activity, which is also consistent with the chemical structure of the drug. The NIAID was quick to state that it is unlikely that remdesivir would interact with other CYP-3A4 inhibitors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Clinical data have now established remdesivir to be a promising drug for the treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and this can be tested further in extensive clinical trials as well as the practical application of the drug in compassionate use, which can provide information about its probable efficacy on a wide scale in the fight against COVID-19.
