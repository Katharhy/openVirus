<p id="Par54">Lopinavir is an HIV protease inhibitor that is administered in combined therapy with ritonavir, which is a potential CYP-3A4 inhibitor that enhances the effectiveness of the drug. The reported course of action of lopinavir is the inhibition of the protease enzyme of the virus, thereby blocking its replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Chu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>] reported the action of various antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-1 during its outbreak, and the administration of lopinavir and ribavirin was observed to block replication of the virus after just two days of therapy, indicating heightened efficacy when used in combination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. The potent activity of lopinavir against SARS-CoV-1 was also reported by de Wilde et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>] and was found to be related to the effective plasma concentrations that were examined previously in subjects who had contracted HIV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. The potency of lopinavir in combination with ritonavir was compared to that of interferon beta (INF-β) against MERS virus in a study by Sheahan et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>], who showed that the administration of these two drugs failed to boost the action of INF-β against the virus, where the EC
 <sub>50</sub> values showed the effect of the two drugs to be similar in the case of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1. This study finding was significant, as remdesivir was thought to be the more potent antiviral drug in the same clinical study. Nonetheless, the drug cannot be discounted as being completely ineffective, as an in vivo study found ameliorated clinical and pathogenic symptoms in animals infected with MERS-CoV after combined therapy with lopinavir and ritonavir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. At present, a controlled study of combined therapy with both drugs together with rINF-β for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients is being conducted in order to rule out any inconsistency between their efficacy in animals and in in vitro studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. This combination was used in 2003 for the treatment of SARS-CoV-1, as mentioned above, in a study by Chu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>], in which it was used with ribavirin and corticosteroid drugs. The subjects undergoing lopinavir/ritonavir therapy were compared with subjects receiving ribavirin along with corticosteroids, after which a considerable decrease in the “acute respiratory distress syndrome” (ARDS) and fatality rate was observed. This was further substantiated by another study on more than 70 lopinavir/ritonavir-treated patients who exhibited an overall lower fatality rate than patients who did not receive the two drugs as an initial treatment, which was significant, as advantageous effects of lopinavir/ritonavir were only observed in those patients who received these drugs as an initial treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. The considerable difference in the fatality rate after treatment against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV enabled the testing of lopinavir/ritonavir against SARS-CoV-2 in new clinical trials conducted by scientists in China. Generally, a 400 (and 100)-mg dosage is taken orally twice each day for a maximum of ten days by adults [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. So far, there are ten clinical trials underway to determine the efficacy of conventional Chinese medicinal therapy and lopinavir/ritonavir, as a singular therapy. Their effect in combination with other antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 is being tested, but the data from this new research are only now coming to light. The administration of lopinavir/ritonavir in positively diagnosed COVID-19 patients in a clinical study resulted in a decrease in auxiliary oxygen in one patient, while the condition of two others worsened. Four out of five patients exhibited severe adverse effects, impeding the execution of the therapy regimen. Other studies have described improvement in the clinical condition of infected patients and an overall reduction in the viral titer after lopinavir/ritonavir treatment. However, the efficacy of this drug therapy remains unclear because of discordant results among studies, variation in the degree of severity of disease in the subjects, and the absence of any standard of treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. Furthermore, the administration of lopinavir/ritonavir along with other antiviral drugs was reported during the early outbreak in Wuhan, but the data and study have not been adequately described with respect to treatment, dosage, and characteristics of the treatment group [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]. A recent clinical trial was conducted in which lopinavir/ritonavir combination therapy was compared to twice-a-day and standardized treatment of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The initial outcome evaluated was the time until improvement was observed after administration of the therapy. Later, treatment success was evaluated based on fatality rates, time until discharge from the hospital, viral load, and the amount of virus in pharyngeal swabs. The groups did not differ in their time from the initial symptoms to their randomization, and no significant difference was reported for symptom improvement or fatality rate between the two groups. Furthermore, no significant difference was found with respect to the decrease in the viral load. The current data on lopinavir/ritonavir provide little information suggesting their potential for their use in single or combination therapy. The findings that these drugs were effective against SARS-CoV-1 provides some hope, but it should be considered that their activity compared to remdesivir and chloroquine in the case of SARS-CoV-1 was below average, and their inadequate activity in animal models for the treatment of MERS-CoV infection is also not encouraging. It is also noteworthy that, in a randomized trial conducted recently, the time from the start of infection to the commencement of the drug regimen was 13 days in the case of SARS-CoV-2, whereas early treatment proved to be beneficial in the case of SARS-CoV-1. The therapy should include the provision of oral tablets or intravenous solution, which may or may not be given on an empty stomach and should not be administered to patients without screening them for any aggravating symptoms and observing them closely, as some cases do not fulfill the inclusion criteria for COVID-19 clinical trials [
