<p id="Par57">The role of corticosteroids in the management of COVID-19 is of great interest, as there is a need to study their role in secondary infections and other adverse side effects. They have been administered in cases of MERS-CoV- and SARS-CoV-1-related pneumonia as a supplementary therapy, but their exact role is difficult to interpret. Patients who received corticosteroids developed a high fever and required more intensive care. The timing of corticosteroid dosage is directly proportional to the duration of disease. The use of corticosteroids immediately enhances fever and leads to a risk of secondary infections by bacteria, and thus poor outcomes, and for this reason such patients need extra care during their intensive care period. The stage of the disease must be kept in mind when choosing a dosage that will result in a swift response while avoiding side effects. Previously, during the SARS-CoV-1 endemic, corticosteroids were given to the patients. The heterogeneity of observations reported, from no effect [

A dosage is recommended in the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guide from the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China, where the authors state, “Based on respiratory distress and chest imaging, may consider glucocorticoid that is equivalent to methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day for 3–5 days or less. Note that large-dose glucocorticoid suppresses the immune system and could delay clearance of SARS-CoV-2.” [
