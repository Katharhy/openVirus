<p id="Par56">Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that has an inhibitory effect on IL-6, which is released by human macrophages and monocytes during cytokine-release syndrome (CRS). Since its approval by the FDA in 2010, tocilizumab has been used as a therapeutic agent in patients with rheumatoid arthritis as a corticosteroid-sparing agent in chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T therapy) [

The administration of tocilizumab in arteritis or arthritis patients results in neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, which makes patients more prone to secondary bacterial infections due to release of IL-6. In a case study, adult patients with refractory acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia and with grade 3 or higher CRS were found to suffer from secondary bacterial infections. In those patients, it was hard to identify the triggering factor (tocilizumab or corticosteroid) for these bacterial infections [

Their IL-6 level was 132.38 ± 278.54 pg/mL (normal, &lt; 7 pg/mL). Although the patients were not accessed for a long period, no side effects were reported during this short period (3–7 days). Tocilizumab as a therapeutic for patients with COVID-19, especially those with increased IL-6 levels, has become a part of the 7th edition of the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. The National Health Commission has recommended a standard dose of 400 mg IV once, or 4–8 mg/kg. There is an option to repeat a dose in 12 h (not to exceed a total dose of 800 mg). Chinese scientists are working on two trials regarding its side effects, but no trials are currently being done in the United States. In the future, there will be more information about tocilizumab. Its administration, time of dose, IL-6 threshold, etc., are all under study. Moreover, the long-term assessment of the patients being treated with tocilizumab will help in establishing its potential role in combating COVID-19.
