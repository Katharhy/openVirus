<p id="Par43">The severity of COVID-19 led to its development of drugs or vaccines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although the WHO, FDA, and EMA were part of this community, the Chinese took the lead in developing academia-industry partnerships for the development of therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and drugs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Such an initiative for vaccine development was recently undertaken by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), involving several countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In this context, the establishment of a “vaccine bank” by the Canadian Government is commendable [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Scientists are also considering a drug formulation against post-infection complications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Scientists have also taken into consideration previously known antiviral drugs for the treatment of post-infection complications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The International Clinical Trials Registry Platform of WHO is dealing with this issue [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In a WHO project named “Solidarity Trial”, the four most potent existing antiviral drugs were tested against COVID-19 in ten different countries, and the results were reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The formulation of drugs and vaccines requires time, and regulatory agencies such as the FDA and EMA have to ensure their safety throughout the drug development cycle (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) before approval [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This process typically requires almost half a decade [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The shortest time frame for developing therapeutics is one and a half years, and that for checking their effectiveness is twelve months [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Currently, many new anti-COVID-19 drugs are in phase I of testing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Four antiviral drugs, including hydroxychloroquine (or chloroquine), favipiravir, lopinavir, and remdesivir, have entered phase III or IV. Currently, the CDC is recommending remdesivir as an anti-COVID-19 treatment for COVID-19 patients suffering from pneumonia [
