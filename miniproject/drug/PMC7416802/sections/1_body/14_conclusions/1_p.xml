<p id="Par72">COVID-19 management strategies are being worked on globally. Although there are many candidates for anti-COVID-19 therapy, the situation is changing daily. The anti-COVID-19 agent chosen, its dose, and the timing of its application are among the many questions that need to be addressed. The authors are of the opinion that high-risk populations should be given therapy as early as possible once it is declared effective and safe. The dose should be adjusted according to the health status of the patient and the progression of the disease. Research scientists and clinicians should keep an eye on new observations published in the literature. Care should be taken when reviewing the literature, as much of the information is not peer-reviewed, self-published, or even unpublished. Scientists and clinicians can play an important role in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as modification and optimization of treatment recommendations.</p>
