<p id="Par74">Although extensive research is being conducted to develop a suitable vaccine against COVID-19, there is a dire need to shift a major part of the ongoing research towards the treatment of pneumonia in patients, which is often fatal. The astounding data regarding mesenchymal stem cells offers a hopeful approach to the use of an endogenous pathway for the treatment of disease. In the case of pneumonia caused by COVID-19, the balance between the antiviral response and the regulation of LIF action against a cytokine storm may be lost, which can reduce the overall beneficial effect of therapy. Nevertheless, the study findings indicating the safe and effective use of mesenchymal stem cell therapy in treating COVID-19 are indeed remarkable and present a modern approach to the efficient and safe treatment of critically ill patients. For its widespread application, “stem cell” companies are working hand in hand [
