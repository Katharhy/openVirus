<p id="Par71">In the case of pneumonia caused by viruses, “leukemia inhibitory factor” (LIF), is a factor that is released by mesenchymal stem cells, protects against damage caused by cytokine production (Fig.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref>]. However, the cost of this therapy is high. This can be overcome using nanotechnology, using synthetic stem cells known as “LIFNano”, which have a thousand-fold higher efficacy than cell-based LIF [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">171</xref>]. Using a treatment model for “multiple sclerosis” (MS), LIFNano was effective in “experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis” (EAE) for treating paralysis within 96 h (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), which is consistent with the reported advantages of the use of mesenchymal stem cell therapy against COVID-19. Earlier studies have shed light on the use of neural stem cells in EAE, demonstrating that the beneficial effects of the treatment were due to the LIF produced by neural stem cells. Emergent substitute therapies like LIFNano illustrate the promise of using concentrated and safe therapeutic agents that can repair damaged tissues and inhibit the cytokine problem in the case of pneumonia. These treatments can be tested using low-volume trials in which the drug is administered either by inhalation or intravenously.
