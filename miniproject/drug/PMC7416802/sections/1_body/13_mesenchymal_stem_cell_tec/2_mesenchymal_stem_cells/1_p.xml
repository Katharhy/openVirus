<p id="Par70">Chinese researchers have observed that stem cell treatment can reverse the symptoms in critically ill patients [

For example, in one case, liver fibrosis was treated well with “human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells” (hUCMSCs), and the ventilator was removed within four days of the treatment. Not only was the patient feeling well but also the hematology report returned to normal after being in an elevated state. Another study [

MSC treatment decreased the level of inflammatory cytokines while increasing IL-10. The clinicians studied the behavior of MSC during the treatment of COVID-19 disease. The portal of entry of SARS-CoV-2 is via ACE2 receptors of human cells (alveolar and capillary endothelium), but. MSCs lack ACE2. Thus, the virus cannot bind to them. MSCs have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, producing TGFβ, HGF, LIF, VEGF, EGF, BDNF and NGF. Thus the use of MSCs has a promising future in the treatment of COVID-19.
