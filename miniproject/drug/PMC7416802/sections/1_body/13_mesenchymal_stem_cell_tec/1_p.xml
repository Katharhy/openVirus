Generally, it has been observed that antiviral drugs, even antibiotics, are being recommended, but another aspect is not taken seriously, i.e., the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Infection causes cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A and TNFα) to be released, which disturb the exchange of gases in the lungs, leading to acute respiratory distress, cardiac arrest, and secondary infections. According to a recent study, patients shed the virus for 37 days [

According to WHO, the fatality rate of COVID-19 is higher than that of influenza (0.1%), i.e., 0.3% to 1%. The data show that in a given country, 80% of infected individuals are asymptomatic, 14% are severely ill, and 6% are in critical condition.
