 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which is divided into four genera of viruses depending upon their genomic structure: 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Gammacoronavirus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic>. Members of the first two of these genera are responsible for disease in humans as well as other animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Before the advent of SARS-CoV-2, there were six CoVs known to cause infections in humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Î²-CoVs that cause mild to severe respiratory diseases in humans include the novel SARS-CoV-2, which is closely related to to SARS-CoV.
