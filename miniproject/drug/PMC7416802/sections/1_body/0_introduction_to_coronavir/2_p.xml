<p id="Par26">CoVs belong to a large family of viruses that are responsible for causing mild to severe respiratory diseases in humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. They contain external spike proteins in their envelope (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), which give them a distinguishable appearance and are the source of their name [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. They are spherical and can vary in diameter from about fifty to two hundred nanometres [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The spike glycoprotein (protein S) is the primary antigenic component of the virus particle. Protein N is the nucleocapsid protein, which associates with the genomic RNA, and this protein can also be employed as a marker in assays detecting viral antigens.
