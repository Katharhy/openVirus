  <p>LIFNano therapy swiftly reverses paralysis in the EAE model (adapted from reference [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">175</xref>]). Mice were immunized against myelin protein, which led to paralysis of the legs and tail region on the fourteenth day of therapy. Hooke’s model was used to follow a standardized approach for the experiment. After fifteen days, untreated mice demonstrated persistent paralysis, whereas treated mice demonstrated paralysis for fifteen days after they were treated for 96 h with LIFNano NPs, which resulted in rapid recovery from paralysis and restoration of mobility with reproducible results (study findings part of a project (I-UK BMC) entitled “Cell-free regenerative medicine: Nano-Engineered “LIFNano” to treat Multiple Sclerosis” Project number: 102847). Fast recovery of motor function is associated with the kinetics of myelin restoration. LIFNano-CD4 penetrates the blood–brain barrier. In this study, mice retained their immune competence
