<p id="p0055">Binary logistic regression models were used to evaluate the impact of the previous and in-hospital glycemic control on the outcomes of the patients with diabetes, and three models were constructed to adjust potential confounding factors. Model 1 explored the risk factors associated with worsening by a univariate analysis, which included HbA1c, maximum of the BG in-hospital, age, sex, smoking, comorbidities other than diabetes, white cell count, the percentage of neutrophils, lymphopenia, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, γ-glutamyl transferase, creatinine, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide precursor (NT-proBNP), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), prothrombin time, total cholesterol, triglyceride, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α. Model 2 included HbA1c and the maximum of the BG in-hospital for a multivariate logistic regression analysis. On the basis of model 2, the variables with a P value &lt; 0.05 in the univariate analysis were further added for a multivariate analysis in the model 3. Considering the limited number of the patients in the worsening group, three variables, which included lymphocyte, CRP and prothrombin time, were added in the model 3 to avoid over-fitting.</p>
