<p id="p0045">A trained team of physicians extracted the epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and prognosis data from electronic medical records. The demographic characteristics, comorbidities, clinical symptoms, symptoms from onset to admission, vital signs, laboratory findings, antidiabetic and antihypertensive drugs used prior to admission and during hospitalization, and outcomes were collected. Most of the clinical data used in our study were collected from the first day of admission unless otherwise stated. Comorbidities were determined based on the patientâ€™s self-report on admission. The glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and the maximum of the blood glucose (BG) in-hospital were used to reflect the previous and in-hospital glycemic control, respectively. All data were double-checked by different researchers to guarantee the accuracy. All patients were followed up to a clinical endpoint (discharge, worsening including transferring to intensive care unit (ICU) or immediate death). Patients who transferred to ICU or died immediately before transferring to ICU were classified as the worsening group.</p>
