<p id="p0065">A total of 64 confirmed COVID-19 patients with pre-existing DM were included in this study (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). 128 COVID-19 patients without diabetes were included as a control group, closely matched for age, sex and comorbidities. The median age of the patients with diabetes was 66.0 years (IQR, 59.0–71.0), and 35 (54.7%) were male. 39 (60.9%) patients with diabetes had at least one other comorbidities, with hypertension (37 [57.8%]) being the most common comorbidity. The median duration from the symptom onset to admission was 10.0 days (IQR, 7.0–15.0) for patients with diabetes and 14.0 days (IQR, 8.0–17.0) for patients without diabetes. The most common symptoms for both groups were fever and cough, followed by fatigue and diarrhea (
