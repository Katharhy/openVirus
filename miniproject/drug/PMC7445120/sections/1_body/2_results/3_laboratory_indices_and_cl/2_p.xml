<p id="p0070">Laboratory findings on admission and clinical outcomes of both groups are summarized in 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> . The rate of disease worsening during hospitalization was significantly higher in the patients with pre-existing DM compared to the patients without diabetes (18.8% versus 7.8%, p = 0.025). Compared to the group without diabetes, patients with diabetes presented higher BG level as expected (8.6 mmol/L [6.5–15.6] versus 5.7 mmol/L [5.2–7.1]), with higher levels of HbA1c (8.1% [65 mmol/mol] versus 6.3% [45 mmol/mol]). The white cell count and the percentage of neutrophils were significantly higher in patients with diabetes. Moreover, patients with diabetes demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of lymphopenia (53.1% versus 33.6%). As for the inflammatory markers, the CRP level was significantly higher in the group with diabetes (39.3 mg/L [2.9–72.3] versus 7.6 mg/L [1.6–31.6]) while the procalcitonin level showed no difference between the two groups. Besides, patients with diabetes showed a higher level of the NT-proBNP.
