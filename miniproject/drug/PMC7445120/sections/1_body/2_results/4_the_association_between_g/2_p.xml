<p id="p0075">Complete data collected from 64 patients with diabetes (12 in the worsening group, and 52 in the discharge group) were included in the logistic regression models (
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> ). In the univariable analysis (Model 1), HbA1c, maximum of the BG in-hospital, lymphopenia, the percentage of neutrophils, CRP and prothrombin time were associated with worsening. In the model 2 included HbA1c and the maximum of the BG in-hospital, only HbA1c was associated with increased odds of worsening. When adjusting for lymphopenia, CRP and prothrombin time, HbA1c was still associated with increased odds of worsening.
