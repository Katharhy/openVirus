<p id="p0080">Using disease worsening as the end point, ROC curve analysis was used to identify the optimal HbA1c cutoff value, which was 8.6% (70 mmol/mol) (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). With this value, the area under the ROC curve was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.83–0.98, p &lt; 0.001), and the sensitivity and specificity for predicting disease worsening in the patients with diabetes were 100.0% and 82.7%, respectively. For each laboratory index, patients were divided into 2 groups for further analysis (
 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> ). Compared to the HbA1c well-controlled patients, the poorly-controlled patients presented higher white cell count and the percentage of neutrophils. Also, the incidence of lymphopenia was higher in the poorly-controlled patients. Levels of the maximum of the BG in-hospital, hemoglobin, triglyceride, urea nitrogen, prothrombin time and cTnI were clearly elevated in the poorly-controlled patients compared with the well-controlled patients.
