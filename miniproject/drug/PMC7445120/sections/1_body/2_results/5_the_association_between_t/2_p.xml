<p id="p0085">Of the 64 patients with diabetes, 52 (81.3%) patients received antidiabetic treatment during hospitalization, including metformin (18/52 [34.6%]), insulin (22/52 [42.3%]), α-glucosidase inhibitors (26/52 [50.0%]), pioglitazone (6/52 [11.5%]), sulfonylureas (6/52 [11.5%]), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (6/52 [11.5%]). 36 (56.3%) patients received antihypertensive treatment during hospitalization, including ACEIs/ARBs (14/36 [38.9%]), calcium channel blockers (CCBs) (27/36 [75.0%]), β-receptor blockers(9/36 [25.0%]), spironolactone (4/36 [11.1%]). Moreover, 10 (10/64 [15.6%]) patients received statins therapy. The association between the use of antidiabetic/antihypertensive drugs and disease worsening was shown in Supplementary 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Drugs with fewer users were not analyzed. Results demonstrated that α-glucosidase inhibitors and CCBs use were significantly associated with decreased odds of disease worsening. After adjusting for glucose, HbA1c at admission and maximum of the glucose in-hospital, there were no significant associations between the use of metformin, insulin, ACEIs/ARBs, statins and disease worsening.
