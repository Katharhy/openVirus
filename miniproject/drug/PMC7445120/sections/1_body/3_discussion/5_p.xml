<p id="p0105">The association between the in-hospital use of common antidiabetic/antihypertensive drugs and the prognosis of the COVID-19 patients with diabetes was also explored in this study for the first time. The results demonstrated that α-glucosidase inhibitors and CCBs use were associated with a lower risk of disease worsening, and no significant associations were observed between the use of metformin, insulin, ACEIs/ARBs, statins and disease worsening after adjusting for glucose, HbA1c at admission and maximum of the glucose in-hospital. Previous studies demonstrated that ACE-2 Ser680 residue could be phosphorylated to improve the stability and increase the expression of ACE-2 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells by the 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase, which was the molecular effector of the majority of metformin’s pharmacological actions

 <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Thus, there are concerns about the safety of using ACEIs/ARBs in patients with diabetes. Our results demonstrated that there were no significant associations between the use of metformin, insulin, α-glucosidase inhibitors, ACEIs/ARBs, CCBs, statins and increased odds of disease worsening. Even the use of α-glucosidase inhibitors and CCBs were significantly associated with decreased odds of disease worsening. Although the potential bias of reverse causation cannot be ruled out, our results at least suggested that the use of these drugs were not associated with a higher risk of disease worsening. However, considering the risk of acute metabolic decompensation caused by metformin in COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms as well as the fact that the maximum of the in-hospital BG alone cannot fully reflect the in-hospital glycemic control, the safety of the in-hospital use of metformin needs more studies to explore.
