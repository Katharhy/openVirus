<p id="p0110">There were some limitations of our study. First, the interpretation of our results might be limited by the sample size. Second, owing to the retrospective design of the study, the lack of data didnâ€™t allow us to analyze the type of DM, disease course and mean in-hospital BG. Third, due to the lack of mean in-hospital BG resulting from the urgency of pandemic, only the maximum of the in-hospital BG could be used to reflect the in-hospital glycemic control, which could reduce the convictive power of the conclusions about the safety of antidiabetic/antihypertensive drugs. In the urgent conditions, medical history was not taken in detail and some laboratory examinations were not performed in all patients.</p>
