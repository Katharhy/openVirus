<p id="p0095">Previously, the prognosis of COVID-19 patients with pre-existing DM has been reported. The majority of the studies demonstrated that diabetes was an important risk factor for the progression or mortality in COVID-19

 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, while some reported that COVID-19 patients with diabetes seemed not to have a higher mortality risk

 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. A recent

 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, which was consistent with the results in our study. It is worth noting that the judgement of pre-existing diabetes was based on the patientâ€™s self-report at admission, which could lead to the underdiagnosis of diabetes in the control group. In fact, the median level of HbA1c in the control group was 6.3%, which was above the normal upper limit of HbA1c (6.0%). Thus, although our results showed an increased risk of disease worsening in COVID-19 patients with diabetes, the risk might still be underestimated.
