<p id="p0090">This retrospective cohort study have 3 novel findings with important implications for the COVID-19 patients with diabetes. First of all, not only did we find that COVID-19 patients with pre-existing DM had an increased risk of disease worsening, but poor previous glycemic control, which was reflected by HbA1c, was associated with higher odds of disease worsening. Second, to our knowledge, this was the first study investigating the prognostic value of HbA1c in the COVID-19 patients with diabetes, and a HbA1c level of 8.6% (70 mmol/mol) was the optimal cutoff value. Furthermore, we found that α-glucosidase inhibitors and CCBs use were associated with reduced odds of disease worsening. Metformin, insulin, ACEIs/ARBs and statins were not associated with the worsening of COVID-19 in the patients with diabetes. These findings could help frontline medical doctors predict the prognosis of COVID-19 patients according to their previous history of DM and the level of HbA1c, and choose appropriate antidiabetic/antihypertensive therapy for the patients with diabetes.</p>
