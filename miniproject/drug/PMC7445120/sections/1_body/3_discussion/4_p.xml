 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Previous studies have reported that patients with poor HbA1c control were more susceptible to infections, such as the infections of 
 <italic>Chlamydia pneumoniae</italic>, hemolytic streptococci groups B, G, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, and exhibited worse prognosis compared to the patients with well HbA1c control

 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Besides, chronic hyperglycemia was thought to downregulate ACE-2 expression, making cells susceptible to the damage of SARS-CoV-2 
 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, to our knowledge, the association between HbA1c level and the prognosis of COVID-19 patients with diabetes has not been explored. Our study found that among COVID-19 patients, those with poor HbA1c control had a higher risk of disease worsening, with an optimal cut-off value of 8.6% (70Â mmol/mol), demonstrating the importance of previous glycemic control. Furthermore, we compared the clinical characteristics of the HbA1c well-controlled group with the poorly-controlled group. The HbA1c poorly-controlled patients presented a higher incidence of lymphopenia (71.4% versus 44.2%) compared to the well-controlled patients. Also, the levels of the percentage of neutrophils, prothrombin time and cTnI were significantly elevated in the poorly-controlled group. The changes in these clinical indicators were consistent with those in the COVID-19 severe cases that have been reported previously 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, suggesting that the higher risk of disease worsening in the poorly-controlled group might be associated with the changes in these clinical indicators in addition to the poor glycemic control.
