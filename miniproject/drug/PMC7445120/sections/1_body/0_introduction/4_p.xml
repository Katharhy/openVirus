<p id="p0030">Good glycemic control should be the most important for patients with diabetes during the COVID-19 infection as it has been shown to improve the innate immune system 
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Data from other viral epidemics such as SARS and influenza H1N1 has demonstrated that patients with poor glycemic control have a higher mortality risk 
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Unfortunately, the previous studies mostly focused on the impact of diabetes, as a comorbidity, on the prognosis of COVID-19. Despite a few studies reported that COVID-19 patients with poorly controlled fasting blood glucose in hospital were associated with higher mortality 
 <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, there is still a lack of information on the impact of previous glycemic control on the prognosis of COVID-19 patients with diabetes. In addition, previous studies have reported that metformin could increase ACE-2 expression and improve its stability by impeding its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation 
 <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor 1 blockers (ARB) also have been considered as a link between COVID-19 and diabetes because they are widely used in patients with diabetes 
 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, there are still no solid evidences demonstrating the impact of these medications on the prognosis of this population.
