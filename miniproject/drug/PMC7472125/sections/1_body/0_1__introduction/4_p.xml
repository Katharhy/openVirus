<p>Considering the scenario, which includes an ample variety of species allied to the normal and extensive genetic variation of the viruses, the determination of types and genotypes of viral strains using phylogenetic analyses tools is considered an important tool for elucidating how the virus disseminates, from an evolutionary perspective [

A few months after the ecological identification, it became possible by using certain tools to isolate the Asiatic general type of the circulating virus, which suggests that it originated in the Asian Southeast [
