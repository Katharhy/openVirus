<p>Another study, through phylogenetic reconstruction, suggested that the introduction of the CHIKV ECSA (East/Central/South African) genotype in Brazil occurred separately in several locations, as opposed to a single location, then followed by viral dissemination, as expected [

 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00889" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To highlight the importance of investigating these variants, the ECSA genotype (East/Central/South African), when compared to the African genotype S-27 (S-27) in mice, caused a high and acute fatality, with a higher viral load in the central nervous system and peripheral organs [

 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00889" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which shows concern about its circulation and its possible consequences on the populationâ€™s health.
