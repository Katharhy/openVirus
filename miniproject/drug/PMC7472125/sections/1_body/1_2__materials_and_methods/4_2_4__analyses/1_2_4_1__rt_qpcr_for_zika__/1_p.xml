<p>Viral RNA was isolated from 140 µL of serum sample using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions and eluted in 60 µL of AVE buffer. RNA extractions were tested for the presence of ZIKV viruses; DENV serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4; and CHIKV for the real-time PCR kit, Kit Biomol ZDC (Instituto de Biologia Molecular do Paraná, Brazil), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The reactions were performed on a Real-Time 7500 PCR System from Applied Biosystems, with the reaction profile: 51 °C for 30 min, 95 °C for 15 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The result was considered positive when the cycle threshold was ≤36 for the analyzed virus and ≤28 for the internal control.</p>
