<p>Complementary DNA (cDNA) was produced starting from the RNA extracted from positive RT-qPCR samples, using the Reverse Transcription (RT) method using the enzyme M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (© 2020–2011, 2016 Promega Corporation, Madison, USA). Extracted total RNA (2 µg) was incubated with 0.5 µg of random primer, at a temperature of 70 °C for 5 min in order to undo the secondary structures. Subsequently, 5 µL of the 5× M-MLV Reaction Buffer, 5 µL of 10 mM dNTP Mix, 25 units of RNAse Inhibitor, 200 units of M-MLV RT, in a final volume of 25 µL, were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C.</p>
