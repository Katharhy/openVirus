 <xref rid="viruses-12-00889-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) to amplify a PCR product 511 Base Pairs (bp) [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00889" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The reaction was adapted according to the following conditions: 20 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 200 µM of each Triphosphate Deoxynucleotide (dNTP), 200 nM Primer D1, 200 nM Primer D2 and 6 Units of Taq DNA Polymerase Hot Master enzyme. After adding 10 µL cDNA, the reaction was incubated in the thermal cycler at 94 °C for 3 min for initial denaturation, followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min for annealing 
 <italic>primers</italic> and extension at 72 °C for 2 min, ending at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR product was visualized using the agarose gel electrophoresis method.
