<p>The evolutionary model Tamura-Nei with Gamma distribution and Invariant Sites (TN93 + G + I) was chosen using the tool attached to MEGA7 Model Analysis. The evolutionary analysis was performed with Bayesian inference using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithms implemented in the BEAST v.1.10.4 package. [
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00889" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The evolutionary profile was estimated using the Bayesian Skyline coalescent model, relaxed molecular clock not correlated with the lognormal distribution and under a chain length of 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup>, with a collection at every 10,000. The analyzes were performed in duplicate and were combined when using the LogCombiner software v.1.8.4. to evaluate the run in the Tracer software v.1.7.1, which showed good convergence of the parameters (Effective Sample Size—ESS value&gt; 200). The TreeAnnotator v.10.1 and FigTree v1.4.3 programs were used to summarize the later distribution of the tree with a 10% burn-in and to view/customize the annotated MCC (Maximum Clade Credibility) tree, respectively.
