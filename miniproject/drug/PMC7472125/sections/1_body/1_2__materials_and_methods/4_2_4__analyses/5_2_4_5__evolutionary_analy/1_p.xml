 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00889" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], two banks of sequences to elucidate the evolutionary lineage of the isolated strains were assembled based on the purpose of the analyzes: (1) Determination of serotypes and (2) Genotyping of serotypes. Sequences with information about the collection year and isolation location were prioritized. The sample sequences were aligned with each bank of sequences under the MUSCLE algorithm in the MEGA7 software. The alignment was cut to remain only the nucleotides belonging to the region of the samples that had been amplified, removing the remaining bases that were present in the bank sequences.
