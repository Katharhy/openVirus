<p>To detect MAYV and OROV viruses, 2.5 µL of extracted RNA was incubated in a final volume of 10 µL of reaction containing 5 µL of Gotaq Mix 2×, 0.2 µL of GoScript 50×, 100 nM of MAYV probe, 100 nM of OROV probe, 300 nM of Primer Mix MAYV and 300 nM of Primer Mix OROV. The testing was performed on a Real-Time 7500 PCR System from Applied Biosystems, with the reaction profile: 45 °C for 15 min, 95 °C for 15 min, 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The result was considered positive when the cycle threshold was less than 38 [
