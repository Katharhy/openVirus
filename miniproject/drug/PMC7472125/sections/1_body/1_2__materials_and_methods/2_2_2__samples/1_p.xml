<p>Biological samples were collected between January 2018 and December 2019, at the Ambulatório de Malária do CEPEM. For this study, serum samples from 308 patients with a history of acute febrile illness were used, which tested negative for malaria (using microscopy) and with signs and symptoms suggestive of arboviruses (headache, myalgia, joint pain or rashes). These were evaluated by a health team that collected clinical, demographic and laboratory data. Individuals over 12 years of age, of both sexes and whose symptoms did not exceed five days were included. Patients without laboratory characterization, indigenous patients and those with uncontrolled co-morbidities were excluded.</p>
