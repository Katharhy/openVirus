This local transmission was confirmed in entomological-virologic survey sampled mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in outdoor and indoor from dwellings at Porto Velho, state of Rondônia where Aedes aegypti was found infected by ZIKV (one pool of three females sampled in 2016) and DENV-4 (one male sampled in 2018) [
