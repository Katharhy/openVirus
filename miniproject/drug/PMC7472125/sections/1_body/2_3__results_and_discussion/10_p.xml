<p>Another factor that supports this consideration is the formation of a monophyletic group with 100% support in the subsequent probability of the DENV-1 sample sequences. This phylogenetic profile is different from the findings of Vieira et al. during the 2001 to 2003 epidemics in Porto Velho, where the serotype 1 of the isolated dengue virus showed a 98% similarity with isolated sequences in Rio de Janeiro, suggesting that the virus that caused epidemics at that time was derived from the southern regions of the country [
