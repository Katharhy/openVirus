<p>In the study, we show the existence of DENV-1 genotype V and DENV-4 genotype II co-circulation. The current diversity of DENV-1 in the Americas resulted from two independent introductions of the V genotype from India around the early 1970s and 1980s [

The two strains of genotype V were probably introduced to the Americas through the Caribbean and later disseminated on the continent, confirming the central role of the Caribbean islands in the initial dispersion of DENV from Asia to the Americas [

 <xref rid="B64-viruses-12-00889" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The DENV-4 Genotype II is widely distributed with strains from all parts of Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore), China, Western Pacific Ocean Islands, Australia, Caribbean and the Americas [

 <xref rid="B69-viruses-12-00889" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Similarly, co-circulation of genetically distinct DENV, even at the genotype level, and the occurrence of simultaneous infections can affect recombination events and lead to the emergence of more virulent isolates [
