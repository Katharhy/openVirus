<p>Among the signs and symptoms reported by viremic patients during anamnesis and physical examination (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00889-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), there were 20/20 fever (100%), 19/20 chills (95%), 18/20 muscle pain (90%), headache 17/20 (85%), joint pain 15/20 (75%), nausea 15/20 (75%) and retro-orbital pain 14/20 (70%). This type of clinical manifestation is common in infectious processes that trigger an exacerbated inflammatory response, and although non-specific, it is considered characteristic in dengue without alarm signals, with additional symptoms such as vomiting and the appearance of

The study was not designed to compare between groups, although an exploratory analysis was conducted, and the only statistical significative result was lack of appetite. It only aids in describing the selected sample. As for pre-existing conditions, diabetes (1/20) and hypertension (1/20) were reported. Only 2 individuals claimed to use medication to treat fever symptoms. None of the individuals had prolonged use of any medication, or illicit drugs, and 45% (9/20) had a history of malaria.
