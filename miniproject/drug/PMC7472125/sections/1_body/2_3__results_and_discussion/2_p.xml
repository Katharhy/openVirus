<p>The RNA extracted from the biological samples of the 308 patients were tested in Real Time PCR assays. Of this total, 20 samples had a detectable viral load for Dengue, which demonstrated a prevalence of 6.5%, with the DENV1 (18/20), co-infection of DENV1 and DENV2 (1/20), and DENV4 (1/20) viruses being detected. For Dengue serotype 3 and for the CHIKV, ZIKV, MAYV and OROV viruses, no individuals with a detectable viral load were found. For comparison purposes, in 2019 the incidence of dengue in Porto Velho, based on notified and confirmed cases, was 0.09% and 0.03%, respectively. A confirmed to notified ratio of 29.90% was reported (data provided by Health Department of the city of Porto Velho). These data indicate that the sample selection based on an initial hypothesis of dengue or arbovirus in health care facilities is more sensitive when compared to patients in the malaria outpatient clinic. In addition, the serological method used for confirmatory diagnosis by the SEMUSA of Porto Velho allows a longer interval for recruiting participants when compared to the molecular method. With a short fever onset interval, inflammatory processes may not have been localized, resulting in a non-specific diagnostic suspicion.</p>
