<p>Despite the low rate of detection of DENV-4, several studies correlate the events of the reintroduction and reemergence of this serotype with epidemic outbreaks of the disease. DENV-4 was first identified in Brazil in 1982, in the state of Roraima [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-12-00889" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In the state of Amazonas, the first detection occurred between 2005 and 2007, being the first case reported in Brazil after 25 years [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-12-00889" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In 2012 and 2013, the emergence of DENV-4 combined with a highly susceptible population, and previously immunized by DENV-1, gave rise to the most severe epidemic observed in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00889" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In 2014, the same situation was observed in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, with the introduction of DENV-4 also triggering an epidemic outbreak [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00889" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although there are no studies describing the events of the introduction of DENV-4 in the state of Rond√¥nia, the detection of this serotype highlights its endemicity and the need for epidemiological and molecular studies in the region, since the detection of the serotype can be an indication of reintroduction and reemergence.
