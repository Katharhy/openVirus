<p>Among the 20 dengue samples with detectable viral load, due to the sensitivity of the method, only 9 were amplified by conventional PCR for sequencing. A total of 6 samples were successful in sequencing the 
 <italic>sense</italic> and 
 <italic>antisense</italic> tapes and according to the evolutionary profile elucidated by the Bayesian analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00889-f002">Figure 2</xref>), with 100% posterior supporting reliability, 5 samples corresponded to strains belonging to the DENV-1 serotype, and only 1 to the DENV-4 serotype. All strains detected evolved with isolated strains in South American countries, demonstrating even greater proximity to isolated specimens in Brazil, showing that the circulation of DENV in the region remains closed off and restricted to the country, with no introduction detected of virus specimens from other countries in the regionâ€™s DENV urban cycle.
