   <bold>A</bold>). Bayesian phylogenetic tree for determination of serotypes. The tree of maximum clade credibility generated. Fifteen sequences of each DENV serotype were used for this evolutionary lineage determination, totaling 60 sequences. The access codes are shown in the identification of the taxa. The clades are colored according to the DENV serotype (red, DENV-1; pink, DENV-2; green, DENV-3 and blue, DENV-4). The samples correspond to the black colored taxa. The posterior support in decimal format is shown in each node. (
   <bold>B</bold>). Bayesian phylogenetic tree for determination of genotypes. The tree of maximum clade credibility generated. A total of 37 DENV sequences were used for this evolutionary lineage determination, distributed in DENV-1 (17 sequences) and DENV-4 (20 sequences) genotypes. The access codes are shown in the identification of the taxa. The clades are colored according to the DENV serotype, being red for DENV-1 and blue for DENV-4. Sample sequences are colored according to the serotype to which they belong. The identification of the genotypes is displayed in each taxon, as well as in the colored vertical bars to the right of the taxa. The posterior support in decimal format is shown in each node.
