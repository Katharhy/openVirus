 </xref> Factors Nsp1, Nsp3c and ORF7a are related to assistance to the immune evasion of SARS-CoV-2. Interaction between Nsp 1 and the host ribosomal subunit induce the degradation of mRNA, allowing the virus to develop resistance to the host innate immunity. Binding between ORF7a and Bone marrow matrix antigen 2 (BST-2) inhibits activity and blocks BST-2 glycosylation. These results suggest that all three structures are potential targets for antiviral medicine.
