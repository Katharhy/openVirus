<p id="p0165">Moreover, the proteinase PL
 <sup>pro</sup> is responsible for cleavages of 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminus in the replicase polyprotein to release Nsp1, Nsp2 and Nsp3, which are essential for correcting virus replication significant to antagonize the host's innate immunity. Analysis of the docking model showed that ribavirin formed Hydrogen bonds with residues Gly164, Gln270, Tyr274, Asp303 as well as hydrophobic interactions between Tyr265 and the PL
 <sup>pro</sup> residue. These results indicate ribavirin as a powerful PL
 <sup>pro</sup> enzyme inhibitor, which means it has promising features for anti-COVID-19 therapy given the inhibition of a likely PL
 <sup>pro</sup> therapeutic target.
