<p id="p0130">Molecular modelling showed that spike (S) glycoprotein is a transmembrane protein of approximately 180–200 kDa type I whose 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminal turns to the exterior of the virus and its C-terminal segment turns to the interior of the virus. The typical structure of CoVs is given by the assemble of a bulbous projection of a corolla as trimers of protein S and it is cleaved into two important subunits from the pathogenic perspective: S1 and S2. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (S) glycoprotein share about 76% of amino acid identity and enable the entry of the virus in the host cells. Therefore, S glycoprotein present in CoVs has been considered a promising biological target for antiviral mechanisms.
