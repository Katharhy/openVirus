 </xref> investigated how the SARS-CoV-2 S protein facilitates viral entry in the target cells and how this process could be blocked. Results showed that ACE2 is used as receptor for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells and that the spread of this CoV in the infected host depends on the activity of TMPRSS2 (a cellular serine protease responsible for initiating the binding process between S protein and ACE2). This process can be blocked with clinically approved TMPRSS2 inhibitor. Prior to this, the relevance of TMPRSS2 was highlighted in the dissemination of several types of viruses such as Influenza A and other CoVs, which also makes it a relevant target for COVID-19 therapeutic intervention.
