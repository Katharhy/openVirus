<p id="p0175">RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp â€“ also nominated Nsp12) catalyses the viral RNA, which performs a key role in the replication/transcription complex of SARS-CoV-2, possibly aided by Nsp7 and Nsp8 complex as cofactor.

 <xref rid="b0390" ref-type="bibr">78</xref> Nsp12 has been studied as potential target for several SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV inhibitors, due to its importance for viral control. Satisfactory results of RdRp inhibition by several ligands were presented in the modelling studies by Gao et al.

 </xref> Those ligands included antiviral analogous to nucleotides, such as Remdesivir, which already shows great potential in the treatment of COVID-19 infections. In addition, some non-structural proteins, including Nsp3b, Nsp3e, Nsp7, Nsp8, Nsp9, Nsp10, Nsp14, Nsp15 and Nsp16, also stood out as useful targets due to their significant role in the synthesis and replication of viral RNA.
