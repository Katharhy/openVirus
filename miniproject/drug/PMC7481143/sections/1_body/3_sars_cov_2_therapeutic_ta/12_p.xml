<p id="p0170">Helicase (Nsp13) has been identified as a promising target for antiviral drug discovery, particularly against SARS-CoV-2. It is a multifunctional protein necessary for a wide range of biological processes, such as genome replication, recombination and dislocation of proteins related to chromatin and nucleic acid remodelling. For CoVs, helicase is indispensable for viral replication. In studies on molecular modelling, several antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral drugs were analysed and presented elevated affinity to helicase, suggesting it as a good target for SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
