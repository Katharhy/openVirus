<p id="p0665">Developing efficient vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 will be essential to reduce the severity of the disease, viral shedding and transmission to control future outbreaks. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple strategies were used to generate vaccines for the first HCoVs (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV).

 </xref> Several studies related to SARS-CoV vaccine production targeting the protein S, due to its function in the receptor binding and fusion to the host membrane, were successful in animal tests against that coronavirus.

Theoretically, these techniques could be applied to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccines given their similarities from both the genomic perspective and the mechanisms employed in the invasion and infection of host cells.

In addition, three immunizations using two different doses (3 μg or 6 μg per dose) in macaques provided partial or complete protection against the SARS-CoV-2 challenge, respectively, without observable antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. These data reinforce the use of PiCoVacc in the next steps of clinical trials targeting SARS-CoV-2 still for the present year.
