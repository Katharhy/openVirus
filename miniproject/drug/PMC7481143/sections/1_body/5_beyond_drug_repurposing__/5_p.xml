<p id="p0660">Among the modalities of immunotherapy, vaccines are expected to be more promising, hence the global engagement in their production. Over the last decade, the scientific community and the vaccine industry had to answer urgently to the epidemics of H1N1, Ebola, Zika and, more recently, SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine development is an expensive and slow process with high risks of failure, which often motivate developers to follow a linear sequence of steps with several breaks for data analysis and fabrication processes. Therefore, it is fundamental that vaccines be developed through faithful methods even if it takes longer to move them onto clinical trials or to make a large number of doses available, a challenge during a pandemic.
