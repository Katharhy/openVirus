<p id="p0690">In relation to immunotherapy development, several technological platforms are being manipulated to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. Still, the obtainment of vaccines to prevent the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 requires a careful evaluation of possible immunological complications before releasing the vaccine to the world. Therefore, while the vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is in development, it is necessary to continue investigating therapeutic options via repurposing in order to identify promising chemical structures and plan new antiviral prototypes specific for SARS-CoV-2 or, even, to find immediate use alternatives to save the lives of patients with the extreme form of COVID-19.</p>
