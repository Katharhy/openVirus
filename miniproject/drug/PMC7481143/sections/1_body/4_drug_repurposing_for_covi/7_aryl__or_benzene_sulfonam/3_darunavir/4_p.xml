 <italic>in-silico</italic> evaluation of anti-HIV drugs in their interaction capacity to proteinase 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. Results suggest that all drugs have higher binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> than to the homolog SARS-CoV proteinase. Among the evaluated drugs, indinavir and darunavir displayed the highest docking scores, therefore, they were subjected to molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, free binding energy calculations and Molecular Mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) to detail molecular interactions between inhibitors and proteinase. The data suggest darunavir had better binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> with value of −10,24 kJ/mol. In addition, darunavir bind to SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> via 19 contact residues and to SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> via 17 residues. This difference explains the lower binding energy values between darunavir and SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. It was also noted 5 hydrogen bonds between darunavir and SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> but none for indinavir and this proteinase. Because hydrogen bonds are important in the stability of the inhibitor-enzyme complex, darunavir is probably more promising against COVID-19. Finally, a different

 </xref> to assess a large variety of compounds (3 0 0) from several data banks and 66 potential compounds from FDA-approved drugs. The compounds were tested against SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. Darunavir was among the 20 best FDA-approved drugs, with a score of −7.208. All data collected from 
 <italic>in-silico</italic> studies still require experimental studies to validate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of darunavir.
