 <sup>pro</sup>, RdRp, helicase, exonuclease 3′ a 5′, endoRNAse e 2′-O-ribose methyltransferase. Among the best drugs in the assay, darunavir was a surprise because, despite inhibiting viral proteinase, the study showed that it binds to the replication complex components of SARS-CoV-2 with inhibitory potency K
 <sub>d</sub> &lt; 1000 nM. One example is RdRp, whose K
 <sub>d</sub> value was 148.74 nM and exonuclease 3′ to 5′ with K
 <sub>d</sub> value of 195.73 nM.
