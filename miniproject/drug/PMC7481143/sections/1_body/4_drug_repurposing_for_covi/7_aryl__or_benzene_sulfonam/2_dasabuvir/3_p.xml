 <italic>in-silico</italic> outcome against the S-ACE2 protein complex. Briefly, Dasabuvir forms π-cation interactions with Lys31a (present in the ACE2), π- π interactions with Phe170b (S Protein residue) and hydrogen bonds to ACE2 residues Glu35a and Asp38a and Gly176b and Ser174b (S Protein residue). The authors highlight the importance of repurposing drugs as new therapeutic alternatives not only for the new coronavirus but for the next viral outbreaks.
