<p id="p0190">As previously mentioned, SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, whose nucleocapsid consists of a positive RNA genome surrounded by multiple copies of nucleocapsid protein. This virus, after entry in the host cell, replicates fast the viral genome with new virion production. The RNA replication into the cell host depends on enzymes and substrates for RNA synthesis, such as ribonucleotides (adenine, guanine, cytosine or uracil) that have nitrogenous bases in the purine or pyrimidine classes. Compounds can mimic these chemical structures and interfere with the formation or use of one of these essential normal organism metabolites. The interference is generally prompted by enzyme inhibition in the biosynthetic pathway of the metabolite or by incorporation, as a false building block, into vital macromolecules such as proteins and polynucleotides. So, this class of therapeutic agents is called antimetabolites.
