 </xref> suggested combining ivermectin and HCQ against COVID-19 on the hypothesis that both drugs work in synergy: the HCQ would act as a primary shield against the viral penetration through cellular membrane while ivermectin reduced viral replication. However, there are no randomized clinical trials described in the literature to support either the isolated or the combined effect of ivermectin as prophylactic or therapeutic drug against COVID-19. This hinders its indication and clinical decisions. Thus far, data indicate ivermectin is useful at the early stages of the disease, even the epidemiologic profile of COVID-19 shows significant differences regarding the age of patients for the affected countries and patients with comorbidity.
