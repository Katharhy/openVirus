 </xref> analysed the SARS-CoV-2 inhibitory activity of ivermectin, reporting the mechanism of action of the IMP α/β1 proteins upon bonding to the protein of this coronavirus. IMP α bonds to the nuclear localization signal of the protein to be imported to the nucleus of the host cell. IMP β1 assists in anchoring the importin protein to the nuclear pore complex (NPC), translocating the ternary complex (viral protein and IMP α/β1) to the nucleus of the host cell. Thus, the dissociation of the ternary complex occurs in the nucleus of the host cell and the viral DNA unites with the human DNA, undergoing successive mitoses, releasing viral proteins and infecting other healthy cells. At this point, ivermectin bonds to and destabilizes IMP α/β1, impeding the viral protein of the CoV from bonding to importins and consequently impeding the passage of the virus through the NPC to the nucleus of the host cell, thereby inhibiting viral replication. In order to provide further scientific support to the use of ivermectin against SARS-CoV-2, Caly et al.
