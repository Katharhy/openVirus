 </xref> conducted an 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> evaluation of NTZ against recombinant murine coronavirus expressing the firefly luciferase (MHV-2aFLS). The strand was pivotal to triage the 727 drugs with likely anti-CoV activity. The first assay resulted in 84 molecules among which was NTZ. The antiviral effect of NTZ was verified for mouse astrocytoma (DBT) and fibroblasts (17Cl-1).

 </xref> The DBT cells infected with MHV-2aFLS were treated with NTZ at 5 µM for 12 h, after which the viral titer (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) was determined and viral N protein was subjected to Western blot. Results show the strong inhibitory effect of NTZ on the viral titer.

 <italic>In-vitro</italic> studies on NTZ or its metabolite tizoxanide were also conducted to verify efficacy against different coronaviruses. The replication of Canine coronavirus (strain K378) in A72 cells, for instance, was blocked by the tizoxanide with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1 µg/mL. On the other hand, NTZ inhibited the viral N protein in bovine coronavirus L9 (βCoV-L9) and human enteric coronavirus 4408 (HECoV-4408) with approximate values of 0.3 µg/mL.
