<p id="p0510">NTZ is also responsible for inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-2, IL-4, I-5, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Suppressing the overproduction of cytokines favours control of ARDS, the main cause of death by COVID-19 triggered by the development of cytokine storms. 
 <italic>In-vitro</italic>, NTZ inhibits lipopolysaccharides (LPS) induced IL-6 in both RAW 264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.54 mM and 0.17 mg/kg (2 mM), respectively.

 <italic>in-vitro</italic> suppression of cytokines was only assessed in animal models, the positive outcomes indicate that cytokine inhibition can improve results for patients infected with β-CoVs.
