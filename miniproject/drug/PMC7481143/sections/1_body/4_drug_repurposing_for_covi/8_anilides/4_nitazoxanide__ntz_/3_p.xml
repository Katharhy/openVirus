 </xref> The mechanism of action of NTZ varies according to the pathogen. In relation to antiviral activity, NTZ blocks the maturation of the viral hemagglutinin at the post-translation stage in treatments against influenza. In treatments against HCV (hepatitis C), it activates protein kinase R (PKR), which leads to phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor-2Î± thereby preventing translation.
