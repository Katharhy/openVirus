<p id="p0480">Imatinib 
 <bold>(35)</bold> (
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) is an oral anticancer agent that inhibits the activity of some tyrosine kinases, most prominently the BCR-ABL fusion oncoprotein (whose overactivation can lead to chronic myeloid leukaemia, CML), c-kit (involved in gastrointestinal stromal tumours development), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and the native ABL kinase, which has a ubiquitous expression and plays important roles in several biological processes.

 </xref> In this regard, it is reported that imatinib has anti-CoV activity in two points of the virus life cycle. In the early phases of infection, it inhibits virion fusion with the endosome and subsequent release into the cytoplasm, thus preventing viral entry and viral replication via ABL-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangement. In a later phase of the infection, ABL2 protein expression, which is inhibited by this drug, enables SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication, which suggests that ABL2 is a new host cell protein required for viral growth.
