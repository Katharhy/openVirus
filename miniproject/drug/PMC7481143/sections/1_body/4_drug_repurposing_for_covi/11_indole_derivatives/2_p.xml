 <sup>,</sup> The indole ring is the most abundant heterocyclic in nature and is commonly found in biologically active natural products, such as vegetables and seafood. It is also present in the structure of the essential amino acid tryptophan, which interferes with protein synthesis and with the regulation of physiological mechanisms such as precursors for serotonin and vitamin B3.
