 <sup>pro</sup>, ACE2, c-Jun signal and anti-inflammatory vias. Therefore, experimental studies on modifications of ACE2 pathways caused by MLT are useful to understand this drug.

 </xref> On the other hand, it has been suggested that using this neuro-hormone can mitigate the extreme form of the disease, the acute respiratory syndrome that has caused most deaths by SARS-CoV-2 cases. Despite its safety for humans, the lack of data on the relevance of its use for COVID-19 patients implicate monitoring of MLT effects on patients who are either healthy or infected with SARS-CoV-2.
