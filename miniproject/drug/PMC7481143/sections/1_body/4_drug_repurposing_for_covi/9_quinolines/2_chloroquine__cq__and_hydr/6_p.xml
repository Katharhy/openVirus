 </xref> Based on a systematic review, the authors defend the 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> efficacy of CQ as it reduces viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 and CQ is already known for blocking viral infections by increasing endosome pH and for interfering with glycosylation of viral cell receptors. They also claim that the immunomodulatory potential of this drug can favour 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> antiviral effects and highlight the low costs of CQ, particularly for countries with financial restrictions for medical assistance. Singh et al.

 </xref> defend that, in spite of the limited evidences of CQ and HCQ against the new coronavirus, and considering its potentially favourable risk-benefit relation in the absence of a valid treatment, both are useful in the present COVID-19 pandemic. The low costs also facilitate their use against COVID-19 (specially for diabetic individuals or patients with other comorbidities of elevated mortality rate). Using quinoline derivatives, specially HCQ, as initial therapy for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is also defended by Fantini et al.
