 </xref> Tests with 5-FU as monotherapy confirmed its failure against any coronaviruses. The reason proposed to such failure relied on the fact that coronaviruses RNA proofreading activities involve a 3′ → 5′ exoribonuclease in the Nsp14, which removes 5-FU during replication and metabolism. Hence, the combination between 5-FU and deoxyribonucleoside and deoxyribose was suggested so that, after its insertion in the RNA, it escapes RNA proofreading and prompt lethality and/or lethal mutagenesis in the virus. Despite the proposition of using a widely marketed drug to treat several types of cancer, which means it has well-established efficiency and safety, no other type of test has been made to confirm its efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, further experiments are necessary to explore 5-FU potentialities.
