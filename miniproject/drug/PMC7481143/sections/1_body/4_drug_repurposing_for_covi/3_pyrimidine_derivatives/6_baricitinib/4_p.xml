<p id="p0225">In relation to baricitinib, its anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential was explained in three ways: AAK1 inhibition like sunitinib and erlotinib; the kinase associated to cyclin G, which is another endocytosis regulator; and the Janus kinase, that inhibits the action of cytosines that triggers the inflammatory process. Because Baricitinib can inhibit AAK1 at the therapeutic dose (2 or 4â€¯mg/day), the drug is indicated for clinical trials. It is highlighted that Baricitinib is not indicated for patients with neutropenia or lymphopenia, once it lowers rates of neutrocytes and lymphocytes, which can lead the disease to progress and increase anaemia. Furthermore, treatment with Baricitinib can reactivate varicella-zoster, herpes simplex and Epstein-Barr viruses. This implicates in a conflict between the potential effect and the adverse effects of Baricitinib against COVID-19 to prevent aggravating the disease and the mortality of patients.
