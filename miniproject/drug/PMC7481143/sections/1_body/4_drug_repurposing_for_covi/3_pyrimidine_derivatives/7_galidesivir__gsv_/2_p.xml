<p id="p0230">An analogue of adenosine, Galidesivir (GSV) 
 <bold>(13)</bold> is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that blocks viral RNA polymerase by replacing a natural nucleotide with galidesivir triphosphate. This alteration prompts changes in electrostatic interactions and prevents the formation of the RNA elongated strand.

 <xref rid="b0530" ref-type="bibr">106</xref> Adenosine and GSV differ in that galidesivir has one Carbon at 7-position in the pyrimidine ring and Nitrogen in the ribose ring, whereas adenosine has one Nitrogen in the former and Oxygen in the latter (
