 <italic>in-silico</italic> studies have shown the existence of a strong bond between GSV and SARS-CoV-RdRp to demonstrate the capacity of alterations in RNA polymerase, which can eradicate the virus. Although, preclinical and clinical trials are necessary to either confirm or deny this hypothesis.

 </xref> The existence of antiviral activity against other coronaviruses indicates that more investigations on GSV against SARS-CoV-2 are required to elucidate its potential activity in advanced testing.
