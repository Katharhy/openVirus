 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi). It is a zinc metallopeptidases inhibitor that converts angiotensin-I into angiotensin-II, an essential function that regulates arterial pressure. It is predominantly indicated as vasodilator in patients with cardiac insufficiency. This drug was suggested as potential antibiotic capable of inhibiting zinc succinyls/dipeptidase by blocking its zinc catalytic center.

 <xref rid="b0945" ref-type="bibr">189</xref> Tolerance to captopril has been largely investigated; its single dose by mouth is well-established and confirms the pharmacological activity in the short term (10–30 min) at the cellular level. This capacity is related to captopril transport mainly through plasma proteins such as albumins with absorption rate between 70 and 75%. Reported adverse effects are neutropenia, proteinuria, dysgeusia and cough, but less frequent for low doses.
