 </xref> In this regard, drugs that show antiviral activity against SARS-CoV presumably have the same pharmacological anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties. Based on this premise, Jeon et al.

 <italic>in-vitro</italic> study with 48 FDA-approved drugs utilizing Vero cells. Each drug was added to the cells prior to the virus infection. At 24 h after the infection, the infected cells were scored by immunofluorescence analysis with an antibody specific for the viral N protein of SARS-CoV-2. Among the 48 drugs evaluated, the authors indicated that 24 of them, including CsA, had potential activity against SARS-CoV-2, given IC

 </xref> performed a gene-compound interaction, using the RGD database to search for any drugs that mimic the SARS-CoV-DeltaE top 10 genes upregulation and downregulation patterns. They found CsA to be a perfect match because it upregulates all nine upregulated genes and downregulates the only downregulated gene. Hence, the authors declared that CsA showed the same upregulation/downregulation effect on the top 10 genes as SARS-CoV without the envelope (E) gene. The authors conclude that CsA is a strong candidate for a clinical trial to test his ability to prevent the spread of COVID-19 or to flatten his epidemic curve.
