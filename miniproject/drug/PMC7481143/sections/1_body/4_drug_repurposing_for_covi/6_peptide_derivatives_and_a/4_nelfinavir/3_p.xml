 </xref> Among the compounds, 15 drugs were selected based on the docking score and three-dimensional (3D) similarity to the available M
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors. Consequently, 10 additional models of SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> were generated and docked against those 15 drugs. This revealed 6 drugs with good binding modes: nelfinavir, praziquantel, pitavastatin, perampanel, eszopiclone, and zopiclone. Nelfinavir was identified as the best drug with predicted binding free energies of −24.69 ± 0.52 kcal/mol by MM/GBSA and −9.42 ± 0.04 kcal/mol by SIE, respectively. In addition, the binding model of nelfinavir in its docking complex turned out to be very similar with that of the original ligand (TG-0205221), which inhibits M
 <sup>pro</sup>, and is able to form 3 hydrogen bonds similar to its original inhibitor (GLU-166 and GLN-189). The result suggests that electrostatic interaction performs an important role in the bond between nelfinavir and the potential target M
 <sup>pro</sup>.
