 </xref> Generally, Nelfinavir is combined with other anti-retroviral medication as part of a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) that reduces significantly the viral load by increasing cell number to 200 mm
 <sup>−3</sup> CD4(+) lymphocytes. The drug is prescribed for children, young individuals, adults and pregnant women.

 <xref rid="b0900" ref-type="bibr">180</xref> Nelfinavir and its active metabolite M8 strongly bind to serum proteins, displaying optimal tissue distribution. A frequent adverse effect is light to moderate diarrhoea, reported for 15–20% of patients.

 </xref> The SARS-CoV outbreak in several countries triggered the search for antiviral drugs active against the disease. Among the 24 drugs likely to inhibit SARS-CoV, nelfinavir stands out in all assays.
 <xref rid="b0900" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>180</sup>
 </xref> The mechanism of action suggested for nelfinavir involves preventing SARS-CoV replication after its entry in the host cell and disrupting virion production. Based on results from previous studies as well, nelfinavir was considered a likely therapy for COVID-19 after its indication for clinical trials as a promising anti-SARS drug.
