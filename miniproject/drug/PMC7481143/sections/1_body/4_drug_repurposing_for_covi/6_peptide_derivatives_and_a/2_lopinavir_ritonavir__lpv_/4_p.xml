<p id="p0355">A recent randomized clinical assay was conducted in the city of Wuhan, China, with 199 adult patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, saturation inferior to 94% and ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen inferior to 300 mmHg. Patients were divided into two groups: the first was treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) and the second received the standard treatment. Both the mortality rate (19.2% LPV/RTV and 25% standard treatment) and the percentages of detectable viral RNA and time of the treatment were similar in both groups. The total time of treatment was one day shorter for LPV/RTV. Also, gastrointestinal adverse effects were noted in LPV/RTV alone, which discourages use. Notwithstanding, it is noteworthy that treatments began at a late stage of the disease and a relatively high concentration of lopinavir was used to inhibit viral replication.
