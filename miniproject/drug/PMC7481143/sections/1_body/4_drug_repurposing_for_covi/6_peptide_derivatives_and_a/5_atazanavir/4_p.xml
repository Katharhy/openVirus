 </xref> triaged 23 clinically approved antiviral SARS-CoV-2 helicase inhibitor drugs through molecular docking based on binding affinity and binding free energy. Results suggest that atazanavir is a potent helicase inhibitor with affinity of −11,28; score S: −9,32 kcal/mol. Furthermore, the formation of hydrogen bonds between protein residue GLN331 and the drug was observed. Another relevant characteristic of atazanavir is meeting the Lipinski rule of five as the partition coefficients, and hydrogen bond acceptors and donors. Given the results reported in the literature,
