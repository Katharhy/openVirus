<p id="p0390">Atazanavir 
 <bold>(28)</bold> (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) is an antiretroviral drug protease inhibitor used to treat HIV infections with 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> inhibitory concentration of 2,6â€“5,3 nmol. Compared to other protease inhibitors, atazanavir has the advantage of allowing a daily posology regimen with a favourable metabolic profile and low frequency of adverse effects.

 <italic>in-vitro</italic> atazanavir, which is considered safe and well tolerated.

 </xref> The atazanavir acts to inhibit HIV-1 protease, which is indispensable in the processing of polyproteins precursors of viral structures and prevents the formation of infectious and mature viral particles.
