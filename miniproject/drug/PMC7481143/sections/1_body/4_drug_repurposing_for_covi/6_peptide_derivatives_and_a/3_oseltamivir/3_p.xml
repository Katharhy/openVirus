 </xref> in the city of Wuhan, China, monitored 99 patients, who were mostly 55-year-old-men, with pneumonia symptoms confirmed as COVID-19. About 75% of these patients were treated with a combination of oseltamivir (75 mg each 12 h oral), ganciclovir (0.25 g each 12 h, intravenously) and Kaletra (500 mg*2/day, oral) for 3–14 days. Most patients were also treated with antibiotics for 3–16 days and 13 patients were on mechanical ventilation. Finally, 31 patients were discharged, 11 deceased, and the others remained hospitalized. Results do not express clearly the efficacy of oseltamivir. Therefore, more studies are to be conducted to confirm its efficacy against COVID-19.
