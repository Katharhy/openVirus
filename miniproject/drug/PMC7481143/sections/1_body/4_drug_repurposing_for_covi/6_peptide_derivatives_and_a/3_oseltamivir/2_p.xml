 <bold>(26)</bold> is an antiviral used to treat influenza virus A and B (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">FIG. 5</xref>). It is indicated for adults, children and infants with clinical symptoms for two days at least. The drug is available as oseltamivir phosphate prodrug. It is converted in the liver into the active metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate. Its mechanism of action inhibits neuraminidase, which are glycoproteins that help new virions to exit the cell and prevents intercellular viral transmission. The virions remain on the surface of infected cells, trapped in the respiratory secretion. Then, oseltamivir disrupts viral dissemination in the respiratory system and reduces the time of infection.

 </xref> One research involving 1.099 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 from different hospitals in China identified that 35,8% of patients were treated with oseltamivir. However, the study presented several limitations, including the absence of complete data on patients, which hinders the publication of concrete information on the efficacy of oseltamivir.
