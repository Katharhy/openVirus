<p id="p0290">In addition to the promising results shown by RDV, other purine analogues have been investigated for SARS-CoV-2. Ganciclovir (GCV) 
 <bold>(19)</bold> also named, according to its chemical structure, 9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl) guanine (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), is a guanine analogue, similar to acyclovir, except for the bond between the methyl group and one hydroxyl. GCV inhibits the Human Herpesvirus and is also indicated in the treatment of cytomegalovirus infections related to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).

 </xref> GCV is converted into ganciclovir triphosphate by cellular kinase, which inhibits dGTP and disrupts viral DNA synthesis due to substitution of various adenosine bases in the DNA chain.
