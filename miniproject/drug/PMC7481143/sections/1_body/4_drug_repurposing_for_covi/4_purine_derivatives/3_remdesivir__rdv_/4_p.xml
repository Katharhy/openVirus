 </xref> Inhibition tests for MERS-CoV in human nasal and bronchial airway cells (Calu3 2B4) showed that GS-5734 prevented MERS-CoV replication with maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 0.025 μM and cytotoxicity (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) estimated as superior to 10 μM. The assay was conducted on a secondary cell line (HAE) and confirmed the low concentrations necessary for viral inhibition with average values of 0.069 μM (SARS-CoV) and 0.074 μM (MERS-CoV).

 <italic>in-silico</italic> assays on MERS-CoV demonstrated that administration of RDV plus Interferon beta (IFNb) was more effective than lopinavir/ritonavir-IFNb. Findings from 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> tests with prophylactic and therapeutic RDV indicate improvement of lung functions, decrease of the severe pulmonary form of the disease and reduction of viral loads and weight loss in murine.
