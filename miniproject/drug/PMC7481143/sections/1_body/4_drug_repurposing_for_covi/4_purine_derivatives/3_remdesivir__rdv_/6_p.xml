<p id="p0285">One advantage of repurposing RDV is the availability of data on safety and pharmacokinetics, which were obtained previously at phase 1 clinical trial. Intravenous infusions of 3–225 mg were well-tolerated without any evidence of liver or kidney toxicity. RDV demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics within the dose range and intracellular half-life longer than 35 h. Investigations on the ideal dose point to a single 200 mg loading dose, followed by 100 mg daily. Until the present date, there is no recommendation of hepatic or kidney adjustments, but the drug is not recommended in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate inferior to 30 mL/min.
