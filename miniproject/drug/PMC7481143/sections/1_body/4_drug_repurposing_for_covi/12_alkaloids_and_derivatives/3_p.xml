 <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). HHT is an FDA-approved drug in semi-synthetic form known as omacetaxine. This drug displays antitumoral activity in the treatment of myeloid chronic leukaemia. The mechanism of action implicates the ribosomal bond to prevent protein translation. In addition to antitumor activity, there are data in the literature that describe antiviral activity of HHT against several types of viruses including CoVs.
