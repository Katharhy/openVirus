 <italic>in-vitro</italic> evaluation on the efficacy of seven antiviral drugs, including ribavirin, against a SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate. Vero E6 cells were infected with nCoV-2019BetaCoV/Wuhan / WIV04 / 2019 at a Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) of 0,05 for different concentrations of the drugs. Results showed that high concentrations of ribavirin were necessary to reduce viral infection, with EC
