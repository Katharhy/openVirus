<p id="p0335">A prospective randomized, controlled, open-label multicentre trial involving 236 adult patients with COVID-19 was conducted to compare FPV (therapy dose of 1600 mg*2/first day followed by 600 mg*2/day) and Arbidol (200 mg*3/day) for 10 days. There was no significant improvement in the clinical recovery rate at day 7. It is important to highlight that FPV improved latency to relief for pyrexia and cough. Adverse effects were the elevation of uric acid.
