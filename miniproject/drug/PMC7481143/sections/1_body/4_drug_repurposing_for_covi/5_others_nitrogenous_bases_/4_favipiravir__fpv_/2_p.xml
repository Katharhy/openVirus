 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) is a prodrug, approved in 2014 in Japan, to treat cases of influenza A and B that displayed resistance to first line drugs. It has provided results that indicate a promising character and is currently undergoing clinical trials against COVID-19. Its antiviral efficacy has also been investigated in different countries to fight Ebola and Lassa, for example. The molecular structure of the drug consists of a pyrazine heterocyclic ring with fluorine at 5-position, carboxamide at 3-position and a double bond between oxygen and Carbon 2, which renders its analogue to guanine
