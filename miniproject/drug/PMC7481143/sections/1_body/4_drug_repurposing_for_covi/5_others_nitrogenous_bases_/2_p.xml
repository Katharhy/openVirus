<p id="p0310">Heterocyclic compounds with different heteroatoms such as Nitrogen, Sulphur and Oxygen can present different pharmacological properties. One such property is to serve as analogue of nitrogenous bases of nucleic acids, such as triazoles, which have a five-membered ring of two carbon atoms and three nitrogen atoms. This aromatic ring can assume two isometric forms, 1,2,3-triazole and 1,2,4-triazole. The former is stable under acid and basic conditions and becomes more reactive when binding to electronegative elements.
