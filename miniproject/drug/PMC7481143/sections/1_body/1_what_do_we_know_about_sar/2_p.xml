 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family, 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> subfamily, order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic> and they are separated into four genera based on their phylogenetic relationships and genomic structures:

 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> whereas αCoV and βCoV are considered human pathogens (HCoVs) usually related to respiratory illness and gastroenteritis. In the past few years, HCoVs have developed rapidly due to their adaptive mutation capacity, high levels of nucleotide substitutions, their efficiency in causing infection in new hosts and interspecies transmission.

 </xref> HCoVs, such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HKU, also commonly identified in different animal hosts, did not draw attention until November 2002, when the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) emerged in Guangdong province, China.
