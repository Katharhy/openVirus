<p id="p0055">The SARS-CoV-2 broke out rapidly due to the virus adaptation and human-to-human transmission through contact via respiratory droplets generated when an infected person speaks, coughs or sneezes, and a different person inhales the aerosols, which depend on the viral shedding for dissemination.

 </xref> These authors also showed that masks can prevent the diffusion of droplets and recommend its use as preventive measure to avoid SARS-CoV-2 person-to-person transmission. Other well-established preventive strategies to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2 spread are washing hands as many times as possible, social distancing and covering the face when coughing or sneezing.

 </xref> These prophylactic procedures are efficient but reinforce the necessity of more studies on the virus biology in order to broaden knowledge and identify opportunities for best combating COVID-19 and improving prevention. It is important to highlight that this is a unique moment for humanity, and it is not easy to adopt and to maintain preventive behaviours against the virus dissemination.
