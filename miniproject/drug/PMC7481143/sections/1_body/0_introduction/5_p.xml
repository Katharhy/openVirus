<p id="p0020">Repurposing of antiviral drugs can be motivated by either (1) Same target - new virus; (2) same target – new indication and; (3) new target – new indication. In the first case, a new virus shows the same therapeutic target than the virus for which the drug was approved. The drug can act through endocyclic vias or DNA polymerase. In the second case, the targeted virus displays an essential protein for the pathogenic process that can be modulated by a marketed drug, which becomes a potential antiviral therapeutic agent. Finally, the third is the case in which an approved drug, with established bioactivity for a path or mechanism, is given a new molecular target essential in the replication of the virus under investigation for new therapies.
