<p id="p0010">The increase in studies related to SARS-CoV-2 during the first semester in 2020 has allowed the rather speedy identification of promising therapeutic targets for both developing immunotherapies and producing/identifying antiviral drugs. It is noteworthy the increase in outbreaks of SARS-CoV (2002) and MERS-CoV (2013), with accelerated production of knowledge on these HCoVs, which has been very useful for ongoing investigations on SARS-CoV-2. One example is the availability of technological devices that allowed the fast sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genome and the elucidation of a promising antigen target, the S glycoprotein. Nonetheless, the development of a human vaccine can take years, especially because employing emergent technologies requires extensive safety tests and expansion to large scale production in order to assist the world population, as demanded in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic.
