The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is named COVID-19. Development and manufacturing of specific therapeutics and vaccines to treat COVID-19 are time-consuming processes. At this time, using available conventional therapeutics along with other treatment options may be useful to fight COVID-19. In different clinical trials, efficacy of remdesivir (GS-5734) against Ebola virus has been demonstrated. Moreover, remdesivir may be an effective therapy in vitro and in animal models infected by SARS and MERS coronaviruses. Hence, the drug may be theoretically effective against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir is a phosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine C-nucleoside. By entrance into respiratory epithelial cells in human, the prodrug is metabolized to a nucleoside triphosphate as the active form. The nucleoside analog inhibits the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) by competing with the usual counterpart adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The nucleoside analog is incorporated into the generating RNA strand and causes a delayed stop in the viral replication process. Knowledge about the potential efficacy of remdesivir against coronaviruses has been restricted to in vitro studies and animal models. However, information related to COVID-19 is rapidly growing. Several clinical trials are ongoing for the management of COVID-19 using remdesivir. In this study, characteristics of remdesivir and its usage for treatment of COVID-19 are reviewed based on an electronic search using PubMed and Google Scholar.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>remdesivir</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="1"/><ref-count count="42"/><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), formally named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a novel human infectious coronavirus.

Results did not show any significant difference between the 5-day and 10-day durations of remdesivir administration. Due to the lack of a placebo control arm, the magnitude of remdesivir efficacy cannot be deduced from that trial. The results of the trial suggested that if remdesivir surely is an active therapeutic, supplies that are likely restricted could be saved with shorter courses of remdesivir use.<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>In cell-based assays, remdesivir was an effective therapeutic against multiple variants of acute Ebola virus and other filoviruses. In a rhesus monkey model of Ebola, after intravenous administration of remdesivir, a lasting level of the nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) was observed in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (&#x0003e;10 &#x003bc;M) for at least 24 h. The half-life of remdesivir was short in blood (0.39 h), but it was quickly delivered into peripheral blood mononuclear cells and converted into the active drug (half-life=14 h) within 2 h after administration. The NTP was detected in favorable organs for viral replication such as testes, eyes and brain.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Once-daily intravenous administration of remdesivir (10&#x02009;mg/kg) for 12 days blocked the virus replication thoroughly.

Gilead, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) collaborated to discover drug candidates against RNA viruses with potential to induce a global pandemic (eg Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses).<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In order to find suitable antiviral agents against the RNA viruses, a library of approximately 1000 modified nucleosides including monophosphate, ester and phosphoramidate prodrugs was compiled.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Results of data screening showed that GS-441,524 (a 1&#x002b9;-CN modified adenosine C-nucleoside hit) along with GS-5734 (a prodrug form of the monophosphate of GS-441,524, later renamed as remdesivir) were highly potent antivirals.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>In 2016, the first clinical experience of using remdesivir against Ebola virus in human was reported.<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Ebola meningoencephalitis was diagnosed in a female nurse by detection of Ebola virus RNA in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. The patient was successfully treated by administration of corticosteroids and remdesivir for 2 weeks (once-daily administration of 150 mg over 2 h for 2 days, and then daily using of 225 mg for 12 days). In spite of a temporary increase in the levels of the enzyme amylase in serum, any serious adverse event was not observed.<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>In a controlled, randomized clinical trial conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 175 patients were randomly treated with remdesivir for Ebola. Remdesivir was not an effective therapy because of a high rate of death (53.1%). However, some data on the safety profile of remdesivir were formally collected.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Results showed that using two other medicines led to superior survival rates compared with remdesivir. Hence, randomization to remdesivir treatment was stopped.<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Interestingly, the rate of viral clearance in the subjects who received remdesivir was slower than in the patients who received the single-dose antivirals (specially MAb114 and REGN-EB3).

Results showed that the viral load in the lungs of the treated animals was lower than that of the controls. The severity of lung lesions in the therapeutic treatment group was lower than that in the vehicle-treated animals. The lungs of the prophylactically treated animals were normal. Taken together, the results emphasized the efficacy of remdesivir as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent against MERS.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>In 2020, Sheahan et al showed that remdesivir and interferon-beta have a superior antiviral activity compared to lopinavir and ritonavir against MERS-CoV in vitro. In mice, both prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir improved the respiratory function and decreased the pulmonary viral loads and severe lung pathology. In contrast, prophylactic lopinavir/ritonavir-interferon beta somewhat decreased the viral loads without affecting other disease factors. Therapeutic lopinavir/ritonavir-interferon beta improved pulmonary function but did not reduce virus replication or severe lung pathology. Overall, the authors suggested that remdesivir might improve the disease outcomes in coronavirus-infected patients, be useful to protect health care workers in regions with endemic MERS and inhibit future coronavirus epidemics.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p></sec><sec id="s0004-s2002"><title>Clinical Efficacy of Remdesivir to Treat COVID-19</title><p>Knowledge about the potential efficacy of remdesivir against coronaviruses is restricted to in vitro studies and animal models; however, information related to COVID-19 is rapidly growing.<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>In January 2020, a 35-year-old male infected with COVID-19 was compassionately treated with intravenous remdesivir after developing pneumonia in the USA.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The patient was hospitalized for more than 12 days, ntravenous remdesivir was administrated for 7 days and the patient's condition was apparently improved on the eighth day.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> No adverse effect associated with administration of remdesivir was reported.</p><p>Before the clinical trials are completed, information about using remdesivir for COVID-19 can be obtained from studies on compassionate use of the drug.

The ordinal scale is an assessment of the clinical status at the first assessment of a given study day. The US National Library of Medicine clinical trials registry described the seven category scale as follows: death, hospitalized/on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO, hospitalized/on noninvasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen devices, hospitalized/necessitating supplemental oxygen, hospitalized/not needing supplemental oxygen, not hospitalized/limited activity, not hospitalized/no limitations.<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p><p>A randomized, phase 3 clinical trial of 5 versus 10 days of remdesivir, sponsored by Gilead Sciences, is enrolling patients with severe COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04292899).
