 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> As far as we know, there is no registered or published clinical trial focused on evaluating simultaneous administration of remdesivir and dexamethasone in patients on ventilators with COVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) has welcomed the initial clinical trial results from the United Kingdom that showed dexamethasone could reduce mortality by one-third in patients on ventilators with COVID-19. For patients requiring only oxygen, administration of dexamethasone decreased the mortality rate by about one-fifth.
