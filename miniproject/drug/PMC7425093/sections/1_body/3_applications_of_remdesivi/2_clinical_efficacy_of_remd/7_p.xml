<p>Goldman et al (2020) did a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial including hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Patients were randomly divided to receive 5-day and 10-day courses of the intravenous remdesivir. In patients with severe Covid-19 not needing mechanical ventilation, there was not any significant difference between the 5-day and 10-day durations of the intravenous remdesivir. Due to lack of a placebo control, the degree of benefit cannot be ascertained (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT04292899).
