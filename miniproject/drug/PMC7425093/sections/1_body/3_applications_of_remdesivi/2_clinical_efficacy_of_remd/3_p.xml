<p>Before the clinical trials are completed, information about using remdesivir for COVID-19 can be obtained from studies on compassionate use of the drug. At present, several anecdotal reports on remdesivir administration to treat COVID-19 patients are available. A recent newspaper article reported that using remdesivir to treat 17 passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship for 10 days resulted in the patients' survival. Administration of the therapeutic led to less dependence of the patients on a ventilator. However, it should be noted that such reports cannot be considered references for any conclusions.
