<p>In 2020, in a published study in 
 <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic>, remdesivir was provided on a compassionate-use basis to patients with severe COVID-19. Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and breathing oxygen support or receiving ambient air were included in the study. The oxygen saturation of the subjects was 94% or less. The drug was administrated for 10 days. At the first day, the patients received 200 mg of the drug intravenously, and 100 mg of remdesivir was daily used in the remaining 9 days of the treatment course. Among 53 patients included in the cohort study, clinical improvement was observed in 36 subjects (68%).
