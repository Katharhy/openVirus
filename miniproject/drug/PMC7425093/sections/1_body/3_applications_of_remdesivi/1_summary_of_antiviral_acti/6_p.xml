<p>In 2020, Sheahan et al showed that remdesivir and interferon-beta have a superior antiviral activity compared to lopinavir and ritonavir against MERS-CoV in vitro. In mice, both prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir improved the respiratory function and decreased the pulmonary viral loads and severe lung pathology. In contrast, prophylactic lopinavir/ritonavir-interferon beta somewhat decreased the viral loads without affecting other disease factors. Therapeutic lopinavir/ritonavir-interferon beta improved pulmonary function but did not reduce virus replication or severe lung pathology. Overall, the authors suggested that remdesivir might improve the disease outcomes in coronavirus-infected patients, be useful to protect health care workers in regions with endemic MERS and inhibit future coronavirus epidemics.
