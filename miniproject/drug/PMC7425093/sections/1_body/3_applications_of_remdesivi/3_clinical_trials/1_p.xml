<p>Several clinical trials of intravenous remdesivir to treat COVID-19 are ongoing.
 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> A double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04280705) is underway in the USA in which patients are randomly divided into two placebo and remdesivir groups. In the remdesivir group, patients receive 200 mg of parenteral remdesivir as an initial dose on the first day, and a maintenance dose of the drug (100 mg once-daily) while hospitalized for up to 10 days.
 <xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The primary outcome of the trial is time to recovery. Day of recovery is the first day on which the patient satisfies one of the following three categories from the ordinal scale: 1) hospitalized, not needing supplemental oxygen â€“ no longer needs ongoing medical care; 2) not hospitalized, limitation on activities and/or needing home oxygen; and 3) not hospitalized, no limitations on activities. The ordinal scale is an assessment of the clinical status at the first assessment of a given study day. The US National Library of Medicine clinical trials registry described the seven category scale as follows: death, hospitalized/on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO, hospitalized/on noninvasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen devices, hospitalized/necessitating supplemental oxygen, hospitalized/not needing supplemental oxygen, not hospitalized/limited activity, not hospitalized/no limitations.
