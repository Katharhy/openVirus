<p>In cell-based assays, remdesivir was an effective therapeutic against multiple variants of acute Ebola virus and other filoviruses. In a rhesus monkey model of Ebola, after intravenous administration of remdesivir, a lasting level of the nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) was observed in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (&gt;10 μM) for at least 24 h. The half-life of remdesivir was short in blood (0.39 h), but it was quickly delivered into peripheral blood mononuclear cells and converted into the active drug (half-life=14 h) within 2 h after administration. The NTP was detected in favorable organs for viral replication such as testes, eyes and brain.

Administration of remdesivir even after 3 days of the virus exposure protected all infected monkeys against the lethal disease and improved the clinical signs and pathophysiological indicators.
