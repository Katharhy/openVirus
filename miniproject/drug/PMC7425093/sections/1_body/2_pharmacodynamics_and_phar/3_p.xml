<p>However, in a recent trial without a placebo control (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT04292899), patients with severe COVID-19 who did not require mechanical ventilation were included. Results did not show any significant difference between the 5-day and 10-day durations of remdesivir administration. Due to the lack of a placebo control arm, the magnitude of remdesivir efficacy cannot be deduced from that trial. The results of the trial suggested that if remdesivir surely is an active therapeutic, supplies that are likely restricted could be saved with shorter courses of remdesivir use.
