<p>The efficacy of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 and associated coronaviruses can be deduced from in vitro studies and animal models. For example, using remdesivir for prophylaxis and early treatment in a mouse model with SARS-CoV infection led to a decrease of the viral load in the lungs and improvement of the respiratory function.
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In 2020, Wang et al investigated the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 in infected Vero E6 cells. The results showed that the IC50 and IC90 values of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 were 770 nM and 1760 nM, respectively (cytotoxic concentration &gt;100 mM). The authors suggested remdesivir as a highly effective agent against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.
