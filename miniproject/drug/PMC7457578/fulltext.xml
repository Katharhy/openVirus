The relationship of rheumatic diseases, their therapies, and COVID-19 with multiple genuine and malicious information available online can influence the knowledge and attitudes of rheumatic patients. This Google Forms study was conducted to understand the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of rheumatology patients with regard to COVID-19 in Nepal.</p></sec><sec id="s2002"><title>Methods</title><p>A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among patients with rheumatic diseases. A modified version of a questionnaire was used after consent had been obtained. It was then translated into Nepali for comprehensibility. The final questionnaire contained a total of 29 questions: six on demographic parameters and twelve, five, and six on knowledge, attitudes and practice, respectively. Simple descriptive statistics were used to describe the positive responses in each domain.

A sample of 384 patients was calculated with an estimated 3 million population with rheumatic diseases where the margin of error was 5%.

The modified questionnaire was translated into the native language (Nepali) by two independent Nepali-speaking translators. The Nepali version synthesized by these two translators was back-translated to English by two independent translators (one with a master&#x02019;s degree in journalism with an English major and a postgraduate rheumatology registrar [author MB]). A prefinal Nepali questionnaire was developed after sorting out the differences in understanding of common words after a joint meeting between all four translators and author BV. This prefinal survey instrument was distributed to randomly selected faculty members to assess its comprehensibility and appropriateness (on a score of 0&#x02013;4) and refinements made as required to facilitate better comprehension and organize the questions before the final version was distributed to the study population. It contained a total of 29 questions: six pertaining to demographic parameters, including the rheumatic disease they were suffering from, twelve to knowledge about the disease, five to attitude, and six to practices.

Any viral infection can have an aggressive course leading to severe disease manifestations and respiratory complications in immunocompromised patients. The true incidence of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic disease has been reported not to be much higher than the nonrheumatic population. Also, the natural history of COVID-19 in these patients is not much different, with very few cases of severe disease reported in patients receiving biological or target-specific agents. These data still would be considered inadequate for any definite recommendation to be made. This study also shows a level of uncertainty in our patients with rheumatic disease, with around a third of patients responding that they felt that they were at increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 due to their disease. A few patients also opted to reduce the dose of their medications, but this practice was not influenced by their use of DMARDs or immunosuppressants. Various societies have given directives that a reduction or withdrawal of DMARDs is not warranted prophylactically, because of the risk of flare of the underlying disease, which might increase the need for steroids instead.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Such a reduction or withdrawal might be considered in those with symptomatic infections only.</p><p>Some commonly used drugs like hydroxychloroquine might have some role in inhibition of SARS-CoV-19 by interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptors and increasing endosomal pH required for viral fusion.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Some guidelines have recommended hydroxychloroquine&#x02019;s use for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 infection. This might lead to a false sense of security and irresponsible high-risk practice among patients taking these medications. A report suggested that there might be zero protective role of hydroxychloroquine, as 25% of rheumatic patients using this drug had concomitant COVID-19 infections.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In contrast to our expectations, only 13.7% of patients considered their medications to have a protective effect, while 86.3% denied or were unsure of this theory. Along with hydroxychloroquine, some studies have shown that medications like JAK inhibitors, IL-1 inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, and some intravenous immunoglobulins might have protective actions in COVID-19 infection.<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Routine vaccination against pneumonia and flu is recommended before initiation of any DMARDs. However, in low- to middle-income countries like Nepal, this practice is seldom followed. As there was an increasing trend of self-seeking of flu vaccination during the swine- and bird-flu epidemics, we also surveyed a change in this practice in our patients after the COVID-19 outbreak. The majority (96.9%), however, denied changing their behavior regarding vaccination practice.</p><p>Nepal being in stage 3 of the COVID-19 epidemic, this knowledge regarding general symptoms, transmission, and preventive measures in patients with rheumatic disease should be considered acceptable. However, the findings of this survey highlight caveats in certain aspects of knowledge of our rheumatic patients, and it would thus be helpful to design awareness programs. Future web-based studies should include patient attitudes toward herd immunity, as this provides indirect protection from infection. In cases of SARS-Cov-2, development of herd immunity may be difficult to achieve simultaneously in all geographic regions. Furthermore, long-term natural immunity to this virus is not certain. As such, the development of a vaccine is of great importance for the control and prevention of the disease outbreak.<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patients with rheumatic diseases were aware of the general clinical features, route of transmission, and general preventive measures regarding COVID-19.
