<p>Preventive measures like wearing a mask (94.7%) and avoiding public or crowded places (97.9%) were practiced by an acceptable proportion of participants, while 13.6% of patients reduced the dose of their DMARDs on their own and few admitted stopping medication for fear of infection (4.2%) or unavailability of medicine due to lockdown (8.4%). Details are given in 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. There was no difference in attitude or practice changes between higher and lower education (
 <italic>p</italic>=0.969 and 0.643, respectively). Also, no difference was observed between those using and not using DMARDs and immunosuppressants in knowledge of symptoms (
 <italic>p</italic>=0.196), risk of infection (
 <italic>p=</italic>0.607), or change in dose or discontinuation of medication (
 <italic>p</italic>=0.746). Binary logistic regression analysis did not show significant relationships between demographic variables like sex (
 <italic>p</italic>=0.669), education (
 <italic>p</italic>=0.891), or use of immunosuppressants (
 <italic>p</italic>=0.860) on responses to knowledge-, attitude-, and practice-related questions.
