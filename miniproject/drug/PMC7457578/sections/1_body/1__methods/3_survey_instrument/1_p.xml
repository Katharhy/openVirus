<p>A survey questionnaire constructed by Zhong et al was modified and translated into Nepali for the study.
 <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The corresponding author was contacted via email and permission to use the same questions with modification in terms of rheumatic patients obtained. The modified questionnaire was translated into the native language (Nepali) by two independent Nepali-speaking translators. The Nepali version synthesized by these two translators was back-translated to English by two independent translators (one with a master’s degree in journalism with an English major and a postgraduate rheumatology registrar [author MB]). A prefinal Nepali questionnaire was developed after sorting out the differences in understanding of common words after a joint meeting between all four translators and author BV. This prefinal survey instrument was distributed to randomly selected faculty members to assess its comprehensibility and appropriateness (on a score of 0–4) and refinements made as required to facilitate better comprehension and organize the questions before the final version was distributed to the study population. It contained a total of 29 questions: six pertaining to demographic parameters, including the rheumatic disease they were suffering from, twelve to knowledge about the disease, five to attitude, and six to practices. Responses were classified as true, false, or “not sure” in the knowledge and attitude sections. Open-ended questions were not kept to save the time of respondents and reduce dropout rates.
