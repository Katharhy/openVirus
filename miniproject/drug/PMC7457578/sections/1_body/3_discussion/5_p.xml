<p>Nepal being in stage 3 of the COVID-19 epidemic, this knowledge regarding general symptoms, transmission, and preventive measures in patients with rheumatic disease should be considered acceptable. However, the findings of this survey highlight caveats in certain aspects of knowledge of our rheumatic patients, and it would thus be helpful to design awareness programs. Future web-based studies should include patient attitudes toward herd immunity, as this provides indirect protection from infection. In cases of SARS-Cov-2, development of herd immunity may be difficult to achieve simultaneously in all geographic regions. Furthermore, long-term natural immunity to this virus is not certain. As such, the development of a vaccine is of great importance for the control and prevention of the disease outbreak.
