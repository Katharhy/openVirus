<p>There are limited sources of information regarding the risks of infection due to rheumatic disease and severity of illness. Any viral infection can have an aggressive course leading to severe disease manifestations and respiratory complications in immunocompromised patients. The true incidence of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic disease has been reported not to be much higher than the nonrheumatic population. Also, the natural history of COVID-19 in these patients is not much different, with very few cases of severe disease reported in patients receiving biological or target-specific agents. These data still would be considered inadequate for any definite recommendation to be made. This study also shows a level of uncertainty in our patients with rheumatic disease, with around a third of patients responding that they felt that they were at increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 due to their disease. A few patients also opted to reduce the dose of their medications, but this practice was not influenced by their use of DMARDs or immunosuppressants. Various societies have given directives that a reduction or withdrawal of DMARDs is not warranted prophylactically, because of the risk of flare of the underlying disease, which might increase the need for steroids instead.
