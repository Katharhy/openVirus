<p>Some commonly used drugs like hydroxychloroquine might have some role in inhibition of SARS-CoV-19 by interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptors and increasing endosomal pH required for viral fusion.
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Some guidelines have recommended hydroxychloroquineâ€™s use for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 infection. This might lead to a false sense of security and irresponsible high-risk practice among patients taking these medications. A report suggested that there might be zero protective role of hydroxychloroquine, as 25% of rheumatic patients using this drug had concomitant COVID-19 infections.

Along with hydroxychloroquine, some studies have shown that medications like JAK inhibitors, IL-1 inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, and some intravenous immunoglobulins might have protective actions in COVID-19 infection.
