<p id="Par24">According to WHO, transmissions are classified as scattered, clustered, and community-based. Scattered cases refer to a small number of cases that are identified locally. Local transmission shows the locations that have been reported as a source of infection. A cluster of cases refers to cases that are clustered in time, geographic location, and/or by a common exposure. Community transmission refers to the region experiencing higher outbreaks of local transmission. It can be characterized by a situation that the source of exposure cannot be found or by a large number of cases that are not linkable to transmission chains and are identified through surveillance of a specific group of people [
