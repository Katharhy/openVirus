 <italic>Rhinolophus affinis</italic> bat was introduced as the natural host of 2019-nCoV due to 96.2% of whole-genome similarity with the BatCoV-RaTG13 genome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Evidence indicates that the transmission of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV from an animal to a human requires an intermediate host such as palm civets for SARS-CoV and camels for MERS-CoV. Many researchers believe that due to similarities between SARS-CoV and the 2019-nCoV, another animal as an intermediate host is probably needed to transmit 2019-nCoV to humans. If true, finding the intermediate 2019-nCoV host is vital to prevent interspecies transmission. In this regard, pangolins have been suggested as an intermediate host for 2019-nCoV, however, this assumption has not yet been proven [
