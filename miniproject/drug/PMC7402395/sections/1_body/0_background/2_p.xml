<p id="Par10">Clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on clinical manifestations, molecular diagnostics of the viral genome by RT-PCR, chest x-ray or CT scan, and serology blood tests. The most common laboratory abnormalities in patients with positive RT-PCR are lymphopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated CRP and inflammatory markers, elevated cardiac biomarkers, decreased albumin, and abnormal renal and liver function [

However, several parameters may interfere with the results; the most important of which is the window period (time from exposure to the development of symptoms). As the body requires time to respond to the antigenic viral attack, symptoms may appear 2 to 14â€‰days after exposure to the virus. The window-period of viral replication leads to false-negative results and problems in preventing COVID-19 expansion.
