<p id="Par32">Most viral infections target a series of “protective responses” in the host body, including apoptosis, stress response, autophagy, and innate immunity. The strength of the body’s protective response depends on genetics, epigenetics, and or other factors, such as lifestyle [

The results of epidemiological and clinical studies show that most of the infected individuals who are asymptomatic or show mild symptoms have good body capacity for protective responses to activate the body’s antiviral defense mechanisms including immune cell defense and interferons induction. But, such supportive and immune responses are weak in most elderly people or patients with immunodeficiency, lung problems such as fibrosis, chronic obstruction and asthma, cardiovascular and hypertension problems, diabetics, or obesity. Such infected people may encounter more severe symptoms of the disease, severe respiratory problems, and even death [

Weak immune responses and inability to fight the virus increase the viral load, leading to increased secretion of inflammatory cytokine in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and severe inflammatory/oxidative stress response, followed by severe lung damage. Considering acute respiratory distress syndrome, antiviral therapy, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used in treatment protocols [
