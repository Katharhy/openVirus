<p id="Par33">Most drug designs against 2019-nCoV have been focused on immunomodulators (such as corticosteroids and interferons), monoclonal antibody production, and inhibitory agents against viral proteinase, helicase, and polymerases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. However, to date, no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine has been approved by the FDA for COVID-19. Due to short replication times and high viral yields, the replication of the positive-sense viral RNA genome undergoes high error rates and homologous and nonhomologous recombination. This genetic plasticity makes it difficult to design an anti-COVID-19 drug and vaccine [
