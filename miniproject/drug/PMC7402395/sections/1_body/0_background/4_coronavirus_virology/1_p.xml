<p id="Par12">A human coronavirus was isolated for the first time from the nasal secretions of a male child with a common cold in 1965 by Tyrell and Bynoe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Because of their morphological similarity with a solar corona under an electron microscope (crown-like), the virus was termed coronavirus. Such appearance is because of the spike [S] glycoprotein radiating from the viral surface virus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The S glycoprotein and the transmembrane glycoprotein [M] are two major envelope proteins. The S glycoprotein is an antigen that binds to the receptor and is responsible for cellular fusion. M glycoprotein has a role in envelope formation and virion assembly [

The positive single-stranded RNA genome with about 26–32 Kbp, is the largest genomic RNA known among viruses and contains 7–10 different open reading frames. It is methylated in 5′ and has a poly-A tail in 3′. Genomic RNA is associated with the capsid by the basic phosphoprotein [N] [
