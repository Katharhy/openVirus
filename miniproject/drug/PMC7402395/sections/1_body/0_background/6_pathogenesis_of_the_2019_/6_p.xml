<p id="Par22">Both Prolylcarboxypeptidase and Prolylendopeptidase are lysosomal and cytosolic peptidase, respectively, that have been mainly expressed in white blood cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. They have also been detected in lung, liver, and kidney tissues. In addition to their role in the destruction or maturation of a variety of peptides, both enzymes may be considered as protective agents against AngII-induced injuries due to the conversion of AngII to Ang(1â€“7). Prolylcarboxypeptidase also named angiotensinase C, activates bradykinin, and hydrolyzes plasma prekallikrein to active kallikrein [
