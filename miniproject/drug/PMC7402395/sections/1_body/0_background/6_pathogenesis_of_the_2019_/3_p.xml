<p id="Par19">The human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), known as the major receptor for the viral S protein provides the entry point for 2019-nCoV to capture and infect a wide range of human cells. DC-SIGN (CD209), CD147, and L-SIGN (CD209L) are also other entry receptors for 2019-nCoV. Thus, drugs that interfere with the interactions of the spike protein/ACE2, CD147, DC-SIGN or L-SIGN or with their gene expression may inhibit viral invasion.</p>
