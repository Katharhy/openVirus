<p id="Par16">Using the Swiss-Model program 33, the three-dimensional structure of the 2019-nCoV-RBD (Protein Data Bank ID: 2DD8), like the RBD in other beta-coronaviruses, consists of a core and an external subdomain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b-d). Interestingly, the similarity among the external subdomain of RBD in 2019-nCoV with that in SARS-CoV suggests the 2019-nCoV also uses ACE2 binding to entre into the host cell [
