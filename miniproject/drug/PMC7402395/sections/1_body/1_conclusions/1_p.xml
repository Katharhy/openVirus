<p id="Par41">2019-nCoV exists in the respiratory, fecal, and blood samples of COVID-19 patients. However, the main route of transmission is through inhalation of respiratory droplets or contact with contaminated fomites due to the persistence of the virus on surfaces. Although many treatments have been proposed, there are currently no specific options for treating COVID-19 or preventing 2019-nCoV infection. Like influenza, the prevalence of COVID-19 is expected to decrease as the weather warms up in the summer and the 2019-nCoV infection is predicted to start again with the gradual cooling of the air in the fall. Unfortunately, it is not yet possible to say that improved people from COVID-19 are resistant or susceptible to the second infection. Due to the high rate of mortality and economic damage to various communities to date, a significant attempt should be made to produce successful drugs and vaccines against 2019-nCoV infection. However, in the absence of vaccines and antivirals, the most important way to control the disease among the populations is regular hand washing, the use of disinfectants, and the prevention of contact with the face and mouth after interacting with the infected environment.</p>
