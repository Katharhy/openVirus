<p>We used a coherent, useful, and successful approach to developing a COVID‐19 Mental Health Hotline in our efforts to prevent an emerging mental health crisis in our front‐line HCWs. We describe the 13‐step process which we believe led to our success. We described the process of setting up this service with the hope that it might be specifically useful to others who may want to develop COVID‐19 hotline services, and perhaps as a generally useful process for the development of other mental health services.</p>
