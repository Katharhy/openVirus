<p>Lessons learned from the New York 9/11 experience (Rosoff, 
 <xref rid="da23073-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>) taught us that a second wave of mental health crises would occur after an initial onslaught. The 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak produced anxiety, social dysfunction, acute trauma, and posttraumatic stress disorder in HCWs (Klitzman &amp; Freudenberg, 
 <xref rid="da23073-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>; Williams &amp; Gonzalez‐Medina, 
 <xref rid="da23073-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). A recent meta‐analysis (Kisely et al., 
 <xref rid="da23073-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) examined the psychological stress of HCWs exposed to viral outbreaks and epidemics. HCWs suffered greater levels of both acute and posttraumatic stress (odds ratio [OR], 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.28–2.29) and psychological distress (OR, 1.74; 95% CI = 1.50–2.03) when compared with the general population. Younger HCWs were at greatest risk as were junior clinicians, parents with young children, HCWs who lacked support or who had an infected family member, needed quarantine, or suffered from virus‐related stigma. HCWs with access to personal protective equipment, rest, regular information, and those who had psychological support had reduced morbidity.
