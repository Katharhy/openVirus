<p>Our training focused on the basics of crisis intervention. We did not include suicide and violence prevention or addiction screening/assessment, as our mental health professionals were already experienced with these interventions. The crisis didactic training covered these subjects: (a) the normal equilibrium state; (b) the precipitants and/or trauma initiating the crisis; (c) the individual's interpretation or meaning of the events; (d) understanding the crisis state itself as both “Danger” (dysfunction) or “Opportunity” (for successful coping); (e) system of social supports and resources available to help; (f) selective past history which can fuel the crisis; (g) the effects of pre‐existing personality or psychiatric conditions which might affect the crisis; and (h) sequelae of a crisis or trauma. The prognosis after trauma depends on three factors: pretraumatic, traumatic, and posttraumatic functioning (McFarlane &amp; Williams,
