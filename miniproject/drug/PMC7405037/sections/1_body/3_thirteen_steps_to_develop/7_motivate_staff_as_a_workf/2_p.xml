<p>The public media about the pandemic motivated our workforce for us. Providing our mental health professionals with a new clinical service, access to participate in a service that was practical, accessible, and meaningful was all the additional motivation needed. It was apparent that we could easily mobilize our psychiatric residents, fellows, faculty, and volunteer/mental health professionals. We developed our workforce by word‐of‐mouth and by e‐mailing our Grand Round lists to gather interested professionals.</p>
