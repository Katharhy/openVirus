<p>Some of our COVID‚Äê19 HCWs are psychologically crashing; all are frightened, yet many do not ask for help. They are exhausted, not sleeping, some crying, all traumatized by dying and death, and vicariously traumatized by suffering families unable to visit with their terminal loved ones. Some work in a dissociated state, many drink, or use drugs, while others may contemplate or commit suicide.</p>
