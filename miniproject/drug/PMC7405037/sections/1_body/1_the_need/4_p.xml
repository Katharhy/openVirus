<p>The 
 <italic>Healthcare Worker Mental Health COVID‚Äê19 Hotline</italic> was developed to provide crisis counseling by utilizing the expertise of psychiatrists, clinical social workers, psychiatric residents, and volunteer mental health professionals. We envisioned that the Hotline could alleviate some HCWs stress, and enable our frontline staff to continue working. This paper was written in the hope that our experiences setting up this Hotline may be useful to others wanting to offer similar services.
