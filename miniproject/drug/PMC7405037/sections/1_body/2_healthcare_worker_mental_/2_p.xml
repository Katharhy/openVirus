<p>We focused on the perceived needs of HCWs within Dell Medical School Community and 
 <italic>Ascension/Seton Hospitals and Affiliates</italic>. The near future goal was to serve the entire community. For us, this service developed organically with capable leadership, a cadre of interested and talented innovators and administrators. We spoke and e‐mailed frequently, worked both independently and jointly in unstructured cycles. We set urgent timelines, developed what we needed, used existing resources, contracted with one external vendor for hotline technology, and launched. Upon reflection of our process and lessons learned, we decided it might be useful to describe what we now recognize as 13 elements of our success. We thought describing the process of setting up this service might be specifically useful for others who may, wanted to develop COVID‐19 hotline services and perhaps generally useful for the development of other mental health services.
