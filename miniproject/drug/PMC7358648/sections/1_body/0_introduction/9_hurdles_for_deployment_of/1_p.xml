<p>With the looming crisis of increasing numbers of MDR bacterial infections, alternatives to chemical antibiotics are urgently needed. To prevent secondary bacterial infections, prophylactic use of phages could be applied similar to small-molecule broadband antibiotics. This would require a “phage cocktail” that targets a broad range of pathogenic species likely to cause bacterial pneumonia. Since phages are highly specific, a phage cocktail would need to contain a variety of phages. Regulatory guidelines for the medical application of phages are not (fully) established in most countries; each component of a therapeutic requires to be approved, making deployment of phages as prophylactics in patients infected with pulmonary viruses, complex. Phage-derived therapeutic proteins such as endolysins would be advantageous as they would have a lower specificity toward bacteria and be able to inactivate a broader range of bacterial pathogens.</p>
