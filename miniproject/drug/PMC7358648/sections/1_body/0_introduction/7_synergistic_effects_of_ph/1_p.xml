<p>A number of factors can result in phage resistance in bacteria, such as the alteration in phage receptors on the bacterial cell surface; degradation of phage DNA by restriction endonuclease produced by the host bacteria; emergence of mechanisms inhibiting the penetration of phage DNA into the bacterial host, among others (

Under certain conditions, such as low phage to bacterium ratios, or when using a single phage to treat an infection, phage-resistant bacteria can emerge. This selection of resistant mutants is a shortcoming of phage therapy. Clinical applications often make use of multiple phages, making the occurrence of multiple resistance mechanisms unlikely (
