<p>Epidemics are often seen as processes that disrupt the normal rhythms and functioning of daily life for societies. One of the characteristics of this disruption that scholars from a variety of social science and humanities disciplines have focused on over the years is the Foucauldian notion that forces from above—elites or authorities—have throughout history used epidemic disease outbreaks as a ‘tool’ for implementing oppressive social regulations and restrictions.

Furthermore, this dissent or disorder has sometimes passed under the radar of scholars focusing on the written record and ‘texts’: a view from within ‘Performance Studies’ by Dwight Conquergood suggests that the ‘oppressed everywhere must watch their backs, cover their tracks, suck up their feelings, and veil their meanings…subversive meanings and utopian yearnings can be sheltered and shielded from surveillance’.
