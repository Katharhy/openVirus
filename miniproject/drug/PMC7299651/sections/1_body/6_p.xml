<p>In this article we focus on a close analysis of three films that centre around epidemic diseases—
 <italic>Contagion</italic> (Steven Soderbergh, 2011), 
 <italic>Blindness</italic> (Fernando Meirelles, 2008) and 
 <italic>The Painted Veil</italic> (John Curran, 2006)—in order to highlight three categories of distrust that have recently been identified and conceptualised in broader discussions regarding trust and health. The reason for zooming in on these three films is that they first present epidemics in a realistic or semirealistic way, rather than overly fantastical or implausible, and have been widely watched, with cumulatively grossing worldwide figures of $135 458 097, $19 844 979 and $26 522 838, respectively.
 <xref ref-type="other" rid="note21">21</xref> We categorise trust into three dimensions: (1) institutional trust, (2) social trust and (3) interpersonal trust, informed by pre-existing work on trust in public health contexts.
 <xref ref-type="other" rid="note22">22</xref> First, by institutional trust we focus on societies’ hierarchical relationships developed with perceived or real elites and authorities, which comes down to people’s trust placed in medical and ‘expert’ information and trust placed in governmental authorities. Second, by social trust we focus on the relationships developed between ordinary citizens themselves as members of communities, and furthermore trust between members of communities or ‘insiders’ and those seen to be ‘outsiders’ to the communities in question. Third, by interpersonal trust we focus on the micro-scale of individual relationships between people within households, families and friendship networks. Institutional trust, therefore, refers to vertical relationships between those with unequal source of power, whereas the other two forms of trust refer to horizontal relationships—although still not always equal, it should be noted. Interpersonal trust remains largely between kin members, friends or close neighbours, whereas social trust refers more to civic society, collective institutions and broader networks beyond the family or friends.
