<p>Social and institutional distrust are difficult to untangle from one another in 
 <italic>The Painted Veil</italic>, largely because the lines between who is the elite or authority and who is not are rather blurred. Walter brings with him ‘modern’ Western knowledge of biomedicine, but also has to operate within an arena where he is subject to the threat of violence, ceding authority to a Chinese army general in the broader context of nationalist uprisings and anti-Western sentiment against quasi-colonial occupation. The context of nationalist sentiment—already stirred up in the student protests over the perceived injustices of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 (the May Fourth Movement)—was further agitated by the anti-imperialist May Thirtieth Movement in response to the British Shanghai Municipal Police opening fire on Chinese protesters. In that kind of political background, we can understand the villagers’ deep-rooted distrust in Walter, not only as an outsider, but as someone to them representing British colonial presence within China. Local agitation is perhaps only exacerbated by other forms of ‘outsider intrusion’, such as the central presence of Catholic missionaries within the village.
