<p>Much like news reporting and social media, other forms of popular culture such as fictional novels, television shows and films can also influence people’s trust, especially given that the information provided about an epidemic disease is sometimes seen as grounded in ‘scientific fact’ by societies, even when that is not necessarily the intention of the producer, director, writer, artist or creator.
