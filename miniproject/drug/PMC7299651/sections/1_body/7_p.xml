<p>Overall, in this paper our analysis establishes and supports two arguments. First, while certain aspects of trust are badly diminished during epidemic disease outbreaks, epidemics can also interact with pre-existing structural inequalities within society—based on race, gender or wealth—to create mixed outcomes of discord, prejudice and fear that coexist with new forms of cohesion. Historical research in recent times has argued down similar lines, emphasising that social responses to epidemics going back into the past have also included empathy and compassion,

Indeed, the recent global COVID-19 pandemic has brought out a diversity of social responses from a wide spectrum—on the one hand a plethora of evidence pointing to incidents connected to discrimination, prejudice or xenophobia,

 <xref ref-type="other" rid="note25">25</xref> Second, the breakdown in trust seen at certain levels during epidemics, such as at the institutional level between communities and authorities or elites, might be mediated or negotiated, perhaps even compensated for, by heightened solidity of trust at the social level, within or between communities.
