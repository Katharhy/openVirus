<p>The Chinese herbals used to treat COVID-19 mainly included glycyrrhiza (

 <italic>Ephedra sinica</italic>), bitter almond (
 <italic>Prunus dulcis</italic> var. amara), gypsum, reed root (
 <italic>Phragmites communis</italic>), 
 <italic>Amomum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Trichosanthes</italic> (family Cucurbitaceae), and their principal function is to relieve cough and to improve immunity. This research recommended that patients should receive Kaletra
 <sup>®</sup> (a combination of antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir) very early and should also be treated by an association of Western and Chinese medicines, since Kaletra
 <sup>®</sup> and traditional Chinese medicinal plants play a significant action in the management of viral pneumonia. Further scientific research is required to discover the mechanism of Kaletra
 <sup>®</sup> and traditional Chinese medicinal plants in COVID-19 treatment.
