<p id="p0090">Currently no vaccine is available against COVID-19 infection, however vaccines or strategies used to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV can be effective. The recombinant DNA from the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV (AY278741) was administered to hamsters and mice which leaded to production of neutralizing antibodies and protection against SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The DNA was found to inactivate whole virus or live-vectored strain of SARS-CoV (AY278741) and there by significantly reduced the viral infection in animal models [

 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>]. Numerous other SARS-CoV strains are also used to develop inactivated or live-vectored vaccines that have effectively reduced the viral load in animal models. These strains include BJ01 (AY278488) [

 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], Tor2 (AY274119) [

 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], Utah (AY714217) [
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and GD01 (AY278489) [
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Moreover there are few vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 in pipeline. The Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is focusing on creating an inactivated vaccine for viruses [
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. A sample mRNA based vaccine (prepared by Stermirna Therapeutics) will be available soon [
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. GeoVax and Bravovax [
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] is working for the formation of Modified Vaccina Ankara (MVA) based vaccine while as Clover Biopharmaceuticals are developing a recombinant 2019-nCoV S protein subunit-trimer based vaccine [
