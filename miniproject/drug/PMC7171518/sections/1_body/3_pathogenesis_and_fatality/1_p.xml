In order to find out the source of the COVID-19 outbreak CDC researchers of China collected 585 environmental samples from Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, Hubei Province. They found 33 samples were SARS-CoV-2 suggested that it came from wild animals sold on the market [

Such laboratory studies revealed that virus-specific nucleic acid sequences in the sample vary from those of known human coronavirus species. The laboratory findings also showed SARS CoV-2 is identical to some of the beta (Î²) coronaviruses genera found in bats which is located in the SARS/SARS-like CoV groups [

For the conduction of next-generation sequencing from cultured isolates and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid nine inpatients were enrolled by researchers in Wuhan with viral pneumonia and without any common respiratory pathogens. The results indicated SARS-CoV-2 was more distinct from MERS-CoV (with approximately 50% sequence identity) and SARS-CoV (with approximately 79% sequence identity) than from two bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (with 87.2% sequence identity) and bat-SL-CoVZC45 (with 87.9% sequence identity) [
