<p id="p0040">The case fatality rate (CFR) of any disease is not fixed it varies with location and with time. It is reported that CFR of COVID-19 varies widely between countries ranging from 0.2 % in Germany to 7.7 % in Italy. It may not be accurate comparison of the true likelihood particularly like that of COVID-19. Since, we are not aware weather the same criterion of testing is applied between the countries or many cases are symptomatic vs asymptomatic. So for better decision making and to understand differences in CFR we need better data. However, if we are careful to acknowledge its limitations CFR can help us to understand pandemic better and what should be done to combat it.The countries having small number of confirmed cases till now are left as CFR at small sample size is not significant. As we look towards the trajectory in case of Iran on 24th of February 2020 it had 2 confirmed cases and 2 deaths an implausible CFR of 100%. As the number of cases increased into hundreds over time, its CFR dropped to the level seen in other countries. The CFR of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is represented in
