<p id="p0030">However, the volume of COVID-19-related publications increased at a significantly greater speed than that of SARS in all aspects (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a,b), associated with the extent of pandemic severity and diversification of research tools. As of 29 August 2020, there were more than 60 000 publications on journal or preprint servers [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Studies on therapeutics accumulated dramatically, and results of clinical trial results were published 6 months earlier than those in the SARS epidemic (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a,b). The initial reaction from China was represented by two remdesivir trials in early February, and quickly expanded to 5000 trials testing antiviral, anti-inflammatory and immunoglobulin therapies on a global scale [

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the US Food and Drug Administration issued authorization for its emergency use in severe COVID-19. Moreover, 95 policy-related publications for COVID-19 were found, compared to 29 for SARS (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a,b), which underscored evidence-based public health policy in the modern era. The global spread of COVID-19 brought substantial challenges to other health metrics, especially the management of other medical conditions (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a,b). In the settings of severe COVID-19 epidemics, health-care services of non-urgent ailments have been disrupted [
