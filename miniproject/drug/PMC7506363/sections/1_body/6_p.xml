<p id="p0035">We also identified 1085 COVID-19 papers in preprint platforms (bioRxiv, medRxiv, ChemRxiv and ChinaXiv) using the same search strategies (see Supplementary material, 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Appendix S1 and Fig. S3</xref>). Despite similarities in most topics, there were 2.2-fold more policy-related studies in preprints than in peer-reviewed counterparts as of late March (see Supplementary material, 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. 5</xref>), which may be explained by the motivations brought by rapid dissemination in preprints and pre-emption obtained by preprint publication for policy research based on open-source data [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Clinical observational studies were more prominent in peer-reviewed publications, reflecting the accelerated process of peer review in response to COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, worries have been proposed about the quality and reliability of these studies [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], as exemplified by the retraction of a registry analysis for hydroxycholoroquine due to concerns on veracity 13 days after publication [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].
