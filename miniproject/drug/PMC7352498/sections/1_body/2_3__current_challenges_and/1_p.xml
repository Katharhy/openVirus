<p>The incorporation of nanoscience for infectious disease treatment offers novel opportunities to overcome existing challenges of conventional drug therapies and presents therefore massive potential towards the enhanced mechanisms of action of recently accessible pharmaceuticals or the advancement of novel nano-therapeutics and diagnostics that are urgently needed in the drug resistance age. NPs/nanocarriers or nanovaccines (especially nanostructures functionalized with proper functional groups) could be effectively designed to integrate traditional antiviral features with those amendments. Such alterations are distinctive of advanced nanosystems with a high/large surface-volume ratio, ultra-small size, and the potential abilities for tailoring the surface with the multi-functionalization probability. Thus, they could be applied to interface with numerous viruses along with preventing their entrance into cells/tissues.</p>
