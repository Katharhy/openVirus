<p>Presently, the outbreak of viral respiratory infections is rampant and spreading all over the world, and researchers are urgently aiming to identify and develop suitable nanovaccines and therapeutic options including emerging nano-based options. Viruses are a small obligate intracellular parasite and are non-living outside a host cell, whose interactions with them mostly include receptor-ligand interactions; respiratory viruses, among them, represent serious threats for all demographics. Importantly, the need for drug design and discovery is prompted by inherent characteristics of viral illnesses that contain complexities in lifecycle stages, main alterations in replication dynamics, diverse stages of replication in assorted subcellular organelles or compartments, development of drug resistance, and the feasibility of latent viral infections in an inaccessible biological compartment, among others. The quick advancement of drug resistance to recently accessible treatments and the adverse health impacts owing to their protracted use has become a critical health issue. Over the last 20â€‰years, few old illnesses have re-emerged, and many new infectious disease agents, especially viruses, have appeared, with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acute respiratory infections being the leading causes of death worldwide [
