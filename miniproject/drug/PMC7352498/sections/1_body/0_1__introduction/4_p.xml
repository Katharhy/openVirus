<p>Efficient treatments against viruses are hindered by the advancement of drug resistance and non-specific targeting, particularly those associated with influenza [

 <xref rid="B20-nanomaterials-10-01072" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Indeed, the main challenges to combat such epidemic viral infections are that for several of them (especially SARS-CoV infections) there are no effective antiviral drugs or specific treatments accessible, thus designing potent drugs to combat these diseases needs to be pursued urgently. Collectively, control or prevention of the pathogenicity of viruses is probably the best and possibly only way to diminish public health challenges resulting from viral illnesses. Efforts to control these respiratory infections are focused on prevention via vaccine advancement.
