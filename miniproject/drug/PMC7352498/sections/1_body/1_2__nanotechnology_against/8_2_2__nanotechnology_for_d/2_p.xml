Although subunit and DNA/RNA vaccines have several benefits, namely higher care profile, cost effectiveness, and capability to elicit an immune response against a particular pathogen over conventional vaccines, they suffer from challenges associated with the relatively weak immunogenicity, toxicity, intrinsic instability in vivo, and the requirement for multiple administration. These include the premature degradation of a molecule and the lack of ability to translate into an immunogen (e.g., proteins/peptides, lipids). Thus, there is an increasing need to develop a novel generation of vaccine molecules that can act as a functional immunogen and an adjuvant. Indeed, novel antigen preparations, new strategies for vaccination, as well as consecutive programs of general immunization have recently contributed to improvements in the efficacy of viral vaccines, amongst which the emerging nanotechnology holds enormous promise [

Furthermore, the frequency of boost, the administration routes, and refrigeration of the vaccines are still challenges for vaccine distribution in smaller and remote villages in some countries. To overcome such hurdles of subunit and conventional vaccines, nanotechnology-based formulations, NP-based vaccine candidates, and NP-based delivery systems with numerous advantages have been recently incorporated into vaccine development (
