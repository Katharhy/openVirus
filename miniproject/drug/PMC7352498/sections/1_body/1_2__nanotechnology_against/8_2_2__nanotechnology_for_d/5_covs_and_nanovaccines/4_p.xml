<p>In one study, two kinds of vaccines for MERS-CoV were investigated, which included spike protein NPs prepared with alum adjuvant and recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 encoding the MERS-CoV spike gene (Ad5/MERS) [

These vaccines stimulated precise immunoglobulin G against MERS-CoV, although neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV were stimulated solely by homologous and heterologous prime-boost immunizations with spike protein NPs. Remarkably, the activation of Th1 cells was stimulated by immunization programs containing Ad5/MERS, but not by those containing spike protein NPs alone [

Heterologous prime-boost vaccination schedules comprising Ad5/MERS provoked concurrent Th1 and Th2 reactions, while homologous prime-boost schedules did not. Therefore, heterologous prime-boost might stimulate prolonged immune reactions against MERS-CoV due to a proper balance of Th1/Th2 responses [

However, both of these vaccination approaches could offer defense from MERS-CoV challenge in mice; a heterologous approach by priming with Ad5/MERS and boosting with spike protein NPs may be a promising and effective prophylactic approach against MERS-CoV infection [
