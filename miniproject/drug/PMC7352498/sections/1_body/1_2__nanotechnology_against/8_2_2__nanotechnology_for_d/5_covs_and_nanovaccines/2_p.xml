<p>It has been shown that the vaccination of mice with CoV S NPs could produce remarkable amounts of neutralizing antibodies against the homologous virus, although cross-protection against the heterologous virus was not provided [

It was suggested that CoV S NPs are capable of provoking precise anti-MERS- and SARS-CoV antibody responses in mice; however, this does not provide the overall anti-CoV response for protection against multiple CoVs, and further studies should be undertaken regarding nanovaccines for these purposes. Some adjuvants can be employed to accelerate the generation of neutralizing antibodies to CoV S. For example, alum and matrix M1 were employed with a remarkable increase in neutralizing antibodies (Alum: 15 fold and Matrix M1: 68 fold) over the neutralizing antibody levels generated from S NPs alone. Alum is considered as typical adjuvant employed to increase the neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV in a VLP vaccine approach [
