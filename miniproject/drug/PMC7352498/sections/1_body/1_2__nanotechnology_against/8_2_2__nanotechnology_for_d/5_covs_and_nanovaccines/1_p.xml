<p>Vaccination is generally the most cost-effective way and affordable strategy to prevent, control, and fight against infections, especially those leading to several respiratory or pulmonary diseases. To date, vaccine formulations include subunit protein antigens, live-attenuated viruses, or inactivated/killed pathogens, which can elicit an antigen-specific immune response. Conventionally, live-attenuated vaccines present a reversion risk to their pathogenic virulence under a certain immunocompromised condition, whereas inactivated vaccines mostly lead to weak immune responses. Some vaccines based on protein subunits have also been developed to overcome these problems. The formulations of these vaccines can suffer from a reduced immunogenicity, and the protection induced is largely partial. In response to these risks, it is immensely crucial to develop risk-free and effective new vaccines in conjunction with nanotechnology-driven drug delivery systems, an essential requirement to achieve desired cell-mediated immunity against specific infections. Recent vaccine development efforts have mainly focused on the CoV transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein, which extends from the viral surface and mediates host cell entry [

The receptor-binding areas of SARS-CoV S and SARS-CoV-2 S attach with similar affinities to human ACE2, thus causing the effective spread of SARS-CoV-2 in large human populations. SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein shelters a furin cleavage site at the margin of S1/S2 subunits, which distinguishes this virus from SARS-related CoVs and SARS-CoV. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer was chosen to provide a blueprint for designing vaccines and inhibitors of viral entrance. SARS-CoV S murine polyclonal antibodies effectively obstructed SARS-CoV-2 S mediated entrance in cells [
