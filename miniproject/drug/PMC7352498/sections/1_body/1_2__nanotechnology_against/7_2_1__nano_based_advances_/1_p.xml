<p>With the evident possibility of enormous outbreaks, the situation is very quickly growing more critical, and the need for the development of quick diagnostics and effective control strategies is becoming graver. The diagnostic field was boosted early in the 1980s with two main advancements, namely the birth of diverse immunoassays and the invention of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The first study on the serological detection technique of viruses with different immunoassays was described in 1970, in which a radioimmunoassay was utilized towards the detection of the Australia antigen, which was later labeled, the HBs Ag (hepatitis B surface antigen) [

Molecular techniques are comparatively more sensitive and are quicker than immunoassays and could be utilized not only in a facile form towards the manual detection of a virus but also as the embedded component of more complex systems. Despite these promising applications, most molecular means still have diverse potential limitations in accuracy, repeatability, specificity, and sensitivity, often caused by the high genetic variability of several viruses. In addition, the traditional techniques for respiratory virus detection are generally costly, time consuming, labor intensive, and require specialized laboratory equipment and expertise.
