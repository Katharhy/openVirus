<p>Nanotechnologies are presently focused on pathogenic viruses and are geared up for detection of viral infections. In this respect, gold (Au) NPs and quantum dots (QDs) have become key components in the improvement/advancement of novel nanotechnology-based detection for several respiratory viruses; Au NPs have been combined with silver staining and utilized for the detection of HPV (human papillomavirus) in a cervical carcinoma cell [

The advancements in (nano)biohybrid structures are the common methods for exploiting NPs in virus detection, which can include biomolecules (one or more) derived from viruses. Antibody (Ab), DNA, RNA, antigen, etc. are conjugated on the surface of a diversity of NP forms which enable rapid, sensitive, direct, and facile detection with unprecedented multiplexing capabilities. The surface of Au NPs can effectively serve as soft metal ions, which simply binds to a soft ligand, e.g., thiols. The novel Au NP-based detection approaches have been developed for diverse types of clinically relevant viruses with a particular focus on the Au NP biohybrid systems, virus detection targets, and assay modalities.
