<p>The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in medical samples could be accomplished by a field-effect transistor (FET)-based biosensing gadget, and its performance and efficacy was evaluated using cultured virus, antigen protein, and nasopharyngeal swab examples from COVID-19 patients (

 <xref rid="B71-nanomaterials-10-01072" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. For fabrication of the biosensor, the graphene sheets of the FET were coated with precise Ab against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein; the graphene sheets were decorated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody through 1-pyrenebutyric acid 
 <italic>N</italic>-hydroxysuccinimide ester as a probe linker. Accordingly, the produced FET tool could identify the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at concentrations of 1 fg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> in phosphate-buffered saline and 100 fg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> medical transfer vehicle. Additionally, this sensor effectively identified SARS-CoV-2 in culture (with limit of detection ~1.6 × 101 pfu mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) and medical tests (with limit of detection ~2.42 × 102 copies mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). The prepared FET biosensor showed good sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19 with no sample pretreatment or labeling, but various other materials could be investigated to improve the signal-to-noise ratio [
