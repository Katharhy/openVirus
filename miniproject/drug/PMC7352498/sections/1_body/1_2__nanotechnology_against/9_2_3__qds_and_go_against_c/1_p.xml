<p>QDs can be employed as perfect alternatives against pathogenic human CoVs infections; it is a very challenging issue, because these viruses vary biologically and can quickly change. In one investigation, the antiviral activities of seven different carbon quantum dots (CQDs) for treating human CoV HCoV-229E contagions were evaluated. The CQDs, about 10 nm in size with remarkable solubility in water, were synthesized via hydrothermal carbonization of carbon precursors, citric acid/ethylenediamine, and post-synthetic modification deploying boronic acids; concentration-dependent virus inactivation (EC50 of 52 ± 8 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) was discernible from these ensuing nanomaterials [

 <sup>−1</sup>. Suggested mechanisms revealed that the HCoV-229E entrance inhibition is possibly due to the interaction of the functional groups of the CQDs with entry receptors of HCoV-229E; additionally, the viral replication step also displayed similarly big inhibition activity (
