<p>For detection of CoVs, some innovative approaches have focused on application of QDs. As an example, chiral zirconium QDs were prepared using

The cytotoxicity of the prepared QDs was evaluated against rat brain glioma C6 cells using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The anti-infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) antibodies of CoV were linked to these QDs to produce an immuno-link at the existence of anti-IBV antibody-conjugated magneto-plasmonic NPs and the target analyte. The fluorescence characteristics of the nanohybrids (immuno-conjugated QD-magneto-plasmonic NPs) via the external magnetic field-prompted partition process provided biosensing of CoVs (detection limit being: 79.15 EID/50 Î¼L) (
