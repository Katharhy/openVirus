<p>Two kinds of passive or active targeting mechanisms are commonly possible. In a targeted nanoparticulate delivery system, passive targeting could occur because of the enhanced permeability or leakiness (causing by inflammation or malignancy) of a local vasculature, which can result in the sick section growing more accommodating to the buildup of nanotherapeutic agent. Instead, active targeting is associated with attachment of targeting ligands (e.g., antibodies, carbohydrates, peptides, proteins, etc.) to direct the nanotherapeutic entity to a specific receptor, site, or epitope. Incorporation of the nuclear localization signals on the nanocarrier in active targeted nanoparticulate delivery systems is thus desirable to enhance specificity. Active targeting is thus a significant requirement for the remediation of virus infections since numerous antiviral nanodrugs are essential to ensure they are confined at particular subcellular organelles/regions, depending on the replication stages and the (nano)drugâ€™s modes of action. Along this line, integrase inhibitors effectively prevent the strand transfer reaction of the virus lifecycle stages (e.g., HIV integrase, which is responsible for the attachment of viral DNA into host/cell chromosomes) [
