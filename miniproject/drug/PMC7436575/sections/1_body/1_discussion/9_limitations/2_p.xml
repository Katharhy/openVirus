<p>As the intracoronary imaging test was not performed (OCT‚ÄêIVUS), the limitations of this report is the lack of clear information about the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the RCA thrombosis. Furthermore, as the autopsy was not performed, we assume that fatal outcome was due to a combination of severe oxygen desaturation, acute ischemic heart failure, and consequent severe acidosis. However, we cannot exclude concomitant pulmonary thromboembolism or thrombosis of other organs as precipitating factors of cardiac arrest.</p>
