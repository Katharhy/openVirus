<p>On the 20th of March 2020, a 60‐year‐old man with a 7‐day history of fever, cough, and radiological diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia was transferred from another hospital to our institution. The patient claimed he had been previously in contact with a colleague positive to COVID‐19. A nasopharyngeal swab for COVID‐19 detection was collected, and after 48 hr the test result confirmed the active infection.</p>
