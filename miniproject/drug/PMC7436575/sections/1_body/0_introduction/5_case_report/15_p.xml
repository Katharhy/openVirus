<p>Angiography showed a high grade thrombus burden diffused in all RCA extensions (Figure 
 <xref rid="ccd29179-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). We decide to proceed with manual thrombus aspiration, as first strategy, using a 6 Fr Eliminate aspiration catheter (Terumo Medical) without achieving any effective recanalization. Images of diffuse intracoronary thrombosis with persistent TIMI 0–1 flow was documented. Eptifibatide 180 μg/kg IV bolus was given, followed by continuous infusion of 2 μg/kg/min; the ACT value was 304 s; after some minutes we administered a second eptifibatide 180 μg/kg intracoronary bolus through the tip of Eliminate aspiration catheter, placed in distal RCA.
