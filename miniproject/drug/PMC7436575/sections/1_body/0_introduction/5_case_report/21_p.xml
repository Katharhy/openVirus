<p>After 3 hr, the patient developed significant oxygen desaturation (SpO
 <sub>2</sub> 70%), dyspnea, and psychomotor agitation during C‐PAP; the vital signs were PA 100/60 mmHg; HR 90 bpm; the ECG was unchanged (persistent inferolateral ST elevation). Endotracheal intubation with rapid sequence induction and invasive ventilation was immediately performed. The clinical condition evolved after 15 min in severe hemodynamic instability, hypotension, wide QRS, and cardiac arrest for pulseless electric activity (PEA); the advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers were immediately started according with advanced cardiopulmonary life support (ACLS) algorithm and were prolonged for more than 30 min without return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).
