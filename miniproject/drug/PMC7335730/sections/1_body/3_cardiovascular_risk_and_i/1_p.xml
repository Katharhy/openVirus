<p id="Par15">In the twentieth century during influenza epidemics, there has been an excess of mortality from cardiovascular disease [

A recent study that included 364 hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction demonstrated an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction within one week after influenza virus infection to a risk that was six times higher than the risk during the year before or after the onset of infection [

Cardiovascular complications associated with influenza infection include myocarditis, pericardial effusion, myopericarditis, right and left ventricle dysfunction, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and circulatory failure due to septic shock [
