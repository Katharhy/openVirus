<p id="Par20">Type 2 myocardial infarction might be considered with a rise and/or fall of cardiac troponin values and evidence of an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand unrelated to coronary thrombosis. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Influenza infection produces a systemic inflammatory response with a resulting increase in heart rate and shortens the filling time during diastole compromising in that way, the coronary blood supply. If septic shock occurs, it may have a substantial adverse effect on coronary perfusion. In older patients with chronic coronary plaques, systemic inflammation causes cardiac metabolic mismatch increasing the risk of myocardial infarction [
