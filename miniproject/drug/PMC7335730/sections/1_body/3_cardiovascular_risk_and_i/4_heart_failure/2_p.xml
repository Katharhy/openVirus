<p id="Par22">In a healthy heart, severe acute influenza infection produces pro-inflammatory cytokine level elevations that can cause acute myocarditis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], characterized by a broad spectrum of symptoms that go from asymptomatic courses to signs of myocardial infarction to devastating illness with cardiogenic shock [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Myocarditis often results from common viral infections and post-viral immune-mediated responses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In acute myocarditis, there is a high incidence of wall motion abnormalities. During influenza epidemics, 15% of the patients admitted to a military hospital with influenza infection had wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This becomes important, due to the fact that the myocardium inflammatory disease is regarded as a precursor of dilated cardiomyopathy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The electrocardiographic findings in patients with myocarditis range from nonspecific T-wave and ST segment changes to ST segment elevation resembling an acute myocardial infarction; supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias can also be present. Electrocardiographic findings that are related to poor clinical outcome include a QTc prolongation at 440Â ms, an abnormal QRS axis, and ventricular ectopic beats [
