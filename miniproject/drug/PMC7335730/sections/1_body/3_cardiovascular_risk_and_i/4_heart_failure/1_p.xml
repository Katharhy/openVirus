<p id="Par21">Influenza infection is also associated with increased mortality in patients with heart failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and is vulnerable to influenza-associated complications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This type of patients has limited cardiac and respiratory reserves and may not tolerate the metabolic demand and hypoxemia, exacerbating underlying cardiac disease probably due to an increased sympathetic nervous system activity, hypoxemia, and renal dysfunction that can lead to volume overload [
