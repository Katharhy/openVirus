<p id="Par23">A recent study developed to evaluate the incidence and hemodynamic consequences of right ventricular and left ventricular dysfunction in patients with H1N1 infection demonstrated that on admission 72% had abnormal ventricular function (46% had isolated left ventricular abnormalities and 39% had isolated right ventricular dysfunction) and 14% had biventricular dysfunction. On the follow-up, right ventricular function tended to worsen during hospitalization, but left ventricular function tended to normalize. However, patients with ventricular dysfunction needed more aggressive therapy and of rescue ventilatory strategies, such as inhaled nitric oxide, prone positioning, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [
