 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Protein C pathway and endogenous fibrinolysis are mechanisms associated with cerebrovascular ischemia and influenza infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Influenza infection develops a prothrombotic state by increasing tissue factor expression and decreases fibrinolytic capacity by increased plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression. This results in an unbalance between coagulation and anticoagulant pathways [
