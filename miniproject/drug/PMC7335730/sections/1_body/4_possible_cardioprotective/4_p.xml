<p id="Par29">There have been described two possible mechanisms by which influenza vaccination may reduce cardiovascular events: unspecific and specific effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The 
 <italic>unspecific mechanism</italic> is based on the fact that influenza infection causes a systemic inflammatory response, endothelial dysfunction, and a procoagulant state. These factors have negative effects on patients with previous cardiovascular diseases, such as ischemic heart disease and heart failure, causing acute heart failure, pulmonary edema, or destabilization of chronic ischemic heart disease, leading to myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Influenza vaccination reduces the risk of infection and inflammation by decreasing the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines (that cause reduced myocardial contractility) and metalloproteinases (that cause adverse cardiac remodeling and plaque rupture); influenza vaccination also causes inhibition of platelet activation and cloth formation [
