 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], increased disease severity, morbidity, and mortality during lower respiratory tract infections. This might be explained in part by increased lung permeability during infection, found in mice studies. Obese mice have an increased protein leakage from the lung into the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid when compared to lean mice. Additionally, lung edema and oxidative stress are also increased, which emphasizes the multiple etiologies of increased lung pathology in the obese host and the impairment in wound repair [
