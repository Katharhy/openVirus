<p id="Par6">It is well known that influenza A virus infection is characterized by fever, myalgia, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and sneezing. These symptoms peak 3–5 days post-infection, with viral shedding peaking at days 2–3. Usually, it is limited to the upper respiratory tract; however, in severe cases, the lower respiratory tract, including the lungs, can be affected and often requires hospitalization. This progression is more common in obese patients, leading to diminish infection resolution when compared with non-obese patients [
