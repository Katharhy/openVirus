<p id="Par8">The obesogenic state can also affect the influenza A virus evolution. It is well known that obese individuals are malnourished besides their excess in fat; they might also present nutrient deficiencies, such as vitamins [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. There are a variety of mechanisms by which nutritional imbalances could alter within-host viral evolution [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Studies have shown that such imbalances prolong infections, delay clearance, and increase shedding (42% longer than non-obese) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], all of which potentially increase viral transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].
