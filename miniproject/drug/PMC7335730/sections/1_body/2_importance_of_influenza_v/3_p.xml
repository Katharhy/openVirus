<p id="Par12">The efficacy of the vaccine in human groups has shown that initial seroconversion rates are high in the obese population, but that over time there is a greater decrease in efficacy than that observed in non-obese populations [

A study conducted in 2013–2015 aimed at evaluating whether obesity was associated with an increased risk of influenza for influenza and influenza-like illness among vaccinated obese and non-obese adults, finding that, among the obese, 9.8% had confirmed influenza or influenza-like illness compared with 5.1% of healthy weight participants. Compared with the vaccinated healthy weight, obese participants had twice the risk of developing influenza or influenza-like illness (relative risk = 2.01, 95% CI 1.12, 3.60,
