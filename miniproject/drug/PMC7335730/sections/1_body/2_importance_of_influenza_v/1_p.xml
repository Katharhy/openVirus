<p id="Par10">Obesity causes a chronic state of inflammation in a generalized and constant way with negative effects on immunity. Obese people have delayed immune responses to influenza virus infection and experience slower recovery from the disease. In addition, the efficacy of the treatment and the vaccine is reduced in this population causing an alteration of the viral life cycle and, coupled with an already weakened and delayed immune response, leading to a more serious condition. Poor initial and adaptive responses to infection and vaccination create an impaired ability to respond appropriately to infection. The efficacy of the vaccine may decrease in obese humans; however, more studies are needed to better understand how the obese state affects infection control [
