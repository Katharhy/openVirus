<p id="Par34">While influenza vaccination is associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality risk in patients with heart failure, this cardioprotective mechanism may not function as intended in the obese population since they do not always respond optimally to vaccination. Therefore, in an effort to prevent these complications and in the absence of special consideration treatments for this population, we strongly suggest a weight-loss approach. Future studies should focus on developing targeted treatments that can combat the reduced immunocompetence that excess adiposity causes to the patient.</p>
