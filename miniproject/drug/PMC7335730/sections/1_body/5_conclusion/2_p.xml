<p id="Par33">Cardiovascular diseases, such as ischemic heart disease and heart failure combined with influenza A infection, can trigger acute heart failure exacerbations that increase the overall mortality in a hospitalized setting. Cardiovascular complications associated with influenza infection include myocarditis, pericardial effusion, myopericarditis, right and left ventricle dysfunction, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and circulatory failure due to septic shock. There have been described several mechanisms by which influenza increases the risk of cardiovascular events; they might be related to pro-inflammatory mediators, sympathetic stimulation, and activation of the coagulation cascade.</p>
