  <p>Architecture of the mucosal epithelial barrier in the respiratory and intestinal tracts that guards against viral invasion. (
   <bold>A</bold>). The airway epithelium is composed of ciliated cells, goblet cells, basal cells, and Clara cells. The mucus on the epithelial surface is the first barrier against human infection by coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the novel emerging coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The mucins secreted by goblet cells on the epithelial surface include two layers, a viscous layer on top and a periciliary layer below. The innate immune cells in the submucosal layer such as dendritic cells and macrophages are involved in controlling viral infection. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Enteric coronaviruses, such as PEDV and PDCoV, principally infect swine by causing histopathological lesions in the intestinal tract. In spite of their similar histological structures, there are substantial differences in the functional purposes and internal environments of the gut and respiratory tract. The mucus of the intestinal tract mainly consists of MUC2 mucin, antimicrobial peptides, and secreted IgA (sIgA) produced by goblet cells, Paneth cells, and plasma cells, respectively. In particular, the commensal bacterial communities resident in the mucus of the gut are involved in various physiological processes that modulate the homeostasis of mucosal immunity. In addition, the intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) are located between intestinal epithelial cells, and these cells constitute a large and highly conserved T cell compartment. Intestinal microfold cells (M cells) are only found in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) of Peyerâ€™s patches in the intestinal tract, and they are unique antigen-presenting cells that are important for the initiation of mucosal immune responses. The diverse immune cells reside in the 
   <italic>lamina propria</italic> and mainly include B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. These immune cells interact with the epithelium to detect invading pathogens.
