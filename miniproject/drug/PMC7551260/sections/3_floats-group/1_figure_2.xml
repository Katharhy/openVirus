  <p>Schematic diagram of the antiviral immune response and evasion mechanism of coronaviruses. Coronaviruses are internalized into susceptible target cells by the fusion of viral and cellular membranes with unique receptors, such as ACE2, DPP4, and APN, and the RNA of the viral genome is released into the cytosol. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 exploit the serine protease TMPRSS2 for spike protein priming. The virion and the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of coronavirus can be recognized by immune sensors called pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytoplasm retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG) type I like receptors (RLRs) (RIG-I/MDA5). The extracellular membrane of TLRs (TLR2/4) and endosome TLRs (TLR3/7/8) are widely expressed in epithelial cells and dendritic cells. The PAMPs of coronaviruses induce the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway for antiviral innate immune responses. RIG-I/MDA5 conveys signals through mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), while TLRs signal through TIR-containing adapter protein inducing IFN-β/myeloid differentiation factor 88 (TRIF/MyD88). TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) activates tank-binding kinase 1/IκB kinase epsilon (TBK1/IKKε), while TRAF6 signal transduction requires activation of the IKK complex. Activated transcription factors are translocated into the nucleus to promote Type I and III IFN expression. IFNs are secreted into the extracellular space and bound to their cognate receptors IFNAR and IFNLR (IFNLR1 and IL10Rβ) to activate downstream the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling, followed by nuclear localization of the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex and expression of numerous interferon stimulating genes (ISGs), leading to the establishment of an antiviral state. Suppression of IFN signal pathways by coronaviruses and their antagonists is shown in red boxes. S, severe acute respiratory symptom coronavirus (SARS-CoV); M, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV); P, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV); PD, porcine Deltacoronavirus (PDCoV); ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; DPP4, dipeptidyl peptidase-4; APN, aminopeptidase N; TMPRSS2, transmembrane serine protease 2.</p>
