<p>The mucus gel forms a continuous layer on the mucosal epithelial surface of the respiratory and intestinal tracts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01039-f001">Figure 1</xref>) and provides an essential first defense barrier against aggressive luminal factors and pathogens [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Mucins secreted by goblet cells are the main component of airway/intestinal mucus. Respiratory mucus can be divided into two discreet layers, a viscous layer on top and a periciliary layer (PCL) below. The viscous layer comprises the secreted mucins 
 <italic>MUC5AC</italic> and 
 <italic>MUC5B</italic>, whereas the PCL contains membrane-tethered mucins such as 
 <italic>MUC1</italic>, 
 <italic>MUC4</italic>, and 
 <italic>MUC16</italic> [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Mucins are mainly glycoproteins. Specifically, the membrane-tethered mucins are characterized by a large glycosylated extracellular domain that possibly provides binding sites for potential pathogens and a cytoplasmic tail that may induce signaling cascades [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that 
 <italic>MUC5AC</italic> and 
 <italic>MUC1</italic> are key, dynamic components of innate immunity that limit the severity of influenza virus infection, suggesting that mucins are an essential defense barrier against virus invasion [

 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Interestingly, sialic acid is a key oligosaccharide component of mucin, and previous studies have indicated that influenza virus, as well as some coronaviruses such as BCoV and MERS-CoV, could interact with different sialic acid residues to modulate the infection efficiency [

 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Moreover, the number of goblet cells was shown to be depleted or significantly decreased in the small intestine during the early phase of PEDV infection [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], but studies focused on the interplay between different phenotypes of mucins and animal coronaviruses are still lacking. Whether the glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 can interact with the extracellular domain of cell-surface mucins also needs to be experimentally elucidated.
