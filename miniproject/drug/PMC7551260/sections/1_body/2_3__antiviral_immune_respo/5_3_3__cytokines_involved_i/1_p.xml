<p>The epithelium and immune cells in the respiratory and intestinal tracts detect the invading virus via innate immune sensors and trigger a series of well-coordinated immune responses, leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and ISGs, which protect the host cells from viral infection during the early phase. However, patients with severe disease who are infected with highly pathogenic viruses, such as influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2, normally have a dysfunctional proinflammatory response, leading to a cytokine storm and immunopathological changes [
