<p>IFNs are crucial cytokines in antiviral host defenses [
 <xref rid="B62-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Type Ι IFNs can be expressed in many diverse cell types, whereas type III IFNs are mainly produced in epithelial cells and dendritic cells [
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Recently, it has become clear that despite the similarities between type Ι IFN and type III IFN signaling cascades, type III IFNs seem to specifically protect the epithelial cells from pathogen attacks and form a local special defense in the early stage of attack [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. When the first activation of the IFN-λ machinery only weakly disseminates the locally invading virus, the type Ι IFN apparatus is mobilized to mediate a systemic antiviral immune response [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. However, highly contagious coronaviruses have developed strategies to block IFN signaling. For instance, SARS-CoV can efficiently suppress IFN expression by its structural and nonstructural proteins, which has been shown to prevent the innate response of IFNs in cultured cells or SARS patients [

 <xref rid="B67-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Inadequate or delayed IFN responses may explain the progressive increase in viral replication and immunopathology in SARS patients [
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. However, some studies have indicated that SARS-CoV-2 initiates a robust IFN response in patients compared with SARS-CoV cases [

 <xref rid="B69-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Indeed, IFN-α/β and IFN-λ have been recommended as potential therapeutic drugs to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="B71-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,
 <xref rid="B72-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Notably, excessive and prolonged IFN expression might lead to deleterious proinflammatory responses and may aggravate viral infection by disrupting the lung epithelial barrier [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, the dose, frequency, and duration of IFN therapy should be considered carefully before use in clinical practice against viral infection.
