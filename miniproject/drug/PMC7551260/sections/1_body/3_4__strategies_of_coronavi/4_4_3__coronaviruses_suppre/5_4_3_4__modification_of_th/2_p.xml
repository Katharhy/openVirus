<p>Moreover, coronavirus proteins, such as S, nsp1, 3, 5, and 16 can suppress IFN expression, as mentioned above, and other nonstructural proteins also have multiple enzymatic functions that might impede IFN signaling, including superfamily-1 helicase activity (HEL1, nsp13), exoribonuclease activity (ExoN homolog, nsp14), and endoribonuclease activity (XendoU homolog, nsp15) [
