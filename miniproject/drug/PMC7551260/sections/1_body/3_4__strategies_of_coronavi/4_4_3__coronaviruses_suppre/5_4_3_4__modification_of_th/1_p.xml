<p>Eukaryote cells assemble their mRNAs through a translation apparatus, and the 5′terminus structures of host RNA are normally modified with N7-methylation and 2′-O-methylation using enzymes during the transcription process. Viral RNAs without a 5′cap structure or methylation should be recognized by innate immune sensors [
 <xref rid="B115-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. RNA viruses have evolved with quite diverse mechanisms to achieve protection from the immune recognition system. Coronaviruses can produce mRNA with cap-structures themselves by enzymatic functions in their polymerase complexes [
 <xref rid="B116-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that coronaviruses contain at least three capping enzymes in their polymerase complexes, including RNA triphosphatase encoded in nsp13 (NTPase helicase), N7 methyltransferase (N7-MTase) encoded in nsp14, and 2′-O-methyltransferase (2′-O-MTase) encoded in nsp16 [
 <xref rid="B117-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. These enzymes provide viral RNA equipped with 2′-O-methylation or N7-methylation, which gives them similar cap-structures to the host cell mRNA and subsequently suppresses the activation of TLR3/TRIF and RIG/MDA5/IPS-1 signal pathways [
 <xref rid="B118-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. The 2′-O-methylation of 5′cap modification can circumvent antiviral innate responses via evasion of IFIT-mediated suppression [
 <xref rid="B119-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Consistently, PEDV nsp16 inhibits the expression of the 
 <italic>IFIT1</italic>, 
 <italic>IFIT2</italic>, and 
 <italic>IFIT3</italic> genes [
 <xref rid="B120-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>], which might be associated with the 2′-O-methylation modification of nsp16.
