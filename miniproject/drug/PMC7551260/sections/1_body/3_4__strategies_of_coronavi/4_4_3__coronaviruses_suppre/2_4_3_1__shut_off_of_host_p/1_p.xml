<p>Some viruses and their protein components can halt cellular protein expression in the host and simultaneously utilize the cellular translation apparatus for their use. Coronaviruses use a combined method to inhibit host protein synthesis at the levels of transcription and translation. Nsp1 is the 5′-terminal subunit for the replication of polyproteins in coronaviruses [
 <xref rid="B98-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>], and it is one of the most divergent genes among the four different coronavirus genera. Only the genomes of Alpha and Betacoronaviruses encode nsp1, and the genomes of Gammacoronaviruses and Deltacoronaviruses lack the nsp1 gene. Specifically, the nsp1 gene of Betacoronaviruses is much larger than that of Alphacoronaviruses [

 <xref rid="B99-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Coronavirus nsp1 could bind to the cellular molecules of the translation apparatus and prevent the translation of host mRNAs. For example, SARS-CoV nsp1 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm and directly binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit of ribosomes, resulting in inhibition of the protein and translation of host mRNA [
 <xref rid="B100-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. However, nsp1 of MERS-CoV is distributed in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm and targets the translational competence of host mRNAs selectively for inhibition and degradation [
 <xref rid="B101-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Nsp1 of PEDV, the enteric coronavirus, can degrade the cAMP responsive element binding (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) by the proteasome, thus preventing the formation of IRF3 and the CBP enhancer complex and, consequently, resulting in inhibition of IFN-β production [
