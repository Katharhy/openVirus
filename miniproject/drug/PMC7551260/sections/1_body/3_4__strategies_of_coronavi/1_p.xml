<p>Coronaviruses are well known to circumvent the innate immune response, particularly during the early phase of infection. It has been shown that IFN production can barely be detected during the first hours of infection, which greatly facilitates the establishment of productive viral replication [

 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Coronaviruses employ multiple strategies to evade the host’s innate immune response, for instance, hijack of the antigen-presenting cells, formation of a replication organelle for RNA synthesis, modification at the 5′end with 2′-O methylation of viral RNA, and inhibition of IFN signaling cascades.
