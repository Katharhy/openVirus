<p>However, the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and its interactions with its host are poorly understood. Currently, no vaccines or specific drugs have been approved to prevent or treat COVID-19. It is well-known that the highly pathogenic coronaviruses can delay IFN production during the early phase of viral infection and induce hyperactive inflammatory responses in the advanced stages, which leads to the pathogenesis of these viruses. Therefore, it is very important to investigate the immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, particularly the coronavirusâˆ’host interaction and its pathogenesis. Novel three-dimensional models of tissue organoids are close to the real scenario in the respiratory and intestinal tracts and can be applied in vitro instead of as a single-cell culture model. Moreover, integrated multiomics analysis, including single-cell RNA sequencing, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, metabolomics, and other new techniques, may provide new methods that give a comprehensive understanding of the interaction of pathogens with their hosts and the microbiota.</p>
