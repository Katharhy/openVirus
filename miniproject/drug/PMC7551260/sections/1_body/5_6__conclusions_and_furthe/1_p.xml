<p>In summary, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, PEDV, and PDCoV are coronaviruses that have caused pandemic diseases in humans and animals, resulting in severe public health concerns and large economic losses. These coronaviruses are typical strains that can infect mammals and cause illnesses associated with their vial tropism in the respiratory tract and/or intestinal tract. A myriad of epithelial cells and innate immune cells exert a set of robust antiviral defenses as part of the sophisticated mucosal innate immunity through cellular responses, of which IFNs and ISGs are the most fundamental molecules involved in innate immunity against coronavirus infection. However, coronaviruses are the largest types of RNA virus and have evolved with tricky strategies to evade innate immune surveillance, such as hijacking the antigen-presenting cells, shielding RNA intermediates in the replication organelle, and inhibiting the IFN signal pathway. The evasion strategies on the spike glycoprotein, nsp3 protease of PLpro, and nsp5 protease of 3CLpro of the novel SARS-COV-2 might be appealing targets for the development of antiviral agents and vaccines.</p>
