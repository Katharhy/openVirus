<p>The envelope spike (S) protein of coronavirus is a large transmembrane glycoprotein that is involved in receptor binding, membrane fusion, and entry into the host cells. The S protein interacts with unique receptors in susceptible target cells of the host species and presents distinct viral tissue tropism [

Coronaviruses infecting mammalian animals principally cause histopathological lesions in the intestinal and respiratory tracts, but in some cases, they cause central neurologic illness and hepatitis. In humans, coronaviruses have been proven to be mainly associated with respiratory illnesses [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Specifically, the mouse hepatitis coronavirus and feline coronavirus can cause pneumonia and gastrointestinal infections as well as hepatitis and neurologic disorders. It has been indicated that the surface angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is required for host cell entry of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses [

 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], whereas aminopeptidase N (APN) is the functional receptor for the entry of enteric coronaviruses, such as PEDV and PDCoV [

 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Besides the ACE2 receptor, the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) has been shown to activate the S protein for membrane fusion in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Notably, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are also highly expressed in the small intestine of the gut [

 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. More than 60% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 present with intestinal disorders such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, particularly those present with severe clinical disease. Thus, it has been suggested that the digestive system is a potential route for SARS-CoV-2 infection [
