<p>Regarding contribution to the broad health system response to COVID-19, the survey results show that more than seven-in-ten of all trained prior to the COVID-19 pandemic are currently involved in a range of health system areas. These areas include: critical preparedness and response, situation analysis/surveillance, infection control and clinical management, data generation, analysis and reporting, and mitigating the effect of COVID-19 on other diseases. The research training has thus had wider benefits going beyond research, to provide generic skills that can be applied to a range of areas needed to tackle the pandemic. Limitations of this study are that we had no comparison group and we are unable to know the influence of non-response and social desirability bias. The extent and quality of contribution to the COVID response could also not be clearly defined.</p>
