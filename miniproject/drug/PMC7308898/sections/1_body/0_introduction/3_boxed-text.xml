  <bold>Postgraduate Training Scheme:</bold> TDR strengthens individual and institutional capacity for implementation research by supporting a network of seven universities in disease-endemic regions to train Masterâ€™s students on courses relevant to implementation research.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Clinical Research and Development Fellowship (CRDF) scheme:</bold> TDR supports placements of researchers with relevant partners (including pharmaceutical companies, product development partnerships, and public research institutions involved in clinical research) to strengthen their skills in clinical trials. The scheme started in 1999 with a small number of fellows and was scaled up in 2008 and 2014, with the support of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (Gates Foundation) and in partnership with the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers &amp; Associations (IFPMA).
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Structured Operational Research Training Programme (SORT IT):</bold> TDR coordinates a global partnership-based initiative to support countries and institutions to build sustainable operational research capacity. The target audience is front-line health workers from disease control programmes. The focus of training is on teaching practical skills for the generation of high quality, timely and disaggregated data for evidence-informed decision-making to improve public health.
