 </sup>. “The next epidemic” is happening now in 2020 and is the COVID-19 pandemic. This pandemic, of unprecedented global scale and impact, has tested the preparedness and resilience of every country. Among the many factors that contribute to preparedness and resilience, the capacity to undertake health research is a vital component of the response to infectious disease outbreaks. As we have seen from the current pandemic, all countries are at risk of infectious disease outbreaks and need to strengthen their capacity for a timely and effective research response. Capacity to undertake research varies widely among countries, reflecting the extent of investment and efforts to build and retain that capacity, usually over a long period of time. TDR, The Special Programme for Research and Training hosted at the World Health Organization (WHO), has long supported Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) in strengthening research capacity, through the range of activities needed to develop the necessary institutional base, research infrastructure, training programmes, career development pathways, research portfolio, regulatory frameworks and networks.
