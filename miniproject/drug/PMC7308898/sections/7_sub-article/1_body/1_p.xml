<p> A few points to address:

   <p>For the specific question, “what percent of trainees are currently using skills from training in COVID-19 response?” The more accurate denominator for this is all reporting trainees. To say that 77% of trainees are using skills for COVID response, when only 315 out of 699 reported as such, is not accurate. The authors clarify in the table with a footnote, but either they need to add a clause of: Of the 59% working on COVID-19 response, 77% report using their skills as part of that response. Or they need to recalculate and say that 45% report using their skills for the COVID-19 response. This is true for overall and by training type reports and should be reflected in the abstract and main text.</p>

   <p>Can the authors include reporting by gender and a short discussion? There has been expressed concern about how COVID response has been gendered, specifically with working women being excluded from participating in response either because of systemic issues or through home demands. I would be interested to see if this is an issue with trainees.</p>

   <p>Please add a statement about any influence of non-response and desirability bias.</p>
