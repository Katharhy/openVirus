 <bold>Reviewer:</bold> Can the authors include reporting by gender and a short discussion? There has been expressed concern about how COVID response has been gendered, specifically with working women being excluded from participating in response either because of systemic issues or through home demands. I would be interested to see if this is an issue with trainees.
