 <bold>Reviewer: </bold>The authors clarify in the table with a footnote, but either they need to add a clause of: Of the 59% working on COVID-19 response, 77% report using their skills as part of that response.

This is true for overall and by training type reports and should be reflected in the abstract and main text.
