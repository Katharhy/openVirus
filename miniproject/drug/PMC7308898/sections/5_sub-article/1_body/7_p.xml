<p> The survey used a pre-tested questionnaire to collect data, and necessary changes were made to the questionnaire accordingly. Further to this, I would like the following points to be considered: 
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>Study design, only mentioned in the title.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>A few statements on how items in each questionnaire were developed, for example, whether benchmarked/adopted/modified, or what ways had been followed otherwise in developing them.   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Were validity and reliability tests performed on the questionnaire in addition to pre-test so that assuring quality?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>How data were summarized and analysed? Were there any missing data reported, given the low response rate (56%) obtained for the survey, how authors took control of these while analysing the data?</p>
  </list-item>
 </list>
