 <bold>Reviewer: </bold>Some limitations of interpretation of the data could be highlighted in a short paragraph in the discussion, such as: There is no group for comparison that represents the numbers (%) of those not trained who are involved in some way in the COVID response. Could responders represent a biased sample, by nature of actively participating in this evaluation? The total numbers of past trainees involved may not be as high as “seven-in-ten”. The extent and quality of contribution to the COVID response is not clearly defined
