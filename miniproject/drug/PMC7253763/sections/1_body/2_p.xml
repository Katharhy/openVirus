<p>Second, most data regarding bacterial and fungal respiratory co- and superinfections in the context of a viral respiratory pandemic are derived from previous influenza pandemics,

 </sup> In any case, bacterial and fungal respiratory co- and superinfections during large outbreaks of viral respiratory illnesses are probably underdiagnosed due to a shortage of trained healthcare personnel and/or supplies, infection control requirements, high workload, and the emergent nature of the primary viral disease that make the diagnosis complex and laborious. Data from the current COVID-19 pandemic, in accordance with previous coronavirus epidemics, show that the rate of bacterial and fungal co- or superinfection is relative low, but the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials is very common.

 </sup> Specifically, in the current literature, bacterial and fungal co- and superinfections have been reported in 8% of COVID-19 cases, while 72% of these patients received broad-spectrum antibacterials.
