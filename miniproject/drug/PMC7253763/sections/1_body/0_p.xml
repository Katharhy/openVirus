 <italic>To the Editor</italic>—Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently in the spotlight, attracting all the attention of the world’s medical community. Meanwhile, other longer-term public health issues, such as antimicrobial resistance caused by misuse and/or overuse of antimicrobials, may have been relegated to the shadows. At this stage of the pandemic, and under the pressure caused by the absence of specific antivirals and vaccines, antimicrobials are being used in several ways.

 </sup> First, they are being repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19, as it is happening with the combination of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine.

 </sup> In addition, antimicrobials are being used as empirical coverage for possible coexisting community-acquired infection of the respiratory tract, especially in severe cases of COVID-19. They are also being used as empirical coverage for possible hospital-acquired superinfection of the respiratory tract, taking into account that a significant proportion of COVID-19 hospitalized patients will have prolonged hospitalizations or will require intensive care unit admission. Furthermore, antimicrobials are being prescribed for the targeted treatment of community or hospital-acquired respiratory tract co- or superinfections. Finally, antimicrobials are being used in empirical or targeted treatment for co- or superinfection outside the respiratory tract.
