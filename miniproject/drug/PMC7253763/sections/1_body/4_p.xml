<p>Antimicrobial stewardship programs are imperative components of a successful response to COVID-19, and interventions to support the optimal use of antimicrobials are urgently needed. Until results from further research emerge and stronger evidence is available, the following antimicrobial stewardship strategies should be implemented: 
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>Antimicrobials should be used empirically only for severely ill COVID-19 patients, with regular reassessment of their necessity and monitoring of possible side effects.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Empirical antimicrobial treatment must be always guided by the source of infection acquisition, local patterns of antimicrobial resistance, host factors, and concurrent drugs. However, clinicians should consider that local patterns of resistance may change during pandemics and that patient’s physiology becomes extremely altered in severe cases of COVID-19.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Short courses of antimicrobials and early intravenous-to-oral switch whenever possible are desired; these strategies will also contribute to decreasing nurse workload and to maintaining bed capacity.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Culture-based testing should be carried out before antimicrobials are initiated to maximize the likelihood of identifying a pathogen.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Culture-independent techniques (eg, polymerase chain reaction or loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay) are highly important in diagnosing bacterial and fungal co- and superinfections or other viral infections during the course of COVID-19. They must be used whenever they are indicated, for example, in COVID-19 patients with severe presentation or those whose condition worsens after initial improvement.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Procalcitonin measurements can be an important tool to reduce use of antimicrobials, but procalcitonin’s suboptimal specificity must always be considered because increased levels may occur in advanced stages of COVID-19 without proven bacterial co- or superinfection.

    </sup> C-reactive protein is elevated in most COVID-19 cases, and it cannot predict bacterial or fungal co- or superinfection.

   <p>Chest computed-tomography may reveal typical features of COVID-19, that is, solely ground-glass opacities, which are not common in bacterial pneumonia; therefore, such findings can help avoid antimicrobial use.</p>
