    "Highlights • Discussed economic impact of water utilities and COVID-19 health impacts on workforce.• Presented case studies on preparedness and response to COVID-19 by utilities.• Reviewed alternate resiliency strategies for response during and after outbreaks. Recent outbreaks have constantly disrupted our global economy and public health in numerous ways, impacting efficiency and prosperity across all sectors. This article focuses on the impacts of outbreaks (epidemics and pandemics) on the water - wastewater utilities and infrastructure and critically evaluates the issues underlining their economic development impact and highlights the need for preparedness. A perspective on water infrastructure and industry-related impact on our society and economic development in the wake of the pandemic, COVID-19, is provided. Methods that could institute safe, reliable, and efficient procedures for better preparedness and rapid recovery have been explored at length. The purpose of this article is threefold: 1) to discuss the economic and public health impact of water and wastewater utilities and the utility workforce; 2) to present case studies demonstrating utilities' preparedness and response to COVID-19, and 3) review various alternatives for education and training as well as innovative processes and strategies for productivity during and after outbreaks. Strategies discussed in this article could be used as valuable resources for developing resiliency efforts, especially from the context of continuing water and wastewater utility operations and services in emergencies."
