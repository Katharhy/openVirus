<p id="Par33">The NA H275Y substitution and some HA or NA substitutions in drug-resistant A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses isolated from immunocompromised patients influence both antigenicity and NAI resistance. The viruses showed highly reduced inhibition, with over 100-fold increases in the IC
 <sub>50</sub> for oseltamivir and peramivir, but not zanamivir. Thus, zanamivir might be an option for immunocompromised patients when oseltamivir and peramivir are not effective. These findings also indicate the necessity of monitoring for NAI-resistant viruses in outpatients visiting clinics and in-patients, particularly for immunocompromised patients (e.g., with severe acute respiratory syndromes in general hospitals). Additionally, virus characterization can facilitate the risk assessment of NAI viruses.
