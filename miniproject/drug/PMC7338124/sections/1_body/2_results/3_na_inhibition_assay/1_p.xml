<p id="Par28">A/Korea/S0003/2019 and A/Korea/S0002/2019 viruses exhibited significantly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and peramivir with &gt; 100 IC
 <sub>50</sub> fold-changes relative to drug-sensitive virus, but were normally susceptible to zanamivir (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). However, every isolate collected from the KINRESS in 2018–2019 was susceptible to all three drugs.
