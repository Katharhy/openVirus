<p id="Par32">Mutations suspected to represent antigenic drift in immunocompromised patients were more likely to be observed in NA than HA, albeit at a very low frequency (around 1%). However, the NA mutations did not affect antigenic properties, besides drug resistance. Although the HA N158D substitution increases the binding affinity of H5N1 avian influenza virus and human receptor (α2–6-linked sialoside) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], the function of the A/Korea/S0002/2019 HA A158E substitution functionality remains unknown (but it was not involved in antigenicity in this study). Alternatively, NA and HA had different mutation spectra in swine influenza viruses collected from April to June 2019 in the United States. The antigenic drift in immunocompromised patients may allow swine influenza virus insertion to occur without pig to human transmission, ultimately reducing the efficacy of influenza vaccine escape. Nevertheless, antisera from ferrets immunized with the influenza vaccine exhibited good inhibition of A/Korea/S0002/2019 and A/Korea/S0003/2019 infection.
