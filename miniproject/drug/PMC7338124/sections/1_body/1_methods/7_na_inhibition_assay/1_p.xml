<p id="Par23">A fluorescence-based neuraminidase inhibition assay was conducted using the NA-Fluor™ Influenza Neuraminidase Assay Kit (Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The susceptibility of influenza viruses to NAI was characterized using oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir at concentrations that inhibited the NA activity by 50% (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As defined by the WHO, influenza A viruses with normal, reduced, and highly reduced NA activity inhibition exhibit a &lt; 10-fold, 10- to 100-fold, and ≥ 100-fold increase in IC
 <sub>50</sub>, respectively; the last are considered clinically resistant [
