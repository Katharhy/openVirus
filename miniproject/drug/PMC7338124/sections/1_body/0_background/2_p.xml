<p id="Par16">The Korea Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (KCDC) has operated the Korea Influenza and Respiratory Viruses Surveillance System (KINRESS) to monitor epidemic features of influenza viruses and analyze virus characteristics, including drug resistance, since 2000. The KCDC carries out diagnostic testing for influenza viruses in respiratory specimens requested by general hospitals as a national standard laboratory. If a drug resistance mutation is found in the NA gene, the KINRESS attempts to isolate the virus and perform phenotypic analysis (NA inhibition assay). The typical drug-resistance substitutions in NA include H275Y, E119D/G, and Q136R for A(H1N1)pdm09; E119V, D151G/V/D, R224K, E276D, R292K, and N294S for A (H3N2); and G104E, E117A/D, H134Y, and R150K for B virus [

Here, drug-resistant A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were detected via the KINRESS in patients with acute hematologic cancer not exhibiting recovery despite oseltamivir and peramivir administration; these were characterized genetically and antigenically following isolation.
