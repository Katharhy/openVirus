<p id="Par15">Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are globally utilized for the treatment and prevention of influenza types A and B infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], which are stockpiled by some countries, including the Republic of Korea, against unexpected pandemics. NAIs suppress the action of neuraminidase (NA) on the surface of the virus to prevent the spread of progeny virus from infected cells [

Oseltamivir and peramivir, the most commonly used drugs for patients with influenza-like illnesses in the Republic of Korea, help to relieve clinical symptoms within 2 days of symptom manifestation and shorten the virus-release period in the respiratory tract [
