     <p>25HC activates ACAT and stimulates the formation of lipid droplets. Calu‐3 cells were cultured in medium containing 2% LPDS prior to the treatment of ethanol or 5 μM 25HC for 16 h. Subsequently, cells were stained by LipidSpot to visualize intracellular lipid droplets. Scale bar, 50 μm.</p>

     <p>SZ58‐035 rescues surface accessible cholesterol in 25HC‐treated cells. Calu‐3 cells were treated with vehicle or 40 μM SZ58‐035 for 16 h, prior to treatment with ethanol or 2.5 μM 25HC for 1 h. Cells were then incubated with ALOD4 for 30 min. The amount of bound ALOD4 was examined by Western blotting.</p>

     <p>Inhibition of ACAT activity by SZ58‐035 rescues viral entry viral entry. Calu‐3 cells were pretreated with ethanol or 5 μM 25HC for 16 h in the presence of DMSO or 40 μM SZ58‐035. Then, cells were washed and incubated with DMSO or 40 μM SZ58‐305 for 1 h prior to infection with SARS‐CoV-2 pseudovirus. Luciferase activity was measured at 24‐hour post‐infection (D). EGFP signal was captured by fluorescence microscope 24 h post‐infection (E). Scale bar, 100 μm. Bar represents mean ± SD of

     <p>Knockdown of ACAT1/2 rescues SARS‐CoV-2 pseudovirus entry in 25HC‐treated cells. Calu‐3 cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying non‐targeting shRNA or shRNAs targeting ACAT1 and ACAT2. 48 h post‐transduction, cells were treated with ethanol or 5 μM 25HC for 16 h. Then, the cells were challenged with SARS‐CoV-2 pseudovirus. 24 h post‐pseudovirus challenge, viral entry was quantified by luciferase assays. Bar represents mean ± SD of
