     <p>SARS-CoV‐2 entry is dependent on TMPRSS2 but not endosomal cathepsin in lung epithelial cells. Calu‐3 cells were treated with 10 μM camostat or 25 μM E‐64D for 1 h. Then, the cells were infected with SARS‐CoV-2 pseudovirus with EGFP (A) or Fluc (B) for 1 h. EGFP signals were captured by fluorescence microscope 24 h post‐infection. Scale bar, 100 μm. Luciferase activity was measured at 24 h post‐infection. Bar represents mean ± SD of

     <p>25HC depletes accessible cholesterol on the plasma membrane. Calu‐3 cells were treated with EtOH or 5 μM 25HC and subsequently incubated with 3 or 6 μM ALOD4 for 30 min. The amount of bound ALOD4 was examined by Western blotting.</p>

     <p>Supplement of cholesterol can rescue cell–cell fusion induced by SARS‐CoV-2 S. (D) 293FT cells were treated with EtOH or 25HC (5 μM) for 16 h prior to transfection with pLVX plasmids encoding SARS‐CoV-2 S. 4 h post‐transfection, medium was changed and re‐supplemented with EtOH or 25HC in the presence or absence of 80 μM cholesterol. 24 h post‐transfection, syncytium formation was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Scale bar, 50 μm. (E) Membrane fusion was quantified as the percentage of nuclei within syncytia out of all nuclei in GFP‐positive cells. Bar represents mean ± SD of

Addition of Nafamostat in 25HC‐treated cells were infected with SARS‐CoV-2 pseudovirus and 24 h post‐infection, cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured.
