<p>To further confirm the antiviral activity of 25HC during a patient isolated SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, Calu‐3 cells were treated with a concentration gradient of 25HC and SARS‐CoV‐2 USA‐WA1/2020 infection was quantified by evaluating viral RNA of the infected cells and their culture supernatants (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A and B). Viral infection was inhibited by 25HC in a dose‐dependent manner. The IC50 values, as determined by supernatant viral RNA and intracellular viral RNA, are 382 nM and 363 nM, respectively (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A and B), which are quite similar to the IC50 for the inhibition of SARS‐CoV‐2 pseudovirus infection in Calu‐3 cells (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). Supernatants of infected 25HC‐treated cultures also contain significantly less virus progeny than vehicle control (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C). Because organoids are more physiologically relevant than cell lines as infection models, we next sought to confirm the function of 25HC using 3D lung organoids. Human iPSC derived lung organoids were generated using previously published methods (Leibel

 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) and characterized by analyzing expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and alveolar cell epithelial markers (SFTPC, SFTPB, HOPX; Tiwari et al. Manuscript under preparation). These 60D differentiated lung organoids were pretreated overnight with 25HC (5 μM) and were challenged with luciferase‐expressing SARS‐CoV‐2 pseudovirus. After 24 h, luciferase activity was measured to quantify viral levels. 25HC treatment significantly blocked SARS‐CoV‐2 entry in lung organoids (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D). Altogether, results from lung epithelial cells and organoids further support that 25HC efficiently blocks SARS‐CoV‐2 entry in lung cells.
