<p>Next, we determined if 25HC could deplete accessible cholesterol on the plasma membrane of Calu‐3 cells by incubating cells with domain 4 of anthrolysin O (ALOD4), a bacterial toxin that specifically traps accessible cholesterol at the plasma membrane (Das

 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). 25HC depletes accessible cholesterol at the plasma membrane in a dose‐dependent manner (Figs

We supplemented 25HC‐treated cells with exogenous cholesterol in cyclodextrin complex. We found that the depletion of accessible cholesterol could be rescued by supplementing soluble cholesterol to the cell culture (Fig

If accessible cholesterol on the plasma membrane regulated by 25HC is essential for viral fusion, the replenishment of cholesterol should rescue viral fusion and lead to virus entry. As expected, supplementing cholesterol in 25HC‐treated cells rescued SARS‐CoV‐2 fusion and entry, but had no effect on vehicle‐treated cells (Figs 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E and F, and 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0003ev" ref-type="fig">EV3</xref>D and E). These results provide evidence that 25HC mobilizes plasma membrane cholesterol to inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 virus–cell fusion.
