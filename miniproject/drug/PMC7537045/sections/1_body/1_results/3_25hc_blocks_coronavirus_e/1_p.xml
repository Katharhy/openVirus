<p>25HC and other oxysterols are important modulators of cholesterol metabolism and homeostasis (Du

 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that 25HC changes the orientation and solvent accessibility of cholesterol and trigger cholesterol trafficking from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum (Du 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Intriguingly, a recent study on 
 <italic>Listeria</italic> infection of epithelial cells reveals that 25HC restricts 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> cell‐to‐cell dissemination through mobilizing cholesterol molecules free of sequestration by proteins and lipids from the plasma membrane (Abrams 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). These cholesterol molecules constitute a distinct accessible cholesterol pool (Das 
 <italic>et al</italic>,

 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Since we postulate a viral entry mechanism at the plasma membrane and not via endosome, we first confirmed that SARS‐CoV‐2 enters lung epithelial cells primarily through fusion at the plasma membrane and not by endocytosis. We analyzed viral entry in Calu‐3 and Vero cells in the presence of inhibitors for TMPRSS2 and Cathepsin B/L and compared with DMSO control. We found that camostat mesylate, a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, dramatically reduced viral entry in Calu‐3 cells and not in Vero cells (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0003ev" ref-type="fig">EV3</xref>A and B). And cathepsin B/L inhibitor E‐64d efficiently blocked viral entry in Vero cells without effecting Calu‐3 infection (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0003ev" ref-type="fig">EV3</xref>A and B). Therefore, the priming of spike triggering viral fusion is mediated by TMPRSS2 on the plasma membrane but not endosomal Cathepsin B/L. These results are consistent with previous findings that SARS‐2 S‐driven entry requires TMPRSS2 in Calu‐3 cells, which likely directs the virus to an early route of entry through fusion at the plasma membrane, and endosomal cathepsins in Vero cells, which are associated with a late route of entry through fusion in the endosome (Hoffmann
