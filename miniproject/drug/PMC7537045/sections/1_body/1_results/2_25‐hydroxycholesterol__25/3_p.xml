<p>To determine which step of SARS‐CoV‐2 entry is restricted by 25HC, we examined the effect of 25HC on SARS‐CoV‐2 pseudovirus receptor binding and fusion with the plasma membrane. Binding assays were performed by treating Calu‐3 cells with 25HC prior to SARS‐CoV‐2 pseudovirus challenge at 4°C to prevent internalization, and the amount of bound virions after three washes was quantified by RT–qPCR (Fig
