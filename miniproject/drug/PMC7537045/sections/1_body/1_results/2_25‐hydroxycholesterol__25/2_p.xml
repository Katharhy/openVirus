<p>We further tested restrictive potential of 25HC against two other human coronaviruses, SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV using VSV harboring SARS‐CoV S (Figs

 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0002ev" ref-type="fig">EV2</xref>F) and MERS‐CoV S (Figs 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D and 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0002ev" ref-type="fig">EV2</xref>F). Entry of SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV pseudoviruses into Calu‐3 cells was suppressed by 25HC in a dose‐dependent manner as shown by luciferase assays, with IC
 <sub>50</sub>'s of 2.48 μM and 1.22 μM, respectively (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C and D, upper panels). This inhibition of infection was also confirmed by EGFP‐expressing pseudoviruses (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C and D, lower panels). These data, altogether, suggest that 25HC is an effective inhibitor of human coronaviruses entry.
