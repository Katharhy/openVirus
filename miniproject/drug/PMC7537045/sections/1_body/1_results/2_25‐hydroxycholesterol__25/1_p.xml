<p>To determine whether 
 <italic>CH25H</italic> inhibits SARS‐CoV‐2 infection by 25HC production, Calu‐3 cells were treated with a concentration gradient of 25HC, followed by infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 pseudovirus encoding either Firefly luciferase or EGFP (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A and B). Pseudovirus entry was potently inhibited by 25HC in a dose‐dependent manner, with a half‐maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 550 nM (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). This inhibitory effect was confirmed by diminished numbers of EGFP‐positive cells, pretreated with 25HC as compared with ethanol (EtOH) vehicle, and challenged with EGFP‐expressing pseudovirus (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). In light of the findings of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in the gastrointestinal tract (Zang 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), we asked whether the viral inhibition by 25HC was specific to lung epithelial cells or it was a broad cell type mechanism for viral entry. To address this question, we analyzed pseudovirus entry into Caco‐2 cells, a colorectal epithelial cell line, which also expresses ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as found in Calu‐3 cells. Using FLuc‐expressing pseudovirus, we observed a dose‐dependent restriction of entry by 25HC (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0002ev" ref-type="fig">EV2</xref>A). All concentrations of 25HC used in these experiments are non‐cytotoxic to both Caco‐2 (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0002ev" ref-type="fig">EV2</xref>B) and Calu‐3 cells (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0002ev" ref-type="fig">EV2</xref>C), and further 25HC does not exert significant background change in viral gene expression (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0002ev" ref-type="fig">EV2</xref>D). In contrast, 7α‐HC, which is structurally similar to 25HC, did not show any antiviral activity (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0002ev" ref-type="fig">EV2</xref>E). Thus, our results show that 25HC limits SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in both lung and intestinal epithelial cells.
