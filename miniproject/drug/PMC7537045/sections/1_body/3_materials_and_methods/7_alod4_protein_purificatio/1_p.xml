 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0501" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). ALOD4‐His
 <sub>6</sub> was purified using Capturem His‐tagged purification kit (Takara). The purified protein was further concentrated by 10 kD Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters. For ALOD4 labeling by Alexa Fluor 488 C5 (AF488) (Invitrogen), ALOD4 was mixed with AF488 at 4°C for 16 h. The reaction was quenched by 10 mM DTT. Excess dye was removed by desalting.
