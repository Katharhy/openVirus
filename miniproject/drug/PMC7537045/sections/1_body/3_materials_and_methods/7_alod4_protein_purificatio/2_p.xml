<p>For ALOD4 binding assay, 3 μM purified or labeled ALOD4 was added to each well, and ethanol‐ or 25HC‐treated cells were incubated with ALOD4 for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were washed twice with PBS prior to WB sample preparation. For ALOD4 binding assay with cholesterol rescue, ethanol‐ and 25HC‐treated cells were treated with cholesterol for 1 h at 37°C prior to incubation with ALOD4. For ALOD4 binding assay with SZ58‐035, vehicle or SZ58‐035 was present during the treatment with 25HC and incubation with ALOD4.</p>
