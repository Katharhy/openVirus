<p>293FT cells were transfected with pLVX expressing SARS‐CoV‐2‐S, SARS‐CoV‐S, or MERS‐CoV‐S. Nineteen amino acids at the C terminus of SARS‐CoV‐2‐S and SARS‐CoV‐S was deleted, given previous report that the shortened mutant has improved incorporation into the pseudovirus envelope (Fukushi

Cells were washed four times with medium 1 h post‐inoculation and maintained in medium for 24 h. Then supernatant containing pseudovirus was collected, centrifuged, and used or stored at −80°C. The titer was measured using the same method for VSV pseudovirus mentioned above. To characterize the pseudovirus, 1 ml supernatant was concentrated by ultra‐centrifugation at 106,750 ×
