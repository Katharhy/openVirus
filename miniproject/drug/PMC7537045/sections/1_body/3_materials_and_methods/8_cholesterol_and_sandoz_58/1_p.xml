<p>Calu‐3 cells were pretreated with Ethanol or 5 μM 25HC for 16 h. For cholesterol rescue experiment, the cells were washed and incubated with PBS or 80 μM water‐soluble cholesterol for 1 h. Fresh medium and SARS‐CoV‐2 pseudovirus without compounds were added to incubate with the cells for 2 h. Then, cells were washed and cultured in fresh medium. For Sandoz 58‐035 rescue experiment, after overnight treatment of 25HC in the presence of DMSO or 40 μM SZ58‐035, Calu‐3 cells were washed and incubated with DMSO or 40 μM SZ58‐035 for 1 h prior to infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 pseudovirus. For pseudovirus with Fluc, the cells were lysed and subjected to luciferase activity measurement at 24 h post‐infection. For EGFP pseudovirus, EGFP signals were captured by fluorescence microscope at 24 h post‐infection.</p>
