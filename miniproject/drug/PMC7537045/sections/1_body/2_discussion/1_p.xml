<p>In this study, we characterized the anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 function and mechanism of 
 <italic>CH25H</italic>, an interferon‐inducible gene robustly up‐regulated in lung epithelial cell lines infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 and in COVID‐19‐infected patients. We further showed that 25HC, the product of the interferon‐inducible enzyme CH25H, possesses broad‐spectrum antiviral activity against human coronaviruses. Further mechanistic studies revealed viral membrane fusion was blocked by this oxysterol. Previous studies demonstrated that 25HC inhibited entry of various types of viruses including VSV, HIV, NiV, EBOV, and ZIKV (Liu

 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). However, the mechanism by which 25HC modulates viral entry is still unknown. In addressing the mechanism of 25HC function, we found that 25HC triggered the depletion of accessible cholesterol from the plasma membrane via activating ACAT, thereby leading to inhibition of virus entry. The ER‐localized enzyme ACAT uses fatty acyl‐CoA and cholesterol as substrates to produce cholesteryl esters for storage in cytoplasmic lipid droplets and induces the depletion of accessible cholesterol from the plasma membrane through unknown mechanisms (Abrams

 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Altogether, our results provide evidence for a functional link between SARS‐CoV‐2 induced up‐regulation of 
 <italic>CH25H</italic> and the inhibition of SARS‐CoV‐2 entry by the CH25H product 25HC and reveal the broad‐spectrum antiviral mechanism of this oxysterol.
