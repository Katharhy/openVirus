<p>The COVID‐19 pandemic is spreading and causing great human loss and suffering, but no vaccine or effective therapeutic strategy is available. It is urgent to develop antiviral drugs against SARS‐CoV‐2. Statins are commonly used as lipid‐lowering drugs that also have anti‐inflammatory effects; therefore, use of statin has been suggested for COVID‐19 treatment (Castiglione

 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) raising concerns about the use of statin for COVID‐19 therapy. Intriguingly, a retrospective clinical study on 13,981 patients found that statin use was associated with reduced risk of mortality in COVID‐19‐infected patients (Zhang

Compared with statins, 25HC only decreases accessible cholesterol at the plasma membrane without altering the total cellular cholesterol; therefore, it may cause lower cytotoxicity or side effects than statin use. For example, we did not observe any significant increase in

 <italic>TMPRSS2</italic> mRNA expression by 25HC treatment of Calu‐3 cells. In addition, 25HC is a natural product and has not shown toxicity in mice and non‐human primates at effective concentrations. Thus, 25HC has potential as an antiviral agent to combat with SARS‐CoV‐2 and other possible emerging coronaviruses in the future.
