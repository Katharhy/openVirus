<p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the current pandemic, has distinctive genetic features, with two subtypes (L and S) and more than 140 mutation points, making it highly contagious and capable of spreading globally.
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Four main proteins in the structure of SARS-CoV-2 are found responsible for human cell interaction and intracellular replication: membrane (M), envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins. Scientists believe that there are mutation-resistant epitopes in the genes encoding S and N proteins that can be identified in experimental vaccine models and targeted by antibodies (
