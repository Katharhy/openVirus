<p>An entirely different approach is proposed by experts hypothesizing that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) can be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Currently marketed IVIg preparations contain antibodies that cross-react against SARS-CoV-2 and other virus antigens in-vitro.
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> IVIg preparations that contain proteins collected from thousands of healthy donors ameliorate the course of autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases by blocking Fc-gamma receptors and neutralizing inflammatory cytokines. The safety profile of IVIg therapy can be improved by switching to subcutaneous administration. The initial cases of high-dose IVIg therapy (25 g/day for 5 days) combined with antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir) and methylprednisolone in severe COVID-19 in Wuhan, China demonstrated elevation of lymphocyte counts, decrease of inflammatory markers, partial/complete resolution of specific lung affections, and negative nasal and oropharyngeal swab tests within a few days of therapy.
