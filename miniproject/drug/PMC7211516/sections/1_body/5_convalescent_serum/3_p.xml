<p>A big issue is the shortage of convalescent serum with high titers of virus-neutralizing antibodies. An unpublished study of 175 Chinese patients who recovered from mild COVID-19 revealed that about 6% of the patients do not produce detectable level of neutralizing antibodies and about 30% of them present with very low titers.
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> In all these patients, antibody production increased at day 10 to 15 after disease onset. Surprisingly, elderly (60–85 years) and middle-age (40–59) patients, who presented with lower lymphocyte counts and higher level inflammatory markers, produced significantly higher amounts of neutralizing antibodies than younger (15–39) patients.

 <sup>st</sup> week of disease onset and in all patients after 2 weeks.

Variable timing and deficiency of antibody production in a sizable proportion of COVID-19 patients pose yet another challenge, questioning the utility of antibody tests and related “immunity passports” in the general population.
