<p>To increase the efficiency of the virus-neutralizing antibody therapies, it is proposed to collect and utilize hyperimmune IgG antibodies from subjects who have recovered from COVID-19 and produced high amount of the antibodies.
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Due to the existence of different strains of the virus variably spread across cities and countries, potential plasma donors should be from the same geographical area as the recipient patients. Passive antibody therapy can modulate phagocytosis and cytotoxicity and exert additive virus-neutralizing effect in combination with antiviral drugs.
