  <title>Structure of SARS-CoV-2 and potential antibody targets.</title>
  <p>SARS-CoV-2 has four major targets: the N protein covering the viral ribonucleic acid (RNA), the E protein encompassing the viral envelope, the M protein protruding from the cell membrane and the S protein that engages with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor on host cells. Specific neutralizing IgG antibodies to N and S proteins, which are less prone to mutate, may provide successful host immunity; these are also potential targets for future vaccination strategies (
   <bold>A</bold>). Antibodies to E and M proteins, which often mutate, may not be protective against SARS-CoV-2. Cross-reactive antibodies which are generated in response to measles and other known viral vaccines may offer a degree of anti-SARS-CoV-2 protection (
   <bold>B</bold>). Intravenous immunoglobulin and neutralizing antibodies in convalescent serum may block the virus entry to host cells (
   <bold>C</bold>) and dampen hyperinflammation (
   <bold>D</bold>).

  <p>SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, N = nucleocapsid, E = envelope, M = membrane, S = spike.</p>
