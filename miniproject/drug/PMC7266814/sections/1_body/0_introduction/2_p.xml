 </sup> Most γδ-T cells in the peripheral blood and lymphoid organs of healthy human adults are Vγ9Vδ2-T cells. Vγ9Vδ2-T cells can be specifically activated in an HLA-unrestricted manner by small nonpeptidic phosphoantigens, which are metabolites of isoprenoid biosynthesis pathways.

 </sup> Pharmacological compounds, such as the aminobisphosphonates pamidronate (PAM) and zoledronate, which are commonly used for the treatment of osteoporosis and Paget’s disease, can induce the activation and expansion of human Vγ9Vδ2-T cells.

 </sup> Previously, we demonstrated that phosphoantigen-activated Vγ9Vδ2-T cells have antiviral activities against human and avian influenza viruses mediated by killing virus-infected monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), inhibiting virus replication, and promoting the production of virus-specific antibodies.

 </sup> Recently, we further reported that PAM can control influenza diseases by expanding the Vγ9Vδ2-T cell population in humanized mice.

 </sup> However, the application of PAM for the treatment of influenza is limited by the rapid exhaustion of the proliferation and effector responses of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells resulting from repeated treatments with the phosphoantigens. Although the underlying mechanisms of this exhaustion are still not clear, the suboptimal stimulation or lack of optimal costimulation may explain it. Therefore, detailed characterizations of the costimulatory factors required for sustained activation and survival of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells are required to solve this problem.
