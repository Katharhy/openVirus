 </sup> it was not possible to use a conventional mouse or ferret model for the study of human Vγ9Vδ2-T cells. In our previous studies, we successfully established humanized mice containing functional human T and B cells, including a percentage of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells in the peripheral blood similar to that seen in humans.

 </sup> Moreover, we found that influenza viruses could efficiently replicate and cause pathology in these mice, indicating that the humanized mice established by us are suitable for the study of human Vγ9Vδ2-T cell immune responses to influenza viruses. Using humanized mice, we further showed the synergistic effect of PAM and recombinant SA-hCD137L against influenza virus is mediated by boosting human Vγ9Vδ2-T cell immunity.
