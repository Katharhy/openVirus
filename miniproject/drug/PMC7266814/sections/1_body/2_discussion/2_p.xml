 </sup> As shown in previous reports on αβ-T cells, CD137 signaling can inhibit activation-induced cell death (AICD), promote cell proliferation and survival, and enhance effector cell function.

 </sup> Here, we also found that engagement of CD137 could provide costimulatory signals to Vγ9Vδ2-T cells to enhance proliferation, inhibit apoptosis and increase antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that CD137 can provide costimulatory signals to both αβ- and γδ-T cells.
