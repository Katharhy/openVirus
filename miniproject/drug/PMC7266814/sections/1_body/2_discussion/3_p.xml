  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup> direct comparison of the effector functions of CD137
 <sup>+</sup> and CD137
 <sup>−</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cell fractions has not been performed. Here, we found that CD137
 <sup>+</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells displayed more potent antiviral activity than their CD137
 <sup>−</sup> counterparts in vitro and in vivo. The cytolytic phenotype of CD137
 <sup>+</sup> effector Vγ9Vδ2-T cells suggests that CD137 may be a marker of potent effector Vγ9Vδ2-T cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Using CD137
 <sup>+</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells for adoptive cell-based therapy for influenza is superior to using CD137
 <sup>−</sup> or whole Vγ9Vδ2-T cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These properties make adoptive transfer of CD137
 <sup>+</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells an attractive agent for the therapy of influenza diseases.
