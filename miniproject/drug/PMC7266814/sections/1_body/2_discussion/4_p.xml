<p id="Par17">Although CD137
 <sup>+</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells expressed higher levels of activation markers (CD25, CD69 and NKG2D) and cell death-related receptor ligands (Fas, FasL and TRAIL) than their CD137
 <sup>−</sup> counterparts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), there were no significant changes in the expression of CD25, CD69, TRAIL and FasL after treatment with an anti-CD137 neutralizing mAb or SA-hCD137L during coculture of PAM-expanded Vγ9Vδ2-T cells with influenza virus-infected MDMs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In contrast, CD137 costimulation enhanced the expressions of cytolytic granule molecules (perforin and granzyme B) and the antiviral cytokine IFN-γ in Vγ9Vδ2-T cells and promoted cytotoxic granule exocytosis, as marked by CD107a expression, in these cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). These data indicated that the enhancement of Vγ9Vδ2-T cell effector function by CD137 costimulation was mainly mediated by the perforin/granzyme B pathway and secretion of IFN-γ.
