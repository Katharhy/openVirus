<p id="Par12">To determine whether CD137 costimulation can promote the proliferation of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells, CD137 was blocked with a neutralizing mAb during the ex vivo expansion of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (huPBMC) induced by PAM. Compared with control treatment, blocking CD137 resulted in a significant decrease in Vγ9Vδ2-T cells in terms of both the cell frequency (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>) and absolute cell number (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>) after 7 days of expansion. Additionally, the expanded Vγ9Vδ2-T cells exhibited a statistic decrease in the proliferation index after CD137 blockade in a CFSE proliferation assay (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d, e</xref>). To further confirm the role of CD137 costimulation in promoting the proliferation of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells, we added the recombinant SA-hCD137L protein to γδ-T cells purified by positive selection and cultured the cells for 5 days in the absence or presence of IL-2. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>, the SA-hCD137L protein alone could not enhance the expansion of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells; however, the recombinant protein could significantly raise the absolute cell number of γδ-T cells in the presence of a low dose of IL-2 (50 IU/ml), and the cells were expanded by approximately 1.4-fold after 5 days of culturing. This result indicated that CD137 costimulation could promote the proliferation of activated Vγ9Vδ2-T cells in an IL-2-dependent manner. Importantly, blockade of CD137 induced more apoptosis (21.05 ± 0.55%, AV
 <sup>+</sup>PI
 <sup>−</sup>: early apoptosis; 27.43 ± 1.03%, AV
 <sup>+</sup>PI
 <sup>+</sup>: late apoptosis) in Vγ9Vδ2-T cells activated by an anti-γδ-TCR antibody for 24 h than did an mIgG1 control (15.35 ± 0.32%, AV
 <sup>+</sup>PI
 <sup>−</sup>: early apoptosis; 19.30 ± 1.70%, AV
 <sup>+</sup>PI
 <sup>+</sup>: late apoptosis) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g–i</xref>), which indicated that CD137 costimulation also inhibited Vγ9Vδ2-T cell apoptosis and enhanced the survival of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells. Collectively, these data demonstrated that CD137 costimulation promoted the proliferation and prolonged the survival of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells.
