<p id="Par6">To understand the effect of the CD137/CD137L interaction on the antiviral activity of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells, we first analyzed CD137 expression on human Vγ9Vδ2-T cells upon γδ-TCR activation in vitro. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, CD137 was expressed at very low levels on resting Vγ9Vδ2-T cells, but its expression was upregulated, peaked at 18 h and then decreased following activation by anti-γδ-TCR mAbs. PAM could also induce the expression of CD137 when used for ex vivo expansion of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). We then detected the expression of CD137 on Vγ9Vδ2-T cells while coculturing PAM-expanded Vγ9Vδ2-T cells with influenza H1N1/A/PR/8/34 virus-infected autologous MDMs. CD137 was rapidly induced in Vγ9Vδ2-T cells, and approximately 20% of the Vγ9Vδ2-T cells became CD137
 <sup>+</sup> cells after 24 h of coculture with influenza virus-infected MDMs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Importantly, CD137L expression was also rapidly upregulated in MDMs, and 25.7 ± 4.3% of the MDMs became CD137L
 <sup>+</sup> cells after 24 h of influenza virus infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). These data indicated that the levels of CD137 and CD137L were upregulated on Vγ9Vδ2-T cells and MDMs, respectively, during influenza virus infection, raising the possibility that CD137/CD137L could serve as an effective costimulatory signaling pair to promote the antiviral activity of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells.
