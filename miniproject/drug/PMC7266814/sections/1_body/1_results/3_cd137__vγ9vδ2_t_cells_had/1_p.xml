<p id="Par9">To further confirm the antiviral activities of both CD137
 <sup>+</sup> and CD137
 <sup>−</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells against influenza virus in vivo, Rag2
 <sup>−/−</sup> γc
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice were infected with influenza virus intranasally (i.n.). CD137
 <sup>+</sup> and CD137
 <sup>−</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cell subsets were sorted after activation by an anti-γδ-TCR antibody in vitro, and then highly purified (&gt;95%) CD137
 <sup>+</sup>, CD137
 <sup>−</sup> or whole Vγ9Vδ2-T cells were adoptively transferred into the influenza virus-infected mice on days 2, 4, and 6 post infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Consistent with our previous results,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup> adoptive transfer of whole Vγ9Vδ2-T cells significantly reduced weight loss and mortality (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Treatment with CD137
 <sup>+</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells showed more efficacy in controlling influenza disease than CD137
 <sup>-</sup> and whole Vγ9Vδ2-T cells, with the CD137
 <sup>+</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells producing the lowest weight loss (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), highest survival rate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>) and attenuated lung inflammation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Furthermore, CD137
 <sup>+</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cell treatment showed a better ability to reduce virus titers in the lungs of infected mice by day 8 post infection than either CD137
 <sup>−</sup> T cells or whole Vγ9Vδ2-T cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). These data demonstrated that CD137
 <sup>+</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells displayed superior antiviral effects in controlling influenza disease in vivo.
