 <sup>7</sup> cells) were labeled with 5 μM carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Sigma-Aldrich) and then cultured as described previously to generate PAM-expanded Vγ9Vδ2-T cells. A neutralizing anti-CD137 mAb (5 μg/ml) was added to block the CD137-mediated signaling pathway, and mouse IgG1 (5 μg/ml) was used as an isotype control. On day 7, the profile of CFSE in CD3
 <sup>+</sup>Vγ9
 <sup>+</sup> cells was detected by flow cytometry.
