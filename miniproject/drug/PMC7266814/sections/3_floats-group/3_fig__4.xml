  <p>CD137 costimulation enhanced the antiviral activity of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells against influenza virus. Human MDMs (target cells, T) were infected with PR8 (V-MDMs) at an MOI of 2 for 1h and then cocultured with PAM-expanded autologous Vγ9Vδ2-T cells (effector cells, E) at an E:T ratio of 10:1 for 6h with the indicated treatment. 
   <bold>a</bold> V-MDMs cocultured with Vγ9Vδ2-T cells in the presence of SA-hCD137L (500ng/ml) or PBS, which was used as a control. The surface and intracellular expression of the indicated markers by Vγ9Vδ2-T cells was detected with flow cytometry. 
   <bold>b</bold> The proportions of dead (EthD2
   <sup>+</sup>) MDMs were detected by flow cytometry. 
   <bold>c</bold> V-MDMs were cocultured with Vγ9Vδ2-T cells in the presence of a neutralizing anti-CD137 mAb (αCD137) or isotype control (mIgG1). The surface and intracellular expression of the indicated markers by Vγ9Vδ2-T cells was detected with flow cytometry. 
   <bold>d</bold> The proportions of dead (EthD2
   <sup>+</sup>) MDMs were detected by flow cytometry. Data are shown as the mean ± SEM. *
