  <p>Influenza virus induced CD137 and CD137L expression on Vγ9Vδ2-T cells and MDMs, respectively. 
   <bold>a</bold> The expression of CD137 on Vγ9Vδ2-T cells was detected by flow cytometry upon stimulation with or without an anti-γδ-TCR mAb for the indicated time. 
   <bold>b</bold> CD137 expression on human Vγ9Vδ2-T cells was detected at the indicated time during ex vivo expansion of Vγ9Vδ2-T from huPBMC with PAM. 
   <bold>c</bold> CD137 expression on Vγ9Vδ2-T cells was detected during coculture with mock- or influenza virus-infected autologous MDMs for the indicated time. 
   <bold>d</bold> CD137L expression on MDMs was evaluated during mock or influenza virus infection. Cells were harvested at the indicated time and assessed by flow cytometry for CD137 or CD137L expression. The percentages of CD137
   <sup>+</sup> cells in Vγ9Vδ2-T cells and CD137L
   <sup>+</sup> cells in MDMs are shown (mean ± SEM). *
