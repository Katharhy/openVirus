   <sup>+</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T Cells had more potent antiviral activity against influenza virus than their CD137
   <sup>−</sup> counterparts in vitro. 
   <bold>a</bold>, 
   <bold>b</bold> Human MDMs were infected with influenza virus at an MOI of 2 for 1h and then cocultured with PAM-expanded autologous Vγ9Vδ2-T cells for 12h at a ratio of 1:1. The indicated markers were detected by flow cytometry with surface (
   <bold>a</bold>) or intracellular (
   <bold>b</bold>) staining. Representative histograms (above) depict the positive percentage for the indicated markers (blank histogram), with shaded histograms representing isotype controls. The percentages and mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs) of positive cells are shown in the bar graphs (underneath) as the mean±SEM.

   <sup>+</sup> and CD137
   <sup>−</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells were separated from PAM-expanded Vγ9Vδ2-T cells with magnetic beads after stimulation with an anti-γδ-TCR mAb (0.5μg/ml) for 6h. Then, these cells (effector cells, E) were cocultured with influenza virus-infected autologous MDMs (target cells, T) at an E:T ratio of 10:1 for 6h. Cytotoxicity was calculated as the proportion of dead MDMs. Data shown in the bar graphs are the mean ± SEM. *
