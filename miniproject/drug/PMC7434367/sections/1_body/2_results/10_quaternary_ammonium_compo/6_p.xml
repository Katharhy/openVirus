<p id="p0285">Although the clear and severe threat posed by COVID-19 prompts a massive use of QACs as a reasonable strategy to mitigate and contain the spread of the infection, the potential environmental impact of QAC, which may include disruption of wastewater treatment unit operations, proliferation of antibiotic resistance, formation of nitrosamine disinfection byproducts, and negative effects on biota of surface waters, should also be considered. Exploration of potential technologies to minimize the environmental releases of QACs is highly warranted (
