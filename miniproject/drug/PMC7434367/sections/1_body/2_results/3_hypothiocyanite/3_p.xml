<p id="p0085">In 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> , R–SH is a peptide or protein with a thiol moiety essential for the activity of numerous enzymes and proteins. Sulphydryl oxidation of R–SH by OSCN
 <sup>−</sup> or OI
 <sup>−</sup> generates sulfenyl thiocyanate (R-S-SCN) or sulfenyl iodide (R-S-I), determining inhibition of bacterial glycolysis, respiration and glucose transport. Inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway was also observed only for OI
 <sup>−</sup>, with sulfenic acid (R-S-OH) as well as SCN
 <sup>−</sup> or I
 <sup>−</sup> formed at the end of the cycle. Either SCN
 <sup>−</sup> or I
 <sup>−</sup> react with the native LPO and the cycle restarts. The anti-microbial activity of the entire system (enzyme plus substrates) is known to be more effective than hypothiocyanite or hypoiodite alone and has been explained by the production of short-lived, highly reactive intermediates (

 <sup>−</sup> peroxidase system is more effective against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> than the SCN
 <sup>−</sup> system, in that lower I
 <sup>−</sup> concentrations are necessary (

 <sup>−</sup> peroxidase system deserves to be tested in vitro against the new coronavirus.
