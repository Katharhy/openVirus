<p id="p0115">Another laboratory experiment challenged enzyme free OSCN
 <sup>−</sup> against A/H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza virus in-vitro, showing an evident dose-dependent viricidal activity, without cell toxicity (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Cegolon et al., 2014</xref>). Considering a demonstrated wide spectrum cidal effect (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Cegolon and Mastrangelo, 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2018</xref>), not targeting specific proteins, it could be reasonably argued that OSCN
 <sup>−</sup> may be effective also against SARS-CoV-2 and would therefore deserved to be tested in vitro (

 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Cegolon, 2020</xref>). Since it is already naturally present in human airways secretion and considering its large spectrum of action, a low level of resistance due to viral mutations and limited adverse reactions can be predicted with OSCN
 <sup>−</sup> (

 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Cegolon, 2020</xref>). If effective in vitro against SARS-CoV-2, in vivo aerosol trials with enzyme free OSCN
 <sup>−</sup> could be subsequently undertaken with the aim of providing a short term-prophylaxis for the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, by clearing any individual COVID-19 positive at real time PCR.
