<p id="p0240">SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV are lipophilic enveloped viruses relatively easy to inactivate by exposure to alcohols. Ethanol 62–71% is among the reagents already proven effective to disinfect fomites from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV within 1 minute (

A further study confirmed that two commercial formulated alcohol-based hand sanitizers (a gel and a foam both with a 70% concentration of ethanol) marketed in the USA achieved the abatement of SARS-CoV-2 in suspension below detectable thresholds (&gt;3 log
