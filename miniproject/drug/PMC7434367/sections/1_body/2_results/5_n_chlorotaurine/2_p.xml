<p id="p0170">N-chlorotaurine (NCT) is a natural oxidant part of the human defense system which is produced in the body (HOCl + taurine → NCT + H
 <sub>2</sub>O) by the strongly toxic hypochlorous acid and the amino-acid taurine (

This compound revealed an optimal compromise between sufficient disinfecting power and good tissue tolerability. NCT can be stored long-term at low temperatures, and has killing activity against bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses (Herpes simplex virus type 1; Herpes simplex virus type 2; Adenovirus; Influenza virus A and HIV-1). NCT can be applied to sensitive body regions as an endogenous antiseptic. Tolerability was very good in the eye, skin, mucous membranes and paranasal sinuses. The ciliary beat frequency of epithelial cells of the nasal mucosa, a very sensitive parameter for toxicity, was decreased only moderately and reversibly by 1% NCT (

A phase I double-blind randomized clinical study with test group (inhalation of 1% NCT) and a parallel control group (0.9% NaCl as placebo) was carried out in two Austrian centers. Among treated subjects the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) was not reduced and blood analyses showed no abnormalities compared to the baseline values and to the control arm (
