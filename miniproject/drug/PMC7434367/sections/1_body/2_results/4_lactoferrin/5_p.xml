<p id="p0145">The antiviral activity of LF takes place particularly when the virus attacks the host cell, since LF prevents the virus from anchoring and then entering the host cell (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2011</xref>). It has been reported that LF binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which are cell-surface and extracellular matrix macromolecules that are composed of a core protein decorated with covalently linked glycosaminoglycan chains (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Kell et al., 2020</xref>). HSPGs could serve as preliminary docking sites on the host cell membrane and play an important role in the process of entry of SARS-CoV-1 into the cell (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2011</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> , LF blocks the infection of SARS-CoV-1 by competing with the virus for HSPGs (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2011</xref>). This mechanism of action could prevent the viral concentration on the cell surface, as well as to the specific entry receptors (ACE2). It is still not presently known whether LF binds to ACE2 though (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2011</xref>). LF may likely inhibit SARS-CoV-2 invasion at micromolar concentrations and in a dose dependent fashion, just as for SARS-CoV-1 (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2011</xref>). However, there is no current confirmed evidence that SARS-CoV-2 binds to HSPGs, and whether SARS-CoV-2 also enters host cells via HPSGs in the same way as SARS-CoV-1 clearly warrants further investigation.
