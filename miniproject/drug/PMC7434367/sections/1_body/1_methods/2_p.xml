<p id="p0065">PubMed was investigated using “Anti-Infective Agents, Local” and “Anti-Infective Agents, Nasal” as key words and applying the filters “Age: 19+ years”, “Humans” and “English” to identify papers published during 2010–2020. The 255 publications returned by the system were scrutinized by inspection of title and abstract. The majority of papers dealt with drugs against methicillin resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (generally, mupirocin in nose associated with either chlorhexidine or hexachlorophene body wash). The pharmacological agents relevant for the present scoping review were: povidone-iodine solution (reported by 7 papers), alcohol-based nasal antiseptics (2 papers), quaternary ammonium compounds (1 paper) and N-chlorotaurine (1 paper). Furthermore, “nasal disinfection” was used as search term in three online repositories of preliminary not peer-reviewed reports. The treatments found were: povidone-iodine solution and interferon-alpha (2 papers from MedRxiv), hypothiocyanite (2 papers, of which 1 from SSRN) and alcohol-based nasal antiseptics (1 paper from arXiv).
