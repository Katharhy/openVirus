<p>Just this intrinsic biology of the mosquito is not sufficient to make it a vector. Its environment may, or may not, allow this vector potential to manifest itself. According to Euzet and Combes [
 <xref rid="B33-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], the specificity of the vectorâ€“pathogen interaction passes through four stages, which they named encounter and compatibility filters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00265-f002">Figure 2</xref>). These four stages are: (1) to co-occur in space and time, (2) to meet each other (behavior), (3) to recognize each other (receptors), and (4) to accept each other (immunity).
