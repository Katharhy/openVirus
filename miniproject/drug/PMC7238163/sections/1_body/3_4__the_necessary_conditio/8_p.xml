<p>We can hypothesize that only a few species in the genera 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Sabethes</italic> have the capacity to replicate and transmit yellow fever virus to primates, i.e. (1) possess the receptors for cellular penetration of the virus, (2) have insufficient innate immunity to suppress virus replication, (3) live in the same environments as viremic vertebrates (monkeys or humans), (4) take blood from these vertebrates, and (5) survive long enough to retransmit the virus.
