<p>First of all, the mosquito, or to be precise, a given population of a given species of mosquito, must be biologically able to transmit the virus. This ability is called vectorial capacity, which includes vector competence (i.e., the ability of a mosquito to become infected after ingestion of an infected blood meal and later transmit the virus via its saliva). Both terms, vectorial capacity and vector competence, have been formalized since MacDonald [

 <xref rid="B30-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and include the following parameters:

   <p>The human feeding rate: the number of human bites per mosquito, per day:

   <p>The daily survival rate (i.e. the probability of a mosquito surviving each day):

   <p>The extrinsic development time, the time necessary for viruses to complete development from ingestion in midgut to the saliva:

   <p>The infectiousness of the mosquito to the vertebrate host:

   <p>The vertebrate host infectious period: 1/r (how long the virus titre in the vertebrate remains at a level needed to infect a mosquito);</p>
