<p>On a final note of optimism, it is expected that new outbreaks can be detected more quickly, thanks to surveillance and warning systems that have improved greatly in recent decades and thanks to the development of efficient, rapid and less costly diagnostic techniques. Moreover, not all emergences will find favourable environments, including encounter and compatibility filters, and are likely to quickly die out. For public health authorities to succeed in limiting new outbreaks, The International Health Regulations, published in 2005 by WHO [
 <xref rid="B58-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], provide a framework and obligations for member states, and give hope that new epidemics could be brought under control through early detection, efficient vector control, vaccination when available, and other public health measures. While worst case scenarios should be planned for, they seldom actually arise. However, they happen regularly and the recent Covid-19 pandemic, which was not caused by an arbovirus, reminds us that, although we are aware that this can happen, we are not always properly prepared.
