<p>The evolutionary history of 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> genus mosquitoes, which are only found in the New World, is not well known. Phylogenetically, they seem to be quite close to the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00265-f001">Figure 1</xref>), which may explain their ability to transmit, more or less, the same viruses as 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>: yellow fever, dengue [
 <xref rid="B16-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], Zika [
 <xref rid="B17-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and chikungunya [
 <xref rid="B18-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], all introduced into South America. New cycles of jungle yellow fever have thus developed, involving South American primates and tree-dwelling 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> mosquitoes. These cycles have spread throughout South and Central America, where they are still active, as shown by the 2016â€“2018 yellow fever epidemic in Brazil, with more than 700 deaths [
 <xref rid="B19-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This combination of both a sylvan and an urban cycle for yellow fever in the Americas regularly fuelled epidemics that greatly affected the history of colonization of the New World [
 <xref rid="B20-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> adapted to American cities, even non-tropical locations were subject to yellow fever epidemics, such as the well-known Philadelphia epidemic in 1793 (5000 deaths). A largely successful eradication program against 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> began initially in the 1930s and was started by the Rockefeller Foundation [
 <xref rid="B21-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and this continued with DDT after World War II. At the same time, wide vaccination coverage was undertaken. This led to almost no outbreaks of yellow fever due to 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in the Americas, since about 1970, although 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is again abundant [
 <xref rid="B22-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and able to transmit dengue fever virus and the recently introduced Zika virus. It is thought that the Brazil 2016-18 yellow fever outbreak was almost entirely due to spill over from the sylvan cycle and involved 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> and 
 <italic>Sabethes</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="B23-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].
