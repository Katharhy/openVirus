<p>The yellow fever virus circulates in African forests from monkey to monkey, transmitted by forest 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> (
 <italic>Ae. africanus, Ae. luteocephalus, Ae. furcifer, Ae. simpsoni</italic> s.l., 
 <italic>Ae. opok</italic>, etc.), with incursions into villages where domestic anthropophilic 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> are established, and able to replicate and transmit YF virus [
 <xref rid="B12-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These domestic 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> are themselves the result of a slow adaptation of forest ancestors to human habitats and blood [
 <xref rid="B13-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The virus, once in humans, following cross species transmission, can be introduced through the movement of humans into African cities, where it finds 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations adapted to urbanisation and able to generate outbreaks.
