 <xref rid="B15-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Upon arrival to the Central and South American rainforest, not only did the virus find susceptible New World monkeys but also new competent endemic mosquitoes from two genera, 
 <italic>Sabethes</italic> sp. and especially 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> sp. Yellow fever virus thus had a second phase of cross species transmission (African monkeys to American monkeys, African Aedes mosquitoes to American mosquitoes).
