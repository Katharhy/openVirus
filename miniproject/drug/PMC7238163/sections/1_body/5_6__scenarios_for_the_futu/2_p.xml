<p>The optimistic view, but not very realistic, is that the worst is already behind us. Urban environments, where the majority of the humans now live, are already colonized by 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae albopictus</italic>, and/or 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic>, which transmit or can transmit known viruses of tropical or equatorial origin: dengue, chikungunya, Zika, yellow fever, West Nile, as well as, at least potentially, many other tropical viruses like Japanese encephalitis and Rift Valley fever, with variable success depending on species and environments [
 <xref rid="B13-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, this optimistic view needs to be tempered. With global changes (environment, climate, demography, movements), the distribution areas of some of these human adapted vectors and viruses will continue to expand and we will see a steady increase of epidemics of viruses, including in temperate regions. While we cannot predict details of time and place, we know it will happen, and we can prepare for it.
