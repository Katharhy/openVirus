<p>Among the hundreds of wild animal viruses, several viruses are regularly cited as worthy of surveillance. This is the case of the Mayaro alphavirus, closely related to the chickungunya virus. It is a South American virus of mammals, including monkeys, mainly transmitted by 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> mosquitoes, and which could adapt to urban 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> or 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, or to some other anthrophilic Culicidae. However, these other mosquitoes are considered poor vectors [

 <xref rid="B55-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In Africa, the Spondweni virus is genetically close to the Zika virus, which places it on the list of viruses to keep an eye on. While it is indeed pathogenic to humans, very few human cases have been detected; it has no known domestic cycle. It is poorly transmitted experimentally by 
 <italic>Aedes (Stegomyia)</italic>, being efficiently transmitted by zoophilic mosquitoes (
 <italic>Aedes circumluteolus</italic>, 
 <italic>Mansonia africana</italic>), but this situation could change [
 <xref rid="B56-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Indeed, this virus has already been found in Haiti [
 <xref rid="B57-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] in 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus,</italic> a human-biting mosquito recorded in all tropical regions.
