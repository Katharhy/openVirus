 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is considered to be phylogeographically native to Southeast Asia [
 <xref rid="B10-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This assumption is based on the fact that this mosquito is present everywhere in the forested areas of this region and that many species close to the Albopictus subgroup, member of the Scutellaris group, are present in Southeast Asia. However, the notoriety of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, compared to relatives, comes from the fact that it has moved out of its area of origin, becoming worldwide in 50 years, adapting perfectly to urbanization, temperate climates, and international transport, as well as being involved in several dengue and chikungunya epidemics.
