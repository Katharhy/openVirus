<p>In both its native range Asia and recently invaded South America and Africa, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> has retained its ancestral capacity to colonize forest environments, laying eggs in natural pools of water and taking blood from nondomestic vertebrates. It is logical to think that under these conditions, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations would take blood from vertebrates carrying as yet unknown viruses, such as from monkeys, terrestrial mammals, birds or reptiles. If these forest-breeding 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> are able to replicate these viruses, and then retransmit them to humans, they would then be excellent bridge vectors, allowing the emergence of forest viruses hitherto confined to sylvatic 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-vertebrates cycles. We can speculate that this is most likely to occur in Asia. In Africa, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> has already brought many, perhaps most, human adapted viruses from the forest to human habitats, such as yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses [
