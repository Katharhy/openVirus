<p>It is not too difficult to predict the epidemiological future of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. Its geographical distribution will increase, especially in temperate regions, its control by insecticides will be more difficult due to the emergence of resistance, and human pathogenic viruses will adapt to this new vector, increasing its efficiency to transmit. 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>-vectored epidemics are almost certain to increase. It could be responsible for the epidemics of yellow fever, or of currently unknown viruses transmitted by forest edge 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes of South American, South East Asia or Central Africa. A major unknown for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictusâ€™</italic> impact in temperate regions is whether arbovirus replication at lower temperatures is selected to be rapid enough to reach saliva before the female dies.
