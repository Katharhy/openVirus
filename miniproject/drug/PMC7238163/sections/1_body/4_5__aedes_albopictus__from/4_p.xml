<p>In Laos, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is reported from deep natural forest [
 <xref rid="B41-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], rubber forest and secondary forest [
 <xref rid="B42-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], as well as in towns and villages. In contrast, in neighbouring countries, such as in Cambodia, this mosquito was found along hundreds of meters of forest edge, whereas 
 <italic>Ae. pseudalbopictus</italic>, is found in deeper natural forests. 
 <italic>Aedes albopictu</italic>s is frequently found in cities such as the capital, Phnom Penh (

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is rare in forests [
 <xref rid="B43-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and in Yunnan Province, China, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is sometimes more abundant than 
 <italic>Ae. pseudalbopictus</italic> in bamboo forests, but is often absent from deep forests [
