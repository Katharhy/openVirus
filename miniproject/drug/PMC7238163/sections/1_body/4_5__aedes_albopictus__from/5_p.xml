<p>Outside Asia, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations display highly variable success in invading the deep forest. In Brazil, where 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was observed for the first time in the 1980s, Pereira dos Santos et al. found that 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was able to enter degraded forest in the Manaus region, up to 750 metres from the edge [

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was first reported in 2007, it was captured 12 years later in the Lop√© natural forest, several kilometres from villages or clearings (
