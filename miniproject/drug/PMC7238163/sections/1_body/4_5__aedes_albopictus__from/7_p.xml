<p>Mogi et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], suggest that the spreading of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> from its original tropical forest region was possible following evolution from an ancestral wild species, due to adaptation to man-made habitats and then migration with humans to temperate climate regions, where 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> developed a winter diapause. In most introduced localities, it probably encountered only limited competition from native mosquitoes and when it did, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> proved to be a robust competitor, e.g., with 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B45-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. It is likely that the ancestral wild species was already a vector of forest vertebrate arboviruses, for example, dengue-like flaviviruses, or chikungunya-like alphaviruses, which are monkey viruses [
