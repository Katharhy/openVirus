<p>In tropical Southeast Asia, the five morphologically closely related species of the Albopictus subgroup live in forests (
 <italic>Aedes novalbopictus</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes patriciae</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes seatoi</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes subalbopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes pseudalbopictus</italic>) and lay their eggs in tree holes and bamboo stumps [

 <xref rid="B40-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These species are likely to be vectors of arboviruses to vertebrates from which they take blood. These forest-confined viruses are largely unknown, but may emerge through increased contact with humans or domestic animals (see below). They could then be transmitted by domestic vectors, such as 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, in a pattern similar to the emergence of the yellow fever virus in Africa from forests to villages [
