 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> became widely known only over the last 50 years, when it was gradually discovered on all continents outside its native Asia and caused a chikungunya pandemic [

 <xref rid="B36-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A total of more than 40 viruses can be transmitted naturally or experimentally by 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B36-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Experimentally, it will take blood from many vertebrate species [
 <xref rid="B37-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It also lives longer than 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B38-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> therefore perfectly fulfils the necessary conditions in terms of biology and events to be an excellent vector of virus to humans.
