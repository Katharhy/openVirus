<p>However, our present understanding should not be taken as dogma. We must keep an open mind and explore what factors can make a non-vector mosquito become a vector, or what can cause a so-called “secondary” vector to become a major vector for humans. To continue our metaphor, what turns an “innocent” mosquito into a “guilty” menace; then into an effective vector to humans? In theory, it is very simple. Only two conditions are necessary: (1) the mosquito is physiologically capable of sustaining a virus infection that spreads to saliva and takes multiple blood meals from primates, i.e., was always a potential vector, (2) an event or several events occur in its environment that allow it to express this vector potential. Subsequently, adaptive mechanisms, under selection pressure, may cause this mosquito to become responsible for severe outbreaks. However, while this seems simple, in reality, a large number of factors are necessary for the conditions to be met that allow the emergence of a new vector.</p>
