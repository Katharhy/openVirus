<p>Transmission of viruses to humans by mosquitoes seems to be the rule for many public health officers. Actually, it is an exception. The vast majority of mosquitoes do not transmit human diseases. Of the 3585 species of mosquitoes currently formally described, less than 30 transmit the yellow fever virus, either naturally or in the laboratory. In other words, more than 3500 species of mosquitoes do not transmit the yellow fever virus. They are not guilty. There are many reasons for this: (1) the virus is not present in the geographical area of the vector mosquito species; either by “luck” because it was never introduced, or due to the absence of vertebrate amplifying hosts allowing the maintenance of cycles (primates in the case of yellow fever); (2) the mosquito is not competent to transmit (absence of required receptors or innate immunity controlling the pathogen); (3) the biology of the mosquito is not compatible with transmission (life span too short, does not take blood meals from primates, etc.).</p>
