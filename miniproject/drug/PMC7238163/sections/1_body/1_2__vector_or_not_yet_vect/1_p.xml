<p>Two species of mosquitoes of particular relevance to human public health, 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, are good models for understanding, estimating and, if possible, anticipating and limiting the risk of emergence, establishment and transmission of pathogens to humans by vectors [
 <xref rid="B3-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> was suspected to be a vector of the yellow fever virus by Beauperthuy and later Finlay since the middle of the 19th century [
 <xref rid="B5-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and experimentally demonstrated as a vector in 1900 by Reed et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and therefore an enemy to be killed [
 <xref rid="B8-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In contrast, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> became widely known only over the last 40 years when it was gradually detected on all continents (except Antarctica) outside its native region of Southeast Asia and implicated in the recent chikungunya pandemic [

 <xref rid="B11-pathogens-09-00265" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These two species (
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>) of genus 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and subgenus 
 <italic>Stegomyia</italic> are responsible for virtually all major outbreaks of diseases caused by the major primate arboviruses: dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever. Both mosquitoes are invasive species, spreading thanks to man-made means of transport, and are extremely well adapted to human environments.
