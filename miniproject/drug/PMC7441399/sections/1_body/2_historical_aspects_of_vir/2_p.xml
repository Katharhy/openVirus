 </sup>, an association between influenza A virus infection and development of transient parkinsonism is reported

 </sup>. Notably, the avian flu resulted in parkinsonism in many survivors

 </sup>. Other viral infections have been associated with the development of transient or, more rarely, permanent parkinsonism, including Epstein-Barr, Japanese encephalitis, Coxsackie, West Nile, Western equine encephalomyelitis, and human immunodeficiency virus, mostly due to induction of neuroinflammation and/or hypoxic brain injury with structural/functional damage within the basal ganglia

 </sup> (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In addition, debated evidence suggests that previous infection with herpes simplex 1, Epstein-Barr, varicella zoster, hepatitis C, and influenza A virus can increase the risk of developing PD in the long-term

 </sup>. Although the “viral hypothesis“ was generally ignored after the discovery of genetic mutations involved in PD pathogenesis, the role of “environmental” factors acting as peripheral triggers of the neurodegenerative process in susceptible individuals has been increasingly acknowledged
