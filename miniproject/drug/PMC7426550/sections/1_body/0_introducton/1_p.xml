<p>On January 10, 2020, the genome of a new coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was posted on the internet.
 <xref rid="b1-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It had been isolated days before from patients developing varying degrees of pneumonia in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in China.
 <xref rid="b2-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Immediately thereafter, a growing number of scientists worldwide became deeply involved in analyzing its molecular details.
 <xref rid="b3-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> One of the major tasks that they focused on was synthetizing the proteins encoded by the viral RNA and deciphering their structure and function. Acutely aware of the pandemic potential of SARS-CoV-2, some of these scientists immediately alerted selected vaccine producers, with the hope of triggering a swift process for vaccine design and development.

 <xref rid="b5-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Once the protein amino acid composition and the post folding structure of close to 30 proteins in SARS-CoV-2 were defined, multiple computational searches were launched by a number of institutions, looking to repurpose extant drugs aimed against the newly discovered molecular targets.
 <xref rid="b6-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In parallel to this accelerated research, there was a marked and frightening spread of this new coronavirus throughout Wuhan to a widening area in China, and it was subsequently exported to a rapidly growing list of countries worldwide.
