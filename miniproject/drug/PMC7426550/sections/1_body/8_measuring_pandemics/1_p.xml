<p>The COVID-19 pandemic exemplifies the difficulties encountered when attempting to quantify the important numerical parameters of the disease. First of all, when trying to count the number of infected cases, this parameter is significantly underestimated, primarily because the proportion of people who are asymptomatic or suffering from mild disease are not yet known.

 <xref rid="b67-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">67</xref> The same problem arises when attempting to calculate the basic reproduction number, i.e. the number of persons who were infected by a certain patient. In this case, it is not easy to draw a line to those who should be considered a contact.
 <xref rid="b68-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">68</xref> A similar bias can interfere with calculation of the case fatality ratio, i.e. the proportion of infected persons who have died of COVID-19. In addition to underdetection of mainly asymptomatic patients, some deaths due to COVID-19 complications passed under the radar since the patients had not been tested for the virus. Last but not least, the sensitivity and specificity of viral tests are not 100%, resulting in occasional false negative or false positive results.

 <xref rid="b70-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">70</xref> In order to retrospectively estimate the number of infected persons, serologic tests are performed that measure the presence of specific IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Currently, there are many ongoing seroprevalence studies of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; however, the picture remains incomplete regarding the significance of these findings as markers of previous infections.
