<p>The external surface of SARS-CoV-2 has multiple protruding elements called spike proteins which, after manipulation by host cell enzymes (furin and TMPRSS2), function as anchors for attachment to the host cells.

 <xref rid="b13-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The cell surfaces of the upper and lower respiratory tract are covered with angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors, which are physiologically involved in blood pressure regulation.
 <xref rid="b13-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, these receptors are also present in many other organs and tissues, helping to explain some of the extra-respiratory manifestations of COVID-19.
 <xref rid="b14-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Once attached to the external membrane, SARS-CoV-2 covers itself with a portion of the host cell membrane and becomes an intracellular endosome. This structure undergoes partial uncoating allowing the release of gRNA into the cytoplasm of the host cell. The released strands of gRNA attach to host ribosomes, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and together activate the gRNA replication mechanism. Other released strands of gRNA undergo translation into structural, non-structural, and coat proteins.
 <xref rid="b9-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The different basic blocks of the reproduced virus are finally assembled into multiple virions that are expelled to the extracellular space of the host.
 <xref rid="b9-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> These released daughter virions are now ready to infect other cells or, even worse, other hosts.
