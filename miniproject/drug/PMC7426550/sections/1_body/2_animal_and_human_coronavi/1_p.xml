<p>The first human coronavirus was described by June Dalziel Almeida in 1966. She had observed a viral structure seen under electron microscopy while being involved in a study investigating causes of the common cold. A paper submitted by Almeida and her team described a crown-shaped structure supposed to be a new type of virus causing common colds. This paper was rejected as the editors claimed that “these microscopic observations resulted from distorted influenza viruses.”
