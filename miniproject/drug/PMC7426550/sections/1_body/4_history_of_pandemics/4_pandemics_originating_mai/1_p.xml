<p>Yellow fever epidemics occur mainly in Africa and South America. The disease is transmitted by several species of mosquitoes, mainly by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. The disease life cycle has two possible scenarios: (1) the sylvatic cycle, where the hosts are various types of animals, primarily monkeys; and (2) the urban cycle, where the reservoir is human beings. Outbreaks occur mainly during the rainy season. Water accumulation, on land or in various objects, facilitates development of vector mosquitos. Other viruses transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> include dengue virus, Zika virus, and chikungunya virus.
