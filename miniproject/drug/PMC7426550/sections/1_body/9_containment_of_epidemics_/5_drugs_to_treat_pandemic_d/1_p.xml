<p>In general, with regard to the efficacy of antiviral treatments, viral infections can be divided into three groups: (1) infections lacking an effective antiviral therapy (e.g. SARS, yellow fever, measles); (2) infections in which antivirals do not cure the infection, but which do produce varying degrees of clinical improvement (e.g. influenza, AIDS, COVID-19); and (3) infections that can be cured by antiviral therapy (e.g. Ebola, hepatitis C).
