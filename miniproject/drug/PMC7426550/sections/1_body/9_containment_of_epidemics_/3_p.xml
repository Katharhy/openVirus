<p>Following the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the health authorities of most countries imposed a lockdown with various intervals of delay from the first detected case(s) so as to contain the local spread of the virus. Subsequently, they also imposed the use of respiratory masks to reduce airborne transmission by infected persons and to prevent contagion among the uninfected population. Data from several countries have shown that the earlier and more stringent the lockdown was applied, the better the efforts in containing the pandemic.
