<p>The human coronavirus was first diagnosed in 1965 by Tyrrell and Bynoe from the respiratory tract sample of an adult with a common cold cultured on human embryonic trachea.
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Naming the virus is based on its crown-like appearance on its surface.
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses belonging to the Nidovirales order, which includes Coronaviridae, Arteriviridae, and Roniviridae families.
 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Coronavirus contains an RNA genome and belongs to the Coronaviridae family.
 <xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This virus is further subdivided into four groups, ie, the α, β, γ, and δ coronaviruses.
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> α- and β-coronavirus can infect mammals, while γ- and δ- coronavirus tend to infect birds.
 <xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Coronavirus in humans causes a range of disorders, from mild respiratory tract infections, such as the common cold to lethal infections, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The coronavirus first appeared in the form of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in Guangdong province, China, in 2002
 <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> followed by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) isolated from the sputum of a 60-year-old man who presented symptoms of acute pneumonia and subsequent renal failure in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In December 2019, a β-coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization (WHO) has named the new disease as Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee has named it as SARS-CoV-2.
