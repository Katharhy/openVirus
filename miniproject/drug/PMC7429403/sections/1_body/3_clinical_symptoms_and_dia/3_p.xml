<p>Testing for antibody response to infection is usually based on measuring immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG). In serological studies immunoglobulin A (IgA) and total antibodies may also be measured. Most tests evaluate both IgM and IgG. IgM usually increases rapidly with infection and decreases soon after the clearance of infection. IgG is thought to increase more slowly and may even remain stable thereby representing longer-term immunity. Antibody assays are likely to be available in laboratories in the form of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or point-of-care tests by a disposable device using one or two blood drops from thumb prick upon a testing strip, which takes about 10 minutes.
