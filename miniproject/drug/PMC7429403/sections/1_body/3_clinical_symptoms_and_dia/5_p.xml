<p>Recent chest CT scan findings of COVID-19 pneumonia show as multifocal unilateral or bilateral ground glass opacity (GGO) or mixed GGO and consolidation mostly peripherally located. GGO is generally seen in the primary days and advance to the consolidation in the following days. Generally, lymphadenopathy is not seen, and pleural effusion is rare and mild. Generally, a normal chest CT scan may be useful in ruling out COVID-19.
