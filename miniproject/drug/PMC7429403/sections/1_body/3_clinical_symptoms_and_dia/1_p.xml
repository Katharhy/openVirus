 <xref rid="cit0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Fever is considered as the dominant symptom, however, it is not always the initial symptom of infection.
 <xref rid="cit0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Other symptoms include headache, sputum production, diarrhoea, dyspnoea, and lymphopenia.
 <xref rid="cit0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> At the beginning, infection rapidly advances to organs resulting in symptoms such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock, acute kidney failure, acute cardiac failure, and even death in severe cases. Patients may demonstrate normal or lowered white blood cell counts, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia with greater thromboplastin activation time, and raised C-reactive protein level
