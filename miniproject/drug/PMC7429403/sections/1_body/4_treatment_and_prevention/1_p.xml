<p>To date, there have been no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines to combat COVID-19, and treatment is merely provided as supportive and palliative approaches, as well as several antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs care at the clinic. However, WHO has announced that the COVID-19 vaccine is expected to be launched in the next 18 months.
 <xref rid="cit0068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref> Supportive therapy for patients with coronavirus is one of the most important principles along with other treatments for patient management, including oxygen therapy, fluid retention, and the use of antibiotics to avoid secondary bacterial infections.
 <xref rid="cit0065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> The use of antiviral drugs is another treatment for COVID-19. In one study, remdesivir has been used to treat COVID-19 patients and favorable results have been achieved in vitro.
 <xref rid="cit0069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref> It is also possible that antiviral agents such as ribavirin, galidesivir, and favipiravir, which are nucleoside analogues, could be clinically used to treat coronaviruses.
 <xref rid="cit0070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref> EIDD-2801 (β -D-N4-hydroxycytidine-5′-isopropyl ester) can be considered as a drug for the treatment of COVID-19 infection due to its high efficacy properties against respiratory infections such as seasonal influenza virus and pandemic influenza.
 <xref rid="cit0072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref> Arbidol is another antiviral drug used against some viruses such as influenza A and B, hepatitis C and SARS-CoV viruses. For this reason, in a study, Arbidol and Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir) were used against COVID-19, and according to the results, Arbidol had a better therapeutic effect and was able to reduce the prevalence of severe cases. Oral administration of ritonavir, lopinavir, oseltamivir, and intravenous administration of ganciclovir for 3–14 days were also helpful in 75 patients.
 <xref rid="cit0073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref> In addition, chloroquine has been shown to have an immune-suppressive activity and is effective in vitro and in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.
 <xref rid="cit0074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref> In Chinese medicine, it has been suggested that the use of a decoction such as Shuanghuanglian oral liquid (Sol) can inhibit COVID-19 by lung detoxification and clearance.
 <xref rid="cit0076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref> Sol contains active ingredients such as forsythin, baicalin, and chlorogenic acid with inhibitory properties against a variety of viruses and bacteria by reducing inflammatory responses.
 <xref rid="cit0077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref> Natural herbal medicine Lianhuaqingwen capsule has also antiviral properties, regulates immune responses, and reduces inflammatory factors in the early stages of infection.
 <xref rid="cit0079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref> Natural compounds such as flavonoids, Glycyrrhizin, diarylheptanoids, and cinanserin, which inhibit main coronavirus enzymes involved in replication, can be considered as attractive options for COVID-19 treatment.
 <xref rid="cit0080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref> Immunoenhancement therapy is one of the treatment methods that employs recombinant interferon, thymosin alpha-1 (Ta1), Thymopentin, Levamisole, Cyclosporine A, and intravenous immunoglobulin against viral infections.
 <xref rid="cit0082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref> Previous studies have shown that recombinant interferon-alpha affects MERS, suggesting its possible effectiveness against COVID-19.
 <xref rid="cit0083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref> Intravenous immunoglobulin is an immunomodulator used for all ages that enhances the production of anti-inflammatory mediators and inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
 <xref rid="cit0084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref> Ta1 is also an immune system booster that has been effectively used in SARS outbreaks.
 <xref rid="cit0085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref> Intravenous immunoglobulin and Ta1 may be considered as an effective treatment for COVID-19.
 <xref rid="cit0082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref> Combining thalidomide (an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory agent) with a low-dose of glucocorticoids in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia showed immune-regulating effects, inhibited inflammatory cytokines, relieved vomiting, and reduced anxiety, oxygen consumption, as well as lung exudation.
 <xref rid="cit0086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref> In the lack of specific vaccines and antiviral drugs for COVID-19, convalescent plasma therapy is an appropriate way to reduce the severe form of the disease.
 <xref rid="cit0087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref> In previous studies, plasma therapy against SARS and influenza resulted in reduced mortality and shorter hospital stay.
 <xref rid="cit0088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref> Most patients recovered from COVID-19 produce specific antibodies against the virus that can limit COVID-19 reinfection. Therefore, plasma of recovered patients can be considered as a potential treatment option.
 <xref rid="cit0082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref> Another treatment option is extracorporeal blood purification, which can be used to treat severe n-CoV pneumonia cases,
 <xref rid="cit0090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref> which can eliminate cytokine storms as well as inflammatory agents, and maintain acid-base balance in patients with COVID-19.
 <xref rid="cit0091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref> The recombinant monoclonal antibody is another important treatment option against respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV. Various recombinant monoclonal antibodies, including CR3022, m396, and CR3014, have been used against human coronavirus that can be considered as therapeutic candidates for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
 <xref rid="cit0065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> The WHO recommends that steroids and methylprednisolone can be used for patients with COVID-19 only in the acute stage of respiratory distress syndrome as they prolong viral shedding in patients.
