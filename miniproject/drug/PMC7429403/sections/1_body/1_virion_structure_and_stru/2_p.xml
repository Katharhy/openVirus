<p>Using genomic analysis of coronavirus 2019 isolates from patients COVID-19 in China and the USA, Malik et al
 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> reported that the length of the S protein sequence in this new virus was different from that of other Î²-coronaviruses. The major differences of S protein in novel Coronavirus (nCoV) compared with SARS-CoV include three short insertions at the N-terminal region, and four changes in the receptor-binding motif within the receptor-binding domain.
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Recent studies have reported that the binding capacity of n-CoV S protein with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is as efficient as SARS-CoV, which further raises the possibility of human-to-human transmission.
