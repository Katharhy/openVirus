<p>Coronavirus is a medium-sized spherical RNA virus, with a diameter of about 80–160 nm, which can be observed using an electron microscope.
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> This virus has the largest viral RNA (30 kb in length), which is single-stranded, positive in sense, and polyadenylated.
 <xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The coronavirus genome encodes five protein structures, including the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) glycoproteins, hemagglutinin esterase (HE), and nucleocapsid (N) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2</xref>). N, M, S and E proteins are present in all virions, while, HE is only present in some β-coronaviruses.
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The S glycoproteins outside of the virions are homotrimers with crown-like structures, accounting for the name of the virus.
 <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> These homotrimeric glycoproteins belong to class 1 fusion proteins
 <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> that mediate binding host cell receptors.
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> S protein of betacoronavirus (β-CoV) is critical for cross-species transmission as it mediates virus-receptor recognition and viral pathogenesis. The receptor-binding domain is located on the N-terminal of S protein and is necessary for the penetration of β-CoV into the host cells. Moreover, cross-species transmission and severity of the infection are affected via the mutations in CoV RBD.
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> M glycoproteins have three transmembrane regions
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> leading to the fusion of the virion into the cell and the emergence of antigenic protein that is involved in shaping the viral structure.
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The N protein is the only protein present in nucleocapsid,
 <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> which contributes to the formation of a complex structure by binding genomic RNA.
 <xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> E glycoproteins are small proteins comprised of about 76 to 109 amino acids.
 <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> These glycoproteins play an essential role in the assembly and morphogenesis of virions within the cell.
 <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> E glycoproteins can act as ion channels which are considered necessary for pathogenesis.
 <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The HE acts as a hemagglutinin, binds sialic acids on surface glycoproteins, and has an acetyl-esterase activity.
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Apparently, these activities enhance S protein-mediated cell entry and virus extension through the mucosa.
