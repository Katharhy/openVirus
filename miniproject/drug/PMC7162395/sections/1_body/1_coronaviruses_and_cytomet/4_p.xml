<p>Several studies have described the biological and immunological features of the previous coronavirus epidemics, and obviously, most researchers have used flow cytometry to describe the changes in T and B lymphocytes, as well as the role of inflammatory cells in the immunopathogenesis of the disease (reviewed in Ref. 
 <xref rid="cytoa24002-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>). Currently, very limited information is available on the host innate immune status of SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected patients and regard the description of increased total neutrophils, reduced total lymphocytes, and increased serum levels of IL‐6 and of C‐reactive protein, which suggest a strong inflammatory response. This is indeed evidenced by reports detecting abnormally high plasma levels of innate cytokines such as IP‐10, MCP‐1, MIP‐1A, and TNFα or of high levels of proinflammatory cytokines (including IL‐2, IL‐7, IL‐10, G‐CSF, IP‐10, MCP‐1, MIP‐1A, and TNFα). Furthermore, mortality is higher in patients with elevated levels of IL‐6

The overall picture is similar to what happens during SARS and MERS and underlines the fact that leukocyte alterations and a cytokine storm that initiates a viral sepsis could be important in the pathogenesis of Covid‐19. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, as of middle of March 2020 no data have been published on the specific cellular immune response to SARS‐CoV‐2. The first data on changes in lymphocyte populations in patients severely affected by Covid‐19 indicate a low T cells count, an increase in naïve helper T cells and a decrease in memory helper T cells
