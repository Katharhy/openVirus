<p>Many viruses have existed in their natural reservoirs for a very long time without causing relevant problems to humans. However, in the last decades, there has been an increased spillover of viruses from natural hosts (like the bat) to intermediate hosts (like market civets and dromedary camels) and then to humans, likely because of human activities, including modern agricultural practices and urbanization. Coronaviruses are broadly distributed in humans and in other mammals, and there are at least seven viruses that have been able to pass from animals to humans, crossing the species barriers and infecting humans 
 <xref rid="cytoa24002-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>. Some of them are, however, relatively innocuous and cause the common cold, while those quoted here below are extremely dangerous for human health as they are highly pathogenic, able to be readily transmitted from human to human, and able to spread to multiple continents in a very short time. Thus, to cope with this epidemic, and to substantially contribute to the fight against SARS‐CoV‐2, we have to learn the lesson derived from two recent outbreaks caused by two other highly pathogenic coronaviruses.
