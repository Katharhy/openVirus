<p>In a relatively short time, Covid‐19 epidemics have spread all over Asia and presented itself in the United States (Snohomish County, Washington) on January 19

 <xref rid="cytoa24002-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, arriving from China through different routes. Italy, where a higher number of cases than in any other European country has been described in the first weeks of the epidemic, was different from many other countries in distributing and administering large numbers of SARS‐CoV‐2 tests, which were immediately provided free of charge (like all medical treatments and drugs, thanks to the public health system) after the first recognized case, in Lombardy, on February 20. Thus, in reality, the high rate of infection in Italy soon after the identification of the first case only reflected the high local rate of detection of a virus already spread over all Europe. Unfortunately, in several countries, such as Germany, France, UK, and United States, very few tests have been conducted at the beginning of the epidemic, so the real extent was initially missing. In some cases, tests are expensive, and it seems very unlikely testing will ever be free. Coupled with the fact that, in some countries, depending on the circumstances or on the type of job, workers do not have paid sick (or quarantine) leave, it is also likely that people who are asymptomatic or slightly sick, but infectious, will continue to go to work and will infect others. Clearly, this does not help in containing the Covid‐19 epidemic. Most countries are now coping very heavily with the virus, and evidence has emerged that the virus is circulating within local communities so that border‐based travel restrictions are now no longer able to control its unpleasant arrival.
