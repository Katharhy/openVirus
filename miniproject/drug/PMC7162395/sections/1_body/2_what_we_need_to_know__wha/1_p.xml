<p>There are several crucial clinical questions that urgently await an answer and that require strong and highly dedicated work by a community such as ours that certainly remembers the terrific contribution that has been made and is still given to the fight against HIV/AIDS 
 <xref rid="cytoa24002-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>. Thus, to begin: why do some patients get infected but do not develop any disease, while others die from the infection? Which are the protective factors, and which are the biomarkers that clinicians could use to predict, and eventually modify, the course of the disease? Assuming that the scant, available data are reliable, why do children seem to develop a milder form of Covid‐19, similar to what was described in the case of SARS? Can the immaturity of the immune system protect against immune‐mediated damages that could occur during Covid‐19? Which assays are useful to monitor the efficacy of an antiviral therapy? How can we help in developing a vaccine?
