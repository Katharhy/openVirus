<p id="para0001">Coronavirus, an enveloped virus belonging to the family of 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> which initially caused enzootic infections, has shown in the last decades to be capable of crossing the species barrier causing severe epidemics in humans. A novel flu-like coronavirus, emerging towards the end of 2019 and subsequently named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 [COVID-19]) has been associated with an epidemic initially focused in Wuhan, China 
 <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. From there, SARS-CoV-2 has spread quickly throughout China, infecting many thousands of people and causing more than 4,500 deaths 
 <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. However, in a globalize world, it immediately became well clear that this fearsome infection could not be confined to China only, but soon it spread to neighboring Asian countries and immediately after to more than 201 countries around the world, where more than 3,200,000 individuals have contracted SARS-CoV-2 and more than 230,000 of them have deceased (data updated on May 3, 2020) 
 <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. On march 11, WHO declared the rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak a pandemic and Italy is currently the country with the highest number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection after USA and this has generated an unprecedented health and social emergency. Unfortunately, no standardized therapy does exist for COVID-19 and a number of drugs for the use in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 are currently being investigated in a number of non-randomized or randomized trials. These agents include steroids, chloroquine, antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents 
 <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In addition, experiences from previous coronavirus epidemics indicate that convalescent plasma collected from recovered COVID-19 patients, containing antibodies specific against SARS-CoV-2 that can be delivered from donors to patients, could be a potentially effective therapeutic weapon
