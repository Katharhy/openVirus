<p>Peyer’s patches are observable at the intestinal epithelium as oval or round lymphoid follicles. They are considered as the immune sensors of the intestine, owing to their ability to transport luminal antigens and bacteria [
 <xref rid="B22-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Peyer’s patches are covered by specialized cells called microfold cells (M cells) that capture antigens from the lumen and present the antigens to antigen-presenting cells. Dendritic cells and macrophages can also directly sample the lumen by extending dendrites through transcellular M cell-specific pores [

However, there is currently no evidence on the incorporation of RS into Peyer’s patches through M cells.
