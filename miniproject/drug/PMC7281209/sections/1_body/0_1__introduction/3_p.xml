<p>Seaweeds have been traditionally consumed by people in East Asia. Recent studies have shown that seaweeds have health-promoting properties that make them suitable as functional foods. Fucoidan, a sulfated polysaccharide from brown seaweed, has been successfully isolated and has been reported to have anti-influenza virus activity [
