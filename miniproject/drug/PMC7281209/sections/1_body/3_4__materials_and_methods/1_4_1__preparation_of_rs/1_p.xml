<p>Crude RS was isolated from the hot water extract of 
 <italic>M. nitidum</italic> as previously described, with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B3-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. First, 4 g of crude extract was dissolved in 300 mL of H
 <sub>2</sub>O and treated with actinase E (Kaken Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) at 50 °C for 16 h; then, it was applied to a Cellufine A-200 (JNC, Tokyo, Japan) anion-exchange chromatography column, and it was successively eluted with 7 M urea in 2 M KCl. The fractions that tested positive in the phenol-H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> method for the determination of sugars were collected, dialyzed, and freeze-dried. The purified RS showed a single peak with a shoulder in front of the main peak (molecular weight: 5.6 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>) in gel permeation chromatography.
