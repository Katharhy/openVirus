<p>MDCK cell monolayers pre-cooled at 4 째C for 2 h were infected with IFV at 4 째C for 1 h in the absence of RS. After washing 3 times with ice-cold PBS, the cell monolayers were incubated at 37 째C in the medium containing RS. At 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h after a temperature shift to 37 째C, the cell monolayers were treated with a 40 mM citrate buffer (pH 3.0) for 1 min to inactivate uninternalized viruses, and they were then overlaid with the medium for plaque assay.</p>
