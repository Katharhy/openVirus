<p>In this study, we demonstrated that RS obtained from 
 <italic>Monostroma nitidum</italic> exerted potent inhibitory effects on the proliferation of enveloped viruses including IFV, HSV-1, HSV-2, HCMV, measles virus, mumps virus, HIV, and human coronavirus (
 <xref rid="marinedrugs-18-00254-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). RS showed high selective toxicity against IFV proliferation based on our calculated SI values. Furthermore, RS exhibited more potent antiviral activity when added before infection than when added after infection. Through in vitro experiments, we have demonstrated that the targets of RS in the IFV replication cycle are adsorption to and penetration into the cells. However, based on the results that show that RS interferes with the early steps of IFV infection, we failed to evaluate the effects of topical administration in vivo. A model to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment and the prevention of IFV infection by the topical administration of RS may be designed to further examine the effects of RS on influenza in the future.
