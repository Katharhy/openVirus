<p>Taken together, we have shown that RS has an antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of enveloped viruses, such as HSV-1, HSV-2, HCMV, measles virus, mump virus, IFV, HIV, and human coronavirus. Although we have not tested on other types of coronaviruses yet, we suppose that RS might also exert an antiviral effect on them through a similar mechanism. Further examination shows that RS inhibits the early steps of influenza virus infection and enhances neutralizing antibody production. RS is also able to protect immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice from lethal influenza challenge. We also demonstrate that RS is incorporated into the Peyerâ€™s patch through the M cells, which possibly accounts for its ability to enhance antibody production. Therefore, RS may be a potential tool for combatting influenza virus infection and other enveloped viruses. Future studies may be conducted to further examine its effects on other enveloped viruses and for other strains of influenza viruses.</p>
