<p>To clarify the most sensitive step of IFV replication in the presence of RS, time-of-addition experiments were performed. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-18-00254-f001">Figure 1</xref>, pretreating host cells for 3 h prior to viral infection did not markedly inhibit IFV replication. In addition, no marked inhibition of viral replication was observed when RS was added during virus infection at 1 h, 3 h, or 6 h post-infection. RS suppressed virus production most efficiently only when added during infection for 1 h and at the same time of infection and throughout the subsequent incubation.
