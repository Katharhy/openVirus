<p>To show the effects of RS treatment on immunocompetent and immunocompromised IFV-infected (2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU/50 μL) mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 16–21 per treatment group), we induced the immunocompromised state by frequent injections with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Among 16–21 mice, we used 6–10 mice to evaluate the effects of RS or oseltamivir on body weight and lethality both on immunocompetent and immunocompromised IFV-infected mice. In the control group (orally administered with water), the immunocompetent mice without 5-FU treatment (5-FU (-) mice) and immunocompromised mice with 5-FU treatment (5-FU (+) mice) showed approximately 20% and 30% reduction in body weight, respectively, 8 days after infection (

The 5-FU (-) mice administered with oseltamivir showed no marked weight loss. The oseltamivir-treated 5-FU (+) mice had a 5% reduction of body weight from 7 to 9 days after infection and had recovered by 11 days after infection.
