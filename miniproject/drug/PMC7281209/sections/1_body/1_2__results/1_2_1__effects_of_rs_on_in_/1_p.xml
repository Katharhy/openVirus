<p>To assess the antiviral spectrum of RS, we examined its effects on the growth of different host cells and on the replication of different viruses. Representative enveloped viruses (herpes simplex virus 1, HSV-1; HSV-2; human cytomegalovirus, HCMV; measles virus; mumps virus; IFV; human immunodeficiency virus, HIV; and human coronavirus) and non-enveloped viruses (adenovirus, poliovirus, coxsackie virus, and rhinovirus) from different taxonomical groups were used in this study. The half-maximal cell growth inhibitory concentration of RS for each cell type (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) and the half-maximal effective concentration of RS for each virus (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) were determined (
 <xref rid="marinedrugs-18-00254-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The selectivity indices (SIs) against the viruses were calculated (SI = CC
 <sub>50</sub>/EC
 <sub>50</sub>) and are also presented in 
 <xref rid="marinedrugs-18-00254-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. SI values higher than 10 were considered suggestive of antiviral activity. RS showed potent antiviral activities against enveloped viruses (HSV-1, HSV-2, HCMV, measles virus, mump virus, IFV, HIV, and human coronavirus) based on their SIs. On the other hand, RS showed little or no antiviral activity against the non-enveloped viruses (adenovirus, poliovirus, coxsackie virus, and rhinovirus).
