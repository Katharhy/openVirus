  <p>Effects of RS and oseltamivir on mouse body weight change. IFV-infected mice were subcutaneously injected with or without 5-FU, and they were orally administered with water (open and closed circles; control), 5 mg RS (open and closed triangles), or 0.5 mg oseltamivir (open and closed squares) per day. Changes in body weight in 5-FU (-) mice (
   <bold>a</bold>) and 5-FU (+) mice (
   <bold>b</bold>) are shown (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6â€“11). Bodyweight on the day of viral infection (0 d) was taken as 100%.
