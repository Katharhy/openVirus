  <p>Effects of RS on virus adsorption and penetration. (
   <bold>a</bold>) For viral adsorption inhibition assays, Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell suspensions were infected with IFV (1 PFU/cell) in the absence or presence of RS (20 or 50 μg/mL) at 4 °C for 1 h prior to plaque assays. (
   <bold>b</bold>) In viral penetration assays, cell monolayers were infected at 4 °C with IFV in the absence of RS, and then shifted to 37 °C to allow virus penetration in the presence of RS for indicated time. Virus titers were determined by the plaque assay. Closed diamond, no drug control; closed square, 20 μg/mL RS; and closed triangle, 50 μg/mL RS. The number of plaques in the control 6 h after temperature shift was assigned as 100%. Each value is the mean ± S.D. from triplicate assays.
