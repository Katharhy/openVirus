<p>In patients with severe COVID-19, but less so in patients with mild disease, lymphopenia is commonly observed, with drastically reduced numbers of B cells, helper (i.e. CD4
 <sup>+</sup>) T cells (THs), cytotoxic (i.e. CD8
 <sup>+</sup>) T cells (CTLs) and NK cells. These patients also have an increased percentage of neutrophils and a decreased percentage of monocytes, eosinophils and basophils ([

 <sup>+</sup> T cells show signs of functional exhaustion, the extent of which is directly proportional to disease severity. During recovery from COVID-19, the numbers of B cells, THs, CTLs and NK cells as well as exhaustion marker expression in cytotoxic lymphocytes normalise ([
