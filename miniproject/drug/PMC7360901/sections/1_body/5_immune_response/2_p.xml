<p>In the large majority of persons, infection with SARS-CoV‑2 is rapidly and efficiently controlled by the immune system and remains (largely) confined to the upper respiratory tract. As a consequence, these people develop no or only mild disease. However, in a small percentage of infected individuals the lower respiratory tract also becomes infected, accompanied by hyperinflammation and overactivation of the immune system, leading to excessive production of cytokines and accumulation of immune cells in the lungs. Due to the severe injury caused by the virus and by the immune system to the airway epithelial cells and the underlying endothelial cells, the alveolar-capillary barrier is broken, resulting in vascular leakage, alveolar oedema/collapse and ARDS. This may be followed by further clinical deterioration and ultimately cause death as a result of multi-organ damage/failure due to secondary SARS-CoV‑2 and bacterial infections and immune-mediated mechanisms.</p>
