<p>Serological tests are particularly useful in surveillance and containment programmes and for epidemic forecasting. They can also be used for assessment of immunity resulting from natural infection or active immunisation. However, it is not yet clear to what extent Ig levels correlate with protective immunity. In this respect, virus neutralisation assays (e.g. plaque reduction and tissue culture infectious dose assays) may be more informative. In these cell culture assays, virus is mixed with (different dilutions) of patientâ€™s (or control) serum and added to susceptible cells to determine whether the serum contains antibodies that can inhibit virus infection.</p>
