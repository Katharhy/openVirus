<p>Different studies report somewhat different times after the onset of symptoms at which the first antibodies against SARS-CoV‑2 proteins are detected. Moreover, the extent and kinetics of the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV‑2 varies between individuals. This may relate to differences in infectious dose but also be the result of inherited and acquired differences in their immune system. In most studies, IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV‑2 S and N proteins are first detected at roughly the same time, i.e. a few days after the onset of symptoms. IgM and IgG levels peak at 2–3 weeks after illness onset and drop faster afterwards for IgMs (see also above). Serological tests alone can thus not be used to establish with certainty that a person is infected with SARS-CoV‑2. The formats of antibody detection tests are similar to those of the antigen detection assays except that viral proteins (most S or N, but sometimes also whole virus lysates) serve as bait.</p>
