<p>An alternative method to confirm active infections is by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). This assay detects viral protein (i.e. antigen) in clinical specimens after lysis of the cells and virus particles in the sample. The resulting solution is applied to a well coated with a so-called capture antibody specific for one of the virion proteins. Next, an antibody recognising another epitope of the same virion protein (the so-called detection antibody) is applied to the well, followed by an enzyme-conjugated third antibody directed against the detection antibody. A colourless substrate is then added to the well, which can be converted by the enzyme into a coloured product that is detected with a colorimeter. The amount of coloured product that is generated correlates with the amount of virus present in the clinical specimen. Since a sandwich ELISA is a laborious procedure requiring multiple washing steps after each addition, which are usually performed automatically, this method is unsuitable for point-of-care testing. This has led to the development of immunochromatography strips for fast instrument-free testing employing capillary movement (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). These strips contain a sample pad for specimen application followed by a conjugate pad containing an antigen-specific antibody linked to, for example, colloidal gold or latex particles (first antibody). If the sample contains antigens, complexes are formed with the first antibody, which migrate to the so-called test line, where a fraction of these complexes are bound by another antigen-specific antibody covalently attached to the strip (second antibody), resulting in the formation of a coloured line. The remaining complexes and non-complexed first antibodies migrate further until they reach the so-called control line, which contains covalently attached antibodies recognising the first antibody (third antibody). This results in the formation of a second coloured line, irrespective of the presence of antigen in the clinical specimen.
