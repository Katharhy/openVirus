<p>RT-qPCR-based laboratory assays on upper or lower respiratory tract samples are presently the standard tests to detect ongoing SARS-CoV‑2 infections. RNA-virus detection by RT-qPCR is a multistep procedure involving the extraction of RNA from the clinical specimen, the preparation of DNA copies of the extracted RNA by an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, the logarithmic amplification of viral sequences in a so-called thermocycler using a thermostable DNA polymerase and virus-specific DNA primers and the real-time detection of the amplification products using fluorescence-based methods (see, for example,
