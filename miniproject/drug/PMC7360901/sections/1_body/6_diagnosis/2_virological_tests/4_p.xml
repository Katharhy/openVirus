<p>In general, antigen detection assays are less sensitive than genome detection methods, resulting in a higher rate of false-negative results. Moreover, whereas RT-qPCR tests and sandwich ELISAs can provide a reasonable estimate of virus load, immunochromatography tests do not allow accurate quantitative analyses. In early infections, the amount of SARS-CoV‑2 in specimens from the upper part of the respiratory tract may be too low to be detected and repeated sampling may be necessary. Virological tests are not only instrumental in determining whether somebody is infected with SARS-CoV‑2 but also can be used for monitoring disease progression (by taking samples at different sites), to identify virus shedders and for taking de-isolation decisions.</p>
