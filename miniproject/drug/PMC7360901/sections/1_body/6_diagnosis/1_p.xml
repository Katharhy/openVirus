<p>Diagnostic assays for COVID-19 fall into two categories: (1) tests to detect viral components, i.e. SARS-CoV‑2 RNA or protein; (2) assays to measure adaptive immunity (i.e. antibodies and T lymphocytes) against SARS-CoV‑2 infection [

Although not specific, radiography to visualise lung disease, biomarker analysis to assess tissue/organ damage and inflammation, electron microscopy to visualise virus particles and virus infectivity assays to quantify functional virus particles can also aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19.
