<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) were first described in the 1930s and first visualised (by electron microscopy) in the 1960s [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. CoVs own their name to the pedal-shaped protrusions emerging from the surface of the virus particles (also called virions), which give them an appearance reminiscent of a crown. CoVs belong to the family of Coronaviridae, which is divided into two subfamilies. The main subfamily—Orthocoronavirinae—is subdivided into four genera, designated 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic>. CoVs generally have a limited host range and, with a few exceptions, cause either respiratory or enteric infections in mammals and birds. Until recently, six different human CoVs were distinguished, all of which primarily infect the respiratory tract (Tab. 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Of these viruses, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 are responsible for some 10–15% of the annual common colds [

Whereas infections with these viruses usually take a mild course this is not the case for infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, for which case-fatality rates of ~10 and ~35%, respectively, have been reported [
