<p>In several studies, SARS-CoV‑2 RNA has been demonstrated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis (see below) in stool and sewage, and occasionally infectious virus has been recovered from faecal samples [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Moreover, SARS-CoV‑2 has been shown to replicate in enterocytes of human small intestinal organoids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and the viral N has been detected by immunofluorescence microscopy in the cytoplasm of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelial cells but not in oesophageal epithelial cells of endoscopic biopsies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This raises the possibility of faecal transmission of SARS-CoV‑2, although formal evidence for this has not yet been obtained.
