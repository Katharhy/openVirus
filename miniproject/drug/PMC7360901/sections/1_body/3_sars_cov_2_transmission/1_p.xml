<p>In the absence of a SARS-CoV‑2 vaccine and protective immunity resulting from infections with endemic human CoVs, current efforts to bring the pandemic to a halt are focusing on the reduction of the basic reproduction number (R
 <sub>0</sub>), which is defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical infected individual during the entire infectious period in a completely susceptible (i.e. non-immune) population and without any deliberate actions to reduce disease transmission. Based on early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, Li et al. estimated the R
 <sub>0</sub> for SARS-CoV‑2 to be 2.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4–3.9) [
