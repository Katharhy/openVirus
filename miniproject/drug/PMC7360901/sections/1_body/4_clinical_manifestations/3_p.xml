<p>Chest radiography of 64 Chinese COVID-19 patients with RT-qPCR confirmation, showed abnormal X‑ray images in 69% of the patients.

Consolidation and ground-glass opacities were the dominant findings and mostly involved the periphery of the lower halves of both lungs [

Computed tomography (CT) scans of 81 confirmed COVID-19 patients before and ≤1 week, &gt;1–2 weeks and &gt;2–3 weeks after symptom onset revealed abnormalities in 2.8, 11.1, 13.0 and 12.1 of the 20 lung segments, respectively. CT image abnormalities rapidly evolved from predominantly focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 1–3 weeks [
