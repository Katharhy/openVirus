Although SARS-CoV‑2 particles/components have been detected in, for example, endothelial cells, the digestive tract and the liver, not all extrarespiratory manifestations of COVID-19 are necessarily caused by direct viral injury but may also be the consequence of the hypoxaemia, (hyper)inflammatory response, neuroendocrine imbalance and other pathophysiological changes induced by the airway infection [

Primarily intended for low- and middle-income countries, the Clinical Care for Severe Acute Respiratory Infection Toolkit of the World Health Organization is another excellent resource for managing adult and paediatric patients with severe forms of COVID-19 (
