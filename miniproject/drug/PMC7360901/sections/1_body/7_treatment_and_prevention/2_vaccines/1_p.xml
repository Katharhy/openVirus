<p>This has created a huge incentive for the development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV‑2 vaccine (see

Although there are currently no approved vaccines for human CoVs, the development of a vaccine for COVID-19 may benefit from (1) past and ongoing vaccine studies of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as (2) the successes and failures of animal CoV vaccines. This will, however, not obviate the need for extensive testing of candidate vaccines in appropriate animal models and clinical studies, especially since correlates of protection (e.g. neutralising antibody titres) may be different for different CoVs. The repertoire of SARS-CoV‑2 vaccines that is currently being developed comprises both replicating and non-replicating vaccines (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]). The non-replicating vaccines include (1) wild-type SARS-CoV‑2 particles inactivated by chemical treatment or high-energy radiation, (2) non-replicating viral vectors directing the expression of one or more SARS-CoV‑2 antigens, (3) virus-like particles (i.e. assemblies of one or more of the viral envelope proteins often with a lipid envelope), (4) mRNA or plasmid DNA encoding one or more viral proteins (in particular the S protein as the principal target of virus-neutralising antibodies), (5) subunit vaccines consisting of (parts of) the S protein in monomeric or trimeric form and (6) vaccines based on synthetic peptides representing viral antigenic determinants/epitopes. As these ‘dead’ vaccines are generally less immunogenic than ‘live’ vaccines, they are often administered together with an adjuvant to boost the immune response and to stimulate long-term immunological memory. The inclusion of an adjuvant may not be needed for the non-replicating viral vector- and nucleic-acid-based vaccines, as these vaccines will mediate de novo synthesis of SARS-CoV‑2 antigens inside target cells and therefore may induce a stronger immune response. One obvious advantage of especially inactivated virus- and nucleic-acid-based vaccines is that they can be produced in large amounts in a relatively short time. The replicating vaccines comprise (1) attenuated versions of SARS-CoV‑2 generated by serial passage in cultured cells or by genetic engineering and (2) replicating viral vectors encoding one or more SARS-CoV‑2 antigens. Although ‘live’ vaccines usually confer more durable and robust protection against disease than ‘dead vaccines’, their development time is generally much longer. Moreover, attenuated virus vaccines require extensive safety assessment to exclude the early appearance in vaccinees of variants/mutants that have regained their (full) disease-causing potential. More information about the pros and cons of the different types of vaccines and their effects in pre(clinical) studies can be found in various recent reviews [
