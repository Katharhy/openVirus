<p>Rather than trying to prevent the development of SARS-CoV-2-related sickness by arming the immune system through vaccination, another strategy consists of thwarting the virus once an infection has revealed itself by the administration of antiviral drugs to the patient. Due to (1) the lack of approved drugs directed against human CoVs and (2) the long times involved in the development and evaluation of new antiviral agents, the main focus is currently on repositioning existing drugs designed for other (viral) diseases to treat COVID-19 patients [

In addition, unapproved drugs showing antiviral activity in animal models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are being tested for the ability to inhibit SARS-CoV‑2 replication. Mechanistically, anti-SARS-CoV‑2 drugs exert their beneficial effect by inhibiting crucial steps in the viral life cycle like receptor binding, envelope fusion, polyprotein processing and RNA-dependent RNA synthesis (Fig.
