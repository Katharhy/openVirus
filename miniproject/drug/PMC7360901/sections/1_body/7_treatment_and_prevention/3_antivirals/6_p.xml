<p>An alternative to the inhibition of viral proteins/processes is the suppression of host cell factors/processes required by the virus. Obvious targets are the SARS-CoV‑2 attachment receptor ACE2 and the host proteases involved in the processing of the S protein to render it fusion competent. However, care should be taken that antagonists of these host proteins do not interfere with vital physiological processes. Early activation of cellular defence systems could also be an effective means to suppress SARS-CoV‑2 replication. One possibility would be to treat patients with interferons, as these cytokines play an important role in the (1) development of early innate immune responses to viral infections, (2) activation of subsequent adaptive immune responses and (3) dampening of immunopathogenic mechanisms [
