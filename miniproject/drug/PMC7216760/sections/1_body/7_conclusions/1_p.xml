<p>Since 2003, the three pandemics caused by SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 are believed to have initiated as a result of bat coronaviruses crossing the species barrier. Therefore, other epidemics are likely to occur in the future due to the effectively unlimited supply of coronaviruses present in the bat population. Equally concerning is the fact that RNA viruses lack a genomic proof-reading mechanism and therefore are prone to mutation, raising the specter that once a new coronavirus begins circulating in the human population it will be extremely difficult to eliminate. Finally, for a drug to be most effective, it must reach its site of action (e.g., lung tissues) in sufficient quantity to clear the virus. With nearly three million reported cases, &gt;260,000 deaths, millions out of work, and billions of dollars in lost revenue, it appears that SARS-CoV-2 has altered daily life for a sustained period of time. This cascading effect has generated unprecedented momentum and scientific effort around the globe to fight this virus. Success will require creative thinking, new technologies, innovative approaches, particularly focused on speed to market, and combinations of different modalities to effectively combat not just the current foe but also future coronaviruses. We remain hopeful that we will be more prepared for the emergence of a potential “SARS-CoV-3”.</p>
