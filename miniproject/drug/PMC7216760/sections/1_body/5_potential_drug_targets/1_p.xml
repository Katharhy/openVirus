 </sup> The 1273 amino acid, 141 kDa, Spike protein is heavily N-glycosylated and is a major inducer of host immune responses. The 222 amino acid M protein has three transmembrane domains and is the most abundant structural protein in the virion. The 75 amino acid E protein is important for assembly and release of the virus. The 419 amino acid nucleocapsid protein forms a protective protein shell around the virus genetic material and is encased in a lipid envelope that is usurped from the host cell. Matrix protein connects the membrane to the nucleocapsid protein. There are also 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1â€“16)

 </sup> including several for which there are X-ray crystallography-derived structural data: RNA dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12, RdRp), a papain-like protease (nsp3, PLpro), the main protease (nsp5, 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, or M
 <sup>pro</sup>), and exonuclease/N7-methyltransferase (nsp14, ExoN). RdRp catalyzes synthesis of the full length negative-strand RNA template used by RdRp to make more viral genomic RNA. The SARS-CoV-2 genome also contains a number of open reading frames (ORFs): namely, ORF 1a proposed to encode nsp1 to nsp11; ORF1b, is proposed to encode nsp12 to nsp16, essential for viral replication, and ORFs 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9a, 9b, and 10, which encode for accessory proteins
