<p>The development of a manufacturable, safe, and effective vaccine may take 12–18 months. Several phase I clinical trials are currently recruiting participants to test the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of several investigational SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (

An mRNA vaccine based on the Spike protein began human clinical trials within a record 63 days from first publication of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence (NCT04283461). It has been suggested that the mutation rate for SARS-CoV-2 is expected to be low, raising hope that a successful vaccine will provide life-long immunity.

 </sup> Hyperimmune globulin isolated from the sera of convalescent patients having high titers of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 or even their whole blood may provide instant “passive” short-lived immunity mainly via viral neutralization. Antibody dependent therapy, for example targeting the Spike protein might represent the most efficient, near-term therapeutic intervention if regulatory and safety requirements can be addressed. With over 1.3 million positive cases of COVID-19 in the US based solely on the results of RNA molecular tests, large-scale antibody testing should be expedited to identify individuals who have been exposed to the virus but were never officially confirmed to have COVID-19. An understanding what levels of antibody confer immunity postinfection could be used to determine who may be less likely to transmit the virus and thus may be able to go back safely to work.
