<p>Developing highly selective SARS-CoV-2 specific new drugs will take many years. Alternatively, repurposing of existing, approved drugs can present a more rapid strategy to identifying drugs effective in treating COVID-19 (

 </sup> Repurposing of drugs that would block SARS-CoV-2 entry and/or replication are urgently needed to mitigate the symptomatic burden of the disease. Unfortunately, the HIV protease inhibitors ritonavir/liponavir failed to show efficacy in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

 </sup> Hydroxychloroquine, which may act by increasing the pH within lysosomes, was granted FDA authorization for use in emergency cases. Several antiviral agents are being tested such as the RdRp inhibitor remdesivir and the approved anti-influenza drug faviprivir.

 </sup> Remdesivir was previously tested in humans with Ebola virus disease and also in animal models of MERS and SARS-CoV.

 </sup> At least six clinical trials are evaluating remdesivir in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Other drugs that might inhibit RdRp include the broad-spectrum antiviral drug ribavirin. RdRp conservation among RNA virus families makes it an exciting target for the discovery of newer agents. The Spike protein, ACE2, and TMPRSS2 may also represent interesting therapeutic targets for current drug repurposing efforts. Camostat mesylate, approved in Japan for treatment of pancreatic inflammation, has been shown to block TMPRSS2 activity.

 </sup> Arbidol, which is hypothesized to block Spike/ACE2 binding, is being investigated clinically, and a clinical trial was recently launched to study the effect of thiazide, thiazide-like diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers in COVID-19 (NCT04330300). The availability of soluble recombinant hACE2 encouraged its testing in two clinical trials; although one was terminated (NCT04287686) the other is currently active (NCT04335136). Monoclonal antibodies, especially for interleukin-6 (IL-6) or its receptor, are also being considered for the control of SARS-CoV-2 associated respiratory exacerbations.

 </sup> Interestingly, several Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors such as baricitinib and ruxolitinib are currently being evaluated given their involvement in interleukin signaling pathways. Another currently recruiting clinical trial is testing quinolone, macrolide, and Î²-lactam antibiotics against COVID-19 (NCT02735707). Multiple groups have tested FDA approved drugs in various 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays as well as in computational screens. Many of these drugs show inhibitory activities, although not always at a concentration that may be safely achieved in patients.

 </sup> Controlled clinical trials of these agents are mandatory to assess their efficacy and safety without creating false positive hope or depleting the supplies of drugs needed to treat the diseases for which they were initially approved.
