 <p id="Par1">The whole world is currently facing a pandemic of an infectious disease known as novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)Â . This outbreak emerged unexpectedly and imposed a potential threat to humans, associated with the social and economic burden on the individual and federal governments. COVID-19, which initially started in Wuhan City of China and then spread to the whole world, has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The continuous increase in the number of confirmed cases leads to high mortality across the world. Growing evidence indicates that the mortality rate is very predominant in elderly people and those with preexisting health conditions. However, the potential pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is still unknown. The dysregulated/exuberant immune response may have substantially contributed to the SARS-CoV-2-mediated pathology. Nevertheless, there is no clinically approved drug/vaccine currently available that can restrict its pathogenesis. However, several drugs are currently shown to provide some therapeutic benefits for COVID-19 patients, including antiviral drugs that might have a significant role in restricting the current pandemic of COVID-19. In this article, we highlighted the pharmacological treatment strategies for COVID-19 and purposed the therapeutic targets for the development of vaccines or anti-viral drug molecules against SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.</p>
