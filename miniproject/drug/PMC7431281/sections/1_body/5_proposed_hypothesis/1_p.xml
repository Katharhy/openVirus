<p id="Par15">We propose a “Pitchfork self-defense hypothesis” where a varied and wide range of effects are observed among the infected population from mild symptoms to multiorgan failure leading to death. This all is owing to the flawed genome and incompetent immune system which acts as a rod for its own back in the rage of self-defense. The peculiar aspect is the reckless and speedy multiplication of virus resulting in the accumulation of monstrous viral copies which in turn calls for a “save the ship” signal activation. The defense system, sensing this as a hulking danger, apparently must be reacting in an exaggerated manner, deploying and marching its armed forces to the site of infection in the form of the cytokine storm syndrome. This storm would do more harm than good, engulfing the healthy RBCs and WBCs, and further inviting more of the type to the site of infection. Thus, this likely stimulates the blood vessels to leak out the immune cells in adjoining tissues, pouring fluid into the lungs. This pneumonia-like condition undoubtedly must be activating cell suicide in lung tissue and hence tearing off the alveoli. Air sacs failing to exchange gases would lead to chronic oxygen starvation which finally culminates in respiratory distress. Thus, in almost 100% of cases, the first critical clinical sign is respiratory unrest which fits in the said hypothesis perfectly. Once the blood vessels lose their fluid, a sudden drop in blood pressure is observed. This may probably be causing clogging of blood vessels and clotting of blood in several tissues leading to a shortage of blood supply and oxygen to the vital organs. This expectedly would have a shocking climax of multiple organ failure. But, interestingly, not all individuals meet with the same fate. Moreover, there are different categories into which individuals can be divided into, as follows: (1) extremely vulnerable category which includes people with an impaired immune system, a chronic respiratory condition, cancer, etc. who cannot afford a competent immune response and are sure to succumb to the disease; (2) high-risk category which includes old people, pregnant women, obese people, and diabetic patients, who are highly susceptible owing to low immunity; and (3) low-risk category which includes healthy and younger individuals who are well equipped to give a tough fight. Frontline workers (mainly doctors, workers, and police personnel) remain in the high-exposure zone and so have a greater chance of contacting COVID-19. Unreasonable and hectic service schedules make the fall prey to the virus since a tired and restless body temporarily loses on its immunity. But there are also reports where young, healthy, and shielded individuals were victimized to death due to COVID-19. The abnormal immune system rests on a faulty genome; thus, the strongest are selected and the defective perish. This can be explained with the present hypothesis in the sense that some immune defects remain latent and are expressed only when a virus triggers them. In the first few days of catching any infection majorly, natural killer cells and macrophages take charge in containing the pathogen and preventing against any severe damage in the body. In case these fail to fight out the infection, then B and T lymphocytes come in the picture and rage a stronger defense response [

(1) One of the most buttressing exemplar is that patients having impaired perforins (perforinopathies) tend to trigger a very severe cytokine storm. These perforins are stocked in natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Since perforins are glycoproteins that are critically responsible for pore formation in the host cell (infected with virus) causing immune cell-mediated death of the target cell, thus, reduced attenuated expression of perforins invites a cytokine storm. Thus, if such patients are provided with sufficient amounts of perforin, then it may help generate a healthy immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection. (2) Also IL-6 blocks the expression of granzyme B and perforins and prevents the killing of the viral-infected cell (experimentation studies on mice). Therefore, it is of concern to note that in COVID-19 patients succumbing to heart attack, IL-6 prevented the activity of STAT-5 signal transducer, thereby decreasing perforin levels. Thus, a treatment involving anti IL-6R would be quite effective against COVID-19 infection. In a nutshell, patients with weakened immune systems tend to show severe symptoms because of elevated levels of IL-6 mediated by poor perforin functionality [

It has been discovered by the Indo-US research team that the Indian population is better equipped with these killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor genes (KIR genes) and therefore can contain the infection in the initial stage itself. Thus, Indian populations are less susceptible to these infections and also confer Indians with stronger immunity against other viruses, autoimmune diseases, and even tumors [
