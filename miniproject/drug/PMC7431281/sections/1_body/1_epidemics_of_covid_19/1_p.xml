Although the disease is now better contained in the suspected origin, the USA has witnessed the biggest surge in coronavirus cases over the past few months which accounts for around one quarter of the total number of infections worldwide. The USA, Brazil, and India are the most affected countries, contributing about half of the COVID-19-infected people across the world [

However, the actual total death toll may be higher than the number of confirmed deaths, due to limited testing and problems in the attribution of the cause of death and the difference between reported confirmed deaths and total deaths that varies by country to country. Surprisingly, men are at a significantly higher risk of having severe symptoms and fatalities, compared to women [

If the current situation prevails for a longer duration and no therapeutic drug/vaccine is available, it is expected that almost one third of the world population may get infected and millions of deaths occur, worldwide.
