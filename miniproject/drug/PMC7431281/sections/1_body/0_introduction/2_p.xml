<p id="Par3">The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in December 2019 in Wuhan City of China and spread through human-to-human transmission across the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It continues to cause severe infections in humans, posing significant threats to global public health. China initially reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019. Further, on March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic and imposed Public Health Emergency of International Concern [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The fatality rate of coronavirus MERS-CoV was (34.77%) higher than that of SARS-CoV (10.87%); however, SARS-CoV-2 transmitted rapidly in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and accounts for 3.4% deaths all over the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The mortality rate of COVID-19 varies from one country to another. However, these fatality rates also vary with the age range of the infected persons. COVID-19 primarily spread through respiratory droplets. The manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infections ranges from fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, and, in a small population of patients, gastrointestinal infection symptoms to acute respiratory distress and pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The loss of taste (ageusia) and loss of smell (anosmia) as one of the major symptoms of COVID-19 was initially ignored. However, further studies demonstrated a significant presence of ageusia and anosmia in the patients with COVID-19 infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 infection is estimated to be 2–3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and the elderly people with underlying complications such as diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, cancer, etc. are more susceptible to severe infection and fatality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Currently, there is no clinically approved drug/vaccine for the treatment of this disease. All the health organizations across the globe are on high alert and treating COVID-19 patients with the available drugs used in other respiratory infections. However, several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This article highlighted the recent updates on the epidemiology, antiviral drugs used, and possible therapeutic strategies for the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 pathology.
