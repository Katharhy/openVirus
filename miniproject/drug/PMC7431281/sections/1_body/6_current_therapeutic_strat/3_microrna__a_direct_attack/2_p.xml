<p id="Par20">Recently, microRNA-5197-3p has been identified as the most valuable site for interaction with SARS-CoV-2, and complete complementary miRNA regions in the viral genome have been predicted. This proposed site lacks any side effect or competition and a synthetic microRNA constructed based on this template may act as a remarkable candidate for the treatment of COVID-19. These may then be packed into exosomes and either injected into the blood for multiple organ treatment or simply inhaled into the lungs through nebulizers. Antiviral miRNAs present in the host target specific genes of the virus and interfere with viral molecular processes vital for reproduction, namely replication, protein synthesis, and phenotypic expression. Thus, microRNAs are vital tools for tailoring and silencing viral genome as these complementarily bind to the viral genome and prevent their expression. It has been found that hsa-miR-27b is uniquely specific to only SARS-CoV-2 found in India, and so, Indian populations are naturally endowed with a miraculous antidote to this virus. Alnylam and Vir, two big companies, are working on temporarily silencing the ACE2 receptors using interference RNA technology. They believe that when there will be no receptors, then viruses would not be able to enter. But another big challenge is delivering these RNA molecules to the target site. It has been proposed that these microRNA would probably be packed in fat vesicles and inhaled in the form of a dry powder. But most researchers are skeptical about this as knocking down these vital blood pressure-regulating receptors may prove fatal. To speed up the emergency medical need of vaccines and therapies against COVID-19, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the USA has provided fast-track designation to Mrna Vaccine mRNA-1273 created by Moderna. It is in phase II of the clinical trial. Moderna is highly trusted as earlier it could fast-track the Zika vaccine.</p>
