<p id="Par19">The miRNAs are small, non-coding, single-stranded RNA molecules, which are known to modulate a variety of vital physiological processes including RNA silencing, post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression involved in cardiovascular development and health [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Several thousand human genes, amounting to about one third of the whole genome, are potential targets for regulation by the several hundred miRNAs encoded in the genome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. It is evident from the previous studies that novel miRNAs can be used as promising tools as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic drug targets for several diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. In the present context, microRNAs specifically mitochondrial microRNA can prove as a panacea. Silico analysis studies have been used to interpret which host microRNAs have complete complementarity with viral RNA so that viral RNA expression can be silenced.
