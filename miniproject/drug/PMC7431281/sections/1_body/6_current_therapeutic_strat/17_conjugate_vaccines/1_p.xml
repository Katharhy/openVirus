<p id="Par34">Sometimes viruses have some modulating or disguising outer envelope proteins that have the capacity to befool the host’s immune system by concealing their antigens. Thus, such viruses go unnoticed by the host defense system and invade different organs. Live or weakened vaccines generally do not work in such cases, and thus, conjugate or subunit vaccines are made by attaching a characteristic antigen from some other familiar pathogen on to the virulent virus’s coat. It works because the body’s immune system learns to recognize this masked virus as a potential threat in the light of a known pathogen, e.g., 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type B (Hib).
