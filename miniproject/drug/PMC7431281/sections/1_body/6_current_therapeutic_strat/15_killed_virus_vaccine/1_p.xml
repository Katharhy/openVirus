<p id="Par32">Viruses are border organisms that are categorized neither among living nor among dead as these become activated only when they get into a host body. Therefore, a dead virus simply means the one in which infective capacity is removed off so that they cannot enter our body. This can be done either by chemical alteration or by extreme temperature treatment. Thus, using such dead virus vaccines may serve our purpose, but this is not always the case as dead viruses possess different altered protein than one produced by the live virus and so they do not prove very effective. Examples are flu, hepatitis A, etc.</p>
