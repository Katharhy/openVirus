<p id="Par25">Reconstruction of live synthetic less virulent SARS-CoV-2 virus which may provide vaccine protection against COVID-19 is in the pipeline. This commendable project is being taken up by Tonix Pharmaceuticals which had earlier developed the horsepox virus vaccine on a similar plan. University of Alberta, Canada, has signed a licensing agreement with Tonix Pharmaceuticals. Their basic plan is to synthesize some antigen genes of SARS-CoV-2 to innervate T cell immune response. They have a license to create 3 vaccines for COVID-19, namely TNX-1810, TNX-1820, and TNX-1830. Currently, it is at the pre-investigation of new drug stage. This kind of vaccine no doubt can prove miraculous but at the same time may instigate certain criminal minds to construct deadly bioweapons.</p>
