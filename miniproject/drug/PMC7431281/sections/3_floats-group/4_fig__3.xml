  <p>Demonstration of viral entry mechanisms and proposed therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2. It uses human ACE2 receptor for entering the host cell by binding its surface spike protein mediated through proteolytic enzyme activity and receptor-binding domain (RBD). The RBD shows strong hACE2 binding affinity allowing SARS-CoV-2 to befool the host defense mechanism</p>
