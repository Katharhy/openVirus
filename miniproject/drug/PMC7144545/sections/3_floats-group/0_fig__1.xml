   <bold> a</bold> Severe acute respiratory syndrome- coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry into the cells is mediated by the binding of the viral spike (S) glycoprotein to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cells, followed by the proteolytic cut at the S
   <sub>1</sub>/S
   <sub>2</sub> site of the S glycoprotein by the host protease furin. ACE2 levels on the plasma membrane are regulated by ADAM17, which promotes the shedding of the protein. The Notch signalling is a positive regulator of furin and a negative regulator of ADAM17 (through the transcription of miRNA-145), and thus γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI), which prevents Notch activation, may represent a strategy to interfere with the virus entry into the cells by reducing furin and increase ADAM17 shedding. An antagomir to miRNA-145 could represent an alternative approach for upregulation of ADAM17. 
   <bold>b</bold> Notch precursor is cleaved by furin in the Golgi apparatus leading to a heterodimer on the plasma membrane consisting of Notch extracellular domain (NECD) and Notch transmembrane (TM), which contains the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). After the binding with the ligand, Notch is cleaved by ADAM (A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease) 10 or 17, and, after, by the γ-secretase complex. The resultant NICD translocates into the nucleus, where it interacts with the transcription factor CSL (CBF-1/RBP-Jk/Suppressor of hairless/Lag-1) and the transcriptional co-activator MAML (mastermind-like) to regulate the transcription of Notch target genes, such as HEY1 and 2, HES1, FURIN, and miRNA-145
