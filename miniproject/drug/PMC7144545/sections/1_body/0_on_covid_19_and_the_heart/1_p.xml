<p id="Par2">From January 2020, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread fast from China, mainly to Southwest Asia and Europe, especially to Italy, and it is now found everywhere around the world. The disease is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the seventh member of the coronavirus family which infects humans and to which Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS)-CoV and SARS-CoV also belong [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The classical clinical picture of COVID-19 is that of a flu-like syndrome of mild severity in most cases, but in 15% of cases it is complicated by interstitial pneumonia and a variable degree of respiratory failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The underlying pathological changes, responsible for the respiratory failure, have been characterised in two patients who underwent lung lobotomies for lung adenocarcinoma and were retrospectively found to be COVID-19 positive [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Among COVID-19-positive patients, there are those that consult the doctor for heart symptoms, such as palpitations or chest pain rather than respiratory problems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Little is known about a possible relationship between COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease. An early report on 99 patients hospitalised from 1st to 20th January 2020 at Jinyntan Hospital, Wuhan, China, for SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia, shows that pre-existing cardiovascular disease was present in 40% of them [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A second report from the same period of time on 138 patients hospitalised at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University shows that 26% of the patients required cardiologic intensive care. Among these patients, 16.7% developed arrhythmias and 7.2% experienced an acute coronary syndrome in addition to other complications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Furthermore, patients diagnosed with pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection showed an increase in high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I levels, suggesting myocardial injury [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Other published and anecdotal reports indicate the presence of myocarditis, cardiac arrest, and acute heart failure in SARS-CoV-2- infected patients. It is not clear whether these cardiac conditions are provoked by SARS-CoV-2 or are complications typical of any other pathology with higher cardio-metabolic demand, and thus unrelated to the viral infection. Epidemiological studies conducted during the flu epidemic in USA in 1990 show that influenza and its related complications, such as secondary pneumonia, may cause myocardial infarction due to inflammation-induced destabilisation of coronary artery plaques [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This results from multiple mechanisms, such as tachycardia, hypoxia, increased wall stress, and thrombophilia or release of inflammatory cytokines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. So, a possible causal link cannot be excluded.
