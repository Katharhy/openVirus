<p id="Par3">A similar link with myocardial infarction and acute heart failure was shown for the recent epidemics of SARS-CoV and MERS-nCoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In the absence of a specific treatment or a vaccine, which, according to experts, will not be ready before a year from now, there are only three possible remedies: (1) attempts to contain the spread of the infection with drastic and likely unpopular measures, such as quarantine or restriction of free movement in a specific area with the aim of getting the epidemic exhaust itself “naturally”. This, hopefully, should be facilitated by the coming of the summer in the Northern hemisphere; (2) supportive treatment of respiratory and cardiologic complications of the infection, including admission to intensive care units (ICUS) and use of mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); (3) proposal of novel approaches, based on evidence from a variety of fields of expertise, which could help in finding a possible therapy. With our short report, we would like to contribute with our experience on Notch signalling to the third option.
