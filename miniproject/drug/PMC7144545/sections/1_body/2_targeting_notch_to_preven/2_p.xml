 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Inhibition of Notch signalling could, then, be useful to reduce furin levels and interfere with viral entry into the cell. Since Notch dysregulation is a feature of the majority of cancers, Notch inhibitors that target the γ-secretase are available and are being tested, with manageable gastrointestinal toxicity, in several clinical trials in cancer patients. Favorable response has been so far obtained in a limited number of patients indicating that it will be crucial to develop new strategies to identify “responders” to Notch inhibition-based cancer therapies [
