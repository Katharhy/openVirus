<p id="Par10">Notch1-dependent enhancement of furin activity activates ADAM10 but not ADAM17 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], suggesting that Notch1 does not control ADAM17. Nevertheless, a study on abdominal aorta showed that ADAM17 expression is downregulated by the γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) DAPT [
 <italic>N</italic>‐(
 <italic>N</italic>‐[3,5‐difluorophenacetyl]‐
 <sc>l</sc>‐alanyl)‐
 <italic>S</italic>‐phenylglycine 
 <italic>t</italic>‐butyl ester]) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Since GSIs with different specificities toward each isoform of Notch exist [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], more of these compounds could be tested to investigate their effects on ADAM17 and, possibly, on ACE2 shedding. Of interest, miRNA-145, which downregulates ADAM17 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], is a target of Jagged1/Notch1 signalling in vascular smooth muscle cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It would be of interest to investigate whether antagomir to miRNA-145 would increase ADAM17 activity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a).
