<p id="Par8">The Notch signalling pathway plays a major role in controlling cell fate during the development and in postnatal life [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Growing evidence shows that the Notch signalling is involved in maintaining the homeostasis of the cardiovascular system and could represent a novel target to reduce atherosclerosis progression [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In humans, there are four receptors (Notch1–4) activated by binding with ligands (Jagged1,2 and Delta-like ligands (Dll)1,3,4) on the surface of adjacent cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Notch precursor is first cleaved by furin in the Golgi apparatus and then is found as a heterodimer on the cell membrane. Following ligand binding, Notch is first cleaved at the cell membrane by ADAM10 or ADAM17 thus enabling the final cleavage by the γ-secretase releasing the active Notch intracellular domain which migrates to the nucleus and regulates the transcription of target genes (Fig.
