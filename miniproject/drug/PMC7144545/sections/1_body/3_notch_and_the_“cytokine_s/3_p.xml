<p id="Par13">However, it must be also considered that Notch inhibition could interfere with the immune response during viral infection. Ito et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] found that in mice infected with influenza A virus (H1N1), macrophages increase Notch ligand Dll1 expression. In these mice, inhibition of the Notch pathway using an anti-Dll1 antibody, or GSI by intranasal administration, resulted in increased mortality, defective viral clearance, and decreased IFN-γ production in lungs [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Of note, it has been reported that RSV infection causes an increase of Jagged1 in bronchial epithelial cells and, when co-cultured with CD4 + T cells, promotes Th2 differentiation. Conversely, the reduction of Jagged1 expression with siRNA abrogates this effect and promotes an increase in Th1 differentiation. On this basis, it has been suggested that Jagged1-mediated Th2 differentiation may cause RSV-induced airway hyper-responsiveness [

On the basis of these studies, it could be hypothesised that it may be preferable targeting specific components of the Notch signalling, such as Dll4 or Jagged1, rather than inhibiting Notch with a GSI. Of relevance, soluble Jagged1 has been shown to efficiently inhibit neointima formation after balloon injury by decreasing smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration through inhibition of Notch signalling [
