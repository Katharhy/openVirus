<p id="Par12">IL-6 is a predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. However, in severely affected patients, IL-6 is moderately increased (25.2 pg/mL) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] compared to typical levels in cytokine release syndromes (more than 1600 pg/mL in sepsis) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This may explain why no serious vasoplegic shocks were observed. Nevertheless, the cytokine storm in COVID19 patients is characterised not only by hyperinnate immune response but also by activation of Th cell-mediated immunity. In this scenario, the idea of combining Notch inhibitors with anti-IL-6 to dampen the cytokine storm is captivating (Fig.
