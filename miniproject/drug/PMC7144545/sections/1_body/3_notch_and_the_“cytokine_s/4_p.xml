<p id="Par14">Preclinical studies have shown that Notch inhibition can be useful not only for treatment of atherosclerosis but also for other inflammation-based conditions such as graft-versus-host disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and arthritis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It is important to point out that before Notch inhibition becomes a reality in the clinical managements of these patients, we should address issues that could arise upon chronic exposure to Notch inhibitors, likely required for many of these pathologies, such as (1) toxicity related to the multiple cellular targets of GSIs, due to the promiscuous activity of the γ-secretase, (2) alteration of the immune system activities and of the stem cell compartment, in which Notch plays a pivotal role, and (3) the potential oncogenicity of the treatment, given the tumour suppressor role of Notch in tissues like the skin, as observed in Alzheimer’s patient treated with GSIs to inhibit the formation of amyloid A4 peptide [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A possible approach to avoid systemic toxicity could be delivery of GSIs and Jagged1/Dll4 inhibitors directly to the lungs by the use of nanoparticles [
