<p id="Par7">Furin and ADAM17 are both intertwined with Notch, an evolutionarily conserved system of communication between adjacent cells, and thus targeting Notch could represent an alternative approach to inhibit furin and upregulate ADAM17 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Of interest, a recent study has investigated the physical association between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins, identifying 66 potential cellular proteins that could be targeted to prevent viral infection [

With this approach, it is impossible to identify host proteins crucial for viral infection, which do not interact directly with viral proteins, as is the case for furin and ADAM17. Thus, hypothesis-driven studies based on the knowledge of the molecular details of virus–cell interaction are still crucial for the identification of therapeutic targets to treat COVID-19.
