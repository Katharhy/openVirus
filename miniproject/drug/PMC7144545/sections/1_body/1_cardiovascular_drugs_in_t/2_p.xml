<p id="Par5">Based on the evidence discussed above, ACE2 could be targeted to prevent SARS-CoV-2 from entering the cells. To this aim, Lei et al. generated a recombinant protein by connecting the extracellular domain of human ACE2 to the Fc region of the human immunoglobulin IgG1 which neutralised SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [

Of relevance, ADAM17 (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteases 17), a metalloprotease significantly expressed also in the lungs and heart, is involved in the shedding of surface proteins, including ACE2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Ablation of ADAM17 expression reduces ACE2 shedding, whereas overexpression of ADAM17 significantly increases its shedding [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, membrane translocation of ADAM17 leads to a reduction in myocardial ACE2 protein levels and activity which is associated with an increase in plasma ACE2 activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Based on these data, it is tempting to speculate that increasing ADAM17 levels and/or activity to enhance shedding and increase soluble/plasma ACE2 levels could represent a way of blocking SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Of relevance, treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil strongly activates ADAM17 in an animal model of colorectal cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Furthermore, in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, estradiol increases the expression levels and activity of ADAM17 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. This last finding would suggest higher shedding of ACE2 in women and could, at least partially, explain the reduced incidence of COVID-19 in women compared to men [
