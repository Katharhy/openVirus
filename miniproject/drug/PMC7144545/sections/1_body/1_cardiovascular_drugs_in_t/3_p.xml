<p id="Par6">Other than ACE2, the protease furin is also required to promote entrance of the virus into the cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Furin, a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family that processes protein of the secretory pathway, is a type 1 membrane-bound protease that is expressed in multiple organs, including the lungs. SARS-CoV-2, differently from SARS-CoV, presents a furin cleavage site between the S1/S2 subunits of the S glycoprotein. Following the binding of the S glycoprotein to ACE2, furin-mediated proteolytic cut of the S protein is necessary for viral entry into the cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Inhibiting the expression of furin could then be a possible approach to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, b). Of relevance in this context, nanomolar concentrations of a peptide designed from the furin cleavage sequence of the avian influenza A H5N1 virus provide protection against infection by several furin-dependent pathogens [
