 </sup>. A hypercoagulable state is a common abnormality in patients with COVID-19, and is due to infection, inflammation, hypoxia, immobilisation, and diffuse intravascular coagulation with marked elevations seen in lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer and interleukin levels
