<p>However, on 5 April 2020, before he could be discharged, the patientâ€™s clinical status deteriorated again. He complained of palpitations, shortness of breath and chest pain, and oxygen saturation dropped to 90%. The ECG showed a tachycardic sinus rhythm and negative T waves in lateral derivations, which were not previously present. Blood tests showed high sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs Tc) in the normal range but D-dimer elevated at 2.7 mg/l. In light of the symptoms and ECG alterations, coronary angiography was performed, but was negative. A pulmonary angiography CT scan documented the presence of a bilateral filling defect diagnostic for pulmonary embolism (

Lower-limb compression ultrasonography was negative. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was normal. Based on these findings, treatment with enoxaparin was started and the patient was closely monitored. He remained haemodynamically stable and was transitioned to oral anticoagulant therapy with rivaroxaban. On 14 April 2020, the patient was discharged in good condition.
