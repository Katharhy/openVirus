<p>On physical examination, the patient appeared pale and sick. Vital signs were significant for a body temperature of 38.5°C, oxygen saturation of 95% on room air and a respiratory rate of 20/min. Lung sounds were decreased at the bases, with right lower-lobe rales. Chest radiography showed bilateral opacities with a peripheral distribution highly suggestive for interstitial pneumonia. A rapid test for influenza A, B and respiratory syncytial virus was negative. Urinary antigen tests for 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and serotype 1 
 <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> were negative. A nasopharyngeal and oral swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. Arterial blood gas analysis in ambient air confirmed type 1 respiratory failure (PaO
 <sub>2</sub> 9.1 kPa), associated with respiratory alkalosis (pH 7.46 and PaCO
 <sub>2</sub> 4.02 kPa). Blood analysis showed a normal leucocyte count with mild lymphocytopenia of 1180/μl, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 55 mg/l and acute kidney failure KDIGO stage 1. Treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine for 7 days was initiated. In addition, we prescribed parenteral physiological saline and anti-thrombotic prophylaxis with enoxaparin.
