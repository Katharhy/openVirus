<p>Due to these preliminary findings, in our institution an increased dose of thromboprophylactic heparin has been approved for patients with COVID-19, when feasible. Thus, in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 it is extremely important to consider vascular complications as a possible cause of clinical deterioration. Overlooking thromboembolic phenomena could lead to a poor outcome and could partially explain the poor survival rates described in critically ill patients. Another therapeutic strategy could be to stabilize the endothelium while tackling viral replication with anti-inflammatory anti-cytokine drugs, ACE inhibitors and statins
