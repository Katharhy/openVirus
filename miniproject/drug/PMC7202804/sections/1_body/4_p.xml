The COVID-19 pandemic has caused people to be exposed to adverse environmental conditions, not previously experienced. This brings about relevant stress, whose health consequences are yet to be elucidated [

Among the main consequences of confinement are noxious conditions such as the lack of positive relationships and interactions; of physiological stimuli; of objectives and goals to be achieved; of creative ideas and opportunities; of changes in chronobiological rhythms and perceptions; of air quality (often for the better); feelings of anxiety and fear; and very importantly, functional and metabolic impairments dictated by a sedentary lifestyle. These effects are slowly evolving and, hence, it is difficult to imagine what their future consequences will be. Changes in the neuroendocrine and immune setting produce adaptive and compensatory responses the effects of which last for months, may be for generations (epigenetics changes generated through major nutritional and lifestyle challenges, such as severe malnutrition or tobacco smoking in women, have been evoked as the cause behind the association with higher incidence of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, through two or more generations [

In other words, these changes in lifestyles occur now, during this phase of Covid-19 pandemics, but their effects are expected to translate into physical and psychological consequences that will last for a long time after the crisis, potentially representing an emergency in the emergency worth considering for its impact on health systems as well as on social and financial policies of the different regions.
