<p>All biomedical and health research must undergo ECs review before its conduct in accordance with the National Ethical Guidelines and considering the local ethical values for due protection of research participants. To review clinical trial protocol, ECs are requested to register with CDSCO, whereas others must register with DHR and can review biomedical and health research. There are many ECs that have received accreditation from NABH or even have international recognition from Strategic Initiative for Developing Capacity in Ethical Review
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Depending on the region of outbreak, the needful ECs in the region can be activated. The ICMR in the last few years has conducted extensive training and dissemination programmes across the country and more than 7000 persons have received an update
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. The copy of national guidelines has been widely shared across medical colleges and research institutions to empower the decisions and functioning of the ECs. ICMR also released a brief handbook summarizing the key take-home messages from the main national guidelines
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. The ICMR Bioethics Unit at the ICMR-National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research, Bengaluru, has also developed a web portal with all important information and resources
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. A good EC would review all documentation looking at both scientific and ethical aspects of the research as it would concern the human participants. Besides reviewing the protocol and informed consent form, it would look at other elements as well, such as management of adverse events, provisions made for isolation, quarantine, travel restrictions, monitoring research teams for any signs and symptoms of infection, availability of appropriate training to work in such challenging situations, 
 <italic>etc</italic>. It would guide payment of compensation in case of injury, look at ways for protection of confidentiality, and prevention from any stigmatization, rapid post-trial access, local roll out and surveillance, benefit sharing with the community, fair and transparent partnerships, international collaboration and publication of results in a timely manner. Ethical values must be upheld during public health emergencies
