<p>The latest version of the National Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical and Health Research Involving Human Participants released in October 2017 has, for the first time, included a separate section on research during Humanitarian Emergencies and Disaster conditions and suggested ethical safeguards for any research during an outbreak
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. This section has identified the need for pre-emptive preparation and suggested a framework for prior planning for dealing with emergency and outbreaks. It discusses how the Ethics Committee (EC) can undertake an expedited review or hold unscheduled meetings in a given time frame or to connect with relevant experts through available channels, such as video or teleconference whenever physical presence may be difficult for ethical review in a time-bound manner. The guidelines provide measures for protection of the affected individuals or populations from harm and ensuring their safety, stigmatization and ostracization, while maintaining their dignity and protect their privacy or any unauthorized use of identifying information, despite the fact that such diseases are to be notified to public health authorities. The need to draft formats and research protocols in advance, including informed consent forms or plans to seek waiver of informed consent, can help speed up the responses when the need arises. A Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Investigational interventions is also suggested and may be implemented with due precautions. Need for thorough scientific review, followed by an ethics review, local oversight, good manufacturing practice compliance/rescue medicines and supportive treatment accessible are some of the other safeguards suggested.
