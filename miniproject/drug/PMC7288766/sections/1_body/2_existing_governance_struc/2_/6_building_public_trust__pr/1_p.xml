<p>Any large public health programme must be based on ethical principles of transparency, accountability and information exchange with the involved population or communities. Along with building appropriate infrastructure for scientific research, training of investigators and field workers, it is also important to simultaneously inform the public about outbreaks and to educate them about their responsibilities to curtail the spread of infection. There is also a need to dispel and clarify about the fake information floating on social and print media related to the use of unproven claims. The importance of community engagement can never be undermined; however, in an outbreak situation, it is very challenging to practically plan it in view of limited time and resources. Simple key public health messages and responsible use of social media platforms can greatly help. Recently, the MoHFW has prepared some frequently asked questions (FAQs) and fact sheets and ICMR has been preparing press statements and posting updates on COVID-19 on its website on a daily basis. The WHO has also developed a lot of educational messages and warned the public about an ongoing infodemic, discussing ways of combating rumours and false information on the internet

Media has an important responsibility to report facts in a timely manner and not create false alarms. The ICMR has partnered with the Global Health Strategies to receive guidance on communication and networking activities
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Nodal communication officers have been appointed in each of the institutes who coordinate with the Communication Unit at ICMR Headquarters office and public relations officers for media-related activities. A social media policy has been released and a few workshops have been held to train scientists on effective communication skills

Communication, engagement and consultations with various members of civil society, non-government organization (NGOs), patient and community representatives can greatly improve the understanding of the societal ethical values in planning and make interventions more sensitive to the needs of our population.
