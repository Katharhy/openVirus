<p>Chapter IV of the NDCT
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> has made it mandatory for every researcher and EC to follow the ICMR National Ethical Guidelines for research and requires registration of all ECs engaged in review of any biomedical and health research with the DHR on its portal
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. This registration is in addition to the requirement for the EC to register with CDSCO for clinical trials
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Therefore, since September 2019, an Office for EC Registration has been created at the DHR, which is now registering ECs and will be coordinating and monitoring the activities of the ECs registered with it. This fulfils the existing gap related to the regulation of biomedical and health research apart from clinical trials and has helped create a framework for accountability of every EC in the country.
