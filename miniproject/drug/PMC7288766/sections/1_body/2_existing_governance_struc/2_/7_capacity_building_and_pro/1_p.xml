<p>Constant efforts are required at State, regional or national level to build capacity in diagnostics, infection control, outbreak management and adaptation to the international standards and ensure appropriate training of the workforce. Researchers must make sure that there is a fair selection of patients as research participants, and steps have been taken for risk minimization and equitable distribution of risks and benefits, and approvals from ECs
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. It may be important to note that some vulnerable persons may become particularly vulnerable due to the disease condition and may need more protection. If a clinical trial is planned, the trial site capacity and country scientific capacity development is essential and local researchers should be involved in the conduct of a trial, especially at planning, review and writing stages. The health professionals and healthcare workers should look at individual needs and make efforts to not only prevent the spread and reduce the severity but also be sensitive to the impact on family or the community. Due care should be provided to treat, give supportive care, and provide comfort in isolation, or quarantine, as well. Informed consent process should be simple and in the language understood by the participant. Depending on circumstances, use of oral methods for consenting or waiver of consent can be planned with due approval of the EC in line with the sociocultural milieu. Often, research or therapeutic interventions may be using unproven or experimental therapies and there would be unclear benefits or unknown harms, which require due monitoring and follow up on a long-term basis. The researchers must be aware of plans to safely store the collected samples or information, for the specified duration, knowing who can have access, or with whom this may be shared, and for what purpose. This can help avoid any further trauma, stigmatization, discrimination or even ostracization. Any unauthorized disclosure of personal information collected during an outbreak (name, address, diagnosis, family history, caste, community, 
 <italic>etc</italic>.) can expose individuals to additional risk. Use and sharing of non-aggregated surveillance data for research purposes should have the approval of well-trained ECs. Researchers as well as ECs should be alert to the issues of conflicts of interest which could be commercial (monetary gains and patents) or academic (awards, promotion and publications) and manage them. Safety of all healthcare workers should also be top priority in ethical preparedness and they should have access to good-quality basic safety and protection gear, from possible infection in the course of their interactions with infected patients/participants. It is also important to ensure the physical, social and psychosocial support to health workers who take great risk to their own health.
