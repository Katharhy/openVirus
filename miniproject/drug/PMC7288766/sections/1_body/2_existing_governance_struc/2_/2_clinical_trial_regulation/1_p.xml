Permission can be sought from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) for restricted use of combination drugs which are expected to be potentially useful against the infection. Therefore, on the regulatory front, there have been major strides and a responsive enabling environment has been created for online fast-track clinical trial registration and approvals, registration of ECs on SUGAM Portal and monitoring and accreditation of ECs through National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH)
