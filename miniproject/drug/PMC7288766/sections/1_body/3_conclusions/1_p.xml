<p>Ethics preparedness is an important component of plan for dealing with public health emergencies or outbreaks because it helps ensure best standards and quality of deliverables without any compromise on human safety and the ethical values. Availability of trained health workers with strong psychosocial support, research-enabled environment, good ethics review, prior community needs assessment and possible adoption to the present requirements are measures that can help develop interventions that are robust and at par with the international standards. The preparedness also helps the government initiate immediate response and fulfil the expectations from the public and build their confidence and trust. Along with well-equipped laboratories to tackle highly contagious organisms, appropriate updates on training of health personnel are important. Prior plans for data sharing, storage of samples and biobanking can be developed and the network of laboratories and the governance structure can enable them to initiate timely action and improve quality of outcomes. Fair and transparent accountable collaborations are important. The strong political support along with preparedness activities can lead to the successful conduct of public health interventions that may be required and pave the way for future trials in the country. Outbreaks stimulate all partners and agencies to collaborate their efforts to establish best socially acceptable responses that ensure ethical safeguard for the population. Together countries can achieve a lot in tackling the outbreaks which need prompt public health action to prevent their spread and save human lives. Ethics preparedness can guide various stakeholders involved in the public health emergency for fair decision-making based on moral reasoning in the best interest of the population and thereby help make outcomes more ethical and acceptable to the public.</p>
