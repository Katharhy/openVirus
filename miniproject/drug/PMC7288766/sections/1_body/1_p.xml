<p>Ethics preparedness refers to the capability of the public health system, to protect and have the ability to quickly respond to by having in place an ethical framework that would build trust and guide measures to recover from health emergencies. This can make science more holistic, sensitive and people centric focussing on local, social and cultural values helping better protection of our population. The outbreaks could be regular and known for which the research preparation is high or these could be first time or novel for which there is no specific research preparation and requires quick adaptation. Over the last several years, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has worked with the Department of Health Research (DHR), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India, in enhancing the national capacity for early diagnosis of infections that have an epidemic potential by setting up a network of well-equipped Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratories for managing epidemics that can lead to public health crisis
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. The network is led by the ICMR-National Institute of Virology, Pune, which is well equipped with capability to handle highly contagious pathogens having a Biosafety Level 4 (BSL4) laboratory to set the stage for prompt action
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. It has also been identified among the 15 laboratories across the world for diagnosis of novel coronavirus infection recently labelled coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the WHO Director-General at the media briefing on February 11, 2020
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. In case of COVID-19, the research areas could be varied ranging from study of disease transmission routes, incubation period, secondary attack, sequelae, susceptibility and isolation containment, 
 <italic>etc</italic>., or research could be on setting up of diagnostics which may include tools for quick screening or molecular tools for confirmatory diagnosis. Research can also be on treatment or therapeutics because there is no known treatment and ways for protection or it could also be on vaccine candidate molecules. Important research needs in epidemic/outbreaks are given in
