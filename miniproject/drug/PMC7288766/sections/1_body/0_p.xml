India with its 1.3 billion population residing in densely populated areas in resource-constrained environments is at constant risk for any emerging outbreaks that can cause rapid spread of infection. There have been considerable investments in preparedness for rapid responses and to create a conducive environment to undertake therapeutic or disease prevention research. Research is needed when the outbreak is ongoing or after it has subsided.
