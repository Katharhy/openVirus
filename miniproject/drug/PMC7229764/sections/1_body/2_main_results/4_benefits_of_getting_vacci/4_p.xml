 </inline-formula> and fixing all the other parameters as the estimated baseline values, we examine the impact of vaccination against influenza on the COVID-19 epidemics in China in terms of the final size and the peak values. It follows from 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> that increasing the vaccination coverage rate against influenza can remarkably reduce the cumulative number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and cross-infected cases, and also reduce the peak number of

In more detail, we find that by a vaccination coverage rate of 90%, the cumulative number of confirmed cases can reduce by 23.0% (about 19062 total cases), moreover, the cumulative number of cross-infected cases can reduce by 92.9% (about 3700 cases). This implies that mass influenza vaccination could contribute significantly to the control of the outbreak of COVID-19 and significantly reduce the risk of cross-infection.
