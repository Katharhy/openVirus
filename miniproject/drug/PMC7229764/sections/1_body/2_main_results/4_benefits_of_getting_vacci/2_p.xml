<p id="d1e7999">The COVID-19 outbreak in China coincided partially with flu season, and it was difficult to distinguish COVID-19 accurately and rapidly from influenza-like-illnesses. As a result, individuals with clinical fever symptoms required medical treatment in high risk settings of COVID-19, and the risk of cross-infection increased. Here we seek to use our transmission dynamics model to explore the impact of mass influenza vaccination prior to the onset of flu season on controlling the transmission of COVID-19.</p>
