<p id="d1e7276">By simultaneously fitting the proposed model to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, cumulative number of death cases, cumulative number of cured cases and cumulative number of suspected cases, we first estimate the rest parameters and initial conditions using the least square method. The best fitting curves are marked as red in
