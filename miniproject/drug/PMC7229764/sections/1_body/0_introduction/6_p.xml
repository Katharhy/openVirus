<p id="d1e3927">A similar strategy would be valuable also for COVID-19. To test such a hypothesis, we devised a mathematical model incorporating the treatment of people complaining of ILI symptoms, potentially at risk of contracting COVID-19 or other emerging/re-emerging respiratory infectious agents during their admission at the health-care setting, where the competition of the detection resources between the COVID-19 infected population and individuals with ILI symptoms is considered. The main purpose of this study is using the model to assess the effect of mass influenza vaccination and public health interventions on the spread of COVID-19 in the case of a coincidence of the outbreak with the influenza season.</p>
