 <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, Sajadi et al. provided the evidence that COVID-19 could perhaps prevail at low levels and begin to rise again in late fall and winter in temperate regions in the upcoming year. Since COVID-19 symptoms are aspecific and may resemble a common cold, if it should come back with a seasonal pattern and coincide with the influenza season, this would be particularly challenging. From a clinical standpoint, it would be difficult to distinguish between the two infectious agents, with the definition of COVID-19 cases rather problematic. Moreover, diagnostic tests as well as human resources are limited. Furthermore, currently commercially available rapid diagnostic tests are characterized by a good specificity but have a limited sensitivity, as such not enabling a quick and reliable diagnosis of COVID-19. Altogether, this would significantly impact downstream public health efforts to properly identify COVID-19 cases and contain the outbreak, overwhelming and straining the healthcare systems, particularly in resource-limited contexts, and would increase the likelihood of nosocomial transmission.
