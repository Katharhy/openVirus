<p id="d1e3909">SARS-CoV-2 causes a generally mild, but sometimes severe and even life-threatening infection, known as “coronavirus disease” (COVID-19). Currently, there exist no effective vaccines or drugs that can effectively prevent or treat COVID-19 patients. As such, global public authorities have so far relied upon behavioral, non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as use of masks, social distancing, self-isolation, quarantine and even lock-down of entire territories and communities, to contain or, at least, mitigate the burden of the ongoing pandemic

Despite the unprecedented nature of some of these measures, western countries have found it difficult to fully suppress/eradicate the outbreak and have preferred to mitigate it, deciding to opt for a short-period of NPIs, which will be followed by gradual reopening the economy and return to a new normal. Resumption of daily working and social activities is expected to cause further outbreak waves, due to the re-increasing of contact rates.
