<p id="d1e8316">Influenza vaccination would enable to better control and contain the spread of COVID-19 or other emerging/re-emerging pathogens, in case of coincidence of the outbreak with the influenza season. Mass influenza vaccination prior to the onset of the peak influenza season would significantly decrease the number of ILIs among the general population and specifically the elderly, with fewer persons with ILIs seeking for medical advice, particularly those in high-risk settings, with frailty, underlying co-morbidities or disabled. As such, this would minimize the probability of not quickly and accurately identifying circulating respiratory pathogens as well as the possibility of ongoing nosocomial transmission.</p>
