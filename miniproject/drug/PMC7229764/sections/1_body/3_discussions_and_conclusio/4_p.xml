<p id="d1e8314">Influenza generates a relevant burden worldwide, both in terms of healthcare resources consumption and socio-economic impact. Despite the existence of effective vaccines and their importance as cost-effective preventative tool, vaccination coverage rate still remains suboptimal. With respect to the general population, healthcare workers are at a higher risk of exposure to circulating respiratory pathogens, including influenza, potentially threatening their own health and compromising patientsâ€™ safety. Influenza vaccine uptake is suboptimal also among other targeted categories, including the elderly and disabled people. An inadequate disease risk perception, a low health literacy, perception of the societal effects of vaccination and alleged side-effects are among the drivers of vaccine hesitancy.</p>
