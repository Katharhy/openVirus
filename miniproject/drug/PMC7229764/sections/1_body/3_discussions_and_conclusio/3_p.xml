<p id="d1e8312">According to some researchers, the SARS-CoV-2 had already been circulating much earlier than late December 2019 but its correct identification was hindered by a considerable amount of people complaining of influenza-like-illness (ILI) symptoms. In the case of the implementation of a mass influenza vaccination campaign well before the onset of the influenza season, the exposure of emerging/re-emerging respiratory pathogens would be unmasked, facilitating their identification and the design of ad hoc public health interventions. This would significantly alleviate the pressure on health-care facilities, reducing the total number of people complaining of ILI symptoms, and decreasing the transmission probability of COVID-19 or other emerging infectious agents both among healthcare workers and, subsequently, among people under investigation for their disease.</p>
