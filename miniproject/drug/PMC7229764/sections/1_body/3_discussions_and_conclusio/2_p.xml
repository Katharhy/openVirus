<p id="d1e8310">In the present mathematical modeling study, we have tested the hypothesis that a mass influenza vaccination campaign would have a positive effect on the management of people with non-specific symptoms and complaining of ILIs, potentially at risk of developing the COVID-19 (or other emerging respiratory infections) during their admission at the health-care setting. Our findings show that increasing influenza vaccination coverage rate to an optimal threshold would facilitate the efforts of containing the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
