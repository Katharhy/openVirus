<p id="Par4">Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) of the Southern hemisphere are bracing themselves for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and are potentially facing worse outcomes and different challenges than the hard-hit developed world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This may be due to the significant burden of non-communicable diseases in LMIC, including cardiovascular illness, diabetes and lung disease, combined with the highest global prevalence of infections such as malaria, dengue, tuberculosis (TB) and HIV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Studies demonstrate that HIV-infected persons with low CD4 counts are at greater risk for influenza infection and its complications including pneumococcal co-infection, longer hospital stays and increased mortality, as well as prolonged viral shedding [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Persons with pulmonary TB (PTB) are at increased risk of influenza-associated mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, there is currently no evidence that HIV positive patients have poor outcomes in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, even in areas of high HIV prevalence such as Thailand [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In fact, antiretroviral therapy used by HIV positive patients may be protective from COVID-19 infection or serious complications, and there is interest in using HIV antiretroviral therapy to treat severe COVID-19, although very recently lopinavir–ritonavir has shown no benefit [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Endemic diseases in LMIC countries may not only increase the burden of SARS-CoV-2 in these populations but may also cause false positive screening tests, especially for dengue. This situation may delay the diagnosis of COVID-19 and therefore increase the spread of the virus, because in most dengue cases, there are no warning signals and the follow-up is ambulatory [
