<p id="Par5">The brunt of most acute and chronic diseases is borne by the poor, and it is very likely that poor socio-economic status will impact on spread and outcomes of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Overcrowded living conditions, food insecurity and poor access to basic amenities including water, congested public transport and shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for doctors, nurses and medical staff and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients all favour viral spread. Political disruption and poor education with lack of insight into the urgency of conforming to social distancing and lockdown measures may also hamper containment strategies. Care of patients with severe COVID-19 is challenging where healthcare capacities are already stretched thin, with a shortage of hospital beds (&gt; 12 per 1000 population in much of Europe vs 1–2 in many LMIC), intensive care facilities (some European countries have 29 beds per 100,000 population, 35 in the USA and 5 or less in many LMIC countries), PPE and insufficient medical personnel (there are 2.7 physicians per 10,000 population in Africa and parts of South America compared with 21.5 in North Americas and 32.1 in Europe) [
