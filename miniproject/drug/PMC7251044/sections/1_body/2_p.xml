 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. To date, however, no high-quality clinical data has shown clear benefit of AM, and a recent retrospective study failed to show that HCQ, either with or without azithromycin, reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 [

Further studies will clarify the role of AM as prophylaxis or therapy in the COVID-19 pandemic, but our RMD patients should continue these therapies. In addition, tocilizumab is showing promise for the therapy of a severe COVID-19 cytokine release syndrome [
