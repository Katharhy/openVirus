<p id="Par8">The developing world may have some mitigating factors against the COVID-19 pandemic. The first is forewarning and a small window of preparation time. As the pandemic spreads, LMIC can study and learn from the successes and mistakes of the Northern hemisphere. Measures to contain transmission include discontinuing international travel, educating the public, restricting gatherings and timeously locking down all non-essential activities and planning clinical services for severe COVID-19 cases. Secondly, the virus seems to survive better in cold, dry weather with reduced ultraviolet light. The warm climate and the summer season in the Southern hemisphere may offer some protection. Age, a poor prognostic factor in COVID-19 disease, favours LMIC where less than 5 or 10% of the population is over 65 years, compared with 25–30% in Europe [

Protocols already developed during these crises, including laboratory and patient management, were designed and implemented in a scenario of limited resources. The protocols and previous experience with infectious diseases may be useful in this challenging situation [
