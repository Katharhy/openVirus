<p id="p0105">In the last two decades, intra- and inter-species interactomes have been generated in a number of prokaryotes and eukaryotes including human, mouse, worm, and plant models (

Investigating such interactomes has indicated that diverse cellular networks are governed by universal laws and led to the discovery of shared and distinct molecular components and signaling pathways implicated in viral pathogenicity. In the present study, we constructed a Calu-3-specific human-SARS-CoV-2 interactome (CSI) by integrating the lung-epithelial-cells-specific co-expression network with the human interactome. We determined that CSI displayed features of scale-freeness and was enriched in different centrality measures. The identification of structural modules demonstrated the relationships with a set of functional pathways in CSI. In-depth network analyses revealed 33 most influential nodes. Additional noteworthy findings pertain to SARS-CoV-2 transcriptional signatures, regulatory relationships among diverse pathways in CSI, and overall SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis including the cytokine storm and interferon signaling.
