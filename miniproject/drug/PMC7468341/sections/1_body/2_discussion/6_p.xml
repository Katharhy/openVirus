<p id="p0130">In conclusion, we generated a human-SARS-CoV-2 interactome, integrated virus-related transcriptome to the host interactome, discovered COVID-19 pertinent structural and functional modules, identified high-value viral targets, and performed dynamic transcriptional modeling. Thus, our integrative network-biology-based framework led us to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms and pathways of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.</p>
