<p id="p0055">Human-viral interactome landscapes of several viruses have previously shown that viral proteins interact with nodes corresponding to high degree (hubs) and high betweenness (bottlenecks), and such structural features have been previously used to predict viral targets (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Ackerman et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Becerra et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bosl et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to hubs and bottlenecks, the PageRank algorithm was also effectively used to identify viral targets (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Devkota et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, these physical characteristics can also be used to prioritize the most influential genes in CSI for biological relevance and drug target discovery. Here, we used nine different centrality indices to identify the most influential nodes referred to as CSI significant proteins (CSPs). This includes the above-described degree, betweenness, information centrality, PageRank index, and load centrality as well as additional features such as eigenvector centrality (a measure of the influence of a node in a network), clustering coefficient (reciprocal of the sum of the length of the shortest paths between the node and network), harmonic centrality (reverses the sum and reciprocal operations of closeness centrality), and weighted 
 <italic>k</italic>-shell decomposition (an edge weighting method based on adding the degree of two nodes in network partition). Weighted 
 <italic>k</italic>-shell decomposition analysis was recently performed to increase the predictability of host targets of bacterial pathogens (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Ahmed et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we showed that the top 5% (209) of nodes reside in the inner layers of CSI (

 <xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). Although our qualitative comparative analysis revealed distinct components of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in CSI (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C), we further delineated the varied interaction patterns of common nodes based on weight 
 <italic>k</italic>-shell centrality measure (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). This comparative analysis may provide insights into the differential importance of overlapping components of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in CSI (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C and 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). For other centrality measures, we also maintained a stringent threshold of top 5% to be considered as a highly influential node or CSP. Evidently, we can expect overlapping topological features for the same set of nodes. Noticeably, we observed a strong positive correlation between information centrality and degree (

 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>E; 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sup>

 </sup> = 0.68), and PageRank and degree (

 </sup> = 0.94,
