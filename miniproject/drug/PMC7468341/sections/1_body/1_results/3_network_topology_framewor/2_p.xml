<p id="p0060">Collectively, we identified 33 CSPs that exhibit more than one high centrality measure (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>E and 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>). For instance, DDX21, DDX5, EEF1A1, EXOSC5, KPNA2, JUN, UPF1, RAB7A, AP2M1, DCTN2, CAV1, ITGB1, NUP98, PHB, and RPS20 that have been implicated in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are enriched in all the centrality measures tested in our study (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>E and F, and 
 <xref rid="mmc4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>). In addition, RAB5C, PPP1CA, UBE2I, EEF1A1, RAB7A, and AP2M1 are enriched in more than five centrality measures (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>E and F, and 
 <xref rid="mmc4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>). We categorized these 33 CSPs into three major groups based on their potential roles in COVID-19. Althoguh we expect some, if not all, of these proteins to have more than one function(s), the group-1 CSPs might be largely relevant to modifying host response following SARS-CoV-2 infection (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E). Moreover, the proteins in the other two groups might be involved in viral entry, proliferation, survival, and pathogenesis as well as cytokine storm (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E; see details in 
 <xref rid="sec3" ref-type="sec">discussion</xref>). Furthermore, we found that these 33 CSPs are targets of some of the well-known SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 targets most of the CSPs (i.e. five in total), SARS-CoV2 nsp8 targets four CSPs, and SARS-CoV-2 M has four CSPs targets, whereas other SARS-CoV-2 nsps' (2, 4, and 10) and SARS-CoV-2 orfs' (3b, 6, 8, and 9c) possess relatively fewer targets. Intriguingly, two of our CSPs (PPIA and RPS20) are targets of more than one SARS-CoV-2 protein (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>G and 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>F), whereas PHB is the target of several viral proteins tested as bait at a low threshold. It is also important to note that PHB is targeted by viral proteins of SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). These data support previous findings that an individual viral factor can target multiple host nodes and several viral proteins can interact with the same host protein (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Ackerman et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Becerra et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bosl et al., 2019</xref>). Collectively, these data strengthen our notion that centrality measures can be an effective method to predict highly influential nodes, leading us to discover 33 such CSPs.
