<p id="p0050">From the network biology standpoint, a viral infection as well as other pathogen attacks can be viewed as a set of strategic perturbations, at least in part, within the core components of the host interactome (

 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bosl et al., 2019</xref>). Because such central nodes correspond to proteins that exhibit increased connectivity and/or central positions within a network, we addressed a question of whether SARS-CoV-2 also attacks such important nodes within CSI. Toward this, we calculated the average degree (number of connections), betweenness (the fraction of all shortest paths that include a node within a network), load centrality (the fraction of all shortest paths that pass through a node), information centrality (the harmonic mean of all the information measures for a node in a connected network), and PageRank index (counting incoming and outgoing connections considering the weight of the edge) for SIPs and compared them with their first and second neighbors. We demonstrated that these five topological features of SIPs were significantly higher than the other nodes within CSI (

 <sup>−11</sup>). These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 targets core structural components of the human-viral interactome and prompted another question as to whether CSI also activates common biological processes in response to viral infection. Because nodes within CSI form protein complexes among themselves and are transcriptionally regulated, we reasoned that densely connected nodes within this network may participate in similar biological functions. Toward this, we investigated the underlying modular structures (protein clusters ≥5 nodes) in CSI followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). This approach allowed us to identify 25 modules ranging from 5 to 100 nodes for the smallest and largest modules, respectively. Subsequently, we examined the biological processes, cellular pathways, and signaling cascades that are modulated in the top 8 modules (

 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>C and 
 <xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). Significantly enriched signaling pathways and biological processes included eIF2 signaling/translation representing protein translation control, striated muscle contraction, protein ubiquitination pathway, viral infection/mRNA transport, T cell receptor regulation of apoptosis, cell cycle, p38 MK2 pathway, and amino acid degradation (−log(p-value) ≥2) (

 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>C and 
 <xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). Finally, we performed a human phenotype ontology analysis that identifies phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human diseases. Significantly enriched terms included loss of speech, hypoventilation, respiratory failure, and abnormality of the common coagulation pathway (

 <xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). Collectively, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with central nodes of CSI, and these proteins are implicated in core molecular and cellular pathways to establish infection and continue disease progress.
