<p id="p0070">To reveal the regulatory circuitry and molecular events pertinent to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed probabilistic modeling using the iDREM (interactive Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner) framework that incorporates protein-DNA interactions, protein-protein interactions, and miRNA-target interactions with temporal proteomics, small RNA sequencing, and transcriptomics (
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2018</xref>). Given that iDREM requires time course transcriptional profiling data, we used recently reported temporal (three-time points; 4 h, 12 h, and 24 h) SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV transcriptomics (both RNA- and miR-seq) as well as SARS-CoV-2 proteomics dataset in Calu-3 cell lines (

 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Emanuel et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, we only focused on those upstream transcriptional regulators (transcription factors; TFs and microRNAs; miRNAs) and downstream target genes that were differentially expressed in SARS-CoV-2- and SARS-CoV-mediated dynamic regulatory networks. This dynamic regulatory modeling identified several bifurcation points, where a set of TFs/miRNAs regulates their potential co-expressed and downstream target genes in both viral infections (

 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>A, and 
 <xref rid="mmc5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). Based on the expression trajectories and path expression patterns, we identified a total of 63 and 74 significant regulators that were expressed in SARS-CoV-2- and SARS-CoV-infected Calu-3 cells, respectively (P &lt; 0.001 for TFs and 0.05 for miRNAs, 
 <xref rid="mmc5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). By comparing these significant regulators of SARS-CoV-2 with the transcriptome of BALF cells and PBMC COVID-19 patients, we identified 14 significant regulators (MEF2A, IRF1, IRF3, HEY1, ELK4, BRCA1, ZEB1, MEF2C, TCF12, KAT2A, BCL11A, E2F1, RFX5, and SREBF1) (

Similarly, 19 significant regulators (MEF2A, MAFF, USF1, TRIM28, GATA3, RXRA, EGR1, IRF1, IRF3, HEY1, ELK4, BRCA1, ZEB1, MEF2C, TCF12, KAT2A, BCL11A, E2F1, and RFX5) are shared between the transcriptomes that originated from SARS-CoV and BALF/PBMC COVID-19 patients (
 <xref rid="mmc5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). Taken together, we demonstrated that the significant regulators discovered in SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 cell line resemble the transcriptomes of COVID-19 patients.
