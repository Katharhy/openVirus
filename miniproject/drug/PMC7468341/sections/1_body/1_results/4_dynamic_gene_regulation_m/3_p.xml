<p id="p0075">During our dynamic regulatory event mining, we observed the first wave of differential regulation and activation of regulators at 12h post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. At this bifurcative transcriptional event, we found a set of six TFs (STAT1, STAT2, BCL3, CHD2, ZEB1, and NFKB) and two miRNAs (hsa-miR-421 and hsa-miR-429), which were also expressed in the Calu-3 cell's transcriptome. We also found that four TFs (HEY1, ZEB1, RFX5, and E2F1) are differently expressed in BALF and PBMC COVID-19 patients. The next bifurcation occurred at 24 h postinfection, comprising four TFs (STAT1, STAT2, IRF1, and MXI1) and three miRNAs (hsa-miR-320b, hsa-miR-320c, and hsa-miR-590-3p) expressed in SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 cells (

Overall, we reported 52 significant regulators (TFs and miRNAs) that participate during both 24 h post-SARS-CoV-2 and -SARS-CoV infection, whereas 11 and 22 regulators are involved specifically in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection, respectively (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>D–4F). It is important to note that nine of these eleven significant regulators (MAX, BRF2, ZNF263, ESR1, FOS, SREBF1, TFAP2C, TFAP2A, and hsa-miR-429) are highly differentially regulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 cells (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E), further substantiating the importance of our discovery. These nine regulators are known to be involved in the C-Myc pathway, transcription, anticoagulation, estrogen signaling, lipid biosynthesis, ciliary landscape, nasal septum abnormality, and hypoxia (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E). Among the common significant regulators for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, we observed differences in transcriptional amplitudes for numerous genes, thereby distinguishing the progression of disease upon infection with these two coronaviruses (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F). Furthermore, to understand the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 unique regulators, we analyzed the average expression of their target genes. Intriguingly, we found that the average expression of the target genes of these regulators is increasing during SARS-CoV-2 infection (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>G). Here, we also found that hsa-miR-429, which targets over 750 genes involved in response to stress, cytokine signaling pathway, protein de-ubiquitination, defense response to the virus, MAPK cascade regulation, innate immune response, cell cycle, and signaling by interleukins during SARS-CoV-2 infection, is one of the significantly downregulated regulators (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>H). Although we found similar sets of target genes regulated by diverse sets of TFs at different stages of infection, we also discovered multiple combinations of TFs regulating similar sets of downstream genes (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C and 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>A). This reflects the intricate nature of dynamic regulatory relationships between TFs/miRNAs and their targets.
