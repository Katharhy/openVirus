<p id="p0065">To further understand the biological characteristics, regulatory relationships, and molecular events associated with the nodes in CSI, we incorporated transcriptome data of COVID-19 patients derived from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with our CSI data (
 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et al., 2020</xref>). Overall, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited largely different transcriptional signatures for BALF cells and PBMC (
 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et al., 2020</xref>). We identified a set of 1,199 and 397 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in BALF cells and PBMC, respectively (

 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and B, and 
 <xref rid="mmc5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). Thus, CSI constitutes over 50% of transcriptomes pertaining to both BALF cells and PBMC. Intriguingly, in BALF cells, we observed that the upregulated cluster A is enriched with eIF2 signaling/translation and viral transcription pathway, whereas the downregulated clusters are enriched in vesicle-mediated transport and immune response pathway (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). Conversely, one major cluster that is significantly upregulated in PBMC is enriched in the cell cycle, T cell receptor regulation of apoptosis, and protein ubiquitination pathway (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). Moreover, the mRNAs encoding 33 CSPs exhibit a strong positive correlation between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection at both 12 h (

 </sup> = 0.975) (
