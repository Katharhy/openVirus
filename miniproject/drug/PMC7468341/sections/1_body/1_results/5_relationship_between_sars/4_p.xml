<p id="p0095">Overall, we demonstrated the dynamic transcription patterns of CSI genes and CSPs that participate in the cytokine storm, interferon signaling, eIF2 signaling/translation, protein ubiquitination pathway, and TÂ cell receptor regulation of apoptosis and hypoxia (
 <xref rid="mmc5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). We also identified a set of TFs that potentially regulate the aforementioned pathways' genes at various stages of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 patients. Finally, we showed distinct patterns of key pathway genes in SARS-CoV-2 infection when compared with SARS-CoV and other respiratory viruses.
