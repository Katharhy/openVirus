<p id="p0090">In addition to comparative transcriptional output and dynamic regulatory circuitry analyses between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, we also compared the transcriptional amplitude differences between SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses in different cell types (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S2–S4</xref>). By comparing the DEGs of transcriptomes originated from A549, Calu-3, and NHBE cells that were infected with the human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus (IAV), human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3), and SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Blanco-Melo et al., 2020</xref>), we revealed the significantly altered pathways in SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>C). We found several immune-related signaling pathways including numerous interleukins signaling cascades significantly enriched in SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 cells (

Subsequently, we revealed the differential regulation of CSP genes, blood coagulation abnormalities, hepatic necrosis, cytokine storm, mitochondrial inheritance, respiratory failure, and SARS-CoV-2 significant regulators in SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 cells (
