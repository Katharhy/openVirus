<p id="p0035">Networks encompass a set of nodes and edges, also referred to as vertices and links, respectively. Nodes are systems components, whereas edges represent the interactions or relationships among the nodes (
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Vidal et al., 2011</xref>). In biological systems, genes and their products perform their functions by interacting with other molecular components within the cell. For instance, proteins directly or indirectly interact with each other under both steady-state and different stress conditions to form static and dynamic complexes and participate in diverse signaling cascades, distinct cellular pathways, and a wide spectrum of biological processes. Proteome scale maps of such protein-protein interactions are referred to as interactomes (
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">McCormack et al., 2016</xref>). Meanwhile, specialized pathogens including viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotes employ a suite of pathogenic or virulent proteins, which interact with high-value targets in host interactomes to extensively rewire the flow of information and cause disease (

 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Wessling et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, analyzing the network architecture and deciphering the structural properties of host-pathogen interactomes may reveal novel components in virus pathogenicity. Such analyses indicate that diverse cellular networks are governed by universal laws and exhibit scale-free network topology, whose degree distribution follows a power-law distribution with a few nodes harboring increased connectivity (
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2019</xref>). Given that diverse biological systems display similar network architecture and topology, several structural features and physical characteristics within a cellular network may act as indicators of important nodes. These include degree (the number of edges of a node), and betweenness (the fraction of the shortest paths that include a node) (

 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, it has been shown that hubs (high-degree nodes) and bottlenecks (high-betweenness nodes) are targets of numerous human viral, human bacterial, and other diseases (

 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2017</xref>). Specific to the viral-host pathosystem, the network analysis of several interactomes including human T cell lymphotropic viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis C virus, influenza virus, and human papillomavirus indicate that several of the above-described topological features are associated with viral targets. Recently, in SARS-CoV human interactome, nodes corresponding to hubs and bottlenecks including respiratory chain complex I proteins were identified as targets of SARS-CoV. This system-wide analysis also identified several immunophilins as direct physical interacting partners of the CoV nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) (
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Pfefferle et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), a proteome-scale mapping recently identified 332 SARS-CoV-2 interacting proteins in humans (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>). Although this groundbreaking study paved new avenues to investigate novel therapeutic targets using a systems pharmacology approach, integration of spatiotemporal coronavirus-specific expression data is necessary to reveal the cell- and organ-type-specific human-viral interaction architecture. In addition, network biology presents a next-generation, integrative approach for drug repurposing that can predict individual or, more likely, combinatorial sets of drugs with high efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in the cell-type context (
