<p id="p0030">From the epicenter of the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) outbreak in China, the disease has spread globally with over 16.8 million confirmed cases and almost 662,000 fatalities as of July 29, 2020, and the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the pandemic is accelerating worldwide (

Apart from the human tragedy, COVID-19 has a growing detrimental impact on the global economy and will likely cause trillions of dollars in financial losses worldwide in 2020 alone. COVID-19 is an infectious respiratory illness caused by a highly contagious and pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). This single-stranded RNA virus belongs to the family

These coronaviruses mainly spread from a contagious individual to a healthy person through respiratory droplets derived from an infected person's cough or sneeze and from direct contact with contaminated surfaces or objects, where the virus can maintain its viability for a period ranging from hours to days (

Although the majority of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop a mild-to-moderate self-resolving respiratory illness, infants and older adults (≥65 years) as well as patients with underlying medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, renal dysfunction, obesity, and cancer are more vulnerable (

 <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). The pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 is complex and largely unknown but is associated with an extensive immune reaction referred to as “cytokine storm” triggered by the excessive production of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and others. The cytokine release syndrome leads to widespread tissue damage and multiple organ failure (

Although no vaccine or antiviral drugs are currently available to prevent or treat COVID-19, identifying molecular targets of the virus could help uncover effective treatment. Toward this, the generation of a human-SARS-CoV-2 interactome, integration of virus-related transcriptome to interactome, the discovery of disease-related structural and functional modules, and dynamic transcriptional modeling will provide insights into the virulence mechanisms of this deadly virus.
