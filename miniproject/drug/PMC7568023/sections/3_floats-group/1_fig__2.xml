  <p>Proposed reaction mechanisms of various engineered NMs against SARS-CoV-2, action mechanisms outside host cell (I) blocking of virus entry through either binding with the virus spike protein or blocking its cell receptor (ACE2) by virus-like NPs, polymeric NPs, and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein NPs (has not been prepared yet); (II) dissolving the lipid bilayer of SARS-CoV-2 envelope by nano-emulsion, liposomes, and solid-lipid NPs; and (III) initiation of extracellular ROS by Ag NPs. Actions inside host cell include activation of transcription factors by receptor signaling as a response of viral RNA and either the formation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1B) and activation of Th2 pathway ending with the formation of neutralizing antibodies (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) or Th1 pathway activation and the formation of opsonizing antibodies (IgE, C4b, C3b, and IgG)</p>
