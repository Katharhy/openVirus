<p>COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a lethal beta-type virus belonging to a related group of viruses known as coronaviruses, leading to serious infections in the respiratory tract of humans (Fan et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2020</xref>; Yang and Wang 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2020</xref>). Many human coronaviruses have been discovered such as SARS-CoV, HCoV NL63, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 disease (Su et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2016</xref>; Zhu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2020</xref>). The name of coronaviruses was derived from Latin corona meaning crown, the name corresponds to their unique morphology due to the presence of viral spike proteins (Chafekar 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>; Lopez 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2007</xref>). Coronaviruses have large spherical structures with an average diameter of 120Â nm, and they have a lipid bilayer envelope of about 80 nm and 20 nm long spikes (Buzon et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>; Goldsmith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2004</xref>; Yang and Wang 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2020</xref>). The members of beta-coronavirus possess additional short-like protein called hemagglutinin esterase (HE) on their surfaces (Fehr and Perlman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>). Interestingly, the structural proteins of the membrane, envelope, and the spike are anchored. In December 2019, COVID-19 emerged for the first time in China and has quickly-transmitted in the world (Angel-Korman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020</xref>). Recently, COVID-19 pandemic outbreak was recently-declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Angel-Korman et al.
