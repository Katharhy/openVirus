<p id="Par2">Unlike SARS-CoV, COVID-19 transmission takes place during the prodromal period when the infected persons are mildly ill and carrying on with their common activities, facilitating spread of infection (Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>). Direct contact with infected individuals and sneezing or coughing (droplets spread) are the main causes of person-to-person transmission (Chan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>; Thompson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2020</xref>). According to WHO, individuals at risk include elderly (&gt; 60 years old); cardiac, diabetic, chronic respiratory, cancer patients, and individuals in long-term care facilities (Kabir et al.
