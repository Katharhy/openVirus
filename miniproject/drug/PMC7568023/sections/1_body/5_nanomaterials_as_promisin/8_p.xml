 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2017</xref>) reported another nano-vaccine for MERS-CoV in mice; the vaccine was developed from human Fc4-fused eS1–770 spike protein of the virus. After 10 days, they discovered large quantity of antibodies against MERS-CoV, while Ye V. Liu et al. tested vaccines based on virus-like particles (VLPs) similar in morphology and size to the wild SARS-CoV, comprising SARS spike protein conjugated with influenza M1 protein (Liu et al.
