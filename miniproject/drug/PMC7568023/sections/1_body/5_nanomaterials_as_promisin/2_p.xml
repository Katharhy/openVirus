<p id="Par10">The antimicrobial activity results of some green synthesized metal NPs (such as Ag NPs, and Au NPs) should be considered. The biogenic Au NPs mostly-displayed mild antibacterial activities against the highly-pathogenic bacteria (Aina et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2019</xref>; Elegbede et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>). Sunday A. Ojo et al. (Ojo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2016</xref>) investigated the antimicrobial potential of the green synthesized Au and Ag-Au alloy NPs, and the results indicated that they displayed growth inhibitions of 66.67–90.78% against strains of 
 <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> at a concentration of 200 μg/ml. In addition, Ag-Au NPs exhibited tremendous antifungal activities. An interesting result of nearly 100% inhibition of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> growth after the treatment with Ag-Au NPs at a concentration of 150 μg/ml was reported (Lateef et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2016</xref>). The strong antifungal potential of Ag-Au NPs can be attributed to the adhesion on the microbial cell wall, subsequent suppression of fungal spores, then cytoplasmic content leakage, and finally microbial cell death (Elegbede et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2019</xref>).
