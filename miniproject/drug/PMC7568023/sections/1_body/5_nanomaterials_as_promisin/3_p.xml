<p id="Par11">The antimicrobial characteristics of some nanomaterials depend on their size, shape, surface features, and surface charge. As a result, their toxicological effects are controllable by the employed concentration (Sportelli et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2020</xref>). The toxic levels of NPs must be taken into consideration before designing any nano-drug, and the antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) should be measured (Abdel Maksoud et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>; El-Batal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>).
