<p id="Par9">Nanotechnology through a large variety of nanomaterials (NMs) possessing multiple structures, properties, and characteristics can offer a revolutionary solution for the control and treatment of this disease. Many types of NMs showed very promising antiviral and antimicrobial activities which could be used as nano-vaccines to prevent microbial biofilm formation and the adsorption of microbes onto the surfaces and to control their transmission as shown in Fig.Â
