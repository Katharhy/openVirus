<p id="Par20">The proposed action mechanisms of nano-vaccines and nano-drugs against SARS-CoV-2 can be classified into two categories, the action before virus entering to the host cell (nano-vaccines) and after entering it (nano-drugs). Firstly, several types of nano-vaccines such as virus-like NPs and polymeric NPs can effectively-block virus entry through blocking ACE2 cell receptor or virus spike protein through which it enters the host cell through endocytosis mediated by clathrin (Zhou et al.
