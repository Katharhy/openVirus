<p id="Par6">The chest x-ray remarks of a suspected coronavirus case can be similar to pneumonia (Jacobi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>). Severe cases of COVID-19 progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can show a typical “white-out” on chest x-ray (Venugopal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2020</xref>). There are no specific echocardiography/ultrasound findings associated with coronavirus infection (Zheng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2020</xref>). Non-specific echocardiographic findings can include left ventricular systolic dysfunction and pericardial effusion (Pérez-Casares et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2017</xref>). Chest CT scan findings in patients infected with coronavirus can include unilateral or bilateral pneumonia, mottling and ground glass opacity, focal or multifocal opacities, consolidation, and septal thickening with sub-pleural and lower lobe involvement more likely (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2020</xref>).
