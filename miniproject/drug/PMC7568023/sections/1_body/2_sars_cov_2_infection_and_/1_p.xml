<p id="Par3">The virus relies on the ACE2 receptor not only for host cell entry but also for subsequent viral replication (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2020b</xref>). High viral loads have been observed in the lower respiratory tract, proposing that the virus might have a higher affinity for the epithelium of the lower respiratory tract and indicating a need for repeat testing of the upper or lower respiratory tract samples in the setting of an initial negative result of nasopharyngeal or throat swab in a suspected case (Jansen et al.
