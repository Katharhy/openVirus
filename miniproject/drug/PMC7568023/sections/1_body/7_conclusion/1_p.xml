<p id="Par24">In this editorial trend, we covered most known data about coronavirus, properties, family identification, its severity, method of infection, and replication. In addition, we discussed its diagnosis and highlighted the currently-available medications to deal with its driven symptoms and effects. Finally, we proposed multiple nanomaterials that can be used as fighters against this disease, and we have classified them according to the mode of action into nano-vaccines and nano-drugs and revealed the way by which they can resist the virus. However, intensive efforts should be devoted for investigating the efficiency of these nanomaterials against viral samples as a step towards cure development. Importantly, with this high rate of dissemination of viruses and the frustrating slow drug development, there is an urgent need for developing new nanomedicines of high quality, safety, and availability to all countries at a reasonable cost.</p>
