  <p>Predicted viral dynamics by model (3) under different scenarios. We use the fitting to the LRT viral load data of patient #2 in 
   <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, 
   <xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> as an example to study the model prediction under different assumptions. (A) Model prediction with and without lymphocytes (i.e. the secondary target of infection) and seroconversion. The adaptive immune response, if included, is assumed to occur on day 8. (B) The adaptive immune response is assumed to be activated on day 5, 8, 10 and 12, respectively.
