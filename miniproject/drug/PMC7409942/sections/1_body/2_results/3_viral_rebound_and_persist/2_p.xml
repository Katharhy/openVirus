 </inline-formula> is small, i.e. the clearance rate of infected cells increases slowly as the adaptive immune response emerges, then a second viral peak is predicted because the adaptive immune response is not sufficient to control the viral replication. Thus, viral rebound that lasts for a period of time can be observed. As
