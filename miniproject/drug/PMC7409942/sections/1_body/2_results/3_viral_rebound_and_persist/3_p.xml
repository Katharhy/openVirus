<p id="d1e3293"> The timing of the emergence of adaptive immune response also affects viral rebound and persistence. If the adaptive immune system is activated later, then the viral load can persist at a higher level for a longer time (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B). This is consistent with a report that a SARS-CoV-2 infected non-human primate with the lowest and latest antibody response had prolonged viral shedding from the intestinal tract 
 <xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. We also fit our model to the rectal viral load data of this animal and the fit is excellent (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A). The parameter estimates are shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The finding suggests that for infected individuals with compromised or delayed immune responses, the viral load will rebound following the first peak and even persist for a long time 
 <xref rid="b84" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>. If the virus persists at a low level around the detection limit, the patient may be asymptomatic or only develop very mild symptoms. However, the patient can still test positive and spread virus. This has been reported in a study that suggested the transmission from an asymptomatic contact in Germany
