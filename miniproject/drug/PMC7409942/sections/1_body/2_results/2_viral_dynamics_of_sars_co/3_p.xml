<p id="d1e3194">Numerical simulations of model (3) show that the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection can exhibit a few distinct phases (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A). During the first stage, the primary target cells are infected and consumed rapidly. The viral load experiences a substantial increase to the peak level. This agrees with the clinical data that onsets of ARDS are observed around this time 
 <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Following the viral peak, the viral load declines slightly and enters a plateau phase in which the viral load remains approximately unchanged or declines slowly. In our model, the source of this plateau phase is the infection of lymphocytes as a secondary target. Without the infection of lymphocytes, SARS-CoV-2 would continue to infect and deplete pneumocytes. As a consequence, viral load would decline quickly and the infected individual would lose the transmissibility (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A). After viral load persists for a period of time (e.g. a week in some patients), the next phase follows as the adaptive immune response emerges. Seroconversion was also detected about a week after the onset of ARDS in COVID-19 patients 
 <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. During this stage, viral load declines rapidly to an undetectable level. This also agrees with observation in patients
