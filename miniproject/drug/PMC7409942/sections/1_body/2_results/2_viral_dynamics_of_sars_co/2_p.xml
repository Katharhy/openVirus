<p id="d1e3162">We fit each of the three models Eqs. (
 <xref rid="fd1" ref-type="disp-formula">(1)</xref>–
 <xref rid="fd3" ref-type="disp-formula">(3)</xref>) to the viral load data of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients from Germany and China 
 <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. The best fits to the data from lower respiratory tract (LRT) and upper respiratory tract (URT) using model (3) are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. All the parameters of the best fits are listed in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The best fits using models (1) and (2) are shown in the supplemental materials. We find that model (3) significantly improves the fit. The major problem in the fitting with models (1) and (2) is that these models show a single-phase viral decline after the peak. This is not consistent with the viral plateau or even a second peak observed in some patients 
 <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Models (1) and (2) also use a constant rate to describe the clearance of infected cells. The killing by the immune responses is complicated. Using a constant rate fails to explain the viral plateau and subsequent decline of the viral load observed in patients
