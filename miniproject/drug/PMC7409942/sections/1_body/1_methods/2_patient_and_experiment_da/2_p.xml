<p id="d1e2068">The viral load data in COVID-19 patients with and without treatment we analyzed in this paper were from Germany, South Korea and China. We also studied the viral load data from a SARS-CoV-2 infected adult rhesus macaque in the US. The viral load data of eight patients from Germany were from a larger cohort of COVID-19 cases in Munich 
 <xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Viral RNA levels of all patients were measured every day after onset of symptoms via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from specimens of throat swab, sputum, and stool. Seroconversion was detected by IgM and IgG immunofluorescence and virus neutralization assay within cells expressing the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 
 <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The data from China were collected by RT-PCR from serial samples (throat swabs, sputum, urine and stool) of two patients after they were hospitalized in Beijing 
 <xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. We fit the models to one patient due to the lack of enough measurements in another. The viral load data from South Korea were from a 35-year-old Chinese woman traveling from Wuhan, China 
 <xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. She was the first case reported in South Korea. The viral load was also measured with RT-PCR every day after diagnosis from samples of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and sputum. This patient was treated with lopinavir/ritonavir on day 5 since symptom’s onset. The rectal viral load data from a rhesus macaque having prolonged viral shedding were collected by RT-PCR every day from its rectal swab samples after inoculation
