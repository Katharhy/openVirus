  <p>Schematic diagram of coronavirus life cycle. The virion enters the cell through recognizing specific receptor, uses the host cell resources to carry on genome replication and synthesis of major structural proteins, and then finally assembles into the mature virion which is then released out of cell. The invasion process mainly includes (
   <bold>a</bold>) coronavirus S protein recognition and binding to cell receptors, along with virus attachment to the cell; (
   <bold>b</bold>) induction of conformational changes in the S protein upon binding, in which the fusion protein is exposed and inserted into the host cell membrane; (
   <bold>c</bold>) HR1 and HR2 of the S2 subunit gradually approaching each other, narrowing the distance between viral envelope and host cell membrane; (
   <bold>d</bold>, 
   <bold>e</bold>) HR1 and HR2 forming a six helical bundle (6-HB), which causes the virus envelope and host cell membrane to fuse from the hemifusion state to complete fusion, thus releasing the virus gene into the host. Viral genes replicate and translate within cells to produce genomic RNA and viral proteins, which are assembled with the proteins to form viral particles
