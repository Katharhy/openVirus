 </sup> transgenic mice were immunized with S protein of SARS-CoV, and NMAbs that have cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 were identified. Among them, the chimeric antibody 47D11 was reconstructed, expressed in the form of human IgG1, and further characterized. The results showed that the humanized 47D11 could bind SARS-CoV-2 S protein expressed on the cell surface and inhibit the infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.061 μg/ml. Infection of Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2 was neutralized with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.57 μg/ml. 47D11 was shown to target the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in an ELISA assay.
