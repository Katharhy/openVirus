<p id="Par42">Based on the similarity of S protein between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, researchers attempted to identify NMAbs with cross-reactivity for SARS-CoV-2 from the peripheral blood of SARS-infected patients. In order to detect the cross-reactivity of NMAbs against SARS-CoV-2, pseudovirus neutralization assays with a murine leukemia virus (MLV) pseudotyping system were performed. Results showed that S309 could effectively neutralize both pseudoviruses. By targeting the RBD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>), S309 potently neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 (2019n-CoV/USA_WA1/2020) with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 79â€‰ng/ml, via recognition of a highly conserved epitope in the S domain, comprising the N343-glycan.
