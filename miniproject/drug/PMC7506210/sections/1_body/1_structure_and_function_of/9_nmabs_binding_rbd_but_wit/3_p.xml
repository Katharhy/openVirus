<p id="Par41">As mentioned earlier, fully human antibodies have an advantage as drugs in human. In addition to camel origin and humanized sdAbs, fully human sdAbs have been reported.

 </sup> In this study, the S1 fragment was used as an antigen to screen sdAbs that specifically bound to the antigen from a fully human phage display library, followed by pseudovirus and live virus neutralization experiments, and a competition assay against ACE2, on the most representative antibodies. Among these sdAbs, results showed that the most potent antibody, n3130, could neutralize &gt;90% SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus at a concentration of 10 µg/ml, while n3088 could neutralize ~80% pseudovirus at a concentration of 10 µg/ml. No cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed in n3130 and only minimal signs of CPE were observed in n3088, while significant levels of CPE were detected in other antibody groups. However, none of these antibodies could effectively compete with ACE2 in binding the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein.
