<p id="Par40">18F3 was screened out from antibodies specific to SARS-CoV. ELISA assays were performed to detect the activity of binding to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2, and the results showed that six mAbs (46C1, 13B6, 29H4, S29, 7B11, and 18F3) had cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 RBD. 18F3 showed cross-neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 in the pseudovirus neutralization assay, neutralizing about 80% of pseudovirus at 10 μg/ml. However, 18F3 could not block the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs to ACE2 owing to the distance between target and binding site.
