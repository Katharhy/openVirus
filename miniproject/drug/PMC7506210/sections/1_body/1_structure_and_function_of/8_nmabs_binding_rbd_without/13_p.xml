<p id="Par38">Ho and colleagues isolated 61 NMAbs from PBMCs of five severe COVID-19 patients. Nine of them have IC
 <sub>50</sub> in a range 0.7 ~ 9 ng/ml against live SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among of them, 2–15, 2–7, 1–57, and 1–20 targeted RBD, and 2–17, 5–24, and 4–8 targeted NTD, while 2–43 and 2–51 targeted a quaternary epitope on the top of RBD on the S protein trimer. The most potent NMAb 2–15 could neutralize pseudotyped and live SARS-CoV-2 infection with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 5 ng/ml and 0.7 ng/ml, respectively, by binding RBD, competitively with ACE2. The NMAb 2–15 could effectively protect a golden Syrian hamster model against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
