<p id="Par33">To obtain a broad-spectrum vaccine that effectively targets known and potential human coronaviruses, eight NMAbs with SARS-CoV-2 cross-neutralizing activity were identified by using a memory B cell repertoire from a convalescent SARS donor. It is worth noting that these NMAbs can effectively cross-neutralize SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and the bat SARS-like virus WIV1. ADI-55689 binds to the edge of the ACE2 binding site, close to the more conservative core region of the RBD structure, while ADI-56046 binds to the flexible tip of RBD. The IgG format of these NMAbs showed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 live virus at 100 nM, and similar results were shown in a VSV-based pseudovirus neutralizing assay. In a MLV-based pseudovirus neutralizing assay, ADI-55689 and ADI-56046 showed neutralizing activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.05–1.4 μg/ml and 0.004–0.06 μg/ml against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV respectively. Similar IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were observed in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV live virus neutralization assays.
