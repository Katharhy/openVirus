 </sup> The IC
 <sub>50</sub> of these NMAbs against SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020 in a range of 15–4000 ng/ml as measured with focus reduction neutralization test. Among of them, COV2-2196 and COV2-2130 could also neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection. They could completely block the binding between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and hACE2 in a competition assay, but bound to different epitopes on RBD. Therefore, COV2-2196 and COV2-2130 could simultaneously bind to S protein and exhibited synergistic neutralization effect on live SARS-CoV-2 infection. The use of COV2-2196 and COV2-2130 alone or in combination could protect BALB/c mice from challenge with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2. Use of COV2-2196 or COV2-2381 alone could also protect NHPs from SARS-CoV-2 infection.
