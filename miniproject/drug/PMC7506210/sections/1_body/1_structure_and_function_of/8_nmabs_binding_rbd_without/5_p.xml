 </sup> first identified the inhibitory activity of plasma from recovered patients and then sorted out the memory B cells of positive plasma samples. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, they next cloned the VH and VL of IgG which were expressed in vitro again, finally obtaining three mAbs (311mab–31B5, 311mab–32D4 and 311mab–31B9). Consistent with plasma test results, 311mab-31B5 and 311mab-32D4 could efficiently block the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-hACE2 interaction with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.0332 and 0.0450 μg/ml, respectively, while 311mab–31B9 had no inhibitory activity against this interaction. Both 311mab-31B5 and 311mab-32D4 showed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.0338 and 0.0698 μg/ml, respectively, while 311mab-31B9 had no neutralization activity in this assay.
