<p id="Par29">VHH-72 has been shown to have cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Experimental data showed that the binding affinity of VHH-72 to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD was ~39 nM, which was weaker than that of the SARS-CoV RBD. According to the report, this was related to the rapid dissociation of VHH-72. Among the amino acid residues of RBD binding to VHH-72, the only mutation found was Arg426, which is Asn439 in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. However, the binding of VHH-72 to RBD of SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected in ELISA assays, and VHH-72 could not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. In order to overcome the rapid dissociation of VHH-72, scientists modified VHH-72, including a tail-to-head fusion of two VHH-72 molecules connected by a (GGGGS)3 linker (VHH-72-VHH-72) and a genetic fusion of VHH-72 to the Fc domain of human IgG1 (VHH-72-Fc). Both variants exhibited binding ability to the S proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and VHH-72-Fc neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of ~0.2 µg/ml.
