<p id="Par34">Using transgenic mice and PBMC of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, a large number of single B cells that produced antibodies which specifically bind to SARS-CoV-2-RBD were screened out. The antibody genes of these B cells were then sequenced, and then expressed as complete antibodies. Finally, about 40 antibodies with unique sequences and neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses were obtained. Among of them, nine (REGN10989, REGN10987, REGN10933, REGN10934, REGN10977, REGN10964, REGN10954, REGN10984, REGN10986) of the most potent antibodies were identified in subsequent assays. Their IC
 <sub>50</sub> values range from 7â€“99 pM. These antibodies can effectively block the binding of ACE2 to the RBD. In addition, four (REGN10989, REGN10987, REGN10933, REGN10934) of them can effectively neutralize the virus with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 7.38, 42.1, 37.4, 28.3 pM, respectively. REGN10933 and REGN10987 can simultaneously bind to distinct regions of the RBD through crystal structure analysis. Therefore, these two NMAbs can be used as cocktails to exert antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Human trials (clinicaltrials.gov NCT04426695 and NCT04425629) of an antibody cocktail are being tested now.

 </sup> In addition, these antibodies were combined to explore their effect on escape mutations. The results showed that this noncompetitive antibody cocktail therapy can effectively avoid viral escape mutations.
