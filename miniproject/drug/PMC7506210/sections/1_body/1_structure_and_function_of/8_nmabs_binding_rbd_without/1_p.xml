<p id="Par26">Similarly, another NMAb, 7B11, was identified from previously screened antibodies. It is specific to SARS-CoV. ELISA assays were performed to detect the binding activity against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2, and the results showed that six mAbs (46C1, 13B6, 29H4, S29, 7B11, and 18F3) had cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 RBD. 7B11 showed cross-neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 in a pseudovirus neutralization assay, neutralizing about 80% of pseudovirus at 10 μg/ml. According to this report, 7B11 could block the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs to ACE2 owing to proximity between target and binding site.
