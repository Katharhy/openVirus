<p id="Par28">A competitive biopanning strategy was developed to effectively screen RBD blocking antibodies from the phage display antibody library. rRBD-15 and rRBD-16, with the highest affinity for RBD screened from competitive biopanning, were expressed as a full-length IgG1. They can bind to the RBD with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values at 3.8 nM and 5.3 nM, respectively in vitro. Only rRBD-15 inhibited the binding of RBD to ACE2 with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> at 3.0 nM, while rRBD-16 had no blocking or neutralizing activity. In a pseudovirus neutralization assay, rRBD-15 showed potent neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 12.2 nM.
