<p id="Par35">A single-domain antibody H11 that specifically binds to SARS-CoV-2 RBD was identified by screening a naive llama phage display antibody library. Through random mutation, two mutants H11-H4 and H11-D4 H11 that have higher affinity for SARS-CoV-2 RBD were obtained. Bivalent Fc-nanobody fusion, H11-H4-Fc, and H11-D4-Fc, compete with ACE2 for RBD binding and H11-H4 and H11-D4 recognize the same epitope, which partly overlaps to the ACE2 binding region in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. H11-H4-Fc and H11-D4-Fc can block the binding of RBD to MDCK-ACE2 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 61 nM for H11-H4-Fc, and 161 nM for H11-D4-Fc, respectively. The results from the plaque reduction neutralization assay showed that H11-H4-Fc and H11-D4-Fc could neutralize live SARS-CoV-2 infection with the ND
 <sub>50</sub> of 6 nM and 18 nM, respectively. Combining CR3022 with H11-H4-Fc or H11-D4-Fc exhibited synergistic effect on their neutralization effect.
