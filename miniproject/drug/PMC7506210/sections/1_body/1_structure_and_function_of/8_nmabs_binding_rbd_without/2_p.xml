<p id="Par27">In order to rapidly obtain human NMAbs targeting SARS-CoV-2, 206 mAbs specific to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein were screened from the blood of eight SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Analysis of 13 of the 69 antibodies from patient two showed neutralization activity of P2C-1F11 and P2B-2F6 against the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.03 and 0.05 µg/ml, respectively. Consistent with experimental results of the pseudovirus neutralization, P2C-1F11 and P2B-2F6 neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated the most potent neutralization activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.03 and 0.41 μg/ml, respectively.
