<p id="Par36">As the pandemic continues, more and more NMAbs have been screened out. A humanized NMAb H014 was identified from a phage display antibody library generated from RNAs extracted from peripheral lymphocytes of mice immunized with SARS-CoV RBD, which could cross-neutralize SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Both IgG and Fab forms of H014 could effectively bind to the RBD of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 at sub-nM levels. H014 IgG could effectively neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudovirus infection with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3 and 1 nM respectively, and can neutralize the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 38 nM. H014 IgG could effectively protect hACE2-Tg mice from the challenge with SARS-CoV-2. H014 IgG bound to the epitope outside RBM on RBD of SARS-CoV-2, thus, preventing RBD-ACE2 binding through steric hindrance.
