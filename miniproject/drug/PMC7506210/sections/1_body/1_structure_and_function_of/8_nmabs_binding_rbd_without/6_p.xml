 </sup> common mAbs were screened out from convalescent patients and specific mAbs were obtained using high-throughput screening with specific antigen. A neutralization assay for the pseudovirus of SARS-CoV-2 and a protection assay in Syrian hamsters were performed to examine the antiviral activity of mAbs. Among the identified mAbs, CC12.1 effectively neutralized the pseudovirus of SARS-CoV-2 with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.019 µg/ml and live SARS-CoV-2 with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.022 µg/ml. CC12.1 could completely protect Syrian hamsters against the Washington strain USA-WA1/2020 (BEI Resources NR-52281) in a plasma concentration of 22 µg/ml. Furthermore, CC12.1 was found to target the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and block ACE2 binding in a mapping assay. In addition, CC6.29 and CC6.30, which target the RBD of SARS-CoV-2, have the highest potency against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 2 ng/ml and 1 ng/ml, respectively.
