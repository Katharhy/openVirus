<p id="Par7">In the development of antibodies against SARS-CoV, eight (6A, 8C, 12E, 26H, 27D, 80R, 91M, and 92N) recombinant human single chain variable fragments (scFvs) targeting the S1 of SARS-CoV S glycoprotein were identified from two nonimmune phage libraries of human antibodies.

 </sup> One of them, 80R, effectively neutralized SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) in vitro. 80R scFv competes with soluble ACE2 to bind the RBD in the S1 domain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>) with high affinity (equilibrium dissociation constant Kd = 32.3 nM). At a concentration of 7.43 nM, 80R scFv can neutralize &gt;50% of the testing wells from SARS-CoV infection. In most cases, the bivalent full-length immunoglobulin is more effective than its corresponding scFv because of avidity, effector functions, and prolonged serum half-life. The same neutralizing activity was achieved by 80R IgG1 at a concentration as low as 0.37 nM. Moreover, 80R IgG1 inhibits syncytial formation between cells expressing S protein and cells expressing ACE2.

 </sup> In a further study, 80R IgG1 could efficiently protect mice from SARS-CoV infection, noting that the core of its target is aa 324 to 503 in the S protein of SARS-CoV.

 </sup> This is also the first effective antibody against SARS-CoV screened from an antibody library.
