<p id="Par10">By imitating the human immune response to SARS-CoV, S230.15 was identified by B cell-based Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformation and used the RBD of S protein as antigen. S230.15 competes with SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 to bind to the RBD of the S protein. S230.15 potently inhibited viral entry into cells and cell fusion mediated by the S protein of SARS-CoV in vitro. Furthermore, the antiviral activity of S230.15 was tested in mice infected with recombinant SARS-CoV. Mice infected with Urbani and GD03 were treated with 200 µg of S230.15, and the mice were completely protected.
