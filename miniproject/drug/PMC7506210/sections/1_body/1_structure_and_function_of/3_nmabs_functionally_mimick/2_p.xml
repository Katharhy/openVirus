<p id="Par8">CR3014 was also identified from semisynthetic antibody phage display libraries. The results showed that CR3014 targets residues 318 to 510, a region previously identified as the SARS-CoV RBD. Furthermore, complete protection against 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> (50% tissue culture infectious dose) of SARS-CoV infectivity was achieved at 42 nM of CR3014 IgG.

 </sup> At the same time, researchers aligned residues 318–510 of the S protein from 114 human SARS-CoV isolates published in GenBank.

 </sup> The results showed that eight sequences of the S protein were different from those used in the beginning of this article. These sequences were expressed in the form of recombinant S318–510 fragments. Among them, CR3014 had no neutralizing effect on the N479 mutant sequence, indicating that this residue is very important for the binding of CR3014.

 </sup> In a follow-up study, CR3014 IgG suppressed replication of SARS-CoV in the lungs of infected ferrets, attenuated SARS-CoV-induced visible lung lesions, and eliminated virus reproduction in the pharyngeal region at 10 mg/kg.
