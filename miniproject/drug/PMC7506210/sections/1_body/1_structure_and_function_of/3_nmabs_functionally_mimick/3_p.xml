<p id="Par9">To study the inactivated virus as a potential vaccine, inactivated SARS-CoV particles were used as the immunogen to induce humoral and/or cell-mediated immune response in mice, and antibodies were detected in the hybridoma supernatant. Two NMAbs (1A5, 2C5) with strong neutralizing effects on SARS-CoV were screened out. The results of virus neutralization experiments showed that 1A5 (32 µg/µl) and 2C5 (14 µg/µl) were diluted 45,000 and 11,000 times to achieve IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of ~0.71 µg/ml and 1.27 µg/ml, respectively. When mapping epitopes of NMAbs on specific domains of S protein, both NMAbs were found to target residues 310–535 in S protein of SARS-CoV.
