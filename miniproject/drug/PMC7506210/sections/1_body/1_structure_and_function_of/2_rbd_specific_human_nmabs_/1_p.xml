<p id="Par6">NMAbs targeting SARS-CoV RBD generally prevent the attachment of the virus to the host cell by interfering with the binding of viral RBD to cellular ACE2 receptor (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). These RBD-targeted NMAbs can be roughly divided into the following three categories based on their different binding sites on RBD. First, NMAbs that bind to the ACE2-binding site on RBD, including the receptor-binding motif (RBM), can functionally mimic ACE2 to bind RBD and block ACE2-RBD binding (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Second, NMAbs that bind to the epitope outside or partly overlap ACE2-binding site on RBD can indirectly block ACE2-RBD binding without functionally mimicking ACE2 to bind RBD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). Third, NMAbs that bind to the epitope outside ACE2-binding site on RBD and could not block ACE2-RBD binding (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>).
