<p id="Par43">As discussed previously, some NMAbs can cross-bind the RBD of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and some have cross-neutralization activity. The S protein sequence and crystal structure of SARS-CoV were found to be highly similar to those of SARS-CoV-2.

 </sup> Therefore, an affinity test of SARS-CoV NMAbs CR3022 and others was performed against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. The results showed that only CR3022 had high affinity for the RBD of SARS-CoV-2,

 </sup> but it did not block binding of ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>). However, the authors of this study note that multiple antibodies have been reported that offer in vivo protection, even without in vitro neutralization activity.

 </sup> On the contrary, recent research results by scientists have shown that CR3022 has neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of ~0.114 μg/ml in vitro.

 </sup> NMAbs 47D11, 18F3, VHH-72 and S309 derived from SARS-CoV have cross-neutralization activity to SARS-CoV-2 because they target highly conserved sites between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

 </sup> Recently, a series of cross-antibodies were screened out from memory B cell repertoire of a convalescent SARS donor.
