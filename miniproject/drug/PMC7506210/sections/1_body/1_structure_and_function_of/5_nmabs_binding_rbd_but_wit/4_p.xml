<p id="Par19">NMAb S309 was identified from the peripheral blood of SARS- infected patients. Neutralization assays showed that antibody S309 could effectively neutralize pseudoviruses carrying the S proteins of SARS-CoV isolates from the early, middle and late phases of the 2002–2003 epidemic with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values between 120 and 180 ng/ml. S309 targets the front end of the RBD of the SARS-CoV S protein.
