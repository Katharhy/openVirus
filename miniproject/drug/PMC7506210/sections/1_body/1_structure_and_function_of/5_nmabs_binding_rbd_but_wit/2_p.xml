<p id="Par17">The previously mentioned CR3014 IgG does not work in all SARS-CoV strains. In order to cover the remaining virus strains, CR3022 was identified from an immune scFv phage display library constructed from the lymphocytes of a convalescent SARS patient from Singapore. According to the study, all CR3014 IgG escaped virus showed a single point mutation at amino acid position 462 (proline to leucine, P462L) in the S protein. CR3022 IgG does not compete with CR3014 in combination with recombinant S1 fragments. CR3022 IgG completely neutralized the SARS-CoV strain HKU-39849 and the CR3014 IgG escape variants at a concentration of 23.5 µg/ml. The synergistic effect of CR3014 IgG and CR3022 IgG may also reduce the total antibody dose of passive immunity against SARS-CoV infection.
