<p id="Par18">Transgenic H2L2 mice, which encode chimeric immunoglobulin, including variable regions of human heavy and light chains and constant regions of rats, were immunized with the S protein of SARS-CoV. Four hybridomas that activated on the S protein of SARS-CoV were identified. Among them, the chimeric antibody 47D11 showed neutralization activity to SARS-CoV pseudovirus. 47D11 was then reconstructed and expressed in the form of human IgG1 and further identified. The results showed that the humanized antibody 47D11 could bind the SARS-CoV S protein expressed on the cell surface and inhibit the infection of SARS-CoV pseudovirus with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.061 μg/ml. Infection of Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV was neutralized with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.19 μg/ml. 47D11 was shown to target the RBD of SARS-CoV in an ELISA assay.
