<p id="Par11">As mentioned before, m396 was identified from healthy human antibody libraries of volunteers by using the RBD of SARS-CoV S protein as antigen.

 </sup> Further study showed that m396 by targeting the RBD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>), m396 could neutralize GD03 and Tor2 viruses with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.1 µg/ml and 0.01 µg/ml, respectively, and neutralize pseudoviruses from the Urbani isolate. Mice infected with Urbani and GD03 were treated with 200 µg m396, and the mice were completely protected. Meanwhile, m396 showed significant, but incomplete, protection against SZ16 infection in mice. By analyzing the key residues of m396 on RBD of SARS-CoV, Zhu et al found that the epitope of m396 overlapped the binding site of ACE2, including residues Y484, T486, T487, G488, Y491.

 </sup> Therefore, m396 neutralizes viruses by competing with ACE2 to bind to RBD.
