<p id="Par12">In addition to the humanization of mouse antibodies, transgenic technology can replace the mouse immunoglobulin gene with human immunoglobulin gene, and animal immunization with antigen can obtain full human antibodies. Following this practice, a fully human antibody, 201, was developed, that targets residues 490–510 of the SARS-CoV S protein. Affinity measurements showed an affinity Kd of 34 nM between monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and soluble S
 <sub>590</sub> (residues 1–590 of the SARS-CoV S protein fragment consisting of residues 1–590). The NMAb 201 specifically blocked binding of S
 <sub>590</sub> to Vero E6 cells in a flow cytometry –based assay and. 201 provided a 50% maximal protective effect at concentrations of ~1 nM in the neutralization assays against SARS-CoV in vitro. The NMAb 201 completely protected mice against SARS-CoV infection at a concentration of 40 mg/kg. In doses as low as 1.6 mg/kg, mice could be effectively protected, even though replication of virus was not completely inhibited in the lungs.
