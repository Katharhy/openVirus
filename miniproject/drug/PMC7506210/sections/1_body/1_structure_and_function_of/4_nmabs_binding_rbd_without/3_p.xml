<p id="Par13">NMAbs were produced from mice immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV (Tor-3 strain, isolated from a patient infected in the Toronto SARS outbreak

 </sup> These mAbs were then humanized and tested for their affinity and neutralization activity to SARS-CoV. Results showed that chimeric F26G18 bound full-length S protein (rFS) with a Kd of 1.78 ± 0.63 nM and that chimeric F26G18 had a neutralization titer of 2.47 nM which matched that of parental F26G18 with a neutralization titer of 2.07 nM against heat inactivated Tor2.

 </sup> Also, ELISA assays were performed to determine S-protein and RBD specificity for the different mAbs. Of these mAbs, chimeric F26G18 bound to the SARS-CoV RBD, and the reaction was independent of glycosylation. Furthermore, F26G18 and its chimera mapped to a discrete sequential epitope (
 <sub>460</sub>FSPDGKPCTPPALNCYW
 <sub>476</sub>), which overlaps the ACE2 binding site, in the RBD of SARS-CoV S protein,
