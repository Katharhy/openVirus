<p id="Par14">Using hybridoma technology, 26 hybridomas were screened out from mice immunized with radiation-inactivated SARS-CoV. Nine of the most representative clones were selected for further identification. The results showed that five (154C, 240C, 341C, 534C, 560C) of these clones targeted the S protein and that NMAb 341C recognized residues 490â€“510 in the SARS-CoV S protein. Furthermore, the results of neutralization experiments showed that 341C had the strongest neutralizing activity, completely inhibiting the lysis of virus-infected Vero E6 cells at a dilution of 1: 1280.
