<p id="Par15">In a recent study, five variable heavy homodimers (VHH) (VHH-1, VHH-6, VHH-35, VHH-44, and VHH-72) were screened out from a llama immunized with the S protein of SARS-CoV. To assess the antiviral activity of these mAbs, neutralization assays were performed in vitro using SARS-CoV Urbani S pseudotyped lentiviruses. The results showed that VHH-72 neutralized the pseudovirus with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.14 µg/ml. Epitope mapping showed that VHH-72 targets the RBD of SARS-CoV S protein, and the crystal structure shows that VHH-72 blocks the binding of ACE2 and RBD through steric hindrance.
