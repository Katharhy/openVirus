<p id="Par5">Coronaviruses are enveloped spherical particles, the spike glycoproteins (S protein) of which form a crown-like surface (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The S protein consists of two subunits: S1 and S2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The fragment located in the middle of the S1 subunit (amino acids (aa) 318–510) is the minimum receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV, which binds to the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

 </sup> The binding of RBD and ACE2 triggers the conformational change of the S2 subunit and virus particle invasion

 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The crystal structure of the RBD bound to ACE2 peptidase indicates that RBD presents a flat concave surface at the N-terminus of the receptor peptidase on which aa 445–460 anchor the entire receptor-binding loop of the RBD core.

 </sup> This loop (aa 424–494) makes complete contact with the ACE2 receptor and is called the receptor binding motif (RBM)

 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Scientists have already developed safe and effective vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV based on the RBD and screened neutralizing antibodies using it as an antigen. These studies indicate that the RBD contains multiple conformational neutralizing epitopes, which are the main structural domains for inducing neutralizing antibodies and T-cell immune responses, making the RBD an important target for the development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics.

 </sup> Since the emergence of SARS-CoV, researchers have screened, or designed, many NMAbs targeting the RBD. Following the outbreak of COVID-19, the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was soon identified, and it was found that the structure and function of its RBD are very similar to those of SARS-CoV. Moreover, the cell receptor for both viruses is ACE2,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup> and the crystal structure of both virus RBDs interacting with ACE2 is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Therefore, some NMAbs targeting SARS-CoV RBD may also have potential neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. This means that researchers can use the SARS-CoV-2 RBD to screen for NMAbs and design vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Most recently, Yang et al have reported that a SARS-CoV-2 RBD-based recombinant COVID-19 vaccine could induce potent neutralizing antibody responses in the immunized mice, rabbits, and NHPs, and provided protection in non-human primates (NHPs) against SARS-CoV-2 challenge,
