<p id="Par21">Five (1E2, 2F2, 3F11, 4D8, and 5F8) single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) with antiviral activity to SARS-CoV-2 in vitro were identified from a fully synthetic, humanized phage display library with recombinant RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. In a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay, monomeric sdAb 3F11 showed neutralization activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.0038 µg/ml. 3F11 also neutralized SARS-CoV-2 with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.4360 µg/ml in a live virus neutralization assay. The results of a competitive ligand-binding assay suggested that 3F11 completely blocked the binding between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2.

 </sup> sdAbs was fused with human IgG1 Fc fragments. Results showed that the neutralization activity of recombinant 3F11 significantly increased by 10.8-fold in molar concentration with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.0020 µg/ml in a SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus entry assay.
