<p id="Par25">Similarly, two NMAbs, B38 and H4, were isolated from a convalescent COVID-19 patient in China and were recently reported to have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Similar to Cao et al.,

 </sup> the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 was used as bait to isolate specific single memory B cells from PBMC of the patient. In order to identify the antiviral activity of these isolated mAbs, a virus neutralization experiment against SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV/Shenzhen/SZTH-003/2020) was performed. The results showed that B38 had higher potency to inhibit viral infection with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.177 μg/ml. This was followed by H4, which inhibited viral infection with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.896 μg/ml. The crystal structure of the RBD-B38 complex shows that most of the residues on the B38 binding epitope overlap with the RBD-ACE2 binding interface, suggesting that B38 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 infection by functionally mimicking ACE2 to bind RBD and block the RBD-ACE2 binding. B38 and H4 competed with ACE2 for RBD binding in the competition assay. In animal trials, lung viral load was reduced by 32.8% and 26% with a single dose of 25 mg/kg of B38 and H4, respectively, compared with the untreated group. Similarly, a competition assay was performed to identify whether B38 and H4 act on the same epitope on the RBD. No competition was observed between B38 and H4, suggesting that the two NMAbs acted on different RBD sites. Therefore, B38 and H4 can be used as an ideal mAb pair for virus targeting to avoid immune escape in future clinical applications.
