<p id="Par23">In addition, ab1 was identified from eight large phage displayed Fab, scFv and VH libraries by panning against the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. ab1 competes with hACE2 (human ACE2) for binding to RBD, indicating that ab1 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking RBD-ACE2 binding. The ab1 IgG1 could completely neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in a concentration of &lt;400â€‰ng/ml. Moreover, it protected transgenic mice expressing hACE2 from a high-titer intranasal SARS-CoV-2 challenge. A relatively low number of somatic mutations occurred in the sequence of ab1, as determined by sequence alignment results. This indicates that either natural SARS-CoV-2 infection or RBD-based vaccines could stimulate the quick production of ab1-like antibodies. The ab1 IgG1 showed no safety deficiencies; therefore, it has therapeutic and prophylactic potential for SARS-CoV-2 infections.
