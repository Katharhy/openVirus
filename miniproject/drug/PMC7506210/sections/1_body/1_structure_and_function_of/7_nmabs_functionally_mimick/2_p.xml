<p id="Par22">Fourteen effective NMAbs against SARS-CoV-2 were identified from 60 convalescent patients using high-throughput single-cell RNA and VDJ sequencing of antigen-enriched B cells. Among them, BD-368-2 had the most potency, effectively neutralizing the pseudovirus of SARS-CoV-2 and live SARS-CoV-2 with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.2 ng/ml and 15 ng/ml, respectively. In SARS-CoV-2-infected transgenic mice, BD-368-2 also showed strong therapeutic and prophylactic effects. In addition, the target verification results showed that the epitopes of BD-368-2 overlapped with the ACE2 binding site, and the crystallographic analysis indicates that BD23-Fab blocks the interaction between RBD and ACE2.
