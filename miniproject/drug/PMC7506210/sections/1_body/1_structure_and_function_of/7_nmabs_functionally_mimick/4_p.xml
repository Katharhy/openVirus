<p id="Par24">Recently, CB6 was identified from the PBMCs of a COVID-19 convalescent patient by using recombinant RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. CB6 binds RBD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>) and blocks the binding of soluble SARS-CoV-2-RBD with hACE2. Both pseudovirus and live virus neutralization assays were performed to investigate the neutralization activity of CB6 against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The results showed that CB6 could inhibit the pseudovirus of SARS-CoV-2 with ND
 <sub>50</sub> (50% neutralization dose) values of 0.036, 0.023 and 0.041 μg/ml in Huh7, Calu-3, and HEK293T cells, respectively. CB6 could also effectively neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with an ND
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.036 ± 0.007 μg/ml in infected Vero E6 cells. Furthermore, CB6 was tested in a rhesus macaque model infected with SARS-CoV-2 in both prophylactic and treatment settings and showed a considerable effect. Investigating the neutralization mechanism showed that CB6 could block the binding of hACE2 to RBD through steric hindrance and competition with interface residues.
