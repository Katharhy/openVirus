<p id="Par45">In this article, we have summarized NMAbs that target the RBD of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and may have prophylactic or therapeutic potency against SARS and COVID-19. The sources, antiviral activity and targets of NMAbs are compared in Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. A body of evidence suggests that antibodies targeting conserved sites have more broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Therefore, antibodies that target conserved sites are more likely to become broad-spectrum antibodies for coronaviruses that have already appeared or will appear in the future. From these studies, we understand that the antiviral ability of a single NMAb is limited, but that the combination of multiple NMAbs (cocktails) that target different epitopes can achieve satisfactory results in a synergistic way, limiting the possibility of virus escape. The recently reported NMAb 4A8, isolated from convalescent patients and targets N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, has neutralizing activity against pseudoviruses with EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 49 μg/ml and live viruses with EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.61 μg/ml respectively,

 </sup> and could be used as a candidate of a cocktail. Indeed, therapeutic antibody cocktails have been used successfully for the treatment of patients infected with Ebola virus.

 </sup> Among NMAbs we discussed, there are some NMAbs whose sequences are remarkable closed to germline antibodies (e.g., ab1, 2–15),

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>
 </sup> without extensive somatic hypermutations. This bodes well for vaccine development, and these NMAbs have more potency for therapy.
