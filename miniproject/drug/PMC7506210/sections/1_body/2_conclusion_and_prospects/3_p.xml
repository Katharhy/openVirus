 </sup> With scientific technology updates, now methods mainly used to obtain human antibodies include (i) humanizing mouse mAbs,

 </sup> (ii) screening for mAbs from phage display libraries of human antibody fragments,

 </sup> and (iii) immunizing transgenic mice carrying human immunoglobulin gene, followed by hybridoma technology for production of mAbs.

 </sup> In addition, screening of antibodies from patients is the most straightforward and simple method to obtain human antibodies as described above. As COVID-19 epidemic continues, more and more NMAbs have been isolated from the lymphocytes of COVID-19 patients. Although the neutralizing ability of convalescent plasma from some patients was relatively low, some NMAbs isolated from these patients had strong neutralizing activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> as low as 2 ng/ml against live SARS-CoV-2 infection,

 </sup> suggesting that using a vaccine, once it is available, to elicit NMAbs could be an alternative approach. Although numerous antibodies blockbuster antibody drugs are already on the market, technological innovation to improve antibody production is still needed, given that huge amount of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are required for the clinical application. Interestingly, direct antibody synthesis in combination with computerized and bioinformatic approaches are being developed, substantially shortening the time required for antibody development.

 </sup> At the same time, we look forward to new progress in the research and development of antibody drugs, the improvement in long half-life, high efficiency and miniaturization of antibody drugs, and the more economical development of antibody drugs.
