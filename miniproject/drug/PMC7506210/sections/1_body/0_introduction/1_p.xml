<p id="Par2">Coronaviruses represent a large family of viruses common in human and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. However, only a few of these viruses infect people and cause disease. The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is the seventh known coronavirus to infect humans. The other 6 coronaviruses (HCoVs) are HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause very severe symptoms, while the other four viruses usually cause only mild to moderate upper respiratory disease in humans.</p>
