<p id="Par4">Treating with small-molecule compounds has shown good clinical effect, but we still need to be mindful of side effects which play an important role in the selection of therapeutic methods and reagents. Currently, no specific drugs can completely cure the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it is urgent to develop safe and effective therapeutic reagents. Fortunately, human antibodies can accurately and efficiently identify antigens, and they have few side effects in humans. Antibody drugs are widely used in many fields, including cancer and infectious diseases. In addition, antibodies against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been extensively developed.
