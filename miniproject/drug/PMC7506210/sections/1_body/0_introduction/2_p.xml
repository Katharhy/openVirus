<p id="Par3">Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV, the first worldwide pandemic caused by a coronavirus. Before it was contained, SARS had affected 32 countries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. As of December 31, 2003, the total number of SARS cases worldwide had reached 8096, with 774 deaths and a fatality rate of about 9.6% (

COVID-19 refers to the respiratory symptoms and pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. By Sep 18, 2020, according to WHO, SARS-CoV-2 had resulted in 30,369,778 confirmed cases and 948,795 deaths worldwide (

The total number of COVID-19 cases may, however, be higher owing to the inherent difficulties in identifying and counting mild and asymptomatic cases. In addition, the capacity to detect COVID-19 remains inadequate. Some characteristics of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are compared in this review (Table
