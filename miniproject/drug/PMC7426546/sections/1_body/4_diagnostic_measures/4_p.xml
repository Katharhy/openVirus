<p>Finally, serologic tests to identify a virus-specific immune response, including IgM and IgG antibodies, have potential diagnostic implications. The antibody response to infection takes days to weeks to be detectable. Therefore, these tests cannot be used to detect an acute infection and will generally also be negative during the first days post infection. However, accurate serologic assays enable rapid screening and evaluation of the proportion of infected individuals within a given population, herd immunity, and epidemiologic assessments. Furthermore, quantitative serologic assays combined with virus neutralization assays could help define the long-term effectiveness of the anti-viral immune response. Several immunoassays have been developed for SARS-CoV-2, though their accuracy remains to be fully validated.</p>
