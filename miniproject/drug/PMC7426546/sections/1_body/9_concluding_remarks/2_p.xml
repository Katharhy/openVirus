<p>A key question is whether SARS-CoV-2 will stay with us and become endemic, like the influenza virus and other hCoVs such as hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-229E, or will eventually disappear like SARS-CoV. Endemic viruses may acquire mutations that reduce their virulence, yet the opposite scenario, the emergence of a more dangerous strain, is also possible. Therefore, constant monitoring of the population to examine the incidence of infection as well as the genetic shift of the virus is essential. Furthermore, given the history of coronaviruses, they should be regarded as an ongoing threat to human health, as additional animal viruses of this family may undergo genetic changes enabling them to infect humans. Whether infection with one virus family member confers a certain level of immunity to others, and how long the immunity to a given virus persists, remains to be defined.</p>
