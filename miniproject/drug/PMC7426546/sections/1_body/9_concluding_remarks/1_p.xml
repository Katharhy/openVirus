<p>Current management of COVID-19 has been mainly dependent on the prevention of infection, including case diagnosis followed by epidemiologic investigation and quarantine, as well as supportive care. Collaborations are key for fighting this new pandemic; it is important both for knowledge acquisition and innovative initiatives for prevention and treatment, but also essential in the modern, globally interconnected world. Lessons learned from other viruses as well as newly collected data and its rapid dissemination, describing virus transmission, genetic evolution, receptor binding, immune response, and pathogenesis, can be combined towards solving the puzzling outbreak and disease. In the battle against the COVID-19 outbreak, virology serves as a major axis around which a variety of other fields of expertise, such as epidemiology, medicine, immunology, mathematics, chemistry, computer and data science, move together.</p>
