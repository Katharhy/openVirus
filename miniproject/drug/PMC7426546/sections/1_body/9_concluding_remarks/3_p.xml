<p>Scientists need to know how the virus functions upon infection. This involves virus cultivation and propagation in cell culture, and development of appropriate cell/organ culture and animal models. Laboratory studies should also describe the virus host range, which is primarily determined by the susceptibility or permissiveness of different cells. Further basic study of the biology of these viruses is warranted as it may identify new targets for therapy.</p>
