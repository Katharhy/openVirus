<p>Passive immunization provides immediate protection as it does not require a response by the patient, but it does not induce immune memory. In the context of an acute viral infection, such treatment involves administration of anti-viral antibodies that were either derived from the plasma of individuals who recovered from infection or synthetically designed. Treatment can be provided during infection or prophylactically to protect individuals at high risk such as healthcare personnel. It can also be used for prevention following suspected exposure. Transfusion of convalescent plasma was proven effective in treating several viral infections including the H5N1

 <xref rid="b46-rmmj-11-3-e0023" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> yet its effect on virus shedding and disease outcome must be evaluated when given to healthy individuals and patients at different stages and severity of the disease. Importantly, diverse antibodies are produced following viral infection, yet only a fraction of these antibodies is capable of neutralizing the infection. Accordingly, while convalescent plasma could be useful in the short term, it is preferable to identify the most potent antibodies to allow large-scale manufacturing and standardization. As the main target of coronaviruses neutralizing antibodies is the spike protein, samples from patients are screened to identify B cells that produce SARS-CoV-2 antibodies specifically directed at spike. The genes encoding these antibodies are then cloned, and the antigen-binding motif may be used for therapy.
