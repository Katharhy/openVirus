<p>Concerns about the potential emergence of an influenza virus pandemic have been raised and extensively discussed over many years. These concerns were based on the destructive 1918 Spanish pandemic flu, as well as on subsequent influenza virus outbreaks, the most recent of which emerged in Mexico in 2009.

Nevertheless, a clear potential threat by coronaviruses was recognized by a number of investigators.
