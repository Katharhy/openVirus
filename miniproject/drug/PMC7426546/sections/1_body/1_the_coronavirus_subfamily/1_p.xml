<p>COVID-19 is caused by a newly identified virus, SARS-CoV-2, belonging to the 
 <italic>Coronavirinae</italic> subfamily in the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family. Based on phylogenetic relationship and genomic organization, this subfamily has four different genera—alpha, beta, gamma, and delta—of which alpha- and betacoronaviruses have mammalian hosts, while the reservoir of the gamma- and deltacoronaviruses is mainly birds. Sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was accomplished soon after its discovery, promoting its classification to the betacoronavirus and subsequent attribution of certain basic properties that can permit some basic assumptions.
