<p>Replication of the CoV RNA genome takes place on cellular membranes while generating dramatic changes in their organization. Replication involves the synthesis of a full-length negative-strand RNA, which serves as a template for the synthesis of additional positive-sense RNA genomes. The 5′-most open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1ab, are translated from full-length genomic RNA, while a series of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs, which commonly include the 60–100-nucleotide untranslated leader sequence from the 5′ end, and extend to the 3′ end of the RNA genome, are produced to enable translation of downstream genes. Production of these mRNAs involves discontinuous transcription of the full-length positive-strand RNA genome. This process may encompass switching between templates and can therefore result in homologous or heterologous recombination when more than one CoV virion infects a given cell. This capacity, along with the high theoretical mutation rate of the RNA genome by RdRp (10
 <sup>4</sup> nucleotide substitutions/site/ year) can potentially enable rapid genetic changes in coronaviruses. Accordingly, long-term coronavirus infection in some animals, combined with high mutation and recombination rates, increases the probability that a virus mutant with an extended host range might arise.

ExoN inhibitors are expected to reduce the fidelity of CoV replication and thus promote high-level mutagenesis of the viral genome that could drive virus extinction.
