<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) are the largest known RNA viruses, encoding 26–32 kb positive-sense single-stranded RNA with a 5′-terminal cap structure and a 3′-polyadenylated tail. Virions of coronaviruses have a mean diameter of 120 nm, while their most notable feature is a halo of spikes that project from the envelope and give the viral particle the shape of a solar corona, inspiring the name of this family of viruses. Four major structural proteins form the coronavirus particles: the nucleocapsid (N) phosphoprotein, which forms a helical ribonucleoprotein core together with the viral genome; the trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates virion attachment to host cell receptor and membrane fusion; the membrane (M) protein, which is highly abundant and shapes the virion envelope; and the low-abundance integral envelope (E) protein, which plays an important role in viral envelope assembly. Certain coronaviruses also include the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein, which forms short protrusions beneath the S protein spikes. All structural genes, except the HE, are encoded in the 3′-most third of the genome, while the other two-thirds encode the viral non-structural proteins (NSPs), such as replication enzymes and additional accessory genes. Two partially overlapping open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, are encoded in this region, producing the ORF1a polypeptide or being continuously translated via ribosome frameshifting to produce a large ORF1ab polyprotein. These polyproteins are cleaved by virus-encoded proteinases into a number of mature NSPs. As cleavage of the polypeptide is essential for production of functional viral proteins, drugs that target these proteinases have potential therapeutic applications. The assembled NSP replicase–transcriptase complex (RTC) is responsible for RNA replication and transcription. Of note, the coronaviruses encode several viral proteins with RNA-modifying or replication activities, including RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), a helicase, an exonuclease (ExoN), and 2′-O-ribose-methyltransferase.
