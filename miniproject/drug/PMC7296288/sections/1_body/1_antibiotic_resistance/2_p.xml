<p id="Par6">Antibiotic resistance development is not limited to bacteria; it involves all human pathogens. Pathogenic viruses have been known to become resistant to antivirals, with influenza A and B now commonly resistant to adamantane compounds and occasionally resistant to newer neuraminidase inhibitors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Several antiviral compounds are being currently studied, including favipiravir and fludase with potential broad activity against many pathogenic RNA viruses such as Ebola, West Nile, rabies, and Zika in addition to influenza viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Another drug in clinical trials for influenza treatment is the neuraminidase inhibitor laninamivir which would be available as a nasal inhalation if approved [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Nitazoxanide, an antiparasitic agent, used to treat cryptosporidium infection in AIDS patients is currently in trials for influenza treatment due to its apparent antiviral activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Development of a more effective flu vaccine would do much to control influenza epidemics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. As far as other viral diseases are concerned, Presatovir (GS-5806) is in trials for Respiratory Syncytial Virus infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and sofosbuvir, a drug previously approved for hepatitis C treatment, is in trials for treatment of Zika virus infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. While several new compounds are being studied, nothing new has become available for herpes virus illnesses since our last update[
