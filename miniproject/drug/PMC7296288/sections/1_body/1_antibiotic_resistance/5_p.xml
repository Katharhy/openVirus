<p id="Par9">Several pathogens were recently identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a critical priority, based on mortality, health care burden, and prevalence of resistance [

By definition, antimicrobials are meant in general to cure disease rather than to be taken forever as, for example, medications to treat diabetes or hypertension. Furthermore, antimicrobial husbandry includes attempts to limit pathogen resistance by limiting the time course of treatment. Additionally, the FDA requires that new agents for use in simple infections show superiority, which would require a very large number of subjects enrolled in a study, since most of these infections resolve spontaneously [
