<p id="Par5">Antibiotic-resistant bacteria continue to spread worldwide and are a persistent and severe health threat [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>•] with morbidity and mortality increasing annually [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There are multiple implications to physicians caring for patients with presentations concerning for infectious etiology, including the frequent need for early administration of multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Emergency Departments (EDs) are a common entry point for care for patients with a range of infectious diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>••], and ED physicians are on the front line for early and sometimes the only antibacterial therapy choice for these patients. Patients affected by extended spectrum β-lactamase–producing and colistin-resistant 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and drug-resistant 
 <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> are encountered routinely in US Emergency Departments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>••]. Multidrug-resistant bacteria are affecting all populations and have been implicated even in neonatal sepsis requiring broader coverage in that patient group [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It is important for ED providers to stay abreast of new therapies and concepts for these common and serious infections [
