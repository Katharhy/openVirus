<p>At D7, the levels of several cytokines were highly and negatively associated with survival times, in particular cytokines having pro‐inflammatory or anti‐inflammatory effects. In fact, the levels of IL6, IL10, IL1‐RA, IFNα, IFNγ, and G‐CSF, were more significantly associated with survival than viral load levels, suggesting that those cytokines may be more predictive of outcome than viral load. Furthermore, in the four animals that had an extended survival for which cytometry data were available, most of the CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte population counts rapidly increased after D10. In particular, the CD8 T cells expressing cytotoxic surface markers (granzyme B, perforin, and NKp80) increase showed a trend to be associated to viral load decline after D10.</p>
