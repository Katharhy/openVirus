<p>Then the model was extended to include the adaptive response, assuming a decline of nonspecific cells and an expansion of specific cytotoxic T‐cells. Following the same strategy, models building was performed assuming that this effect was primarily supported by cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes subpopulation. CD8 T lymphocytes expressing granzyme B, perforin, or NKp80 were successively fitted to the data and we found that CD8 T lymphocytes expressing perforin provided the best improvement of the data description and could reproduce both the cytokine‐mediated lymphopenia observed in early infection and the rapid viral decline in NHPs after peak viremia. The schematic representation of the final selected viral dynamic model is given in
