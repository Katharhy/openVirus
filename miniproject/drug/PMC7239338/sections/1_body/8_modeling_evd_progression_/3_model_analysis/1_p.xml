<p>The estimate of parameter

This implied that IFNα concentration greater than about 10‐fold this value (17 pg/mL) provides little additional benefit for cell protection. Thus, in untreated animals, the infection affects a significant proportion of the target cells, and consecutively trigger a massive release of IFNα (with median levels of 400 pg/mL at peak viremia;

 </xref>) and other pro‐inflammatory cytokines that negatively affects survival rate in spite of limiting cell infection. Conversely, in treated animals, favipiravir reduces viral production and slows the infection progression. Hence, the number of infected cells and IFNα concentrations are lower. These levels of IFNα concentrations are sufficient to confer a nearly similar effect on cell protection than in untreated macaques. The impairment of the viral replication in treated macaques gives time to the organism to protect the targets cells and, thus, reduces and delays peak viremia while limiting the deleterious effect of a cytokine storm on survival (
