<p>In the days that follow infection, the half‐life of infected cells was estimated to about 3 days (
 <italic>δ</italic> = 0.22/day), suggesting that in absence of an adaptive response, it would take several weeks to clear the virus in the blood. However, the loss rate of infected cells was reduced continuously with the concomitant increase in specific CD8 T lymphocyte levels, in particular those expressing perforin. This leads to a much shorter half‐life of about 16 hours (
