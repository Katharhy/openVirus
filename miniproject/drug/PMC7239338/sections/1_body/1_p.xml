 </xref> The main advantages of applying an approved agent to treat a new indication, a process called “drug repurposing,” are that the drug is available in large quantities and that safety studies have already been conducted on large populations.

 </xref> Consequently, it can be used more rapidly on a large scale and be particularly relevant as a first line of protection to administer to suspect or contact cases during a pathogen outbreak. However, the data available for a specific pathogen are often limited, and specific methodologies are needed to leverage the information that has been collected with other pathogens or in animal models. This is particularly crucial as the antiviral efficacy of a repurposed drug can be lower than what could be obtained with a specific antiviral agent.
