<p>It is this dosing regimen that was chosen in “JIKI,” an open multicenter nonrandomized clinical trial that took place in Guinea from December 2014 to April 2015.

 </xref> JIKI was the largest therapeutic clinical trial performed during the epidemic, with 126 patients included. The first result of the JIKI trial was that mortality was strongly associated with baseline viremia, and accordingly the result analyses should be stratified on the baseline cycle threshold (CT) value, with a cutoff for baseline viremia of 20 CT (corresponding to 7.7 log
 <sub>10</sub> EBOV RNA copies/mL). The mortality rate was equal to 20.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) 11.6–32.4%) in patients with CT ≥ 20 and 90.9% (95% CI 78.8–96.4%) in patients with CT &lt; 20. Both CIs for the mortality rates included the predefined target values (defined on values observed in the same centers before the trial) of 30% and 85%, respectively, providing no evidence that favipiravir monotherapy has a favorable benefit/risk ratio in patients with very high viral load at onset. However, in those having a baseline CT value ≥ 20, there was a small signal toward a better survival rate, albeit not significant. Consistent results were reported in a retrospective analysis of 163 patients admitted in an Ebola treatment center in Coyah, Guinea, where lower but no significant case fatality rate and significant longer survival time were found in patients receiving favipiravir on a compassionate use basis.

 </xref> Several clinical trials evaluating other candidate treatments from different therapeutic classes, including ZMapp, TKM‐Ebola, brincidofovir, and convalescent plasma were implemented in Gunea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone during the 2013–2016 outbreak, yet none of them could demonstrate a significant improvement of survival rate related to the antiviral treatment.
