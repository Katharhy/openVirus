<p>Even if drug exposure is satisfactory, the translation of results from NHP experiments to patients needs caution. First, unlike what is obtained in the NHP model, EVD is not uniformly lethal and the mortality rate during the 2013–2016 outbreak was close to 40%. Second, no supportive care was administered in infected animals, which was shown to be critical for patient outcome. Thus, it is possible that the NHP models are more stringent and that treatment initiation of a potent drug, closer to peak viremia, may nonetheless have an impact on the disease and survival. In the 2013–2016 outbreak, the time from symptom onset to admission in the Ebola treatment centers was between 3 and 5 days

Consistent with our prediction that antiviral drugs should be initiated as early as possible to reach maximal therapeutic benefit, the effect on survival in these studies was modest for favipiravir,

 </xref> In August 2019, an interim analysis on the first 499 included patients showed favorable results with two of four candidates, REGN‐EB3 or mAb114, which are, respectively, monoclonal antibodies cocktail and single monoclonal antibodies.

 </xref> suggest that their efficacy could remain largely contingent on the timing of treatment initiation, and monoclonal antibodies remain uneasy to use in limited resource settings and expensive to produce. In that respect, and following what has been done in chronic viral infections, mathematical modeling can be used to better understand the efficacy of antiviral drugs. In spite of the difficulty to collect data in treatment centers during epidemics, more modelers should be involved in the design and the analysis of clinical trials to accelerate the development of effective therapies.
