<p>How to interpret our results in the context of antiviral therapy, in particular in EVD? The first aspect is obviously the question of the target drug concentration. The results found in NHPs, where significant protection was conferred with a drug efficacy of 50% corresponds to free drug concentrations of ~ 100 μg/mL. This is greater than the value determined prior to the trial based on mice experiments, and is, more importantly, greater than the level achieved in patients of the JIKI trial. This strongly suggests that doses larger than those used in the JIKI trial will be needed to achieve a high level of antiviral efficacy against EBOV. Given the complexity of the drug PKs, we now need to find safe and tolerable dosing regimen that could generate such exposure in humans and this will be evaluated in a clinical trial.</p>
