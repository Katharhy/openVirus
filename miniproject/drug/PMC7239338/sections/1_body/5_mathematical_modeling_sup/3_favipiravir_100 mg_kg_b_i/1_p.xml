<p>Preliminary PK studies conducted in uninfected cynomolgus macaques from a Chinese colony found that a loading dose of 200 mg/kg b.i.d. the first day followed by 100 mg/kg b.i.d. achieved drug concentrations that were comparable to those predicted in successful mice experiments and expected in the JIKI trial. Accordingly, a first experiment was designed where cynomolgus macaques from Mauritius Island were infected 2 days after the initiation of treatment (pre‐exposure prophylaxis). Although treated animals had a median peak viremia lower than untreated animals, there was no benefit of favipiravir in terms of survival (
