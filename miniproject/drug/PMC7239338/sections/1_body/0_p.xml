<p>Specific aspects of modernization, such as rapid air transit, as well as demographic trends, including urbanization, have accelerated both the (re)emergence and the spread of viruses,

Although nearly 100 antiviral drugs have been approved since the approval of idoxuridine in 1963 (an anti‐herpes virus drug), these molecules are licensed in a very narrow range of only nine human viruses (HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), herpes simplex virus, influenza, hepatitis B virus, Varicella zoster virus, human cytomegalovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and human papillomavirus), with anti‐HIV and anti‐HCV drugs representing more than half of these.

 </xref> there are no antiviral drugs available against the vast majority of human pathogenic viruses, including the emerging ones. Given the cost of drug development and the epidemiology of these infections that mostly affect low‐income countries, it is unlikely that the drug industry will invest largely in the development of specific antiviral compounds. In this context, it is the role of academic research groups to look for innovative antiviral strategies against emerging viral infections.
