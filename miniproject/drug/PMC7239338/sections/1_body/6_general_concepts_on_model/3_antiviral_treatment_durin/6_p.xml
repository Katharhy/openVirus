<p>Of note, in these models, the viral load does reach 0 (i.e., eradication, only asymptotically, and cannot address the question of optimal treatment duration). A paradox of these models is that, in case of high antiviral efficacy, viral growth is almost entirely blocked, thus the immune system does not step in and all cells remain targets when treatment is stopped. Because viral dynamic models are deterministic, it cannot reproduce viral eradication and even a small quantity of virus can be sufficient to reignite the infection, provided that there are a large number of target cells are present. Thus, if treatment is stopped, virus dynamics will be similar to an acute infection without any treatment. To address the question of treatment duration needed to achieve cure, one would need to incorporate in these models the possibility of viral eradication, using stochastic events
