<p>In this model, cytokine levels, 
 <italic>F</italic>, are proportional to the number of infected cells and their release in the circulation increases the number of cells that are refractory to the infection, noted 
 <italic>R</italic>. When the cytokine levels exceed a certain threshold, denoted 
 <italic>θ</italic>, cell receptors are saturated and the rate of cell “conversion” from susceptible to refractory state saturates to a level noted 
 <italic>ϕ</italic>. Of note, several model extensions can be proposed, such as a reversion of refractory to susceptible cells, or also considering the effect of IFN in reducing viral production.

 </xref> Further extensions may include the cellular or humoral adaptive immune responses. In acute infections, most of the proposed adaptive response models focused on cytotoxic lymphocytes and/or antibodies responses and are structurally close to those proposed for the innate response, but need to incorporate the delay characterizing the development of these responses.

 </xref> Including adaptive response may help explore the mechanisms leading to the outcome of the infection, viral clearance, host death, or chronic infection.
