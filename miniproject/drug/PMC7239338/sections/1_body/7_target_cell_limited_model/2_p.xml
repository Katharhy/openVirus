<p>A target cell limited model was sufficient to capture the viral kinetic of the acute infection, consistent with the fact that IFN response is impaired in these animals.

 </xref> Viral kinetics in untreated animals was characterized by an exponential growth of virus until D8 followed by rapid death, leading to an estimated R
 <sub>0</sub> of 9, which suggests that a treatment efficacy larger than 90% would be needed to block viral replication. Viral growth was accompanied with high levels of transaminases,
