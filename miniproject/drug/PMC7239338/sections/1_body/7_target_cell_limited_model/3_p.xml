 </math> where 
 <italic>k</italic> is the rate of transfer between the plasma and the effect concentration. We estimated that it took about 2 days to achieve a high antiviral effectiveness of about 95%. In mice starting treatment at D6 (i.e., 2 days before peak viremia), the treatment period was sufficient to reduce the peak viremia by 1.5 log. However, in mice treated at D8, the treatment initiation was too late and the activity of favipiravir was not sufficient (estimated to 80% at peak viremia) to substantially perturb viral dynamics and increase survival. This suggests that favipiravir treatment, in order to be effective, has to be initiated as early as possible and before peak viremia.
