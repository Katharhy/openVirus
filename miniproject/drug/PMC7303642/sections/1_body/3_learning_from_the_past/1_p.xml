<p id="p0040">COVID-19 appears to follow a disease course similar to previous highly pathogenic coronavirus infections (ie, Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS] and severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]), with up to 20% of hospitalized patients progressing to potentially fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome.

 </xref> Risk factors for poor outcomes during the SARS and MERS outbreaks included older age and the presence of comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, and renal disease. Immunosuppression alone was not identified as a significant risk factor for primary infection or death,
