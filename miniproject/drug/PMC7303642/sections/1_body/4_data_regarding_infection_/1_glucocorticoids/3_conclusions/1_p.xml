<p id="p0060">There is evidence for harm without a clear mortality benefit when systemic corticosteroids have been used to treat MERS and SARS-associated pneumonia. Existing safety data also indicates that daily doses of systemic corticosteroids &gt;10 mg of prednisone equivalent are associated with an increased susceptibility to overall infection. Recently however, preliminary evidence from a large RCT suggests that the use of dexamethasone reduces mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Further data are needed to define the optimal use and potential complications of systemic corticosteroid use in the setting of COVID-19.</p>
