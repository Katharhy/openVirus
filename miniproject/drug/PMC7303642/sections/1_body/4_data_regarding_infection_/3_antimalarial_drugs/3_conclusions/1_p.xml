<p id="p0085">The current data show no significant risk of infection or infectious complications when antimalarials are used for the treatment of immune-mediated disease and therefore suggest low potential for harm in COVID-19 infection. However, data supporting the use of antimalarials for prevention or treatment of COVID-19 are lacking at present, and use of antimalarials outside of a hospital or clinical trial is cautioned against.
