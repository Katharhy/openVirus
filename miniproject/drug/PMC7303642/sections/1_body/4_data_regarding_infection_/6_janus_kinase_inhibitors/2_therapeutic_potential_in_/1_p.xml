<p id="p0120">Ruxolitinib (NCT04362137) and baricitinib (NCT04280705) are currently being evaluated in phase III clinical trials for potential therapeutic effect in patients critically ill with COVID-19. It is suggested that preferential inhibition of JAK1 and JAK2 significantly downregulates the production of interleukin (IL) 6 and interferon-Î³, both of which are implicated in the hyperinflammatory state seen in patients critically ill with COVID-19.
