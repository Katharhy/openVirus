<p id="p0145">Taken together, these data suggest a low risk of harm with IL-12/23 or IL-23 inhibition. Further data are needed regarding any potential increased risk of viral and nonviral URIs associated with IL-17 inhibition. The data presented indicate higher rates of overall infection and URIs with TNF inhibitors; however, ongoing trials investigating the therapeutic potential of adalimumab in the COVID-19â€“related cytokine storm are still underway, and this precludes any definitive comments relating to the safety of TNF inhibitors in COVID-19.</p>
