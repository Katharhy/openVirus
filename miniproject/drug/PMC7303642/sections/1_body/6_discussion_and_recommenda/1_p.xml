<p id="p0200">We believe a patient-centered approach, with shared decision making informed by the data presented here, will help mitigate risk to our patients. Factors to consider are summarized in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>. Our interpretation of the literature based on the highest quality of evidence available to date is found in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table III</xref> . The overarching principles are that immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapy can be safely initiated or continued in most patients. Physicians should alter and optimize regimens in favor of lower-risk options where possible, and as outlined more specifically in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table III</xref> and
