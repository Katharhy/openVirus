In contrast, no association was seen between TNF inhibitor monotherapy and poor COVID-19 outcomes (adjusted OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.37-2.17).

Among subgroups, 23% (23 of 98) of steroid users had poor outcomes compared with only 2% (8 of 337) of patients on TNF inhibitor monotherapy and 3% (3 of 112) of patients on IL-12/23 inhibitors.
