  <p>Conservation of the Sofosbuvir binding residues in members of the 
   <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genus and structural superposition of SARS-Coronavirus nsp12 with hepatitis C virus NS5B bound to Sofosbuvir. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Multiple alignment of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 and other coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-related coronavirus. The colored lines below the alignment mark the different structural motifs and are the same as Fig.Â 
   <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; the residues that partake in Sofosbuvir binding are highlighted in orange, whereas the catalytic aspartates are highlighted in red. (
   <bold>b</bold>) The structural superposition of the two polymerases (HCV NS5B is colored blue; SARS-CoV nsp12 is colored yellow) shows the high degree of conservation in the active site. The sidechains of the residues partaking in Sofosbuvir binding are shown, and sofosbuvir is colored orange.
