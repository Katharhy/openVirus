<p id="Par7">The multiple alignment of the SARS-CoV nsp12 sequence with distinct SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 sequences and MERS-related coronaviruses shows that the SOF-binding residues are conserved (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). As expected, even the most recent SARS-CoV-2 sequences present a strict conservation of the polymerase catalytic domain and the binding residues (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). A structural superposition of the SARS-coronavirus nsp12 with HCV NS5B bound to SOF shows that the inhibitor can be modeled into the nsp12’s active site without any steric hindrances, and that the residues that partake in SOF binding are well conserved in the SARS-coronavirus active site (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). As observed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, some of the residues’ side-chains involved in SOF-binding and catalytic activities have different conformations in the two polymerases. This might be explained by the fact that the HCV NS5B is in an active conformation, whereas the SARS-CoV nsp12 is in its apo-form. Neither the results presented here nor a recently published independent model

 </sup> support the possibility that the conserved T680 found in coronaviruses but absent in NS5B is required for SOF binding to the RdRp active site. Detailed characterization of the interaction between T680 and SOF must await experimental analysis and/or the availability of a three-dimensional structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 bound to SOF. While this manuscript was under review, very similar conclusions have been reported by Elfiky
