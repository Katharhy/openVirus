<p id="Par8">With the number of COVID-19 cases surpassing the 2 million and fatalities reaching over 160 000 deaths, the resources and the options being tested against the virus are increasing in a parallel way, with serious proposals of testing stem-cells and traditional Chinese medicines as antivirals

 </sup>, it would be interesting to develop 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments to test its efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 as well as its minimal inhibitory concentration as a step towards later testing in a clinical setting. Although SOF has a high barrier to resistance, several point mutations have been identified in the HCV NS5B that confer resistance to this drug in clinical settings, which may occur in the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12

 </sup>, it can be speculated that a SOF regime in high concentrations might circumvent the action of the ExoN and prevent the removal of the drug. The SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibition might represent a key step towards a control of the COVID-19 pandemic; nevertheless, the two latter aspects and previous RNA viral infections suggest that a multitargeted approach, in which different drugs target different viral proteins, might be the ultimate strategy.
