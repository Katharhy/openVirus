  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup> reveals that the drug binds to the active site and is incorporated into the nascent strand preventing the addition of the next nucleotide. The residues that participate in SOF binding include motif A’s D225, motif B’s S282, T287, and N291 (the latter binds to the SOF 2′-F), motif F’s K141 and R158, plus motif A’s and C’s universally conserved aspartates that coordinate the metal ions
