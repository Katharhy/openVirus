<p id="Par5">The most highly conserved protein in all known RNA viruses is the viral monomeric RdRp. The coronavirus replication machinery is a large multi-subunit complex; however, the polymerase domain (nsp12) has the characteristic right-hand shape with fingers, thumb and palm subdomains, and the six conserved structural motifs (Fig.Â

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>. Structural and phylogenetic analysis indicate that all known viral RdRps are monophyletic and preserve a high degree of structural conservation, in which key residues within six conserved structural motifs partake in the correct nucleotide recognition and incorporation

 </sup>. Nowadays, there are several drugs that bind to the RdRp active site and that have been approved to treat other RNA viral diseases, including Favipiravir
