<p id="Par59">The number of women incarcerated worldwide has increased by 53% since 2000, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] and substance use is clearly present in womenâ€™s prisons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A higher proportion of women than men are incarcerated for drug-related offences [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]; for example in Europe and Central Asia, an estimated one in four female prisoners has been convicted of a drug offence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Sex workers who use drugs are particularly vulnerable, with the dual criminalisation of sex work and drug possession putting them at particularly high risk of incarceration [
