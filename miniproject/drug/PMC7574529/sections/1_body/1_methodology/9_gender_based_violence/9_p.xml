<p id="Par45">Many of the women at the Metzineres centre in Barcelona reported lived experiences of violence. This can be during adulthood and/or childhood, from partners, family members, other acquaintances and/or strangers. Staff and participants at Metzineres report a severe lack of public services able to meet the complex needs of women and non-gender conforming people who use drugs and have experience of violence. As identified elsewhere in Europe, these experiences are commonly addressed separately by mainstream services without acknowledgement of the complex interdependence between the two. One member of staff at Metzineres reported that:

  <p id="Par46">Services related to women surviving violence are not an answer. They do not accept women who use drugs, or they have conditions that are incompatible with the situation of most of them.</p>
 </disp-quote> Equally, according to the same staff member, mainstream harm reduction services are incapable of addressing the needs of women with experience of violence:
 <disp-quote>
  <p id="Par47">They do not take into account their specificities, their experiences of trauma and needs of safety and protection particularities or their strategies to cope with them.</p>
 </disp-quote> As a result, women report resorting to unofficial and sometimes illegal means to protect themselves from abuse. 
 <italic>Narcopisos,</italic> apartments (often squats or under illegal occupation) where people can buy and use drugs in private, emerged as an alternative to the official drug consumption spaces. One women reported that she had escaped an abusive relationship by setting up a 
 <italic>narcopiso</italic>:
 <disp-quote>
  <p id="Par48">I was the first who opened a narcopiso.[…] I had a fight with my ex-husband. He told me that if I continue dealing he would kill me. I was in a squat with a friend and I told her to bring people because I was hiding and couldn’t go out. It was successful for a long time because cops did not know what it was or what was going on. I spent 6 years in jail and when I was released everybody was doing the same.</p>
 </disp-quote> While for some women such spaces may offer shelter from law enforcement and abusers, focus group participants commonly reported sexual and physical assault that occurs in the 
 <italic>narcopisos</italic>. One participant described how reliance on these spaces can make women more vulnerable to violence:
 <disp-quote>
  <p id="Par49">The narcopisos have been through a huge change, there are strong mafias behind, they don’t live in the neighbourhood. They just came here because there were empty flats where they can open their business for free, day and night. They control all the market. I have to buy from them.[…] They don’t give a shit for the clients or the neighbours and the level of violence has risen. What women suffer in that places is terrible.</p>
 </disp-quote> There is a clear need for services that understand the complex needs of women who use drugs and have experience of violence, without forcing them into hidden spaces where they are at greater risk of social, physical and drug-related harm. Metzineres seeks to provide such a space. As one women experiencing homelessness and an abusive partner reported:
 <disp-quote>
  <p id="Par50">Coming here I could break my relationship with him. He hurt me, but I was afraid of sleeping in the streets by myself. Now I know that I am not alone anymore, we have our strategies to protect each other.</p>
