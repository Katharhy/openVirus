<p id="Par43">Links between drug use and intimate partner violence have been established in systematic reviews, which find that they can in some cases be co-occurring mutually enhancing phenomena, influenced by power relations based on class, race and gender [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The exact nature of the link is unclear [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]; however, there is a wealth of evidence that intimate partner violence has a negative effect on access to harm reduction services for women who use drugs. While physical assault by a husband, boyfriend or former partner is generally associated with increased access to health services (because of the occurrence of physical injury and mental trauma), the same is not true for women who use drugs [
