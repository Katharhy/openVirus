 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. With responsibility for parenting disproportionately falling to women, harm reduction services that do not meet the needs of mothers represent a significant barrier to access for women who use drugs. Firstly, women consistently report that a lack of childcare facilities means they are unable or unwilling to access harm reduction services [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. Thirdly, mothers who use drugs report that they are reluctant to access health and harm reduction services because of the risk of losing custody of children based on drug use [
