<p id="Par18">Metzineres has a transdisciplinary team, some of whom are survivors of violence or have experience of mental ill health. The team includes a team coordinator and a harm reduction coordinator (both with lived experience of drug use), a doctor, nurse, social educators, social workers, an artist, an administrator and a social anthropologist. They work together with the participants to implement an intersectional feminist, harm reduction and human rights, person-centred, approach founded on the freedom of (re)definition, autonomy, empowerment and improvement of physical, emotional and psychological wellness. Among its goals are to reduce access barriers and increase adherence to health and social care services, through diversified, comprehensive, appropriate, affordable, accessible and high-quality resources and services; uphold women and gender non-conforming people who use drugs as essential interlocutors to influence implementation, development or transformation of public policies and whatever actions that, directly or indirectly, could determine their vital journey and to diminish prejudice, stigma and discrimination against people who use or have used drugs.</p>
