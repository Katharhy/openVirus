<p id="Par16">The literature was sourced from online databases. Using search terms relevant to women and harm reduction and screening by title and abstract, the initial search found 101 papers. Further investigation of these papers and checks for relevant references produced 46 additional papers. Finally, 45 papers were excluded after reading, as they did not bear sufficient relevance to the research question. This left a total of 102 academic papers to be reviewed in this study. This was supplemented with reference to grey literature.</p>
