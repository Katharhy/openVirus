<p id="Par30">In Barcelona, women who use drugs reported stigma to be a pervasive experience in their lives, and an experience that leads to deprioritising self-care and harm reduction. One women who uses heroin and crack daily said:

  <p id="Par31">Today I had money, and I wanted to spend it on something nice for me. I went to a hairdresser and she look at me with rejection. She didnâ€™t want to do my hair. Why? I am clean, I am cleaner that most of her clients. Finally, I expended my money on crack. </p>
 </disp-quote> Many women and gender non-conforming people attending the Metzineres centre no longer access the mainstream harm reduction, health and social services that are available in Barcelona. They report that this is a result of multiple interrelated factors that drive social exclusion and stigma, among which are drug use, sex work, migration status, gender identity and living with HIV and/or hepatitis C. The stigma and discrimination they experience are mutually reinforcing with wider experiences of structural violence: extreme poverty, homelessness, family breakdown and the loss of custody of their children.
