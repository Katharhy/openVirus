<p id="Par32">One of the central goals of Metzineres has been to challenge the stigma and structural violence experienced by women and gender non-conforming people who use drugs, and for them to be considered (and consider themselves) a part of the community rather than challenge the community must face. Many participants reported that Metzineres is the first place that they feel safe, with the power to define their own engagement, according to their personal circumstances, well-being and levels of trust. They are not service recipients, but experts who drive the services provided at their own pace. Staff at the centre aim to mitigate any perception of failure, to avoid re-victimisation and secondary traumatisation, while also recovering power, community and belonging. One participant, a transwoman with experience of migration, reported that:

  <p id="Par33">It is the first time that before hiring someone the staff ask for our opinion. We have an assembly every Wednesday where we decide what activities we want or if there are any problems. We discuss a lot, and we are not always agreed, in fact, most of the time we are not, but it doesn’t matter because it is ours. And we never had anything like that before. We are a dysfunctional family but a family who sticks together to face the problems together.</p>
 </disp-quote> Creating active participation in the community is one of the main goals of Metzineres. They facilitate the participation of Metzineres participants in wider society in contexts free of stigma and discrimination. This includes organising and participating in social events in communal spaces in the El Raval district. Metzineres and the participants who frequent the centre have substantial links with other social, communitarian and solidarity movements and organisations in the area and have faced very little opposition from local actors. As reported by one woman experiencing homelessness:

  <p id="Par34">You know, one of the things that happen when you are on the streets, shooting every day, is that you just talk with other drug users or service providers. But [Metzineres] is not like that. We have our paella on Fridays and a lot of different people come to have lunch with us. Now I can go to the community garden and they are my friends. It is nice to meet people outside of this world sometimes.</p>
 </disp-quote> One woman who injects methamphetamine emphasised the effect of how such an environment helps to confront self-stigma and promote self-belief and empowerment:
 <disp-quote>
  <p id="Par35">When a friend of mine told me about this place I couldn’t believe her. First weeks coming here I didn’t know who was staff and who wasn’t. I thought that I deserved everything that happened to me. Now I know that we have rights and if we are together, we can accomplish a lot of things.</p>
 </disp-quote> Another participant, a transwoman with experience of sex work and migration, also highlighted the way in which engagement with Metzineres had addressed self-stigma:
 <disp-quote>
  <p id="Par36">I don’t feel ashamed anymore, now I have an example of how I want to be treated. I have the right.</p>
