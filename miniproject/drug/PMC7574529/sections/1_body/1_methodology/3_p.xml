Metzineres offers direct, holistic and individualised approaches tailored to particular needs, responding to women’s expectations, concerns, curiosities and interests.

Its interventions are guided by human rights and gender mainstreaming approaches and invest significant efforts to prove that it is reliable, pragmatic and cost-effective.</p>
