<p id="Par90">The criminalisation of women and gender non-conforming people who use drugs drives them away from formal services and towards less safe patterns of use. This is a result of several factors. Firstly, formal barriers prevent certain women from accessing certain services, such as restrictions on services for pregnant or parenting women. Obligatory registration in harm reduction services can also deter women, again particularly those who are pregnant or parenting, from accessing services. Secondly, experiences of arrest, harassment and violence by law enforcement officers are particularly acute for women and gender non-conforming people who use drugs, and can push them into more hidden spaces and away from mainstream harm reduction services. Finally, the inequivalence of harm reduction service access between prisons and the outside community means that the incarceration of women who use drugs places them in an environment with no access to harm reduction services. Where services are available in prisons, willingness to access such services is commonly lower than outside due to controls on access, even greater breaches of confidentiality and stigma.</p>
