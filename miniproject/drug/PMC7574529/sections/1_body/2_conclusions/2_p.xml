<p id="Par88">Stigma, whether experienced or anticipated, reduces women’s willingness to access harm reduction services. While all people who use drugs face stigma based on drug use, cultural norms around womanhood mean that women who use drugs are doubly stigmatised. Generalised stigma in society prevents women from accessing harm reduction services for fear of their drug use becoming publicly known. This can push women into more hidden spaces, making it less likely that they will be approached by outreach workers. Stigma experienced or expected from service staff dissuades women further from accessing services. Self-stigma—a result of gender expectations and experienced stigma—compounds this effect by reducing health-seeking behaviours and therefore access to harm reduction.</p>
