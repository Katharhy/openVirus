<p id="Par91">Few harm reduction services are designed specifically with women and gender non-conforming people in mind. As a result, they commonly are poorly integrated with services to address the needs of these populations, notably sexual and reproductive health services, services for people who have experienced gender-based violence, and childcare. This lack of services reinforces the perception that harm reduction facilities are masculine spaces, thus discouraging access by those who do not identify as male. Furthermore, the relationships between barriers and access, such as gender-based violence, stigma, criminalisation and unspecialised services, are poorly recognised and under-addressed in health and harm reduction responses.</p>
