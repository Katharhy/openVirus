<p id="Par92">Women who use drugs in Barcelona experience all of these barriers. However, their testimonies demonstrate that the existence of Metzineres as a service specific tailored and responsive to their needs goes some way to mitigate these barriers. By creating an environment in which the principles of harm reduction, social inclusion, human rights and gender responsiveness are emphasised, Metzineres challenges the marginalisation faced by many of its participants. The approach enables Metzineres to provide holistic and personalised care for those who access its services. As reported by the participants in this research, the safe space at Metzineres enables women to share experiences and create a sense of solidarity, intensifying the serviceâ€™s ability to combat stigma and self-stigma.</p>
