<p id="Par3">When faced with a pandemic of a novel infectious disease, it’s understandable that we quickly focus on the necessary biomedical tools required to prevent, diagnose, and treat the offending pathogen. Do we have a test that can accurately diagnose infection? How long will it take for scientists to develop an effective vaccine that can prevent disease acquisition? Are any drugs available that can cure or safely treat persons once they’ve become infected? To be sure, each one of these elements—accurate diagnostic test, effective vaccine, successful treatment—is critical but by themselves they do not constitute an adequate pandemic response. Why? Because, simply stated, a pandemic’s impact is not just experienced at the level of the infected individual. By their very nature, pandemics adversely affect large segments of the population, thereby generating negative consequences that spread across social systems and structures. It follows, then, that successful responses to pandemics must include the implementation of societal-level responses and system-wide interventions. To wit, during a pandemic the goal of public health is to protect the health of the entire population, not just to prevent or treat disease among specific individuals.</p>
