<p id="Par8">We readily admit that the epidemiology, transmission dynamics and pathogenesis of these two viruses—HIV and SARS-CoV-2—are vastly different. Nor do we mean to infer that the interventions successful in preventing HIV can be directly applied to COVID-19 disease. But the principles that we’ve learned from decades of grappling with the HIV pandemic—in the U.S. and abroad—
 <italic>are</italic> relevant in regard to developing successful, long-term responses to protect against other infectious disease pandemics. While maintaining an adequate public health infrastructure may “top the list” of necessities when it comes to protecting population health, other fundamental principles, listed below, are equally important.

  <p id="Par9">Sustained investment in public health infrastructure is necessary in order to develop, implement and evaluate effective system-level interventions in response to emerging and ongoing health threats.</p>
  <p id="Par10">Approaches to assuring and preserving health must not be limited to the biomedical sciences; we must also actively address the psychosocial influences that affect well-being.</p>
  <p id="Par11">Affected communities must be actively engaged in identifying and implementing strategies in response to threats to their health and well-being.</p>
  <p id="Par12">Stigma and fear are constant companions of infectious disease pandemics; proactive steps must be taken to minimize their negative consequences.</p>
  <p id="Par13">To reduce health disparities, proactively identify groups and communities at disproportionate risk of developing disease or poor health outcomes and design interventions to reduce these disparities and to promote health equity.</p>
  <p id="Par14">In recognition of the interconnected nature of our world, there must be a global component in our response to infectious disease pandemics and this component must be based on the best available information and science.</p>
