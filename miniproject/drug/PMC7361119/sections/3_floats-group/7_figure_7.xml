  <p>Cumulative number of publications and clinical trials 
   <bold>(a)</bold> over the past decades for HIV compared with the global number of cases/deaths 
   <bold>(b</bold>) as well as the approved drugs developed over this time period 
   <bold>(c)</bold>. The count of clinical trials starts in 1999, whereas other metrics begin in 1993. The dates and numbers of clinical trials were obtained from ClinicalTrials.gov. The dates correspond to the time each trial was deposited to the server and do not reflect the actual study completion date (i.e., some studies might have been conducted before 1999). The numbers of people living with HIV and of deaths were obtained from WHO and UNAIDS annual reports. No reports were available before 1993. WHO and UNAIDS data for 2019 are not yet available. The timeline of appearance of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anti-HIV treatments is highlighted. Abbreviations: COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome; NIH, National Institutes of Health; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome.
