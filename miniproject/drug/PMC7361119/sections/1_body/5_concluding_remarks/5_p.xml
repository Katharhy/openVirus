It is not enough to say that there are more resources available at our disposal now than ever; it is a matter of using these resources effectively. The historical response to HIV sets a precedent for success in the fight against emerging infectious diseases. We shall use this historical precedent and past failings as a guide for the current battle against COVID-19 and all future battles against other, imminent outbreaks.</p>
