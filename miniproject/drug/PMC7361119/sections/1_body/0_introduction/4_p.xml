<p id="par0080">This rapid exchange of information applies to scientific data and publications as well: with increased access to the internet, the response of the scientific community has been enriched. We have observed an increasing number of articles being published for successive outbreaks in both peer-reviewed journals and various 
 <bold>ArXiv</bold> (see 
 <xref rid="glo0005" ref-type="glossary">Glossary</xref>) preprint servers over the past 20 years. Over the past few months, both peer-reviewed journals 
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and ArXiv preprint 
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> servers have been overpopulated with reports on known drugs or clinical candidates with possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity identified by computational approaches. However, despite many experimental and clinical studies, no effective drugs or treatments have emerged to treat the previous six epidemics of bird flu, SARS, swine flu, MERS, Ebola, and Zika as well as, thus far, COVID-19. This observation begs the question of whether the rapidity and bulk of immediate responses to epidemics are sufficient to enable the development of effective treatments.
