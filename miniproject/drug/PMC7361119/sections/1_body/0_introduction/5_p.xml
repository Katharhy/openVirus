<p id="par0085">In this study, we investigated historical data for seven major disease outbreaks of the past two decades: bird flu (H5N1), SARS, swine flu (H1N1), MERS, Ebola fever, Zika fever, and COVID-19. We assessed the response of the scientific community to these outbreaks over time, in addition to how effective that response was in producing vaccines and small-molecule antiviral drugs. To this end, we analyzed the number of publications, clinical trials, funding levels, and Google Trends data from the start of these epidemics until the present day. We observed that there has been little success in combatting outbreaks effectively while they were occurring, let alone after they have passed. By contrast, we also observed that these trends were different for HIV/AIDS, which has received continuous and uninterrupted attention from researchers around the world and for which multiple targeted therapies have indeed emerged. We expect this analysis to provide insights as to how to better mobilize both federal agencies and scientists to find treatments for COVID-19 as well as other future outbreaks.</p>
