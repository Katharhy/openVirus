<p id="par0130">Before the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, previous studies had forecasted the re-emergence of a SARS-like 
 <bold>betacoronavirus</bold>
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The potential for sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or for the emergence of another novel betacoronavirus is alarming but has not been sufficient previously to garner any substantial drug discovery or vaccine efforts. These transmission dynamics and this potential for wide-scale, future pandemics makes COVID-19 distinct from the six previous epidemics examined earlier. Thus, the response to the HIV pandemic, which began in 1981, is also a worthwhile comparison to the current COVID-19 response.
