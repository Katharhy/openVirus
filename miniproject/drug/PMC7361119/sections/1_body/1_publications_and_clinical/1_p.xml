<p id="par0090">We evaluated the number of publications (in both peer-reviewed journals and ArXiv preprint servers) and the number of clinical trials performed over the course of the epidemic to estimate the engagement and success of the scientific community in response to the seven major outbreaks of the past two decades: bird flu, SARS, swine flu, MERS, Ebola, Zika, and COVID-19. These metrics indicate the velocity with which the scientific community mobilizes to seek solutions to remedy an outbreak, as well as how this velocity correlates with other metrics, such as the number of confirmed cases and the number of people who have died from the disease. In addition, we evaluated the number of unique molecules and/or treatments being tested in clinical trials, because many were replicates of each other.</p>
