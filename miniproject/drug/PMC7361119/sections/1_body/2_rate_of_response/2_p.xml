<p id="par0105">In comparison to SARS, COVID-19 does not show clear spikes in the number of publications or clinical trials corresponding to peaks and dips in the number of new cases or deaths (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> ). Instead, the trends in the number of publications and clinical trials appear to follow the trends in the number of cases and/or deaths. Indeed, there is a correlation (R = 0.98) between the rate at which the virus spreads throughout the population and intensity of research on COVID-19, as measured by the number of publications. Although looking for causality in these relationships is non-sensical, the number of new peer-reviewed publications appears to follow roughly the same logarithmic curve as the number of new cases recorded for COVID-19, whereas the rate of new publications in non peer-reviewed arXiv preprints appears to exceed even that of new COVID-19 cases (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The number of COVID-19 preprints in arXiv servers surpassed the number of COVID-19 papers in peer-reviewed journals in early March, highlighting the rise of online journals and preprint servers, as well as reflecting the shrinking period of time between the original observations and respective publications. This is also in direct contrast to SARS: more papers were published at a faster rate during this pandemic than in the SARS epidemic beginning in 2003. For example, eight peer-reviewed papers on COVID-19 had been published by the time there were 555 cases of the disease (January 22, 2020), whereas SARS only had one paper published by the time there were 1804 total cases (April 3, 2003). However, it is necessary to contextualize these observations in terms of the scientific output, not just by the rate of response. In this regard, we observed that the large number of studies conducted on SARS notwithstanding, no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug or vaccine to treat the disease has been developed in the 17-year period since the outbreak began (in 2003).
