<p id="par0100">Equally valuable is to compare the rate of response of the scientific community to the rate of epidemic growth. As a case study, we chose to compare data on SARS to that of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Interestingly, the number of total publications for SARS over time roughly followed the same trend as the number of cases, with an offset by a short time period of less than a month (
