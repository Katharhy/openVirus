<p id="par0115">In addition to quantifying the response of the scientific community to these epidemics, we also collected Google Trends data on the principal search terms representing each of these diseases. Google Trends data do not represent the number of Google searches during a given time period but rather anonymized, aggregated, and normalized information about the relative proportion of searches on Google for a given search term, region, and time period 
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. This normalization protects against places with larger populations being weighted more heavily. A value of 100 corresponds to the maximum search interest in a topic for the given time and location, whereas a value of 50 corresponds to the search term being half as popular as it was at its peak. Google Trends, as a whole, serves as a fairly representative data source for the public perception of different news topics, indicating how interested people appear to be in a given topic over a specific period of time, with rapid peaks in search interest indicating a sudden increase in interest in a topic.
