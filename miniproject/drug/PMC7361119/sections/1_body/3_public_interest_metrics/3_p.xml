<p id="par0125">COVID-19 is interesting in that, although representing a novel virus, the number of relative searches peaked relatively close to those for all the previously studied illnesses (mentioned earlier) and is following an increasing exponential trend (
 <xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is increasing in a nearly exponential fashion, with more people infected worldwide than in any of these previous epidemics besides H1N1 (swine flu). Additionally, for all diseases previously mentioned, their respective search interests peaked during the years when the epidemic was most severe (
 <xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), so we should expect that the search interest for COVID-19 will steadily decrease when the pandemic begins to die down. However, as noted earlier, although we should expect such evolution of the general public interest, research into understanding this disease and developing powerful therapeutics should continue unabated.
