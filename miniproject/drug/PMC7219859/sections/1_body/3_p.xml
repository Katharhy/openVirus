<p>Results from studies that have excluded pregnant women cannot be automatically extrapolated to a pregnant population. This lack of generalizability is due to the physiologic changes in pregnancy, which affect the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs. The lack of data specific to pregnancy will negatively affect the health of pregnant women and their access to interventions in the current and next outbreak, especially with estimates from public health officials that indicate that this outbreak may last for a significant duration of time until an effective vaccine is identified and a massive vaccination campaign is implemented. Although it is not known how quickly a safe and effective vaccine may be readily available and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, experts believe it will take at least 12-18 months.

 </sup> Pregnant women with COVID-19 infection may be harmed, because knowledge gained from ongoing research may not be generalizable to them. This will create a knowledge gap concerning the safety and efficacy of any drugs or interventions that may emerge from current COVID-19 research.

 </sup> Although fetal safety is the most cited reason for the exclusion from research studies of pregnant women and those who could become pregnant, it is unethical to automatically preclude them from carefully designed clinical therapeutic research studies. For example, several trials are investigating the benefit of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin in patients with COVID-19 infection. However, pregnant women are excluded despite the fact that these two medications have been used for decades in pregnancy for women with systemic lupus erythematosus or as malaria treatment and prophylaxis (hydroxychloroquine), and in women with community-acquired pneumonia and those with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (azithromycin). Moreover, the drugs' safety profiles are well established in pregnancy.
