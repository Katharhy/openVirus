<p>This pattern of “protection by exclusion” of pregnant women from research, even during pandemics and epidemics, is not new or limited to emerging infections.

 </sup> Even during the Ebola virus epidemic, pregnant women were excluded from all therapeutic and vaccine-development trials. This occurred even with Ebola being a highly lethal virus—the vast majority of cases of Ebola virus infection in pregnancy resulted in the death of the mother and child.

 </sup> This automatic disqualification denies pregnant women the potential for benefit given to other patients. Since the 1950s, and after the discovery of the association between exposure to certain drugs during gestation and birth defects, pregnant and breastfeeding women have been systematically excluded from drug-development and clinical trials. Despite several policy and legislative changes, including the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's guidelines for the Study and Evaluation of Gender Differences in the Clinical Evaluation of Drugs, the National Institutes of Health's guidance for the inclusion of women in clinical trials, the establishment of the Office on Women's Health, and the establishment of the Task Force for Research Specific to Pregnant and Lactating Women, pregnant women remain therapeutic orphans, with the vast majority of current accepted therapies for medical conditions never having been studied in pregnancy.
