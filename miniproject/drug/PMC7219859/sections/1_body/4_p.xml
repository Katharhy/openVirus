<p>Pregnancy recently was removed as a classification for vulnerable population in the common rule, but the research community has yet to catch up.

 </sup> The perception that pregnant or breastfeeding women are a “vulnerable population” needing protection from exploitation research studies has hindered progression of care. We need to advocate for a cultural shift within the research community to view this population as in need of more evidence, particularly in pharmaceutical research.

 </sup> Pregnant women should be permitted to determine their eligibility and entry into a research study based on the principle of informed consent. Excluding pregnant women from research under the guise of the “vulnerable populations” perception places a restraint on their right to autonomy.

 </sup> Although one must consider the safety of a drug in pregnancy, it is equally important to consider the risks of not treating or inadequately treating pregnant women. Similarly, the risk to the fetus of treatment needs to be weighed against the risk of inadequate treatment, given that many of the conditions that affect the mother will ultimately adversely affect the fetus if not treated. It is crucial that the sequelae of lack of treatment be weighed against the risks of treatment or, at a minimum, inclusion in clinical trials.
