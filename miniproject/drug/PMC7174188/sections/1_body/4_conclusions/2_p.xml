<p id="para0009">Central to the SARS-CoV-2 response must be a focus on forgotten populations. Planning should incorporate dedicated efforts, funding, and policies/guidelines specific to individuals who experience homelessness, are incarcerated, or are coping with substance use disorders both because these populations deserve care and services and because not doing so poses a great risk to the broader community. Although decades of inattention and underfunding for these systems will not be remedied during a national emergency, the responsibility to support these populations is now more critical than ever. Careful consideration of and assistance for these vulnerable communities will be required to achieve a comprehensive and effective public health response.</p>
