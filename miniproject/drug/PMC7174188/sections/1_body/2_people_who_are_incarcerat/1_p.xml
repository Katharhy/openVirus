<p id="para0005">Correctional facilities are densely populated, closed spaces with a constant flow of human activity. During the H1N1 pandemic of 2009â€“2010, an Australian correctional facility reported effective containment of the virus through limiting visitors to the facility and implementing symptom screenings, isolating cases, and quarantining contacts.

This will lead to added strain on local healthcare facilities when they have limited capacity to handle additional patients.
