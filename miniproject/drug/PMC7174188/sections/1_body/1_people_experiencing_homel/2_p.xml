<p id="para0004">Many individuals experiencing homelessness with SARS-CoV-2 will not meet hospitalization criteria and will be discharged into the general population. Inadequate social services will result in infected people spending more time in public places, thereby contributing to the spread of the virus. The SARS-CoV-2 response must prioritize access to testing in congregate settings and ensure access to shelters that can follow isolation and quarantine recommendations. Local coordination of shelter services will be required to ensure that both asymptomatic individuals without COVID-19 and those who are exposed or diagnosed with the disease have safe places to quarantine and isolate. In most localities, this will require identification of new facilities such as hotels, dormitories, and closed public buildings.</p>
