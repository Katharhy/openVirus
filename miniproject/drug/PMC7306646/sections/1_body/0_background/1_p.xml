<p id="Par47">From December 2019 to March 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been considered an epidemic in China, specifically in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, where this disease initially emerged [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. According to data, this disease has already been considered a global epidemic because more than 200 countries have been affected, with more than 970,000 patients infected and 50,000+ deaths [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Hence, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) which caused COVID-19, shows stronger infectivity than SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, although, the mortality rate of COVID-19 is lower than SARS and MERS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Nevertheless, COVID-19 should be given careful attention considering that its mortality rate is increasing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The previous study has reported that elderly men, specifically those with chronic comorbidities, tend to develop a more severe COVID-19 which may be fatal compared with young men [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], considering that these elderly men have impaired immune response and incomplete functional organs. However, several previously healthy young adults who developed severe COVID-19, required superior oxygen therapy, including high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV), invasive positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV), and even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The reason this happened remains unclear. Thus, we used our hospital’s data to determine the factors affecting patients’ clinical outcomes using an appropriate statistical model.
