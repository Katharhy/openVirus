<p id="Par63">In summary, this is the first study to systematically describe the clinical symptoms and laboratory biomarkers of COVID-19 in mild and severe groups of previously healthy young adults. If the patients who were admitted to the hospital had higher fever and symptoms of anorexia, biochemical examination showed higher CRP and lymphopenia; the patients is then more likely to progress to severe COVID-19. Furthermore, lymphopenia was considered as the strongest predictor of severe prognosis. Our study findings are possibly beneficial for physicians to comprehensively understand the predictive factors associated with disease severity for COVID-19, allowing them to immediately and accurately provide supportive treatment, preventing the rapid development of the disease and decreasing the mortality rate. However, additional multicenter, prospective studies are required to further assess the clinical outcomes of severe COVID-19.</p>
