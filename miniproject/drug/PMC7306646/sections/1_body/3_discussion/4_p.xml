<p id="Par60">Elevated D-dimer levels in COVID-19 patients, associated with poor clinical outcomes has been proven [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Tiny thromboses are produced by inflammatory cascade, blocking the pulmonary vessel, which might result in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) without stopping inflammation. In fact, in clinical practice, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is administered to prevent thrombosis if the D-dimer levels at &gt; 4 μg/ml. The inflammatory reaction includes a cytokine storm, resulting in internal environmental disruption and inducing coagulation maladjustment. Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) or those who died may present a final phase of body decompensation, with elevated D-dimer. The study we conducted could be an early phase before coagulation decompensation. The increase in Fib levels and decrease in PLT counts could be a coagulation compensation before D-dimer elevating.
