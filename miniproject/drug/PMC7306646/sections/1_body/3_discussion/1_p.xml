<p id="Par57">Coronaviruses are known because of the previously encountered SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, and both are zoonotic viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Similar to the previous two coronavirus outbreaks, fever and cough were the most common symptoms with viral pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Our study showed that patients with severe COVID-19 had higher febrile temperatures with a large number of them in the overall population. For those previously healthy young adults with sound immunity, the occurrence of high fever after viral infection indicates the body’s rapid response against the invaded pathogen. It revealed that a fierce inflammatory reaction in patients was one of the factors leading to the “severe” status. Anorexia also showed significance in our study; we presumed that it co-occurred as a symptom with fever. Patients with high fever accompanied by anorexia could be discriminated more strongly from those with ordinary fever (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Inversely, we found that both symptoms were insignificant to distinguish severe COVID-19 in previously healthy young adults. In fact, only seven patients (two in the severe group and five in the mild group) had dyspnea and 39 patients had chest tightness (11 in the severe group and 28 in the mild group) on admission. Owing to the relatively good state of the lungs, we inferred that there was less probability of respiratory decompensation on admission. Besides, a great sample size was needed for a more powerful prove. Furthermore, a larger cohort would be required to validate these associations. Additionally, we found that older patients would need to beware of aggravation of the disease because an older age indicates the decline in organ function as well as ability of the body to self-regulate.
