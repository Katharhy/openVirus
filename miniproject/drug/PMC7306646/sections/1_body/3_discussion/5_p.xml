<p id="Par61">Lymphopenia is commonly assessed in most viral infections, specifically, type A and B influenza [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. According to a previous study, lymphopenia was also observed in SARS and MERS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Coronavirus infection usually induces an immune response, resulting in decreased CD4 count and immunosuppression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Simultaneously, the virus also damages the epithelial walls, and disrupts surfactant in the airways, providing access to rapid bacterial growth and resulting in a secondary bacterial infection, adversely affecting immunosuppressed patients.
