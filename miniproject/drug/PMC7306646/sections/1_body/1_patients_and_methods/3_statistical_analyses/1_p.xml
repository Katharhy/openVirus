<p id="Par52">All analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Statistic (SPSS) version 24.0 (Chicago, IL). Continuous data were illustrated as means and standard deviations (mean, standard deviation [SD]). Categorical data were illustrated as counts and percentages. Descriptive statistics were illustrated as mean (standard deviation, SD) or median (interquartile range) according to data distribution. Hypothesis testing for patient-level data was performed using the chi-squared test for categorical variables, Studentâ€™s t-test for normally distributed data, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for non-normally distributed data. Characteristics of mild and severe COVID-19 patients were compared, and we used a logistic regression model to determine the strongest predictive factors of the severity of the disease. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to validate the predictive value of predictors. All reported
