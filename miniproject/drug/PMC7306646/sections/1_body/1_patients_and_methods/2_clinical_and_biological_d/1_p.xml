<p id="Par49">Patients’ medical history was retrospectively reviewed (mainly by ZCZ and HZ), and their demographic information was collected. Symptoms such as fever (the highest temperature recorded), cough, expectoration, headache, wheezing, weakness, muscle ache, pharyngalgia, runny nose, anorexia, stethalgia, chest tightness, dyspnea, and diarrhea were assessed. Time from illness onset to hospital admission (days), computed tomography (CT) scan revealing bilateral lesion or unilateral lesion, and preadmission drugs used were also evaluated. While receiving treatment, all patients underwent laboratory testing on admission day or the next morning. Throat swab specimens were routinely collected, tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection within 12 h on admission, and other examination data were assessed in 24 h on admission. Moreover, serum biochemistry analysis was performed. WBC count, N%, and N, lymphocyte, and PLT were assessed on formal full blood examination. Levels of creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), indirect bilirubin (IBIL), albumin (ALB), aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), D-dimer, and fibrinogen (Fib), prothrombin time (PT), and international normalized ratio (INR) on admission were also recorded. All the data were checked by another researcher to ascertain their accuracy.</p>
