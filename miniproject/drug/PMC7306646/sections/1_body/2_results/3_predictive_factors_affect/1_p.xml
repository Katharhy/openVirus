 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) The ROC curve was used to analyze the predictive value of lymphocyte count for determining severe COVID-19. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was estimated, the result showed that the AUC was 0.791 (95% CI: 0.704–0.877), with a specificity of 64.3% and a sensitivity of 84.2%(
