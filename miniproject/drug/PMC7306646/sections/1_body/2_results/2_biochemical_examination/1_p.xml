 <italic>P</italic> = 0.016) (Normal range 40–75%), lymphocyte count (1.30[0.56] vs. 0.80[0.36],

 <sup>9</sup>/L), and levels of PLT count (184[42] vs. 157.50[23], 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.016) (Normal range 125–350*10
 <sup>9</sup>/L), C-reactive protein (CRP) (0.46[0.093] vs. 1.46[2.58], 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (Normal range 0–0.6 mg/dL), AST (19[6.3] vs. 22.45[11.83], 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.037) (Normal range 9–50 U/L), ALB (42.42[4.48] vs. 40.40[4.82], 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.042) (Normal range 40–55 g/L), CK (64.50[45.75] vs. 92[106], 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.011) (Normal range 38–174 U/L), and Fib (2.50[0.3] vs. 2.75[0.76], 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) (Normal range 2–4 g/L) were different between mild and severe groups, respectively. All compared variables except lymphocyte count and CRP were within the normal range, therefor we considered CRP and lymphocyte count more meaningful. Among all variables, only the N% and ALB levels were normally distributed. (Table
