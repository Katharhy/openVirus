<p id="Par53">Based on the data we collected, a total of 28 out of the 123 (22.76%) previously healthy young patients developed severe COVID-19. Of those 28, 20 patients of severe disease were diagnosed with the PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300 mmHg, four patients were classified with rapid breath rate ≥ 30 breaths/min, and four with SpO2 ≤ 93% in resting time. All patients received appropriate treatment, and severe disease patients received oxygen therapy. Sixteen patients received routine nasal oxygen, and eight patients needed high-flow oxygen therapy to alleviate their symptoms or hypoxia. However, the other four patients needed NPPV or superior oxygen therapy. (Fig.

All patients were residents of Wuhan City. Fever was the most common symptom (79.7%), followed by cough (60.9%), anorexia (48%), and weakness (40.7%). Pharyngalgia (9.8%), stethalgia (8.1%), dyspnea (5.7%), and runny nose (1.6%) were rarely observed in previously healthy young patients during hospital admission.
