<p>We performed a prospective observational study based on data from patient medical records. Patients were included into the study based on two criteria. First, patients were required to have a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection based on nasopharyngeal swab specimens, using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In case of suspected COVID-19, PCR testing was repeated. Second, all the patients studied had been admitted to the PICU. The study was carried out from March 1, 2020, to April 15, 2020.</p>
