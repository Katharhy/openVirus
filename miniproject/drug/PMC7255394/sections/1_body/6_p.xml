<p>This report describes a large single-center series studies of children critically ill due to COVID-19. Nearly all the children admitted to our PICU were previously healthy. Only two of our admitted cases were children less than 1 year old. Respiratory symptoms were prevalent, and many presented with fever. Regarding complementary tests, chest radiograph imaging was of assistance in diagnosing pneumonia. The blood tests performed on these patients showed that lymphopenia was not always present on admission, but rather developed later. Also, 
 <sc>d</sc>-dimer and ferritin were usually elevated. As for therapy, respiratory support was necessary in almost all cases. The children included did not complain of dyspnea, but all presented with increased respiratory work of some degree. We started HFNC therapy in five children, and for almost all of them, it was necessary to substitute this therapy with NIV. The two patients receiving MV experienced deterioration on the first day of admission despite close monitoring and rapid change to noninvasive oxygen support. All cases (except case 1) received the drugs empirically recommended for COVID-19; we used tocilizumab only in intubated children. Finally, heparin was administered to four children; this indication was based on the presence of thrombosis (therapeutic) or 
 <sc>d</sc>-dimer levels (prophylactic).
