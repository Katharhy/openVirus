<p>During the study period, 512 patients were admitted to our hospital as inpatients. Twenty-four children with COVID-19 were hospitalized in the pediatric ward; of these, two children were transferred to the PICU. Eleven children were admitted to the PICU with suspected COVID-19; seven had positive PCR test results (1.4% of total admissions and 5% of children admitted to the ward with COVID-19). We included seven children; three patients with a clinical presentation compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection were excluded due to two negative PCR test results. Four of the seven patients were male. The median age was 100.7 months (range, 0.5–16). Five children were admitted from the emergency department and two from the ward. The only patient with a relevant history was a boy who had received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. One patient was admitted to the PICU because of ketoacidosis; he underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing due to the risk of community transmission and the need to remain isolated in the event of a positive result. Almost all cases presented with respiratory symptoms and fever on PICU admission (

 </bold>). The Pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 3 (range, 0–9), and the Pediatric Risk of Mortality II score was 4 (range, 0–16). All patients developed lymphopenia, with two during the first 24 hours of admission. Regarding classical biomarkers, 
 <italic>C</italic>-reactive protein was 19.7 mg/dL (range, 40.1–0.11) and procalcitonin was 5.3 ng/mL (range, 37.7–0.07). Imaging tests evidenced bilateral pneumonia or infiltrates in three of eight cases in the first 24 hours of admission (

 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, case 2). All patients needed oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula. Five received oxygen through a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC); this therapy was later changed to noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in four patients. Two patients also required mechanical ventilation (MV) on the first day of PICU admission. The two children with MV needed additional vasoactive support. None of the children required renal replacement therapy. Only the patient admitted with symptoms not compatible with COVID-19 did not receive empirical pharmacologic treatment. The drugs administered were azithromycin (6/7), lopinavir/ritonavir (6/7), corticosteroids (5/7), and hydroxychloroquine (6/7). Remdesivir, immunoglobulins, and tocilizumab were given to the patient with previous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, Also, prophylactic low-weight heparin was administered in two of the seven patients. The girl with cranial thrombosis also received continuous unfractionated heparin, which was later substituted with therapeutic low-weight heparin. At the end of this preliminary study, five of seven had been discharged from our PICU (Table
