<p>The Madrid regional health authority decided to centralize pediatric care to optimize care for adults with COVID-19. Under this measure, the pediatric emergency departments of all hospitals remained in operation, although all children requiring admission were transferred to one of the two tertiary hospitals. In this brief report, we describe the epidemiologic and clinical features of children admitted to one such PICU during the first month and a half of this situation. The reportâ€™s main objective is to describe the characteristics of these patients so as to increase the knowledge of children critically ill with COVID-19.</p>
