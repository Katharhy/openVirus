<p>As for pharmacologic therapy, Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows that almost all cases were treated empirically with the drugs proposed to treat COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Antimicrobial treatment was added based on clinical suspicion. Case 2 received antimicrobial treatment due to previous odynophagia. Case 3 underwent antibiotic therapy for a urinary tract infection. All other cases received broad-spectrum antibiotics. Inotropic support was applied only in children with MV. We used corticosteroids in five cases. We chose to start them, given the presence of findings consistent with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or immune dysregulation (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Despite the presence of an active viral infection, we chose to administer methylprednisolone, which was subsequently withdrawn over 3 or 5 days based on clinical progression (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In one case, methylprednisolone was used despite no suspicion of MAS. In that patient, because of the presence of massive thrombosis (brain, lungs, and lower extremities), we empirically started methylprednisolone to treat the suspected inflammation related to SARS-CoV-2 binding to endothelial receptors. Tocilizumab was administered to both children who later received MV. This monoclonal antibody was administered as a second-level therapy in our treatment protocol, which was given in the absence of a favorable response to supportive therapies and methylprednisolone. We cannot draw any conclusions on the effects of drug therapy due to the lack of a control group and because one of our main objectives was to avoid any adverse effects produced by these measures.
