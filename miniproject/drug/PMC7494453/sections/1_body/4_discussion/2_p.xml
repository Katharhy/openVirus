<p id="p0210">From this review of HCWs, fear of uncertainty or becoming infected were at the forefront of the psychological challenges faced. Providing medical care during a global epidemic generates fear and heightens stress levels, with one large-scale study (
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Tam et al., 2004</xref>) reporting over 70% identified that becoming infected was most distressing. During the COVID-19 pandemic, HCWs have been exposed to high infection risks, death and dying, moral dilemmas in deciding who qualifies for intensive care, and excessive workloads. The entire experience can be traumatising and heighten the risk of mental health conditions in a group that are already at increased risk, for instance HCWs are at higher risk of suicide than the general population (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dutheil et al., 2019</xref>). It is likely that the psychological effects of epidemics on HCWs are variable across different contexts with several studies demonstrating an increased risk of acquiring a trauma or stress-related disorder. The risk to the mental well-being of HCWs are likely to be multi-faceted and more research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms that can potentially be mitigated with appropriate measures. Collection of high quality data is urgently needed, especially for vulnerable groups exposed to a pandemic (
