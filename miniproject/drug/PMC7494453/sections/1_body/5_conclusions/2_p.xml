<p id="p0230">Managing the emerging mental health issues amongst HCWs during an epidemic is imperative particularly in the current COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The potential psychological consequences faced by this highly vulnerable group can have profound and long-term implications. While some elements of tackling an epidemic are difficult to modify, many preventable aspects can be considered. Fear can be minimised through the correct dissemination of information and the provision of adequate training and resources. Education to HCWs, their families and the wider public can help lessen stigma and discrimination. Hospital and health policy-makers must also consider the importance of a preventative approach to mitigate the development of psychological manifestations. Psychosocial support and effective measures need to be readily available in multiple modalities and levels, and designed to suit the specific characteristics of HCWs to empower them in the critical role they play against epidemics. Further high-quality and longitudinal research is needed especially on measures to reduce their mental health burden should be a priority.</p>
