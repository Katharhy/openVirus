<p id="p0065">In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this timely review is both relevant and urgent. It is imperative that those working at the frontline with infected patients or in afflicted regions have the necessary strategies and resources to endure various challenges. There is a lack of systematic reviews published specifically on the mental health implications experienced by frontline HCWs during an epidemic. Of the literature, there is also a paucity of information around how to best prevent psychological distress, and what steps are needed to mitigate harm to HCWsâ€™ wellbeing. The purpose of this review is to explore the main findings from the literature examining the psychological impact on HCWs in times of severe epidemics, and to identify strategies to address this.</p>
