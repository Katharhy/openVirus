<p id="p0200">The high number of studies during the COVID-19 pandemic within a short period is impressive given the understandable difficulties in conducting research in HCWs under often stressful circumstances. Most studies used validated tools for identifying psychological stressors, although some used novel questionnaires. The implications of this review highlight a range of psychological impacts and multiple factors contributing at different levels affecting HCWs when responding to epidemics. There was a high degree of consistency in findings making it generalisable to a variety of health-related disasters. This can inform research priorities and development of measures against the deleterious mental health outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
