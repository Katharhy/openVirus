<p id="p0205">The majority of studies used online survey methodology and self-report measures which have inherent limitations. There was a lack of longitudinal studies and therefore little evidence on the long-term psychological sequelae and treatment needs. There is a lack of in-depth research considering the pre- and post-outbreak psychological risk factors, the effects of stigma and discrimination or impact on families.. Of note, it was difficult to compare studies due to heterogeneity of design and outcome measures. Geographic factors may have influenced results due to unique social and cultural contexts amongst the study locations where research was conducted.</p>
