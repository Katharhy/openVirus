 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chan and Huak, 2004</xref>). Correspondingly, the lack of social support during the SARS outbreak brought out discrimination from the community as well as distancing behavior from HCWs’ own families (

 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Maunder et al., 2004</xref>) of 1,557 nurses identified three attitudinal factors (health fear, social isolation and job stress) mediated the association between contact with SARS patients and psychological stress. The levels of anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy exhibited amongst Chinese HCWs in Wuhan during the COVID-19 pandemic appeared dependent on their degree of social support and quality of sleep (
