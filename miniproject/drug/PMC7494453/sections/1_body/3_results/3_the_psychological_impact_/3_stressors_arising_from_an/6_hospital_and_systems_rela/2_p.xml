<p id="p0160">HCWs often found themselves working under high levels of physical and psychological stress (

 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020a</xref>). The heavy protective gear was found to add to the physical difficulties of carrying out procedures (

Contrastingly, findings from 10,511 HCWs during the SARS outbreak demonstrated that 96% reported that the personal protective measures implemented were effective, 93% felt that institutional policies and protocols were clear and 90% felt they were timely (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Koh et al., 2005</xref>). Similar findings were depicted by HCWs who generally declared confidence in infection-control measures (
