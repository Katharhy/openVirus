<p id="p0105">A study (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Lee etÂ al., 2018</xref>) of 1,800 HCWs assessed the psychological impact in the initial stages of the MERS outbreak and one month later. Those who performed MERS-related tasks reported greater distress and more intrusive phenomena. They also had the greatest risk for PTSD symptoms one-month later, and interestingly, this risk was increased even after home quarantine. Home quarantined HCWs had poorer sleep and a heightened degree of numbness than those who were not quarantined.
