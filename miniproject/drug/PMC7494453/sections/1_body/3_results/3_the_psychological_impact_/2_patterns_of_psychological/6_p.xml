<p id="p0110">In terms of impact on different health professionals, a recent study (
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020b</xref>) comparing medical HCWs (927) to non-medical HCWs (1,255) demonstrated significantly higher levels of insomnia, anxiety, depression, somatization, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in medical HCWs. A Spanish study (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">García-Fernández et al., 2020</xref>) also found that HCWs (613) had higher symptoms of acute stress than compared with non-HCWs (164). Similarly, anxiety and insomnia were significantly higher in frontline HCWs compared to non-frontline HCWs (

 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2020b</xref>). Eight studies compared doctors and nurses (
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Tam et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Maunder et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Lung et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2020b</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Korkmaz et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2005</xref>). Four of these studies focused on SARS and found that nurses experienced greater levels of stress. Of these, one study (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Maunder et al., 2004</xref>) reported higher distress for nurses and those with direct contact with infected patients. In two studies (
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Tam et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2005</xref>) from Hong Kong, the overall distress level for nurses was significantly higher than for other HCWs with the exception of doctors, and nurses also experienced higher levels of stress and psychological morbidity compared with other professionals. Interestingly, one study (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2005</xref>) of 1,470 nurses, showed that nurses in moderate-risk areas appeared to have more stress symptoms than those working in high-risk areas, but the reasons for this remain unclear. Alternate findings were depicted in two studies (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chan and Huak, 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2020b</xref>) where doctors and single nurses were found to be at higher risk compared to nurses and those who were married, and doctors had more stress and anxiety compared to nurses. Further, 27% of participants (177 of 660) had psychiatric symptoms, with the doctors being 1.6 times more likely to experience psychiatric symptoms than nurses, and 20% (127 of 651) had PTSD. In contrast, a study (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Lung et al., 2009</xref>) comparing 127 HCWs impacted by SARS, found no significant difference in feelings of stress between the physicians, nurses and other HCWs. An Italian study (
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Rossi et al., 2020</xref>) of 1,379 HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic, showed that general practitioners were more likely to have PTSS than other HCWs, while nurses and health care assistants were more likely to exhibit severe insomnia. Similarly, another Chinese study (
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020c</xref>) found that nurses (234) working in the frontline against COVID-19 experienced significantly greater levels of vicarious traumatisation when compared to non-frontline nurses (292). This theme was replicated with findings to suggest that frontline HCWs in close contact with infected patients were 1.4 times more likely to feel fear and twice more likely to suffer anxiety and depression when compared to non-clinical staff (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2020</xref>).
