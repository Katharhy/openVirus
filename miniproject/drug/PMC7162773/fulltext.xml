This paper provides a critical review of the available evidence regarding the lessons learned from the Chinese experience with COVID-19 prevention and management. The steps that have led to a near disappearance of new cases in China included rapid sequencing of the virus to establish testing kits, which allowed tracking of infected persons in and out of Wuhan. In addition, aggressive quarantine measures included the complete isolation of Wuhan and then later Hubei Province and the rest of the country, as well as closure of all schools and nonessential businesses. Other measures included the rapid construction of two new hospitals and the establishment of &#x0201c;Fangcang&#x0201d; shelter hospitals. In the absence of a vaccine, the management of COVID-19 included antivirals, high-flow oxygen, mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, interferons, intravenous immunoglobulin, and convalescent plasma infusions. These measures appeared to provide only moderate success. Although some measures have been supported by weak descriptive data, their effectiveness is still unclear pending well controlled clinical trials. In the end, it was the enforcement of drastic quarantine measures that stopped SARS-CoV-2 from spreading. The earlier the implementation, the less likely resources will be depleted. The most critical factors in stopping a pandemic are early recognition of infected individuals, carriers, and contacts and early implementation of quarantine measures with an organised, proactive, and unified strategy at a national level. Delays result in significantly higher death tolls.</p></abstract><trans-abstract xml:lang="fr"><title>R&#x000e9;sum&#x000e9;</title><p>Avec plus de 1 800 000 cas et 110 000 d&#x000e9;c&#x000e8;s dans le monde, la COVID-19 est l'une des pires &#x000e9;closions de maladies infectieuses de l'histoire.

Data for China were obtained from the National Health Commission of China, which excluded Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Regions and Taiwan. Data for the remaining countries were obtained from the World Health Organisation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr3_lrg"/></fig></p><p id="p0325">The lessons learned in China and South Korea are that in these times of crises, the earlier the intervention from a societal perspective the better. China had implemented an electronic monitoring system for infectious disease outbreaks after SARS in 2003. The question is how early one can reasonably expect to determine that something is out of the ordinary. People die of respiratory failure due to many causes, including influenza, every day. When should there be suspicion that something like a new virus is involved? The lesson here is that one should always have a high index of suspicion, but this must be balanced against causing mass hysteria and panic.</p><p id="p0330">Once it is recognized that there is a new, potentially lethal, virus, the virus needs to be isolated, the genome sequenced, and testing kits validated and released for rapid distribution. Infected individuals and their contacts need to be tracked and isolated. The earlier this is done, the less impact there will be on the personal and professional lives of people and the economy, and the fewer resources will be needed. When more people are infected, the drastic measures including shutting down cities and restricting travel will need to be more widespread, health care resources will be exhausted, and the economy will take a bigger hit.</p><p id="p0335">It is perhaps significant to evaluate the number and distribution of cases in China as a basis for aggressive testing, tracking, and quarantining. In the early days of the epidemic, the genomic sequence of the virus was determined and tests kits that would deliver results within hours were developed. It should be emphasized that the lockdown in Wuhan was a complete lockdown, other than bringing in necessary medical personnel, ventilators, and PPE, as well as everyday goods and supplies. The difference between this type of lockdown and the shelter in place recommendations that have been put forward in many Western countries is that the lockdown in Wuhan was strictly enforced. Laws in Wuhan limited grocery shopping to 1 person per household once every 2 days, with identity checks when leaving and returning. This type of enforced lockdown was later extended to the rest of the country, so that even in cities of more than 7 million and only 200 cases, the population experienced the same restrictions (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;4</xref>). The entire country stayed on lockdown for more than 2 months. When lockdown measures were eased over the past few weeks, temperature checks were still being performed and one had to show electronic medical data on one&#x02019;s electronic device. The lesson here is that if effective quarantine is what needs to occur, these measures must be supported by personnel to enforce them, and they cannot be voluntary or simply recommended.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Downgrading After the Epidemic or Pandemic Has Been Brought Under Control</title><p id="p0340">According to relevant laws and regulations in China, when the number of confirmed cases has a steady decline and the risk of the spread of the epidemic is effectively controlled, each province should reduce the emergency response levels accordingly. In fact, local governments adjust emergency response levels according to the local epidemic situation. Provincial governments use counties as a unit to divide different regions into high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk areas and implement different prevention and control measures in the different risk areas.<xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr"><sup>87</sup></xref>
</p><p id="p0345">Low-risk districts have no confirmed cases or no new confirmed cases for 14 consecutive days. Medium-risk districts have new confirmed cases within the previous 14 days but the cumulative number does not exceed 50 confirmed cases, or there are cumulatively more than 50 confirmed cases but no clustered epidemics within the previous 14 days. High-risk districts have a cumulative number of more than 50 confirmed cases, with clustered epidemics within the previous 14 days.<xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr"><sup>88</sup></xref> Even so, there is always a risk of a second wave if restrictions are relaxed too soon and too drastically.</p><p id="p0350">Different prevention and control measures were implemented in different risk areas. In low-risk areas the main focus was to prevent import of outside cases with the economy restored back to normal. In medium-risk areas, both preventing internal and external spread was implemented, and screening of body temperature and disinfection of public facilities was continued. The entertainment industry remained closed, but other business activities resumed. In high-risk areas, strict quarantine and control measures were continued, with continued closure of nonessential businesses.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0355">The experience in China is unique in that it was the first country to implement drastic measures to combat COVID-19. The strategy in China was early testing, diligent tracking, and strict isolation of patients and contacts, first in Wuhan and then nationwide. Even with this, there were more than 80,000 cases in China and more than 3000 deaths. All countries, even China, can learn from this. Although the drastic measures that China implemented appear for now to have stopped the viral spread, earlier implementation could have reduced the number of cases and deaths even more.</p><p id="p0360">Viral epidemics need to be countered with a unified national strategy that can be implemented quickly on a very large scale. The ability to mobilize and to stay nimble in adapting to these challenges is paramount. Public buy-in is crucial for all citizens to abide by the rules and recommendations. Rules must be mandatory and cannot be simply recommended and voluntary. Designated officers must be deployed to enforce these rules. The negative short-term public and economic consequences that may result from shutting down services, restricting travel, and aggressive quarantining must be accepted or the virus will keep spreading. Collaboration and sharing among countries are imperative to establish more effective policies to control the spread of future epidemics and minimize mortality and morbidity.</p></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>Funding Sources</title><p id="p0365">This study was supported in part by the <funding-source id="gs1"><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100005089</institution-id><institution>Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source> General Program, China (7192197), CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences, China (2016-I2M-1-003), the <funding-source id="gs2"><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source> (31671371 and 81700490), the Central Public-Interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund, China (2016ZX310195, 2017PT31026, and 2018PT31016), and the Epidemic Research Project of Guangzhou Regenerative Medicine and Health Guangdong Laboratory, China (2020GZR110406001).</p></sec><sec id="sec9"><title>Disclosures</title><p id="p0370">The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Guan</surname><given-names>W.-J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ni</surname><given-names>Z.-Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><volume>382</volume><year>2020</year><fpage>1708</fpage><lpage>1720</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">32109013</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other" id="sref2">Sun P, Qie S, Liu Z, Ren J, Li K, Xi J.
