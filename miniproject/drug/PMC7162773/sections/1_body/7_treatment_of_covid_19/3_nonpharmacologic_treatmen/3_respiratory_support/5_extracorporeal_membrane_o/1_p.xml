<p id="p0210">ECMO is a form of extracorporeal life support for very ill patients that circulates blood flow through an artificial lung for gas exchange and then back into the bloodstream. It provides a period of pulmonary rest, artificially supports critical ill patents while their heart or lungs recover, and plays a role in the care of heart or lung transplant patients. ECMO has rarely been used in China owing to limited resources.
