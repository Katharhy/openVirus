 </xref> A Chinese expert consensus released in 2019 recommends that physicians can consider providing HFNC to mild or moderately ill patients (arterial oxygen partial pressure [PaO
 <sub>2</sub>]/fractional inspired oxygen [FiO
 <sub>2</sub>] 100-300 mm Hg). The clinical application of NIPPV on hypoxemic respiratory failure caused by severe pneumonia has long been controversial.
