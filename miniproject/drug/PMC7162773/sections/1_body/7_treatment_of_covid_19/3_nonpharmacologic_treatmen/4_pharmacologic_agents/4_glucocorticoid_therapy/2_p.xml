<p id="p0255">A retrospective study found that low- to moderate-dose glucocorticoid therapy had no effect on the time to viral clearance in patients with COVID-19. Glucocorticoids are not recommended in mild cases, because there was no improvement in the rate of radiographic recovery.

 </xref> Another study analyzed 15 critical cases and suggested that a low dose and short duration of corticosteroids (methylprednisolone &lt; 1 mg/kg, &lt; 7 days) may be beneficial for critically ill patients with COVID-19.

 </xref> Zhou etÂ al. analyzed 10 patients with COVID-19 who received corticosteroids and found that short-term moderate-dose corticosteroids (160 mg/d) plus immunoglobulin (20 g/d) were effective for reversing the continued deterioration of COVID-19 patients who failed to respond to the low-dose therapy (40-80 mg/d corticosteroids and 10 g/d immunoglobulin).
