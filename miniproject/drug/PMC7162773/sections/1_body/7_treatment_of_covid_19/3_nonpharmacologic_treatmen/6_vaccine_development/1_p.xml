<p id="p0290">The development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 has been accelerated as a priority project. On January 23, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced a $12.5 million grant to fund vaccine development by Queensland University in Australia, the National Institutes of Health in the United States, and the pharmaceutical companies Inovio and Moderna. On January 24, a virus strain of SARS-CoV-2 was successfully isolated from patientsâ€™ samples in China to provide the basis for vaccine development.

 </xref> On February 3, CEPI and GlaxoSmithKline announced collaboration to strengthen the global effort to develop a vaccine. Vaccine safety is a priority. Currently, strategies for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development include recombinant proteins, DNA vaccines, mRNA vaccines, traditional live vaccines, and recombinant adenovirus vaccines. These are in various phases of development, ranging from nonhuman animal studies to clinical trials.
