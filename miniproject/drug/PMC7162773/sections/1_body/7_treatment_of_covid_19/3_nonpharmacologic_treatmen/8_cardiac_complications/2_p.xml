 </xref> The use of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) may not be of any benefit, because they does not bind to the ACE2 receptor. This also means that discontinuing ACEIs in patients with COVID-19 is not necessary. Regarding angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), there is evidence that ARBs could lead to increased expression of ACE2, thus worsening disease, but this remains controversial. There is no current recommendation to discontinue ARBs during treatment of COVID-19 in China. Monteil etÂ al. found that SARS-CoV-2 infection in engineered human blood vessel organoids and human kidney organoids could be inhibited by human recombinant soluble ACE2.
