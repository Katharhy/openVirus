<p id="p0300">Cardiac abnormalities were found to be present in a high proportion of patients who died of COVID-19 and may be more associated with severe disease. Based on current studies, COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular diseases are more likely to develop into critical cases and have higher mortality.

 </xref> Clinicians should be alert to the manifestations of heart injury by closely monitoring patientsâ€™ vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate), laboratory tests including creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, high-sensitivity cardiac Troponin I, creatine kinase MB, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal proBNP, and electrocardiography. Antiviral drugs, such as ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir, have been widely used in cardiac patients, although there no well-designed trials to support that. The hypothesis that COVID-19 directly causes myocardial injury may support the usage of antiviral drugs, but the side-effects of these drugs on the cardiovascular system, such as sudden cardiac death and bradycardia, should be carefully considered.
