 </xref> For acute ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in patients with confirmed COVID-19, strict isolation should start immediately and thrombolytic contraindications should be evaluated. Patients with thrombolytic contraindications should be transferred to the local infectious disease specialist hospitals immediately for further treatment. Patients without thrombolytic contraindications should first be started on intravenous thrombolysis and then transferred to the local infectious disease specialist hospitals for further treatment.

 </xref> Considering the increased risk of exposure due to the lack of negative-pressure catheterization chambers and shortages of PPE, and the greater difficulty of finely manipulating the guidewires under level 3 protection, fibrinolysis is preferred when both percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and fibrinolysis are available. Once PCI is required, all medical workers should be under level 3 protection and thorough environmental disinfection must be given after each PCI.
