<p id="p0335">It is perhaps significant to evaluate the number and distribution of cases in China as a basis for aggressive testing, tracking, and quarantining. In the early days of the epidemic, the genomic sequence of the virus was determined and tests kits that would deliver results within hours were developed. It should be emphasized that the lockdown in Wuhan was a complete lockdown, other than bringing in necessary medical personnel, ventilators, and PPE, as well as everyday goods and supplies. The difference between this type of lockdown and the shelter in place recommendations that have been put forward in many Western countries is that the lockdown in Wuhan was strictly enforced. Laws in Wuhan limited grocery shopping to 1 person per household once every 2 days, with identity checks when leaving and returning. This type of enforced lockdown was later extended to the rest of the country, so that even in cities of more than 7 million and only 200 cases, the population experienced the same restrictions (

When lockdown measures were eased over the past few weeks, temperature checks were still being performed and one had to show electronic medical data on one’s electronic device. The lesson here is that if effective quarantine is what needs to occur, these measures must be supported by personnel to enforce them, and they cannot be voluntary or simply recommended.
