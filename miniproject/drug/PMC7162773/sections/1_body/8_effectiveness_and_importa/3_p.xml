<p id="p0325">The lessons learned in China and South Korea are that in these times of crises, the earlier the intervention from a societal perspective the better. China had implemented an electronic monitoring system for infectious disease outbreaks after SARS in 2003. The question is how early one can reasonably expect to determine that something is out of the ordinary. People die of respiratory failure due to many causes, including influenza, every day. When should there be suspicion that something like a new virus is involved? The lesson here is that one should always have a high index of suspicion, but this must be balanced against causing mass hysteria and panic.</p>
