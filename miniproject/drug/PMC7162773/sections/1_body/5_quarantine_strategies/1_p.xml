   <p id="p0105">Limiting migration—Wuhan city announced a citywide lockdown on January 23, 2020. Subsequently, the Chinese government banned all domestic travel, extended the Lunar New Year holidays, and postponed reopening of schools and factories to reduce the nationwide migration of the population.</p>

   <p id="p0110">Designated hospitals—In Wuhan, to consolidate patients, medical experts, resources, and treatment, there were 45 COVID-19–designated hospitals: 6 for critical patients and 39 for severe patients and patients &gt; 65 years of age. All regional hospitals established standardized fever clinics to timely screen for fever and strengthen isolation management. Designated hospitals were increased as needed by conversion of public and nonpublic hospitals.</p>

   <p id="p0115">Community isolation—Travelers from Wuhan and other epidemic areas were required to register at their destination along with their travel history with the use of smartphones and to self-quarantine for 2 weeks to prevent community transmission. Only 1 family member could leave the house to purchase daily living supplies every 2 days.</p>

   <p id="p0120">Maintaining adequate supply of essential items and revamping supply chains—Express delivery companies conducted “noncontact delivery” in communities. Shelves in stores were kept stocked by criminalizing price gouging and preventing hoarding. Opening green channels and coordinating transportation of supplies helped to ensure the safe delivery of key supplies. In the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, there was a shortage of personal protection equipment (PPE), which was mitigated by the use of reserve supplies, acquiring donations, and increases of production (

   <p id="p0125">Testing—Early testing provided the basis for tracking and isolation in Wuhan to identify persons who could potentially spread the disease. The numbers of tests performed in Wuhan are shown in

   <p id="p0130">Tracking—A major part of the success in controlling the spread of COVID-19 was rooted in the tracking strategy. All patients testing positive for COVID-19 were tracked and their contacts isolated. Big data and artificial intelligence (AI) were used to strengthen contact tracing and the management of priority populations.</p>

   <p id="p0135">Temperature screening—Temperature screening checkpoints were established at supermarkets, residential area entrances, and transportation hubs. Everyone was screened for temperature when entering public areas. Temperature screening is a cheap, easily implemented, and rapid method of screening large numbers of the population for possible COVID-19. Fever is the most common symptom in patients with COVID-19. Persons who had traveled to Hubei or had close contact with COVID-19 patients in the preceding 14 days were required to undergo temperature checks.

   <p id="p0140">Personal protection—All residents were required to wear medical surgical masks or N95 masks when accessing public places. The internet and media were leveraged to publicize the correct knowledge of protection and prevention of spread, such as using masks, daily disinfection, and washing hands correctly.</p>

   <p id="p0145">Controlling cross-infection—Hospitals offered online consultation and medical services to reduce the frequency that patients visited hospitals. Online work and learning were used to avoid cross-infection.</p>
