<p id="p0355">The experience in China is unique in that it was the first country to implement drastic measures to combat COVID-19. The strategy in China was early testing, diligent tracking, and strict isolation of patients and contacts, first in Wuhan and then nationwide. Even with this, there were more than 80,000 cases in China and more than 3000 deaths. All countries, even China, can learn from this. Although the drastic measures that China implemented appear for now to have stopped the viral spread, earlier implementation could have reduced the number of cases and deaths even more.</p>
