<p id="p0360">Viral epidemics need to be countered with a unified national strategy that can be implemented quickly on a very large scale. The ability to mobilize and to stay nimble in adapting to these challenges is paramount. Public buy-in is crucial for all citizens to abide by the rules and recommendations. Rules must be mandatory and cannot be simply recommended and voluntary. Designated officers must be deployed to enforce these rules. The negative short-term public and economic consequences that may result from shutting down services, restricting travel, and aggressive quarantining must be accepted or the virus will keep spreading. Collaboration and sharing among countries are imperative to establish more effective policies to control the spread of future epidemics and minimize mortality and morbidity.</p>
