<p>It is increasingly believed that IFN-λs provide important first-line immunological defense against viral infections of the respiratory tract [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7–11</xref>]. In murine models, IFN-λs are the first IFNs produced in response to influenza virus infection and these cytokines act at the epithelial barrier to suppress initial viral spread without causing inflammation [

 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Mice lacking IFN-λR1 shed more infectious virus particles and transmit the virus to other mice much more efficiently [
