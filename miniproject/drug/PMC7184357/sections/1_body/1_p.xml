<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus, was first identified in the Hubei province of China in December 2019 and has now spread worldwide. The etiologic agent of COVID-19 is a β-coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] that is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the virus that caused the much more limited SARS outbreak of 2002–2003, and to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the etiologic agent for MERS. SARS-CoV-2 differs from previous emergent coronaviruses in important ways. The case fatality rate for COVID-19 is considerably lower than that reported for SARS (17%) or MERS (40%) [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]; however, SARS-CoV-2 spread much more rapidly, quickly causing many more total deaths than infection with both previous coronaviruses combined. Currently, there are no effective treatments for COVID-19 and our understanding of the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 is limited. A report in this issue of 
 <italic>Clinical Infectious Diseases</italic> from Professor Kwok-Yung Yuen and colleagues demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 induces very weak expression of interferons (IFNs) in infected cells [
