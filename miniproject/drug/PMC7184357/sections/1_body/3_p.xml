<p>IFNs play a crucial role in the immune response to viral infections. Type I IFNs, such as IFN-α and IFN-β, attach to cell surface co-receptors that are expressed ubiquitously. This binding leads to activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and upregulation of numerous IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Many of the proteins encoded by these ISGs mediate antiviral activities. The IFN-λ family (also known as type III interferons) [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref>] is a more recently discovered group of cytokines that bind to a distinct receptor complex yet activate the same JAK-STAT signaling pathway. However, expression of the IFN-λ receptor (IFN-λR1) is largely restricted to cells and tissues of epithelial origin, including respiratory epithelial cells [
