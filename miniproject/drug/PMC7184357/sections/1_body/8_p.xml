<p>Pegylated IFN-λ1, an investigational agent that has undergone testing in &gt; 3000 human subjects, might be an effective early treatment for SARS-CoV-2. In phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, pegylated IFN-λ1 administered parenterally for up to 48 weeks produced fewer adverse effects, but similar efficacy, compared with pegylated IFN-α [

Despite promising results for the use of pegylated IFN-λ1 in HCV infection, it was abandoned for that indication because of the contemporaneous development of direct-acting antiviral agents for HCV that proved to be even more effective. However, that extensive testing of pegylated IFN-λ1 established its safety, opening the door to its use in other infections. Currently, pegylated IFN-λ1 is being tested for treatment of hepatitis D virus infection, including in a clinical trial now under way at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (NCT03600714) [
