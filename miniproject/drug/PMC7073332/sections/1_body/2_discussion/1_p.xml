<p id="Par22">In this study, we presented a network-based methodology for systematic identification of putative repurposable drugs and drug combinations for potential treatment of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Integration of drug–target networks, HCoV–host interactions, HCoV-induced transcriptome in human cell lines, and human protein–protein interactome network are essential for such identification. Based on comprehensive evaluation, we prioritized 16 candidate repurposable drugs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) and 3 potential drug combinations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) for targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. However, although the majority of predictions have been validated by various literature data (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), all network-predicted repurposable drugs and drug combinations must be validated in various 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 experimental assays
