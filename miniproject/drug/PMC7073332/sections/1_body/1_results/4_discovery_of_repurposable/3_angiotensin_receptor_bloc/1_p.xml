 </sup>. Irbesartan (
 <italic>Z</italic> = –5.98), a typical ARB, was approved by the FDA for treatment of hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. Here, network proximity analysis shows a significant association between irbesartan’s targets and HCoV-associated host proteins in the human interactome. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>, irbesartan targets SLC10A1, encoding the sodium/bile acid cotransporter (NTCP) protein that has been identified as a functional preS1-specific receptor for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the hepatitis delta virus (HDV). Irbesartan can inhibit NTCP, thus inhibiting viral entry
