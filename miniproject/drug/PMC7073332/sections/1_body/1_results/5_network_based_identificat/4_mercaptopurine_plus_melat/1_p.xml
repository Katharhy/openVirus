<p id="Par21">As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>, targets of both mercaptopurine and melatonin showed strong network proximity with HCoV-associated host proteins in the human interactome network. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies identified mercaptopurine as a selective inhibitor of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV by targeting papain-like protease

 </sup>). Specifically, melatonin was reported to inhibit calmodulin and calmodulin interacts with ACE2 by inhibiting shedding of its ectodomain, a key infectious process of SARS-CoV

 </sup>. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>, mercaptopurine and melatonin may synergistically block c-Jun signaling by targeting multiple cellular targets. In summary, combination of mercaptopurine and melatonin may offer a potential combination therapy for 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 by synergistically targeting papain-like protease, ACE2, c-Jun signaling, and anti-inflammatory pathways (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>). However, further experimental observations on ACE2 pathways by melatonin in 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are highly warranted.
