<p id="Par11">In total, we computationally identified 135 drugs that were associated (
 <italic>Z</italic> &lt; −1.5 and 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, permutation test) with the HCoV–host interactome (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). To validate bias of the pooled cellular proteins from six CoVs, we further calculated the network proximities of all the drugs for four CoVs with a large number of know host proteins, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, IBV, and MHV, separately. We found that the 
 <italic>Z</italic>-scores showed consistency among the pooled 119 HCoV-associated proteins and other four individual CoVs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). The Pearson correlation coefficients of the proximities of all the drugs for the pooled HCoV are 0.926 vs. SARS-CoV (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, 
 <italic>t</italic> distribution), 0.503 vs. MERS-CoV (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), 0.694 vs. IBV (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), and 0.829 vs. MHV (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). These network proximity analyses offer putative repurposable candidates for potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs.
