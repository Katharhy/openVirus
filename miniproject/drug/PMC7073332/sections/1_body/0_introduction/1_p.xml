 </sup>. In the past two decades, two highly pathogenic human CoVs (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), emerging from animal reservoirs, have led to global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality

 </sup>. For example, 8098 individuals were infected and 774 died in the SARS-CoV pandemic, which cost the global economy with an estimated $30 to $100 billion

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of November 2019, MERS-CoV has had a total of 2494 diagnosed cases causing 858 deaths, the majority in Saudi Arabia

 </sup>, was found in Wuhan, China. As of 24 February 2020, there have been over 79,000 cases with over 2600 deaths for the 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 outbreak worldwide; furthermore, human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. However, there are currently no effective medications against 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Several national and international research groups are working on the development of vaccines to prevent and treat the 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2, but effective vaccines are not available yet. There is an urgent need for the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies for 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
