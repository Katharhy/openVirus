  <title>Network-based rational design of drug combinations for 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> The possible exposure mode of the HCoV-associated protein module to the pairwise drug combinations. An effective drug combination will be captured by the “
   <italic>Complementary Exposure</italic>” pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV–host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. 
   <italic>Z</italic>
   <sub>CA</sub> and 
   <italic>Z</italic>
   <sub>CB</sub> denote the network proximity (
   <italic>Z</italic>-score) between targets (Drugs A and B) and a specific HCoV. 
   <italic>S</italic>
   <sub>AB</sub> denotes separation score (see Materials and methods) of targets between Drug A and Drug B. 
   <bold>b</bold>–
   <bold>d</bold> Inferred mechanism-of-action networks for three selected pairwise drug combinations: 
   <bold>b</bold> sirolimus (a potent immunosuppressant with both antifungal and antineoplastic properties) plus dactinomycin (an RNA synthesis inhibitor for treatment of various tumors), 
   <bold>c</bold> toremifene (first-generation nonsteroidal-selective estrogen receptor modulator) plus emodin (an experimental drug for the treatment of polycystic kidney), and 
   <bold>d</bold> melatonin (a biogenic amine for treating circadian rhythm sleep disorders) plus mercaptopurine (an antimetabolite antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant properties).
