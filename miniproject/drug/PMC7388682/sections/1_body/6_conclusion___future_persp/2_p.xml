<p>To properly contain COVID-19 or any other emerging coronaviral pandemic, complete understanding of virus virulence and transmission are required. This will enable an understanding of virus transfer between species, in addition to identification of different encoded nonstructural proteins, enzymes and the related mechanisms of action. Accordingly, newer therapeutic targets can be recognized and targeted using surface functionalized NPs. Additionally, studying the lifecycle of the virus and the host’s response will enable us to produce an effective nanovaccine. Based on these studies, we expect future development of a broad-spectrum ‘universal’ NP-based vaccine or therapeutic to be ready for current and future CoV pandemics. Interestingly, we predict that microfluidics will significantly contribute in CoV detection, taking the benefits of miniaturization, rapid detection and portability [

As the spread of viruses is faster than the development of effective vaccines, drug and vaccine studies should be complementary to what has already been achieved with previous CoV-related research.
