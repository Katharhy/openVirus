<p>Nanomedicine, as a promising antiviral approach, could target the different steps in CoV’s lifecycle, in addition to the entry step. Virus entry, via endosomes or membrane fusion as the first step of its lifecycle, is initiated with S protein (entry protein). Thereby, NPs have been frequently designed to block S protein and inhibit coronaviral entry (
