<p>Emerging diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, such as NP-based flow detection strips, have been developed to speed up detection and to avoid the requirement to send samples to specialized facilities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">FigureÂ 4</xref>). Vertical flow (VF) detection was previously done to visually detect N gene of MERS-CoV in combination with reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification technique (RT-LAMP-VF) [

RNA of MERS-CoV was amplified by RT-LAMP and the amplicons were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and biotin to bind streptavidin-AuNPs conjugates forming complex. This FITC-labeled complex was captured by anti-FITC antibody immobilized on the strip, producing a visibly colored line [
