<p>Current diagnostic tools for CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, are based mainly on CT scans and nucleic acid testing using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) [

 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. Rapid diagnosis and identification of infected patients is the best way to contain epidemics, and this is hard with conventional diagnostic methods due to unavailability of equipment, kits and slow output, in addition to need of technical expertise. Due to immediate priority for rapid, sensitive and affordable diagnosis of COVID-19, nanotechnology can contribute in extraction and/or detection of SARS-CoVs-2, exploiting NP-based electronic, mechanical and magnetic properties.
