<p>Accurate assays require efficient and automated extraction and isolation of nucleic acids from samples to avoid cross infection or false-negative results. Magnetic NPs (MNPs) could play a role in isolation of nucleic acids using. For example, Zhao 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>] developed a one-step nucleic acid extraction technique using amino-modified MNPs functionalized with polycarboxyl groups (PC-coated NH2-MNPs) to specifically bind viral RNA. With magnetic fields, nucleic acids are easily collected and then released from MNPs by the addition of elution buffer. Using COVID-19 pseudoviruses, polycarboxyl-functionalized MNPs (10 ± 3 nm, -39 ± 1 mV) showed excellent absorption and paramagnetic properties (30 s magnetic capture). Additionally, superparamagnetic NPs were prepared to give a magnetite core covered with silica (80 nm) coupled with a probe, which is only complementary to the target cDNA of SARS-CoVs. The functionalized superparamagnetic NPs were able to anneal and extract target cDNA from samples using magnetic field [
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. This extracted DNA was amplified with PCR to be easily detected via a sandwich hybridization assay using silica-coated fluorescence NPs (40 ± 5 nm), which were attached to complementary target cDNA [
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Silica-coated fluorescence NPs result in fluorescence intensity, which is directly related to the concentration of the target cDNA.
