<p>Vaccination is thought to be the ultimate aim to rapidly control current and future CoV outbreaks. Nanovaccines are designed to improve vaccine efficacy and immunization strategies through different NP-related mechanisms such as protection of antigens from degradation, controlling delivery of antigens from NP matrix and regulation of antigen uptake and processing by APCs [
