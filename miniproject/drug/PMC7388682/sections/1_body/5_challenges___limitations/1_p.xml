<p>Nanomedicine offers numerous opportunities against coronaviral infections in the field of vaccination, molecular diagnosis and treatment. However, despite these interventions, it is still highly challenging to safely translate NPs from laboratory innovation to the clinic. The key challenges and hurdles are encountered at different stages, starting from understanding viral genomic and proteomic composition to clinical translation. While genomic and proteomic compositions of SARS-CoV-2 were rapidly identified to help in design and development of NP-based approaches against the virus, a high mutation rate and the consequent genetic diversity is still a major obstacle for successful therapy. This is clear in the case of NP-based RBD vaccines, where RBD is a variable sequence in CoV genome [

 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Viruses do not have enough therapeutic targets, which can be easily targeted without affecting host cells. Accordingly, studying the weak points of the virus and vulnerabilities of infected cells will enable us to design specific ligands, which can be used surface functionalize NPs and target the lifecycle, of the virus. Additionally, scaling up of NP production is very challenging, so, we should give more insights to optimize scale up procedures and invest more in translation of bench-top research to clinical practice. SARS-CoV-2 as an emerging pathogen has not enough animal models, which are required for preclinical studies. Furthermore, each virus behaves differently from one host to another, and host response to SARS-CoV-2 is still under study. So, broadening the spectrum for NP-based vaccination, diagnosis or treatment against different viruses is still very difficult. Importantly, with this high rate of dissemination of viruses and the frustrating slow drug development, there is an urgent need for developing new nanomedicines of high quality, safety and availability to all countries at a reasonable cost.
