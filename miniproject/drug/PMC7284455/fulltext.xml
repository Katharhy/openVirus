Wuhan, China and rapidly spread worldwide, with a vast majority of confirmed
cases presenting with respiratory symptoms. Potential neurological
manifestations and their pathophysiological mechanisms have not been thoroughly
established. In this narrative review, we sought to present the neurological
manifestations associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Case
reports, case series, editorials, reviews, case-control and cohort studies were
evaluated, and relevant information was abstracted. Various reports of
neurological manifestations of previous coronavirus epidemics provide a roadmap
regarding potential neurological complications of COVID-19, due to many shared
characteristics between these viruses and SARS-CoV-2. Studies from the current
pandemic are accumulating and report COVID-19 patients presenting with
dizziness, headache, myalgias, hypogeusia and hyposmia, but also with more
serious manifestations including polyneuropathy, myositis, cerebrovascular
diseases, encephalitis and encephalopathy. However, discrimination between
causal relationship and incidental comorbidity is often difficult. Severe
COVID-19 shares common risk factors with cerebrovascular diseases, and it is
currently unclear whether the infection <italic>per se</italic> represents an
independent stroke risk factor. Regardless of any direct or indirect
neurological manifestations, the COVID-19 pandemic has a huge impact on the
management of neurological patients, whether infected or not. In particular, the
majority of stroke services worldwide have been negatively influenced in terms
of care delivery and fear to access healthcare services. The effect on
healthcare quality in the field of other neurological diseases is additionally
evaluated.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cerebrovascular diseases</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>healthcare impact</kwd><kwd>neurological manifestations</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>typesetter</meta-name><meta-value>ts1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1756286420932036"><title>Introduction</title><p>In December 2019, a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, as the causing factor
of pneumonia and severe acute respiratory syndrome.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> As of May 1st, 2020, the currently named severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread in more than 215 countries, infecting
3,181,642 patients and causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as
this outbreak was declared on 11th March 2020 by the World Health Organization.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> During this pandemic, public health is relentlessly facing critical
challenges, and the medical community continues to struggle in an uncharted so far
territory, especially with regards to reliable therapeutic interventions.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>Neurologists have to navigate through the same dark arena of uncertainty, since novel
data are emerging, and the pattern of clinical characteristics of COVID-19 is
continuously widening and increasing. However, neurologists are used to uncertainty,
but they are also dedicated to thoughtful problem solving, taking one step at a time.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In fact, the brain has traditionally been the target organ in a variety of
infectious diseases and critical illnesses, either as a direct insult or as a
secondary result of infection.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Apart from the central nervous system (CNS), the peripheral nervous system
(PNS) is particularly vulnerable during immune-mediated diseases associated with
infections, and prolonged immobilization during critical hospitalization can also
severely impact nerves and muscles.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>In the present narrative review, we sought to present the neurological manifestations
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. Caution is recommended so that
clinicians can differentiate between the cases where neurological disease is
directly associated with COVID-19 from those that present as non-etiological
comorbidities. We also evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health
care of neurological patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section2-1756286420932036"><title>Methods</title><p>We systematically searched the literature through MEDLINE and EMBASE, based on the
combination of keywords: SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, COVID-19, coronavirus,
neurological manifestations, implications, cerebrovascular diseases, healthcare
impact, pandemic. References of retrieved articles were also screened. Case reports,
case series, editorials, reviews, case-control and cohort studies were evaluated,
and relevant information was abstracted. Duplicate publications were excluded from
further evaluation. Reference lists of all articles that met the criteria and
references of relevant review articles were examined to identify studies that may
have been missed by the database search. Literature search protocol was conducted by
three independent authors (GT, LP and AHK). The last literature search was conducted
on May 1st, 2020.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="section3-1756286420932036"><title>Results</title><sec id="section4-1756286420932036"><title>What is already known from previous coronavirus epidemics?</title><p>SARS-CoV-2 virus is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Severe disease can be caused by three of these zoonotic viruses: severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which both have caused epidemics in the new
millennium, and SARS-CoV-2. In fact, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share common viral
characteristics, such as they both target the same receptor,
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and they cause similar symptoms,
predominantly pulmonary.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>Regarding the search for a neurological component of COVID-19 manifestations, one
can derive experience and data from the previous epidemics caused by
coronaviruses. During the worldwide outbreak of SARS in 2002&#x02013;2003, limited cases
and case series of patients manifesting neurological complications were
reported, most of which were associated with prolonged immobilization and septic
and cardiogenic shock.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="bibr11-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr12-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> However,
one case with possible direct infection of the central nervous system was
documented, based on SARS-CoV detection by reverse transcriptase&#x02013;polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the patient.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Interestingly, neurotropism of human coronaviruses has been suggested by
<italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies that showed
that certain strains of the viruses could persist in the human CNS by targeting
oligodendrocytic and neuroglial cell lines.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="bibr15-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr16-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>Cases with neurological complications have also been reported in patients with MERS-CoV.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Neurological manifestations, such as Bickerstaff&#x02019;s encephalitis
overlapping with Guillain&#x02013;Barr&#x000e9; syndrome, intensive-care-unit-acquired
neuropathy, seizures and strokes, both ischemic and haemorrhagic, had all
complicated the clinical course of patients with MERS-CoV.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="bibr19-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr20-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr21-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> More severe manifestations
occurred in two patients with immune-mediated disorders, precisely one with
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and another with encephalitis.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> CSF analysis was performed in the last two cases, but MERS-CoV RT-PCR was
negative in both of them.</p><p>Coronaviruses can cause serious pulmonary manifestations requiring intensive care
unit treatment; thus, infected patients may also suffer from indirect
neurological complications of critical illness. The central and peripheral
nervous system involvement may be related to hypoxia and endothelial damage,
uncontrollable immune reaction and inflammation, electrolyte imbalance,
hypercoagulable state and disseminated intravascular coagulation, septic shock
and/or multiple organ failure. Neurological manifestations are indeed expected
(<xref rid="table1-1756286420932036" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), but
few robust data exist to suggest direct infection of the nervous system by
coronaviruses as yet.</p><table-wrap id="table1-1756286420932036" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Neurological symptoms potentially associated with COVID-19, according to

mechanisms have been published and involve viral access to the CNS through
systemic circulation or across the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone leading
to symptoms of hyposmia and hypogeusia.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Viral neuro-invasion and subsequent central neuronal injury have also
been proposed to contribute to the acute respiratory distress of the patients
with COVID-19.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Moreover, the adhesion of SARS-CoV2 to ACE2 receptors gains particular
importance in the cases of intracerebral haemorrhage, due to the inactivation of
the receptor and subsequent dysfunction in blood pressure regulation.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In severely infected patients, coagulopathy and prolonged prothrombin
time due to disseminated intravascular coagulation may contribute to increased
risk of secondary intracranial haemorrhage. In cases of ischemic stroke,
potential mechanisms are hypercoagulability associated with inflammation,
endothelial and platelet activation, dehydration and cardio-embolism from
virus-related cardiac injury.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bibr27-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Hypoxemia can further
worsen neuronal damage.</p><p>The first cohort study about neurological manifestations of COVID-19 summarized
the neurological symptoms among 78 out of the 214 (36.4%) patients hospitalized
in three designated COVID-19 hospitals in China.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Of those patients, 6 suffered from stroke, but milder neurological
symptoms were more commonly reported in this cohort, such as dizziness,
headache, muscle symptoms, hypogeusia and hyposmia. Interestingly, anosmia,
hyposmia and dysgeusia affected such a significant number of patients worldwide
that the American Academy of Otolaryngology &#x02013; Head and Neck Surgery proposed
that these symptoms should be added to the list of screening tools for possible
COVID-19 infection.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bibr30-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Mild neurological symptoms, such as headache (13.6%) and
myalgias (14.9%), were also reported in another large case series, which
summarized the clinical characteristics among 1099 COVID-19 patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> In addition, the most common (52%) symptoms of adult patients with
COVID-19 infection were myalgia and fatigue in a recent Chinese study.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> It is unknown whether these symptoms represent a systemic inflammatory
state, neurological disease or both.</p><p>Cerebrovascular disease in patients with COVID-19 was studied in a single-centre,
cohort study that has been published without peer-review on a pre-print server.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> According to this study, acute stroke may complicate or co-exist with
COVID-19; 5%, 0.5% and 0.5% of the patients developed acute ischemic stroke,
cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and cerebral haemorrhage, respectively. The
main limitation of this report is the lack of comprehensive diagnostic work-up
to document the potential aetiopathogenic mechanisms of cerebrovascular
diseases.</p><p>A more recent study underscored the high incidence of ischemic stroke due to
large vessel occlusion in patients younger than 50 years old.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> More importantly, all of those patients (n=5) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection but were not critically ill until the stroke occurrence. Two of them
did not have any known risk factors for stroke.</p><p>More case reports of neurological manifestations have also followed (<xref rid="table2-1756286420932036" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). A patient
with COVID-19 developed decreased consciousness during hospitalization in the
intensive care unit and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in the CSF.<sup><xref rid="bibr35-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> The authors diagnosed this patient as a case of SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis.
However, caution is highly suggested since positive RT-PCR in the CSF is not
necessarily equivalent to CNS infection. A traumatic lumbar puncture with
contamination of the CSF sample by the patient&#x02019;s blood or other biological
secretions that contained the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2, cannot be entirely
excluded. One more patient with COVID-19 presented with altered mental status
and possible encephalopathy and underwent electroencephalogram (EEG), which
showed bilateral slowing and focal slowing in the left temporal region with
sharply countered waves.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> However, the patient had suffered a stroke in the past and had an
underlying left temporal lesion of encephalomalacia, that could have contributed
to the abnormal EEG. CSF analysis was also not indicative of CNS infection. More
conclusive evidence of SARS-CoV-2 associated meningitis/encephalitis are
presented by a case report of a comatose patient with positive RT-PCR for
SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF and neuroimaging features indicative of right lateral
ventriculitis and encephalitis mainly on right mesial lobe and hippocampus.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Surprisingly, no genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 was detected during

<italic>versus</italic> residual CNS infection after viral clearance from
other sites, a feature observed in other viral infections like Ebola and human
immunodeficiency virus. A case of acute haemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy
in a patient with COVID-19 has also been described as a result of an
intracranial cytokine storm, similar to the one occurring in the lungs during
severe COVID-19, leading to respiratory failure.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Large trials have been looking into therapeutic countermeasures that
include immune modulation like IL-6 inhibition in an attempt to fight this
inflammatory cascade. Another case involved the peripheral nervous system with
the development of para-infectious Guillain&#x02013;Barr&#x000e9; syndrome.<sup><xref rid="bibr39-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> However, the authors acknowledge the fact that SARS-CoV2 infection in
their case might as well be a coincidence rather than causality. Five more
patients developed Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome 5 to 10 days after the onset of
COVID-19 symptoms.<sup><xref rid="bibr40-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Severe deficits, axonal involvement and respiratory failure with

documented in those critically ill patients and 33% of those discharged had a
persistent dysexecutive syndrome. Further diagnostic evaluation was also
performed in a subset of patients, consisting of magnetic resonance imaging,
electroencephalography and CSF examination. Among neuroimaging features,
leptomeningeal enhancement in eight patients, frontotemporal hypoperfusion in 11
patients and cerebral ischemic stroke in three patients were reported. CSF
examination was performed in seven patients and was abnormal in three of them,
presenting positive oligoclonal bands with an identical electrophoretic pattern

SARS-CoV-2 was negative in all examined CSF samples.</p><p>The distinction between true causality and non-etiological concomitance may pose
a real challenge in some instances, but its importance is unquestionable when
presenting case-reports with neurological manifestations attributable to
COVID-19. Microbiological assays and temporal association can contribute to one
or the other direction. We present the case reports of two stroke patients with
clearly identified underlying aetiopathogenic stroke mechanisms, who also
suffered from COVID-19 manifestations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1756286420932036">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1756286420932036">2</xref>). These cases highlight the potential
of comorbidity between COVID-19 and stroke. In fact, COVID-19 and stroke share
some common risk factors (<xref rid="table3-1756286420932036" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) such as age, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus,

Consequently, COVID-19 and stroke may coexist without any causal association.
The CASCADE (Call to Action: SARS-Cov-2 and CerebrovAscular DisordErs) study is

in models of stroke care, differential hospitalization rate, and stroke
severity, as it pertains to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately, this will help
guide clinical-based policies surrounding COVID-19 and other similar global
pandemics to ensure that treating cerebrovascular comorbidities is appropriately
prioritized during the global crisis.</p><fig id="fig1-1756286420932036" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Imaging evaluation of an ischemic stroke patient with concomitant
COVID-19.</p><p>This 53-year-old man presented in the emergency department of a
comprehensive stroke centre on March 18, 2020. The patient was aphasic
with right hemiplegia. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale
(NIHSS) score was 16. He was afebrile and his family members denied any
symptoms attributable to COVID-19. Neurological symptoms&#x02019;
onset-to-presentation time was 1&#x02009;h. A non-contrast brain computed
tomography (CT)-scan was performed, intracranial haemorrhage was
excluded and early hyperacute signs of left middle cerebral artery
ischemia were disclosed (loss of grey-white matter differentiation (A).
No other contraindications existed and intravenous thrombolysis with
alteplase was administered. Door-to-needle time was relatively prolonged
(70&#x02009;min), since the CT-scan was occupied at that time with chest
examinations of patients with possible SARS-CoV-2 infection. There was
no availability for mechanical thrombectomy in this institution
(after-hours presentation of the patient and limited personnel in the
catheter laboratory). Diagnostic work-up revealed two possible stroke
mechanisms: atrial fibrillation of unknown duration with subsequent
cardio-embolism, and concomitant atherothrombotic disease, causing
haemodynamically significant (&#x0003e;70%) stenosis of the internal carotid
arteries bilaterally. During the next 48&#x02009;h, the patient presented
neurological deterioration (NIHSS-score of 22) and follow-up brain CT
showed an extensive infarction in the distribution of the left middle
cerebral artery (B). At that time, the patient developed a low-grade
fever, most probably due to aspiration. Chest CT-scan was indicative of
bilateral aspiration pneumonia (C). Oropharyngeal swabs were also
examined for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR assay, but the virus was not detected.
Three days later, the patient was intubated and transferred to the
general intensive care unit. The second oropharyngeal swab test was
positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The patient expired on March 24, 2020 due
to further neurological deterioration from cerebral oedema.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1756286420932036-fig1"/></fig><fig id="fig2-1756286420932036" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Imaging evaluation of a patient with intracerebral haemorrhage with

hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery disease presented to the
emergency department of a comprehensive stroke centre on April 6, 2020
after waking up with slurred speech, left-sided weakness and numbness.
Admission systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels were
178/106&#x02009;mmHg. The patient was afebrile with no respiratory symptoms.
However, history provided by his wife suggested that earlier in the
morning, prior to his admission, he had an increased body temperature of
38.5&#x000b0;C. Brain computed tomography scan uncovered right thalamic
intracerebral haemorrhage with mass effect and intraventricular
extension (A). The patient was admitted in the stroke unit. Due to the
history of fever, a nasopharyngeal swab was performed on the day of
admission and was negative for SARS-CoV-2. However, on the following day
the patient redeveloped fever, so work-up with blood cultures, chest
X-ray (B) and urinalysis was performed but did not uncover any obvious
source of infection. A second nasopharyngeal swab was ordered and came
back positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Despite SARS-CoV-2 infection, the
patient never experienced any symptoms of dyspnoea, cough, chest pain or
diarrhoea during his hospitalization. He only reported the presence of
mild generalized headache and nausea, which could have been attributable
to the intracerebral haemorrhage. A certain causal association between
COVID-19 and intracerebral haemorrhage cannot be established based on
the evidence in this case, especially since the patient had a medical
history of three common risk factors of manifesting both the diseases
(<xref rid="table3-1756286420932036" ref-type="table">Table

dysregulation due to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) inactivation

patients?</title><p>Regardless of any direct or indirect neurological manifestations related to
SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 pandemic has a huge impact on the management of
neurological patients, whether infected or not. Normal neurological medical
care, as we know it, has been seriously impaired worldwide.<sup><xref rid="bibr46-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="bibr47-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Many
neurological wards, among other general medical wards, have been converted into
quarantine wards for the treatment of infected patients. Routine neurological
outpatient visits are delayed or suspended, and treatment remains available only
for emergency conditions and highly selective cases. Even in the emergency
setting, neurological departments may be forced to function with fewer staff,
either due to staff redeployment to COVID services, prophylactic quarantine or
direct illness. The remaining healthy personnel are at high risk of burn-out,
due to long shifts, sleep deprivation, psychological distress, shortages of
medicine and supplies and discomfort associated with personal protective
equipment (PPE) use.<sup><xref rid="bibr48-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> Characteristically, PPE use has recently been associated with the
development of <italic>de novo</italic> headaches and aggravation of
pre-existing headaches among frontline healthcare personnel and these factors
can interfere with compliance and workplace safety and productivity.<sup><xref rid="bibr49-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> Despite those unprecedented conditions, quality of care in neurology
should be maintained.</p><p>Stroke, as the cornerstone of neurological emergency and a major cause of
mortality and disability, should not be neglected at the expense of extreme
community and health-care COVID-19-measures.<sup><xref rid="bibr46-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> However, published and anecdotal reports of declining stroke admission
volumes are accumulating.<sup><xref rid="bibr46-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="bibr50-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Stroke patients with
mostly mild symptoms, and for that reason with better chances of recovery if
appropriately treated, may be unwilling to seek medical help due to their fear
of the virus. Such a practice can significantly narrow down the time-window for
available acute treatments and can lead to neurological deterioration, early
recurrent stroke and permanent disability.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In light of those data, several stroke centres have come together to
design a study protocol with the aim to investigate the worldwide burden of
cerebrovascular disease before, during and after SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (CASCADE study).<sup><xref rid="bibr45-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup></p><p>In addition, stroke centres have been guided to implement a &#x02018;protected code

maintaining the high standards of stroke care is of utmost importance.<sup><xref rid="bibr53-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> For example, early cerebral imaging should be preserved in order to avoid
unnecessary delays, noted in our patient presented in the case report (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1756286420932036">Figure 1</xref>). During stroke
patient presentation, doctors should ask patients and their companions whether
they have symptoms indicative of COVID-19. If so, they might consider ordering a
chest CT-scan, which can be performed at the same time as the brain CT-scan.<sup><xref rid="bibr54-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> Return visits to the imaging departments run the risk of exposing and
being exposed and should be avoided. As early as at the admission process,
doctors should establish a discharge plan and perform in-hospital only the most
essential diagnostic tests, in order to shorten the duration of hospitalization.<sup><xref rid="bibr53-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> Finally, early consultation should be asked from an infectious disease
specialist in cases of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection or from an intensive care
unit physician, if the patient requires high fractions of inspired oxygen.
Stroke patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection should be transferred to
dedicated COVID-19 wards.<sup><xref rid="bibr54-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> The need for a multidisciplinary team approach and vigorous
inter-specialist cooperation is essential.</p><p>Notably, the European Stroke Organization (ESO) has recently announced a press

from stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://eso-stroke.org/news/">https://eso-stroke.org/news/</ext-link>). In a survey of 426 stroke care
providers from 55 countries, only one in five reported that stroke patients are
currently receiving the usual acute and post-acute care at their hospital. This
press release concluded that the lack of optimal care is likely to lead to a
greater risk of death and a smaller chance of a good recovery (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://eso-stroke.org/news/">https://eso-stroke.org/news/</ext-link>). The ESO has also emphasized that
patients with stroke symptoms should still present to the hospital as soon as
possible and that efforts should be made to maintain the usual level of stroke
care, including intravenous and endovascular reperfusion strategies,
irrespective of the patient&#x02019;s COVID-19 status, to avoid unnecessary &#x02018;collateral
damage&#x02019; through the inadequate treatment of this often disabling or
life-threatening condition (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://eso-stroke.org/news/">https://eso-stroke.org/news/</ext-link>).</p><p>Other fields of neurology are less obviously, albeit still affected, by the
COVID-19 pandemic. Many neurological patients with multiple sclerosis and
autoimmune syndromes such as myasthenia gravis, neuromyelitis optica, angiitis
and inflammatory polyneuropathies are on a wide variety of immunosuppressive
therapies. Whether those therapies can impair the immune response to SARS-CoV-2
infection is a matter of great concern, but few data are currently available.<sup><xref rid="bibr55-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> However, not only should the disease-modifying therapies not be
discontinued, but also neurologists have to ensure that the patients can present
safely for their regular treatment appointments. Such patients may need to take
extra precautions to prevent exposure to the virus during their hospital visits
but also in the community. Any follow-up visits which are unrelated to treatment
can be postponed or completed through tele-neurology programs. Once a patient is
confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the physician might consider postponing any
second-line immunomodulating (fingolimod, ocrelizumab or natalizumab in
particular) or immunosuppressive therapies, especially if the patient is of
higher risk for severe COVID-19 disease.<sup><xref rid="bibr56-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> Treatment should be restarted when symptoms have fully resolved and the
repeat testing is negative. When feasible, prompt treatment re-initiation is
particularly important in the cases of fingolimod and natalizumab, in order to
minimize the risk of the rebound effect that has been associated with the
discontinuation of these agents. In the case of a clinical relapse of COVID-19
patients, treatment with intravenous pulse steroids should be carefully
considered and potentially avoided, in view of the recent multiple sclerosis
scientific organizations&#x02019; statements, cautioning against the use of
corticosteroids in patients with viral infections and COVID-19.<sup><xref rid="bibr56-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="bibr57-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> Fever in
the case of a multiple sclerosis patient with COVID-19 can further deteriorate
pre-existing symptoms (Uhthoff phenomenon) and this should be differentiated
from a &#x02018;true&#x02019; clinical relapse. Respectively, in patients with myasthenia
gravis, an infection can also induce a myasthenic crisis.<sup><xref rid="bibr58-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> Those patients are generally at high risk for developing various
in-hospital complications and the treating physicians should be extremely
vigilant.</p><p>Patients with neurodegenerative diseases also belong to a more vulnerable subset
of the general population. Patients with dementia, which are generally older and
therefore at high mortality risk due to COVID-19, can hardly follow protective
measures or use telecommunication when needed.<sup><xref rid="bibr59-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup> Lock-down can also trigger or worsen behavioural symptoms in such
patients and their caregivers should be appropriately prepared. In addition, if
such patients need prolonged hospitalization or deal with hypoxia, they will be
in immediate risk of developing delirium and deteriorate permanently.<sup><xref rid="bibr59-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup> Patients with extrapyramidal disorders are not immunocompromised, however
COVID-19 may be particular challenging for those with significant movement restrictions.<sup><xref rid="bibr60-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> In fact, patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease are more prone to lower
respiratory tract infections and, in turn, pneumonia is the leading cause of
death in Parkinson patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr60-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="bibr61-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup> The association of
COVID-19 and neurodegenerative diseases is even more complex since a significant
proportion of such patients live in nursing homes and are at particular risk of
developing the disease or infecting others with SARS-CoV-2. Healthcare- and
community-based approaches are urgently needed to minimize the bilateral impact
between COVID-19 and neurodegenerative diseases.<sup><xref rid="bibr59-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup></p><p>During their clinical practice, neurologists should also be prepared to confront
neurological adverse effects and drug interactions related to the use of
anti-viral agents and other medications that may be tested and used against
SARS-CoV-2. For example, hydroxychloroquine sulphate has been associated with
headache, dizziness and extrapyramidal disorders, such as dystonia, dyskinesia
and tremor.<sup><xref rid="bibr62-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup> In addition, it interacts with a variety of antiepileptic drugs and can
potentially lower the convulsive threshold. Caution is also required when
patients with disorders of the neuromuscular junction are prescribed
hydroxychloroquine sulphate, especially with co-administration of aminoglycoside
antibiotics. Certain drug databases report additional minor interactions of
chloroquine with anti-Xa inhibitors, resulting in a decrease of their excretion
rate and potentially in higher bleeding risk.<sup><xref rid="bibr63-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="bibr64-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup> All direct oral
anticoagulants also interact with the antiviral agent ritonavir (a protease
inhibitor used in conjunction with another PI lopinavir, as the
lopinavir/ritonavir combination for COVID-19), which is a strong inhibitor of
both cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein transporter and therefore may
increase their plasma concentrations to a clinically relevant degree.<sup><xref rid="bibr65-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">65</xref><xref rid="bibr66-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr67-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup> Remdesivir, a promising
nucleoside analogue currently tested for its efficacy in COVID-19, may be
associated with delirium.<sup><xref rid="bibr68-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup> In addition, colchicine that is currently being investigated as a
potential therapy for cardiac complications of COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier: NCT04326790), presents with substantial neuromuscular complications
that may exacerbate myalgias, weakness and other muscle symptoms of COVID-19.<sup><xref rid="bibr69-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup> Massive, inconsiderate or over-the-counter administration of such drugs
may pose a significant morbidity risk for the neurological patient. Since more
than 100 trials currently evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents, we should be aware
for potential drug&#x02013;drug interactions affecting commonly prescribed neurological
agents.</p><p>The healthcare of neurosurgical patients is also affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.<sup><xref rid="bibr70-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup> Intensive care units are being overcrowded by COVID-19 patients, and
post-operative neurosurgical patients cannot be admitted for monitoring. The
less emergent surgeries are being postponed. Patients are being triaged
according to case severity and are transported to a limited number of designated
neurosurgical centres, since the majority have been transformed to COVID-19
wards. Fortunately, but not surprisingly, cases with traumatic brain lesions,
which require urgent surgery, are being reduced in number due to the public
lockdown and social distancing measures.<sup><xref rid="bibr70-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup></p><p>Drastic times call for drastic measures and the safety of neuroscience
specialists should be preserved. Neurologists are first responders to stroke and
other neurological emergencies and have to be protected.<sup><xref rid="bibr71-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup> One management approach could be that only neurology subspecialists who
do procedures or surgeries should be going to the emergency room, stroke units
and neuro-intensive care units (i.e. neuro-intensivists and neuro-endovascular
specialists, vascular neurologists).<sup><xref rid="bibr71-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup> Other non-urgent neurological evaluations may be performed remotely.<sup><xref rid="bibr72-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></sup> Tele-neurology has emerged as a fundamental component of solutions to
sustain neurological healthcare quality.<sup><xref rid="bibr73-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">73</xref></sup> Its expanding use ranges from the simplest drug prescriptions to the more
complicated tele-triage of patients before they get admitted to an emergency
department. It has already been implemented with success in stroke care over the
past decade and in pilot projects for epilepsy care but can also be applied to
other neurological fields.<sup><xref rid="bibr74-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">74</xref></sup> We expect that information technology experts would scientifically
support this endeavour and that authorities would reimburse it appropriately.
More optimistically, after the management of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the
recovery of global health, the COVID-19 pandemic may act as a stimulus for a new
era of tele-neurology to be established. Finally, medical education for
neurological residents and the younger generation of neurologists needs to adapt
to e-learning activities in these times of extraordinary needs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section7-1756286420932036"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our narrative review summarized the so far documented neurological complications of
COVID-19 that involve the central and the peripheral nervous system. The
neurological manifestations include dizziness, headache, myalgias, hypogeusia and
hyposmia, but also highlights less common but more serious disorders including
polyneuropathy, myositis, cerebrovascular diseases and rarely encephalitis. These
neurological manifestations have also been reported in previous coronavirus
epidemics with the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV viruses. More data are needed to
establish the incidence, outcomes and causal mechanisms between COVID-19 and stroke,
encephalitis or polyneuropathy. However, direct infection of the neurological system
appears to be extremely rare.</p><p>Regardless of any direct or indirect neurological manifestations, the COVID-19
pandemic has had a huge impact on the management of neurological patients, whether
infected or not. In particular, the majority of stroke services worldwide have been
negatively influenced by the pandemic and the lack of optimal care is likely to lead
to a greater risk of death and higher odds of disability in acute stroke patients.
This includes treatments for vessel recanalization (intravenous thrombolysis and
mechanical thrombectomy), securing brain vascular malformations (aneurysm coiling
and clipping), specialized stroke unit care, secondary stroke prevention strategies
and rehabilitation. Moreover, patients with neuroimmunological disorders receiving
immunosuppressive therapies may have a higher risk of COVID-19 infection than the
one recognized so far. Similarly, patients with severe neurodegenerative disorders
are prone to pulmonary infections and may reside in nursing homes that have so far
proven to be hotspots for SARS-CoV-2 infections associated with high case-fatality
rates. In addition, neurologists should also be prepared to treat neurological
adverse effects related to the use of anti-viral agents and other medications that
may be tested and used against SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>Similar to the general population, infectious disease outbreaks are known to have a
psychological impact on various healthcare workers. A recent study on healthcare
workers from two tertiary care institutions showed that 10.8% of medically trained
(doctors and nurses) and 20.7% of allied healthcare workers suffer from moderate
anxiety, mostly related to the uncertainty of contracting the disease as well as
transmitting it to their colleagues, patients and family members.<sup><xref rid="bibr75-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">75</xref></sup> Healthcare workers in neurology departments are particularly vulnerable,
since most neurological disorders often need close contact and repeated evaluations
of the patients by neurologists, nurses, physiotherapists, technicians, as well as
personnel from allied departments. The prevalence of psychological impacts may
increase further as the pandemic continues. Important clinical and policy strategies
are needed to support healthcare workers on the frontline, especially for those who
are susceptible to psychological distress. Studies have shown that the availability
and accuracy of health information can alleviate stress levels. Regular
communication and stringent educational and psychological interventions should
target all healthcare personnel involved in the care of neurology patients to ensure
their understanding and proper use of infectious disease control measures, and to
boost a sense of security among them. Finally, psychological distress, &#x02018;burn out&#x02019;
symptoms and headaches associated with the long use of PPE may negatively affect the
performance of neurologists that are involved in the management of COVID-19 patients
hospitalized in quarantine wards.</p><p>In conclusion, COVID-19 presents with predominantly mild neurological manifestations
in the majority of infected patients, while there are multiple comorbidities with
more severe neurological disorders. New data will be continuously emerging in the
upcoming period, so the neurologists have to be prepared in this largely unknown
territory. At the same time, they must stand by their neurological patients, whose
needs do not disappear during the COVID-19 pandemic but become even more demanding.
We should stand united against this challenge and view it as a unique opportunity
for preservation of our management planning, for inter-specialist collaboration, for
innovative thinking and telemedicine adoption that can all contribute to quality
healthcare services during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Conflict of interest statement:</bold> The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or
