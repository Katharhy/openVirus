<p>In conclusion, COVID-19 presents with predominantly mild neurological manifestations in the majority of infected patients, while there are multiple comorbidities with more severe neurological disorders. New data will be continuously emerging in the upcoming period, so the neurologists have to be prepared in this largely unknown territory. At the same time, they must stand by their neurological patients, whose needs do not disappear during the COVID-19 pandemic but become even more demanding. We should stand united against this challenge and view it as a unique opportunity for preservation of our management planning, for inter-specialist collaboration, for innovative thinking and telemedicine adoption that can all contribute to quality healthcare services during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
