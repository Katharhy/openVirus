<p>Similar to the general population, infectious disease outbreaks are known to have a psychological impact on various healthcare workers. A recent study on healthcare workers from two tertiary care institutions showed that 10.8% of medically trained (doctors and nurses) and 20.7% of allied healthcare workers suffer from moderate anxiety, mostly related to the uncertainty of contracting the disease as well as transmitting it to their colleagues, patients and family members.

 </sup> Healthcare workers in neurology departments are particularly vulnerable, since most neurological disorders often need close contact and repeated evaluations of the patients by neurologists, nurses, physiotherapists, technicians, as well as personnel from allied departments. The prevalence of psychological impacts may increase further as the pandemic continues. Important clinical and policy strategies are needed to support healthcare workers on the frontline, especially for those who are susceptible to psychological distress. Studies have shown that the availability and accuracy of health information can alleviate stress levels. Regular communication and stringent educational and psychological interventions should target all healthcare personnel involved in the care of neurology patients to ensure their understanding and proper use of infectious disease control measures, and to boost a sense of security among them. Finally, psychological distress, ‘burn out’ symptoms and headaches associated with the long use of PPE may negatively affect the performance of neurologists that are involved in the management of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in quarantine wards.
