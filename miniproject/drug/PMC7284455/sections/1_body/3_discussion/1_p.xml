<p>Our narrative review summarized the so far documented neurological complications of COVID-19 that involve the central and the peripheral nervous system. The neurological manifestations include dizziness, headache, myalgias, hypogeusia and hyposmia, but also highlights less common but more serious disorders including polyneuropathy, myositis, cerebrovascular diseases and rarely encephalitis. These neurological manifestations have also been reported in previous coronavirus epidemics with the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV viruses. More data are needed to establish the incidence, outcomes and causal mechanisms between COVID-19 and stroke, encephalitis or polyneuropathy. However, direct infection of the neurological system appears to be extremely rare.</p>
