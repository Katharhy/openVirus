<p>Regarding the search for a neurological component of COVID-19 manifestations, one can derive experience and data from the previous epidemics caused by coronaviruses. During the worldwide outbreak of SARS in 2002–2003, limited cases and case series of patients manifesting neurological complications were reported, most of which were associated with prolonged immobilization and septic and cardiogenic shock.

 </sup> However, one case with possible direct infection of the central nervous system was documented, based on SARS-CoV detection by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the patient.

 </sup> Interestingly, neurotropism of human coronaviruses has been suggested by
