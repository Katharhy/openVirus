 </sup> Severe disease can be caused by three of these zoonotic viruses: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which both have caused epidemics in the new millennium, and SARS-CoV-2. In fact, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share common viral characteristics, such as they both target the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and they cause similar symptoms, predominantly pulmonary.
