<p>The distinction between true causality and non-etiological concomitance may pose a real challenge in some instances, but its importance is unquestionable when presenting case-reports with neurological manifestations attributable to COVID-19. Microbiological assays and temporal association can contribute to one or the other direction. We present the case reports of two stroke patients with clearly identified underlying aetiopathogenic stroke mechanisms, who also suffered from COVID-19 manifestations (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1756286420932036">2</xref>). These cases highlight the potential of comorbidity between COVID-19 and stroke. In fact, COVID-19 and stroke share some common risk factors (

 </sup> Consequently, COVID-19 and stroke may coexist without any causal association. The CASCADE (Call to Action: SARS-Cov-2 and CerebrovAscular DisordErs) study is a worldwide, multicentre hospital-based study on stroke incidence and outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

 </sup> The main aim of this study is to enable the understanding of the changes in models of stroke care, differential hospitalization rate, and stroke severity, as it pertains to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately, this will help guide clinical-based policies surrounding COVID-19 and other similar global pandemics to ensure that treating cerebrovascular comorbidities is appropriately prioritized during the global crisis.
