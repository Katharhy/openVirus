 </sup> According to this study, acute stroke may complicate or co-exist with COVID-19; 5%, 0.5% and 0.5% of the patients developed acute ischemic stroke, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and cerebral haemorrhage, respectively. The main limitation of this report is the lack of comprehensive diagnostic work-up to document the potential aetiopathogenic mechanisms of cerebrovascular diseases.
