<p>Other fields of neurology are less obviously, albeit still affected, by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many neurological patients with multiple sclerosis and autoimmune syndromes such as myasthenia gravis, neuromyelitis optica, angiitis and inflammatory polyneuropathies are on a wide variety of immunosuppressive therapies. Whether those therapies can impair the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is a matter of great concern, but few data are currently available.

 </sup> However, not only should the disease-modifying therapies not be discontinued, but also neurologists have to ensure that the patients can present safely for their regular treatment appointments. Such patients may need to take extra precautions to prevent exposure to the virus during their hospital visits but also in the community. Any follow-up visits which are unrelated to treatment can be postponed or completed through tele-neurology programs. Once a patient is confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the physician might consider postponing any second-line immunomodulating (fingolimod, ocrelizumab or natalizumab in particular) or immunosuppressive therapies, especially if the patient is of higher risk for severe COVID-19 disease.

 </sup> Treatment should be restarted when symptoms have fully resolved and the repeat testing is negative. When feasible, prompt treatment re-initiation is particularly important in the cases of fingolimod and natalizumab, in order to minimize the risk of the rebound effect that has been associated with the discontinuation of these agents. In the case of a clinical relapse of COVID-19 patients, treatment with intravenous pulse steroids should be carefully considered and potentially avoided, in view of the recent multiple sclerosis scientific organizations’ statements, cautioning against the use of corticosteroids in patients with viral infections and COVID-19.

 </sup> Fever in the case of a multiple sclerosis patient with COVID-19 can further deteriorate pre-existing symptoms (Uhthoff phenomenon) and this should be differentiated from a ‘true’ clinical relapse. Respectively, in patients with myasthenia gravis, an infection can also induce a myasthenic crisis.

 </sup> Those patients are generally at high risk for developing various in-hospital complications and the treating physicians should be extremely vigilant.
