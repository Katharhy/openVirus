<p>Notably, the European Stroke Organization (ESO) has recently announced a press release, cautioning for a potential increase in the risk of death or disability from stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic (

In a survey of 426 stroke care providers from 55 countries, only one in five reported that stroke patients are currently receiving the usual acute and post-acute care at their hospital. This press release concluded that the lack of optimal care is likely to lead to a greater risk of death and a smaller chance of a good recovery (

The ESO has also emphasized that patients with stroke symptoms should still present to the hospital as soon as possible and that efforts should be made to maintain the usual level of stroke care, including intravenous and endovascular reperfusion strategies, irrespective of the patient’s COVID-19 status, to avoid unnecessary ‘collateral damage’ through the inadequate treatment of this often disabling or life-threatening condition (
