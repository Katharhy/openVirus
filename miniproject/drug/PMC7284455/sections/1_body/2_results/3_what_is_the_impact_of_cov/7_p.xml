<p>During their clinical practice, neurologists should also be prepared to confront neurological adverse effects and drug interactions related to the use of anti-viral agents and other medications that may be tested and used against SARS-CoV-2. For example, hydroxychloroquine sulphate has been associated with headache, dizziness and extrapyramidal disorders, such as dystonia, dyskinesia and tremor.

 </sup> In addition, it interacts with a variety of antiepileptic drugs and can potentially lower the convulsive threshold. Caution is also required when patients with disorders of the neuromuscular junction are prescribed hydroxychloroquine sulphate, especially with co-administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Certain drug databases report additional minor interactions of chloroquine with anti-Xa inhibitors, resulting in a decrease of their excretion rate and potentially in higher bleeding risk.

 </sup> All direct oral anticoagulants also interact with the antiviral agent ritonavir (a protease inhibitor used in conjunction with another PI lopinavir, as the lopinavir/ritonavir combination for COVID-19), which is a strong inhibitor of both cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein transporter and therefore may increase their plasma concentrations to a clinically relevant degree.

 </sup> Remdesivir, a promising nucleoside analogue currently tested for its efficacy in COVID-19, may be associated with delirium.

 </sup> In addition, colchicine that is currently being investigated as a potential therapy for cardiac complications of COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04326790), presents with substantial neuromuscular complications that may exacerbate myalgias, weakness and other muscle symptoms of COVID-19.

 </sup> Massive, inconsiderate or over-the-counter administration of such drugs may pose a significant morbidity risk for the neurological patient. Since more than 100 trials currently evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents, we should be aware for potential drug–drug interactions affecting commonly prescribed neurological agents.
