<p>In addition, stroke centres have been guided to implement a ‘protected code stroke’ for the management of acute stroke patients.

 </sup> ‘Protected code stroke’ actually originates from the acknowledgment that every stroke patient is potentially infected and should be treated accordingly.

 </sup> However, maintaining the high standards of stroke care is of utmost importance.

 </sup> For example, early cerebral imaging should be preserved in order to avoid unnecessary delays, noted in our patient presented in the case report (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1756286420932036">Figure 1</xref>). During stroke patient presentation, doctors should ask patients and their companions whether they have symptoms indicative of COVID-19. If so, they might consider ordering a chest CT-scan, which can be performed at the same time as the brain CT-scan.

 </sup> Return visits to the imaging departments run the risk of exposing and being exposed and should be avoided. As early as at the admission process, doctors should establish a discharge plan and perform in-hospital only the most essential diagnostic tests, in order to shorten the duration of hospitalization.

 </sup> Finally, early consultation should be asked from an infectious disease specialist in cases of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection or from an intensive care unit physician, if the patient requires high fractions of inspired oxygen. Stroke patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection should be transferred to dedicated COVID-19 wards.

 </sup> The need for a multidisciplinary team approach and vigorous inter-specialist cooperation is essential.
