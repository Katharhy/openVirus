<p>Patients with neurodegenerative diseases also belong to a more vulnerable subset of the general population. Patients with dementia, which are generally older and therefore at high mortality risk due to COVID-19, can hardly follow protective measures or use telecommunication when needed.

 </sup> Lock-down can also trigger or worsen behavioural symptoms in such patients and their caregivers should be appropriately prepared. In addition, if such patients need prolonged hospitalization or deal with hypoxia, they will be in immediate risk of developing delirium and deteriorate permanently.

 </sup> Patients with extrapyramidal disorders are not immunocompromised, however COVID-19 may be particular challenging for those with significant movement restrictions.

 </sup> In fact, patients with Parkinsonâ€™s disease are more prone to lower respiratory tract infections and, in turn, pneumonia is the leading cause of death in Parkinson patients.

 </sup> The association of COVID-19 and neurodegenerative diseases is even more complex since a significant proportion of such patients live in nursing homes and are at particular risk of developing the disease or infecting others with SARS-CoV-2. Healthcare- and community-based approaches are urgently needed to minimize the bilateral impact between COVID-19 and neurodegenerative diseases.
