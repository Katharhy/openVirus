<p>In the present narrative review, we sought to present the neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. Caution is recommended so that clinicians can differentiate between the cases where neurological disease is directly associated with COVID-19 from those that present as non-etiological comorbidities. We also evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health care of neurological patients.</p>
