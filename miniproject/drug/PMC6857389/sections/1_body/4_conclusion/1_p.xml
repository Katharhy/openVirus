<p>Half of the world's population is at risk from dengue and now it has also established its roots in India where it is becoming hyperendemic in our population. National level comprehensive studies to estimate the true burden of dengue in India and its geographical mapping are not sufficient. Through integrated and combined efforts from various sectors and policy makers, prevention of dengue must be intensified to control further disease transmission as there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine against dengue is available. The key options for preventing and controlling dengue are: to control larval habitats in and around people's homes, workplaces, unclaimed empty spaces, dump sites, and public areas, such as place of worships/recreational centers, roadsides, playgrounds, and cemeteries; to reduce humanâ€“vector contact.[
