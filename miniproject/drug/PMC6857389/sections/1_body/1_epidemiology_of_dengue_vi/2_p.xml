<p>The epidemiology of dengue in the Indian subcontinent has been very complex and has substantially changed over almost past 6 decades in terms of prevalent strains, affected geographical locations, and severity of disease. The very first report of existence of dengue fever in India was way back in 1946.[
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Notable epidemics are one in the eastern Coast of India (1963-64),[
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Delhi (1967),[
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Kanpur (1968).[
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The southern part of the country was also involved with wide spread epidemics followed by endemic/hyperendemic prevalence of all the four serotypes of DENV. The epidemiology of DNV and its prevalent serotypes has been ever changing. The epidemic at Kanpur (1968) was due to DV-4 but in the subsequent 1969 epidemic, both DEN-2 and DEN-4 were isolated.[
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] It was completely replaced by DEN-2 during 1970 epidemic in the adjoining city of Hardoi.[
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In Delhi, till 2003, the predominant serotype was DEN-2 (genotype IV) but in 2003 for the first time all four DNV subtypes were found to cocirculate thus changing it to a hyperendemic state,[
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] followed by complete predominance of DEN serotype 3 in 2005.[
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Further, replacement of DEN-2 and 3 with DEN-1 as the predominant serotype in Delhi over a period of 3 years (2007--2009) has been reported.[
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Emergence of a distinct lineage of DEN-1, having similarity with the Comoros/Singapore 1993 and Delhi 1982 strains, but quite different from the Delhi 2005 lineage and microevolution of the precirculating DEN-3 has been reported.[
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Cocirculation of several serotypes of DNVs has resulted in concurrent infection in some patients with multiple serotypes of DEN.[
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Concurrent infection by Chikungunya and DEN-2 was reported from Vellore and Delhi.[
