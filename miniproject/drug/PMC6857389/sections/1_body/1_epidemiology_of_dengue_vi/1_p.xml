<p>The epidemiology of dengue significantly changed in south-east Asia during and following World War II.[
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] These years of war were responsible for creating conditions (hyperendemicity and high densities of Aedes Aegypti) susceptible for the emergence of DHF in south-east Asia. In the years following World War II, unprecedented urbanization in south-east Asia led to inadequate housing, deterioration of water, sewer, and waste management systems. The Aedes Aegypti and DNVs thrived in this new ecological setting, with increased transmission and frequency of epidemics occurring in the indigenous populations particularly children. Moreover, with economic expansion and continued urbanization along with ever increasing migration of people, those cities and countries that do not have multiple serotypes cocirculating as such have become hyperendemic. The viruses, often all four serotypes, were maintained in a human-Aedes Aegypti-human cycle in most urban centers of south-east Asia.
