<p>In humans, infection with DNV results in a spectrum of clinical outcomes, ranging from self-limiting, uncomplicated dengue fever (characterized by a sudden onset of fever and one or more of a number of nonspecific signs and symptoms such as frontal headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea and vomiting, weakness, and rash) to the more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The critical stage in DHF is at the time of defervescence when the patient develops a capillary-leak syndrome, with signs of circulatory failure and hemorrhagic manifestations, primarily skin hemorrhages, thrombocytopenia (&lt;100 000/mm
 <sup>3</sup>), and elevated hematocrit being the prominent features. In the most severe cases, these hemorrhagic manifestations lead to potentially fatal hypovolemic shock, a condition known as dengue shock syndrome. Infection with one serotype of DENV confers short-lived immunity against heterologous serotypes and with waning immunity; there is an increased risk of severe disease. This phenomenon, known as enhancement, may be mediated through antibody responses that are directed against the previous instead of the current serotype, leading to increased viral replication.[
