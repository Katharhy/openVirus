<p>Epidemiological surveillance incudes fever surveillance; diagnosis based on standard case definition; reporting of DF/DHF cases to state health authorities; during an outbreak situation, if 5 to 10% of the samples collected from clinically diagnosed cases are found positive by laboratory, others would be considered epidemiologically linked cases. However, atypical cases (doubtful) samples must be sent for laboratory confirmation.</p>
