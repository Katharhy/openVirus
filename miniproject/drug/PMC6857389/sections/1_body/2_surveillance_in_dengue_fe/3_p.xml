 <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] includes larval surveillance during the premonsoon and monsoon to find out the extent of prevalence of vectors in certain selected high risk localities/areas (from where dengue cases have been reported earlier). House index (percentage of houses positive for larvae of Aedes Aegypti), container index (percentage of water containers positive for Aedes breeding), and Breteau index (number of positive containers for Aedes Aegypti per 100 houses) are usually used. Adult mosquito surveillance will help in finding out the susceptibility status to insecticides. However, a single water container found positive for Aedes breeding warrants for immediate action for source reduction [
