<p id="Par6">The rich tradition of herbal medicine in China is also being deployed against COVID-19.

Boli Zhang, a leading traditional Chinese medicine expert advising on COVID-19 management, claims that such herbal medicines have been very useful in improving symptoms such as coughing, weakness and digestive system disorders as well as alleviating anxiety.
