human health and society. These infectious viruses have been identified as
hemorrhagic fever viruses (Lassa, Ebola), novel coronaviruses including severe
acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome
MERS-CoV), and highly pathogenic influenza. Coronaviruses (CoVs), as a class of
enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, cause various diseases in
humans. CoVs are subdivided into four groups: <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic>,
<italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> (&#x003b2;CoV),
<italic>Gammacoronavirus</italic>, and <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic>.
Two novel &#x003b2;CoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS- CoV) and
Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), have recently emerged and can
induce a high mortality. The current outbreak of novel coronavirus COVID-19
(HCoV-19 or SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO)
declaring this outbreak a global pandemic. By March 15, 2020, infected cases had
reached 81&#x0202f;048 in China and a total of 72&#x0202f;600 cases outside China
have been reported to the WHO from 146 countries and territories (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd">https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd</uri>).</p><p>Similar to the SARS-CoV, symptoms of COVID-19 infection at onset of the illness
include fever, myalgia, fatigue, and cough, and more than half of patients
developed dyspnoea. Some patients had radiographic ground-glass lung alterations,
and lower than average circulating lymphocyte and platelet populations. To date,
the global deaths reached 5746, and the fatality rate was estimated as 3.7% for
COVID-19 virus (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd">https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd</uri>),
which is lower than that of SARS-CoV (10%) or MERS-CoV (37%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup>
The major challenge of the coronavirus family and similar infectious agents is
that no effective drugs or vaccine are available, and it may take many months for
research and development.</p><p>Human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 occurs when individuals are in the incubation
stage or showing symptoms, while some individuals remain contagious while
remaining asymptomatic (superspreaders). Transmission is thought to occur via
touching infected surfaces (skin-to-skin, touching infected inanimate objects)
then mediating the COVID-19 infection through the mouth, nose, or eyes.
Transmission can also be through inhalation of exhaled virus in respiratory
droplets. It has been reported that infectious viruses, including coronavirus, can
survive for long periods outside of its host organism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup>
COVID-19 virus is thought to survive for several hours on surfaces such as
aluminum, sterile sponges, or latex surgical gloves, increasing the opportunity
for transmission via touch. Transmission via the inhalation of small, exhaled
respiratory droplets may occur as the aerosol droplets remain airborne for
prolonged periods, mediating long-range human-to-human transmission via air
movement. The relative contributions of large respiratory droplets, smaller
airborne aerosol, or direct surface contacts to the transmissibility of COVID-19
still need to be evaluated to enable a fully effective control of transmission and
infection.</p><p>Faecal transmission routes should also be considered, as the COVID-19 virus has been
positively detected in stool samples of infected patients. Studies have shown that
SARS-CoV can survival in stool samples for 4 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> In a
separate study, coronavirus was reported to remain infectious in water and sewage
for days to weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> At room temperature, in pure water, or
pasteurized settled sewage, researchers reported that time required for 99%
reduction of virus infectivity was several days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> This adds
another potential transmission route if the quality of personal hygiene is poor.
Infected stools in wastewater can generate further transmission routes through the
generation of virus-laden aerosols during wastewater flushing. It was reported
that a contaminated faulty sewage system in a high-rise housing estate in Hong
Kong in 2003 was linked to the SARS outbreak of a large number of residents living
in the surrounding buildings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Therefore, the role of the
aerosol from contaminated sewage in the transmission of COVID-19 should be
investigated.</p><p>A further transmission route could be via airborne dust. It is considered that
microorganisms in airborne particulate matters (PM) or dust is linked to
infectious diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> Poor nation-wide air pollution is
frequent in some developing countries, and the role of air PM and dust in the
transmission of COVID-19 infection remains uninvestigated. Inhalation of
virus-laden fine particles could transport the virus into deeper alveolar and
tracheobronchial regions, which could increase the chance of infective
transmission. Adsorption of the COVID-19 virus on airborne dust and PM could also
contribute to long-range transport of the virus Therefore, investigations on
adsorption, survival, and behavior of the COVID-19 virus with the surface of PM
are needed to help to understand the role of air PM pollution in COVID-19
transmission.</p><p>The extent to which the COVID-19 virus induces respiratory stress in infected
individuals may also be influenced by the extent to which an individual&#x02019;s
respiratory system is already compromised. The high levels of PM pollution in
China may increase the susceptibility of the population to more serious symptoms
and respiratory complications of the disease. In addition, oxidant pollutants in
air can impair the immune function and attenuate the efficiency of the lung to
clear the virus in lungs. The simultaneous inhalation of chemical pollutants in PM
alongside COVID-19 virus may also exacerbate the level of COVID-19 infection.
Pro-inflammation, injury, and fibrosis from inhaled PM combined with an immune
response or cytokine storm induced by COVID-19 infection could enhance the
infection severity. Larger numbers of patients displaying more serious infection
symptoms also created an increased risk of enhanced transmission potential.
Therefore, the mechanisms underlying the impact and modulation of air pollution on
COVID-19 severity and onward transmission warrant further investigation.</p><p>Taken together, the survival of the COVID-19 virus in different environmental media,
including water, PM, dust, and sewage under a variety of environmental parameters
warrants systematic investigation immediately. Levels of infectious virus in
environmental samples could be low, requiring high-sensitivity methods for precise
quantitation of COVID-19 virus to be developed. In the future, this novel
coronavirus may also become a seasonal infectious virus. The occurrence, survival,
and behavior of COVID-19 virus in environmental compartments should be determined,
requiring the development of high-throughput, automatic techniques for virus
monitoring. Meanwhile, to reduce the chance of infection, it is important to
develop practical methods for large-scale disinfection treatment of COVID-19 virus
in different environmental settings.</p><p>It is clear that the threat of COVID-19 outbreak is not limited to any single country
or region. The response, control, and prevention of novel infectious diseases
require strong and sustainable international collaborative work and data sharing.
Further research is imperative to fill the knowledge gaps on COVID-19. In addition
to expertise in the fields of medicine, public health, and computer science, the
contribution of environmental scientists in collaborative research is urgently
warranted for combating the infectious disease threat at a global scale.</p></body><back><notes notes-type="COI-statement" id="NOTES-d7e261-autogenerated"><p>The authors declare no competing financial interest.</p></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal" id="cit1"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name>; <name><surname>Horby</surname><given-names>P.
