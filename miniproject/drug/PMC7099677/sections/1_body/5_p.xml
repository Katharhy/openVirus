<p>The extent to which the COVID-19 virus induces respiratory stress in infected individuals may also be influenced by the extent to which an individualâ€™s respiratory system is already compromised. The high levels of PM pollution in China may increase the susceptibility of the population to more serious symptoms and respiratory complications of the disease. In addition, oxidant pollutants in air can impair the immune function and attenuate the efficiency of the lung to clear the virus in lungs. The simultaneous inhalation of chemical pollutants in PM alongside COVID-19 virus may also exacerbate the level of COVID-19 infection. Pro-inflammation, injury, and fibrosis from inhaled PM combined with an immune response or cytokine storm induced by COVID-19 infection could enhance the infection severity. Larger numbers of patients displaying more serious infection symptoms also created an increased risk of enhanced transmission potential. Therefore, the mechanisms underlying the impact and modulation of air pollution on COVID-19 severity and onward transmission warrant further investigation.</p>
