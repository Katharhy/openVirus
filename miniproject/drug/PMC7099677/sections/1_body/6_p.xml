<p>Taken together, the survival of the COVID-19 virus in different environmental media, including water, PM, dust, and sewage under a variety of environmental parameters warrants systematic investigation immediately. Levels of infectious virus in environmental samples could be low, requiring high-sensitivity methods for precise quantitation of COVID-19 virus to be developed. In the future, this novel coronavirus may also become a seasonal infectious virus. The occurrence, survival, and behavior of COVID-19 virus in environmental compartments should be determined, requiring the development of high-throughput, automatic techniques for virus monitoring. Meanwhile, to reduce the chance of infection, it is important to develop practical methods for large-scale disinfection treatment of COVID-19 virus in different environmental settings.</p>
