<p>A further transmission route could be via airborne dust. It is considered that microorganisms in airborne particulate matters (PM) or dust is linked to infectious diseases.

 </sup> Poor nation-wide air pollution is frequent in some developing countries, and the role of air PM and dust in the transmission of COVID-19 infection remains uninvestigated. Inhalation of virus-laden fine particles could transport the virus into deeper alveolar and tracheobronchial regions, which could increase the chance of infective transmission. Adsorption of the COVID-19 virus on airborne dust and PM could also contribute to long-range transport of the virus Therefore, investigations on adsorption, survival, and behavior of the COVID-19 virus with the surface of PM are needed to help to understand the role of air PM pollution in COVID-19 transmission.
