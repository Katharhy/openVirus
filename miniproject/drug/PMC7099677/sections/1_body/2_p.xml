<p>Human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 occurs when individuals are in the incubation stage or showing symptoms, while some individuals remain contagious while remaining asymptomatic (superspreaders). Transmission is thought to occur via touching infected surfaces (skin-to-skin, touching infected inanimate objects) then mediating the COVID-19 infection through the mouth, nose, or eyes. Transmission can also be through inhalation of exhaled virus in respiratory droplets. It has been reported that infectious viruses, including coronavirus, can survive for long periods outside of its host organism.

 </sup> COVID-19 virus is thought to survive for several hours on surfaces such as aluminum, sterile sponges, or latex surgical gloves, increasing the opportunity for transmission via touch. Transmission via the inhalation of small, exhaled respiratory droplets may occur as the aerosol droplets remain airborne for prolonged periods, mediating long-range human-to-human transmission via air movement. The relative contributions of large respiratory droplets, smaller airborne aerosol, or direct surface contacts to the transmissibility of COVID-19 still need to be evaluated to enable a fully effective control of transmission and infection.
