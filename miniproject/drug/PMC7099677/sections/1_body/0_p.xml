<p>In the last two decades, the emergence of viral epidemics poses great threats to human health and society. These infectious viruses have been identified as hemorrhagic fever viruses (Lassa, Ebola), novel coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS-CoV), and highly pathogenic influenza. Coronaviruses (CoVs), as a class of enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, cause various diseases in humans. CoVs are subdivided into four groups: 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> (βCoV), 
 <italic>Gammacoronavirus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic>. Two novel βCoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS- CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), have recently emerged and can induce a high mortality. The current outbreak of novel coronavirus COVID-19 (HCoV-19 or SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring this outbreak a global pandemic. By March 15, 2020, infected cases had reached 81 048 in China and a total of 72 600 cases outside China have been reported to the WHO from 146 countries and territories (
