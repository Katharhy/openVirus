<p>Faecal transmission routes should also be considered, as the COVID-19 virus has been positively detected in stool samples of infected patients. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV can survival in stool samples for 4 days.

 </sup> In a separate study, coronavirus was reported to remain infectious in water and sewage for days to weeks.

 </sup> At room temperature, in pure water, or pasteurized settled sewage, researchers reported that time required for 99% reduction of virus infectivity was several days.

 </sup> This adds another potential transmission route if the quality of personal hygiene is poor. Infected stools in wastewater can generate further transmission routes through the generation of virus-laden aerosols during wastewater flushing. It was reported that a contaminated faulty sewage system in a high-rise housing estate in Hong Kong in 2003 was linked to the SARS outbreak of a large number of residents living in the surrounding buildings.

 </sup> Therefore, the role of the aerosol from contaminated sewage in the transmission of COVID-19 should be investigated.
