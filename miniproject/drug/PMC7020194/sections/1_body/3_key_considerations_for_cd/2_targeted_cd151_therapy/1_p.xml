<p>Given the role of CD151 in a milieu of processes that contribute to lung disease pathophysiology, targeting CD151 in a clinical setting is justifiable. The most commonly reported method of targeting CD151 is with anti-CD151 monoclonal antibodies. Treatment with these antibodies has been shown to impair cellular processes at multiple cancer stages. Tumor growth potential, neoangiogenesis and metastasis following injection with a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line was also inhibited in mice that were treated with mAb 9B, which was shown to specifically disrupt the interaction between CD151 with integrin α6β1 (
