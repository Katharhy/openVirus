<p>Cluster of Differentiation 151 was first identified as a platelet surface glycoprotein, gp27, where it was found to induce platelet aggregation and mediator release (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Ashman et al., 1991</xref>). Following successful cloning of the cDNA encoding gp27, it was shown to belong to the transmembrane 4 superfamily, tetraspans, and renamed Platelet-Endothelial cell Tetra-span Antigen-3 (PETA-3) (

The following year, another team independently identified the same protein but named it protein SFA-1 as it was induced by a T-cell leukemia cell line, SF-HT. The protein was subsequently reassigned as Cluster of Differentiation 151 (CD151) (
