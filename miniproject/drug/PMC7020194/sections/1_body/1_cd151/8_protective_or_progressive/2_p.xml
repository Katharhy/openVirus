<p>Interestingly, CD151-null mice spontaneously developed pulmonary fibrosis features observed at 30 weeks and exhibited accelerated bleomycin-induced lung injury in the pulmonary fibrosis model, suggesting a protective role of CD151 in IPF. This was attributed to the critical function of CD151 in maintaining AECs integrity, and that CD151 deletion attenuates AECs adhesion to the basement membrane, upregulates transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) signaling in AECs and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition changes. In support of this, CD151-negative AECs were focally observed in lung biopsies from IPF patients. However, it is unclear if the IPF phenotype observed in CD151-null mice is strain-specific as differences in renal function in tumor formation (
