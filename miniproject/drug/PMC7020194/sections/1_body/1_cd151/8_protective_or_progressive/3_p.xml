<p>In contrast to the report above describing the protective role of CD151 in IPF, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Fujishima et al. (2010)</xref> proposed that interactions between CD151 and MMP-7 (for which expression is elevated in IPF patients) could contribute to worsening of IPF condition. They show that CD151 facilitates MMP-7 activation by acting as a docking molecule (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Shiomi et al., 2005</xref>) and was colocalized with pro-MMP-7 in sections of lung tissue from IPF patients. However, CD151 levels in these IPF patient samples were not directly measured in this study (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Fujishima et al., 2010</xref>). In support, CD151 has been implicated in other fibrotic processes, such as liver fibrosis and skin wound healing (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Mazzocca et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Geary et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, more studies are warranted to clearly define the role of CD151 in fibrosis in general and IPF more specifically.
