<p>In NSCLC, several studies have shown that CD151 overexpression, measured by gene expression and immunohistochemical analysis, is associated with poorer prognosis in terms of survival rate (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Kwon et al., 2013</xref>). Exosome protein profiling comparing a cohort of lung cancer patients with non-cancer patients revealed that CD151 was one of the markers found to be upregulated in lung cancer (

This study showed that whilst CD151 expression was detected on structural or immune cells, these cells also secreted CD151-containing exosomes in circulation to act as components for crosstalk between cancer initiating cells and their environment (
