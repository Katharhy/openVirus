<p>Use of gene deletion technology and/or use of monoclonal antibodies directed at CD151 have been employed to explore the functional significance of CD151. In lung cancer cells, CD151 knockdown resulted in impairment of several cancer-promoting processes including cell survival, migration, invasion, and matrix adhesion. These changes were mainly due to CD151 interaction with partner or associated proteins such as integrin α3β1 (
