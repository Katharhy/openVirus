<p>Expression of CD51 is clinically relevant to asthma as immunohistochemical analysis of human bronchial biopsy specimens for CD151 expression in airway smooth muscle bundles were highest in mild or moderate asthma subjects compared with non-asthmatic subjects (

In the same study, CD151 was implicated to play a role in airways hyperresponsiveness â€“ loss- and gain-of-function studies showed that CD151 enhances G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-induced calcium and protein kinase C signaling, which are key signaling pathways implicated in airway smooth muscle cell contraction. In support, CD151-null mice did not exhibit increased airway reactivity to contractile agonists and were shown to have increased lung compliance compared to the wild-type group (

This study is significant as it provides a better understanding of the mechanism for airways hyperresponsiveness which may help in the design of more efficacious and emerging therapies for asthma. What remains to be determined is whether high CD151 expression is a result of asthma or whether elevated expression of CD151 results in asthma. Furthermore, the impact of CD151 on the remaining key features of asthma, airway wall remodeling, and airway inflammation, is yet to be established.
