<p>The role of CD151 in normal lung physiology is not fully explored but inferences about its critical role can be made from clinical cases of CD151 gene mutation and from studies in mice where CD151 is deleted. With regards to clinical cases of CD151 gene mutation, there have been six reported case studies of patients with CD151 gene mutations resulting in truncated or altered forms of the protein. Nephropathy was reported in four of the cases as well as epidermolysis bullosa and sensorineural deafness in two cases (

 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Vahidnezhad et al., 2018</xref>). The remaining two cases, with a single base substitution, exhibited no significant clinical outcomes (

Differences in lung function or morphology were not reported in these patients â€“ whether genetic mutations of CD151 had no effect on lung physiology and therefore it was not reported, or whether the investigators did not look at other organ phenotypes is not known. In CD151-null mice, several studies have recapitulated the significant role of CD151 in kidney, skin and inner ear function (

 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Tsujino et al. (2012)</xref> reported that CD151 is essential for the normal function of alveolar epithelial cells (APCs) as the deletion of CD151 in APCs resulted in the loss of epithelial integrity (loss of epithelial adhesion to the basement membrane). In addition, there were increases in collagen deposition, collagen-1 expression and hydroxyproline content in the lungs of the CD151-null mice and lung compliance was also reduced in these mice as compared to wildtype control mice. The authors concluded that CD151 functions to protect against pulmonary fibrosis by maintaining epithelial integrity.
