<p>Besides these reports, findings from other groups may be informative in understanding the physiological role of CD151. Treatment with anti-CD151 antibody resulted in the loss of epithelial integrity in skin epithelial cells (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Shigeta et al., 2003</xref>) whilst CD151 knockdown was shown to disrupt integrin-mediated adhesion to the basement membrane (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">Yamada et al., 2008</xref>). Both these processes are crucial for the development and maintenance of lung structure. Given the strong interaction between CD151 and its laminin-binding partners, defects in bronchi morphogenesis and lung deficiencies observed with the deletion of integrin α3β1 (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Kreidberg et al., 1996</xref>) and laminin-α5 (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen et al., 2002</xref>), respectively, cannot be overlooked and further studies have to be conducted to conclusively determine whether the physiological conditions observed are a direct consequence of CD151 dysregulation or a secondary effect of CD151 due to disruption of its laminin-binding partners.
