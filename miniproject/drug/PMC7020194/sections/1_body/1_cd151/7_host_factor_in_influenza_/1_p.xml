<p>An estimated 5% of adults develop influenza symptoms annually with severe cases leading to conditions such as bronchitis and pneumonia. These seasonal epidemics are largely due to influenza viruses A and B. Influenza viruses are segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses within a lipid envelope containing the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase – involved in viral entry and progeny release, respectively (

In addition, CD151-null mice were more resistant and tolerant to IAV infection with higher survival rates as compared to the wild-type infected mice. With regards to respiratory infection, the anti-viral responses were attributed to CD151 mediating the export of progeny viruses through its binding to newly synthesized viral proteins (NP, M1, and NEP) and host nuclear export protein (CRM1). The novel action of CD151 on viral nuclear export signaling associated with H3N2 and H1N1 infection (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Qiao et al., 2018</xref>) highlights the potential of CD151 to be developed as a novel therapy to treat influenza and other viral infections. Targeting CD151 is especially beneficial given that it targets a host mechanism thus making it less susceptible to constant changes in viral strains – due to antigenic shift and antigenic drift – that render current antiviral drugs or vaccines ineffective after each season.
