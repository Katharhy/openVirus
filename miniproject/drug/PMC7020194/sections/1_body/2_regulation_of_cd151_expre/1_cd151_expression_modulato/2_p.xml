<p>Besides drug-induced regulation, hypoxic conditions were shown to regulate CD151 expression and subsequently cell adhesion and metastasis. Hypoxia is the condition of oxygen deficiency and is a major driver of cancer-promoting processes such as angiogenesis and migration. Hypoxia is mainly mediated through hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) (

HIF-1α dependency was further confirmed when CD151 levels were inhibited by HIF-1α induction through treatment with desferrioxamine (hypoxia-mimetic agent) or overexpression with plasmid vectors (
