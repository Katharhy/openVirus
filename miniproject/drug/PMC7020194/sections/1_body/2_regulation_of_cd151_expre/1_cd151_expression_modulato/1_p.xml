<p>Given the importance of CD151 in respiratory diseases, it is interesting to note that little is known about regulators of CD151 expression changes. To date, there are only two studies that report that the expression of CD151 mRNA and protein abundance are modulated by therapies â€“ anti-epileptic drugs and anti-cancer drugs, respectively (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Hwang et al., 2019</xref>). The study conducted by 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Hua et al. (2001)</xref> showed that chronic administration of the anti-epileptic drugs, carbamazepine or valproate, significantly decreased CD151 transcript levels in rat frontal cortex following chronic (five-week) treatment. The functional significance of this reduction was not explored in this study and there have been no followup studies to date by this group or others. In contrast to that, a recent study by 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Hwang et al. (2019)</xref> showed that several anti-cancer drugs (gefitinib, lapatinib, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, camptothecin, and 5-fluorouracil) induced CD151 protein levels in A431 skin epidermoid carcinoma cells. They further showed that gefitinib upregulated CD151 protein levels in MDA-MB-231 breast and A549 lung carcinoma cell lines, respectively. In this study, the group showed that anti-cancer drug resistance may in part be attributed to CD151 upregulation, for which CD151 knockdown sensitized the cells to drug treatment. It remains to be seen whether these effects could be translated to
