<p>Whilst CD151 expression modulation plays a critical role in determining disease progression, whether in promoting pathophysiology of lung cancer, asthma, and influenza or in potentially protecting against IPF, there is a distinct gap in the literature pertaining to the mechanisms underlying these changes. In the study reporting CD151 mRNA downregulation after treatment with anti-epileptic drugs, valproate and carbamazepine (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Hua et al., 2001</xref>), there were no experiments conducted to explain gene expression changes or whether downstream protein expression was affected. Whereas in the anti-cancer drug-induced CD151 study (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Hwang et al., 2019</xref>), the authors ruled out integrin dependence and proposed that CD151 upregulation may be due to diminished protein degradation. However, there are no reports to date to corroborate this proposal.
