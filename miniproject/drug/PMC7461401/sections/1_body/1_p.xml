<p>Although at least three quarters of young people with self‐harm do not access mental health services (Ystgaard et al., 
 <xref rid="camh12411-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), severe self‐harm is a common cause of inpatient admissions. There has been a significant increase in the number of psychiatric inpatient admissions in England between 2008 and 2018 which then plateaued and started to decrease in 2019 (NHSEngland, 
 <xref rid="camh12411-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). The reasons for this recent reduction could be complex; however, a rapid expansion of intensive community care services may have been a deciding factor. Lengthy inpatient admissions for young people with self‐harm, although sometimes needed, have been linked with an increase in self‐harm (Ougrin et al., 
 <xref rid="camh12411-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>, 
 <xref rid="camh12411-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Reavey et al.,
