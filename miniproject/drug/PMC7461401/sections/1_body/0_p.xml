<p>Suicide is the second leading cause of death in young people in most developed countries, exceeded only by accidents. Self‐harm is one of the strongest known predictors of suicide (Hawton et al., 
 <xref rid="camh12411-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Both suicide and self‐harm in young people have been rising in the UK, and, in recent years, social media has been playing a prominent role in the way young people communicate about self‐harm (Sedgwick et al.,

Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) presentations with self‐harm have seen a particularly sharp increase before the COVID‐19 lockdown, and the number of young people seeking help for self‐harm has also increased in primary care (Morgan et al.,

There has also been an increase in the number of young people reporting self‐harm in surveys of the general population, especially older girls. These increases in self‐harm have been paralleled by increases in suicide in older teenagers (15–19‐year‐olds), rising from 4.1 to 6.7/100,000 between 2010 and 2018 (ONS,
