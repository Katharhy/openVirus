<p>The lower incidence of A&amp;E presentations with psychiatric symptoms, including self‐harm among this age group, not compensated for by an increase in the number of inpatient admissions is significant. It is potentially due to the quarantine measures. Of importance, many children and adolescents stopped going to school in March and April 2020 and the pressure to perform during the examination periods was reduced. In addition, many young people are likely to have stayed at home more often, interacting with their parents and feeling part of a family more than before. Many young people may have had fewer opportunities to engage in face‐to‐face encounters associated with increased risk of self‐harm and worsening of psychiatric disorders, such as face‐to‐face bullying, using drugs and alcohol and engaging in risky behaviour. Although some evidence indicates that common mental health disorders, especially emotional disorders are becoming more common during the periods of epidemics and that some young people might be at greater risk of violence and abuse at home, the numbers affected might be relatively low. Exposure to digital media and its potential impact on children and adolescents’ mental health is the centre of continued media debate. Such technologies can be helpful and facilitate access to care and support, but there is also a suggestion that extreme 'connectedness' could have detrimental effects. The most plausible explanation for our findings could be that the marked decrease in incidence observed reflects both a true decline in incidence together with less frequent help‐seeking behaviour. This could mean that a significant number of young people with severe psychiatric symptoms and self‐harm are not seeking help.</p>
