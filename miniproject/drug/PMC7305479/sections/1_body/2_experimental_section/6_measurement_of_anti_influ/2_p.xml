<p>Cell cultures were washed with media, and experimental drug solutions (100 µL per well) were applied to them at the appropriate concentrations, followed by incubation for 1 h in the dark (CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator, 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>). Virus (in a volume of 100 µL) was then added, followed by incubation for 24 h (37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>). At the end of the incubation period, 10-fold serial dilutions (10
 <sup>–1</sup>–10
 <sup>–7</sup>) were prepared from each sample in support medium. These were applied to 1‑day-old monolayers and then incubated for 72 h (37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>). Viral titers were determined by hemagglutination reaction. For this, culture medium was transferred to the appropriate wells of multi-well plates (U-bottom, immunology grade), and an equal volume of chicken red blood cell suspension (1% in physiological saline) was added. After 40 minutes, the presence or absence of hemagglutination in the wells was visually assessed. Viral titers were calculated using the Reed and Mench method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and expressed as 50% tissue infection doses (TID
 <sub>50</sub>) per 100 µL volume. Drug antiviral activities were estimated based on decreased viral titers in relation to controls.
