<p>MDCK cell culture and influenza virus strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) were used in the study. Drugs were dissolved in DMSO (2000 Âµg/mL) and diluted in culture medium to a concentration corresponding to CC
 <sub>50</sub> (the drug concentration causing 50% cell death). Following that, a series of 3-fold dilutions were prepared from this solution. A virus dilution (corresponding to multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) = 1) was prepared using culture media.
