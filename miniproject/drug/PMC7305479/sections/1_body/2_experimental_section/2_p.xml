 <bold>-Triisobutyryluridine (VI).</bold> To a solution of uridine (5.00 g, 20.48 mmol) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (20 mg) in dried pyridine (35 mL), isobutyric anhydride (10.2 mL, 61.43 mmol) was added at once. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h, diluted with methanol (5 mL), and evaporated in a vacuum. The residue was dissolved in dichloromethane (200 mL), and washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub> (2 × 150 mL) and brine (150 mL). The organic phase was dried with Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, filtered, and evaporated in a vacuum. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (0 → 2% methanol in dichloromethane, (vol)), and compound (
 <bold>VI</bold>) (7.72 g, 83%) was obtained as a white foam.
