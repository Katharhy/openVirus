<p>Although they cause less mortality than the influenza virus, the parainfluenza (PIV) and respiratory syncytial (RSV) viruses are nevertheless dangerous. High-risk patients (preschool children, the elderly, persons with immune disorders) are especially vulnerable. There are no etiotropic drugs to treat illness caused by these pathogens, only symptomatic treatments. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new, effective means of respiratory virus control. Preparations featuring entirely new mechanisms of action, relative to existing drugs, are of special interest.</p>
