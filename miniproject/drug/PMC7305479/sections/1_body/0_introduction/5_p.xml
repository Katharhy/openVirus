<p>Previously, we found that perylene derivatives of uracil nucleosides 
 <bold>dUY11</bold> (
 <bold>I</bold>) and 
 <bold>aUY11</bold> (
 <bold>II</bold>) are highly active against a broad spectrum of enveloped viruses: herpes simplex type 1 and type 2; Sindbis; hepatitis C; vesicular stomatitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; tick-borne encephalitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]; African swine fever [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; and the influenza A virus serotypes H1N1 and H3N2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Despite the formal nucleoside structure, there is evidence in favor of a ‘non-nucleoside’ mechanism of antiviral action of substances (
 <bold>I</bold>) and (
 <bold>II</bold>). Two main hypotheses have been proposed: (1) introduction of the drug into the virion lipid membrane causing mechanical disturbance of its rheological properties, which, in turn, leads to inhibition of penetration of viral genetic material into the cell (of the act of fusion of virion and cell lipid membranes) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; (2) drug-mediated photosensitized generation of singlet oxygen, oxidizing unsaturated lipids in virion membrane, which has no systems for membrane reparation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Both hypotheses explain the broad spectrum activity of perylene derivatives against enveloped viruses, have consensus on the target (virion outer lipid membrane), and imply pharmacophoric importance of the perylene part of the molecule. Indeed, the carbohydrate fragment in such compounds is not a necessary precondition for antiviral activity. Recently, we have demonstrated the activity of a non-nucleoside derivative of 
 <bold>cm1pUY11</bold> (
 <bold>III</bold>) against enveloped viruses herpes simplex type 1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and tick-borne encephalitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Thus, the lipid nature of the proposed antiviral target of perylene derivatives fundamentally distinguishes them from the three aforementioned groups of influenza drugs.
