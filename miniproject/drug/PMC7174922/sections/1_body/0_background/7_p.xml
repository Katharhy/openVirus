<p id="Par19">RdRps are considered among primary targets for antiviral drug development, against a wide variety of viruses. Some RdRp inhibitors have been considered to target SARS-CoV-2: Favipiravir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], Galidesivir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], Remdesivir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and Ribavirin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Interestingly, the docking site is not located in proximity to the catalytic domain of the RdRp [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In addition, other possible drugs such as Filibuvir, Cepharanthine, Simeprevir and Tegobuvir, are predicted to be potential inhibitors of RdRp [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Naturally occurring mutations in critical residues for drug efficacy can lead to drug resistance phenomena, with a significant loss in the binding affinity of these molecules to the RdRp.
