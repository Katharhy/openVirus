<p id="Par38">The distribution between the two groups in terms of number of mutations is statistically relevant (Fisher-Exact test, 
 <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.001). In particular, group 1 and 2 are significantly different in terms of the distribution of genomes having 0, 1, 3 and 4 numbers of mutations (Fisher-Exact test, p &lt; 0.001) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This difference, instead, is insignificant when the number of mutations is 2, 5 or 6.
