<p id="Par32">Moreover, a different pattern of hotspot mutations is clearly distinguishable in viral genomes detected in North American patients starting from March 2020, when the outbreak of positive cases was reported in the US and Canada. In this group, three novel mutations (17746, 17857 and 18060â€“light blue, purple and light pink, respectively) were reported. Interestingly, viral genomes present in North American patients carrying RdRp mutation (14%) do not carry any of the European specific mutations.</p>
