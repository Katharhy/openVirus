  <p>Number of SARS-CoV-2 mutations associated with the RdRp mutation. Genomes were subdivided into two groups: group 1 contains genomes with mutation in position 14408 (RdRp) (n = 53, 4 North America and 49 European), and group 2 without RdRp mutation (n = 84). We further subdivided group 1 and 2 by the number of mutations present in the genome. Genomes in group 1 (red bars) showed an increased number of mutations compared to group 2 (grey bars). Most genomes of groups 1 (86.8%) have at least 3 or 4 mutations, whereas 76.2% of genomes of group 2 have less than 2 mutations. We found that viral strains with RdRp mutation have a median of 3 point mutations [range: 2–5], whereas viral strains with no RdRp mutation have a median of 1 mutation [range: 0–3] (p value &lt; 0.001, Mann–Whitney test)</p>
