  <p>Schematic representation of the role of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV) papain-like protease (PLP) role during infection. The figure represents the early roles of SARS-CoV PLP during the replication phase. The replicase/transcription complex (RTC), is coded by two open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, that, with a ribosomal frame-shift mechanism, allow for the translation of two polyproteins (pps): pp1a and pp1ab. Pps are in turn constituted by 16 non-structural proteins (nsp), 1-11 for pp1a and 1-16 for pp1ab. SARS-Cov PLP is encoded within nsp3 and is responsible for the cleavage of the N-terminal portion of pps, cutting the bonds between nsp1/2, nsp2/3 and nsp3/4.</p>
