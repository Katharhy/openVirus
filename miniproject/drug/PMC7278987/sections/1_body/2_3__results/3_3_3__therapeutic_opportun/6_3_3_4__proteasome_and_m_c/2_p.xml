<p>However, a mechanism has been proposed by other authors, who exclude proteasome inhibition and link MG132 antiviral activity to m-calpain (a cysteine protease) inhibition, suggesting that viral cysteine proteases, such as PLP, are possible targets of this drug. Even more promising results were obtained in vitro when the calpain specific inhibitor MDL28170 was used [
