<p>Several in vitro studies support the idea that PLP inhibitors may be effective in reducing coronaviruses infection. For instance, a recent work evaluated the effects on SARS-CoV by substituting its native PLP with the one derived from a bat SARS-related CoV. Interestingly, the obtained SARS-CoV replicated 10.3-fold less than the wild type in human airway epithelial cells, but showed no differences in non IFN competent cells [
