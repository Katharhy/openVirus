<p>In summary, these three mouse models may confirm in vivo the previously described individual roles of PLPs enzymatic activities in the pathogenesis of coronaviruses infections and give some promising insights on targeting PLPs as an antiviral strategy. However, thus far, the evidence of the therapeutic efficacy of targeting PLP in vivo remains questionable. The first study gave positive results in a SARS-adapted mouse model, but only a single compound was investigated, while the second did not consider the inhibition of PLP in vivo and gave insights on its pathogenic role. The third study was specifically aimed to investigate the role of the DUB activity of PLPs, rather than to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of targeting PLPs. As far as we are aware, the number of in vivo studies on PLPs is limited. Therefore, in vivo, therapeutic-oriented, studies in more reliable models, such as those developed for SARS and MERS, are strongly recommended [
