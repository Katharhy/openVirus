<p>In addition to the above-described roles of PLPs enzymatic activities, other authors have demonstrated further effects on the infection pathogenesis. The SARS-CoV PLP has been shown to complex with SUD (SARS-unique domain) and stabilize the p53 E3 ligase RCHY1, leading to subsequent ubiquitination and the degradation of p53, thus resulting in a decrease of p53 mediated antiviral activity, similar to other human CoVs PLPs.
