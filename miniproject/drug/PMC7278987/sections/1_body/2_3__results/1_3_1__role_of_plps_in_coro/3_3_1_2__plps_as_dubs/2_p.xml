<p>Coronaviruses infections, such as SARS, generally include a dysregulation of the immune system in their pathogenic features at systemic level [

 <xref rid="B29-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Indeed, early research has shown that active SARS-CoV replication does not stimulate INFs production in cell culture [
 <xref rid="B30-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Since it is known that cellular antiviral pathways include (de)ubiquitination within their regulatory mechanisms [

 <xref rid="B15-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], PLPs are believed to contribute to infection pathogenesis by using their intrinsic DUB and deISGylating activities to antagonize the activation of the host cell innate immune response [
 <xref rid="B5-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Specifically, PLPs use their DUB activity to interfere with the proteins that mediate the intracellular sensing and signaling of viral infection, therefore leading to a dysregulation of the immune pathways, such as the IRF3 and NF-kB pathways, that in turn, results in a decrease in the antiviral response. The DUB activity of PLPs is usually broad spectrum and not selective for specific ubiquitin linkage types, such as K48 or K63 [

 <xref rid="B33-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Since DUB activity was first hypothesized as an important component of SARS-CoV PLP in 2005 [
 <xref rid="B34-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], a number of studies investigating the DUB activity of coronaviruses PLPs and their effects on host cell innate immunity have been performed [
