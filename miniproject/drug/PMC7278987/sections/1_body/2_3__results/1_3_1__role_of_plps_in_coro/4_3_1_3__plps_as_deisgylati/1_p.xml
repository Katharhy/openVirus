<p>Once translated, type I IFNs activate the JAK-STAT pathway through the IFNs receptors via an autocrine and paracrine mechanism. This subsequently leads to the expression of a plethora of ISGs, either effectors, regulators or both, that embody the antiviral response [
 <xref rid="B46-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. ISG15 is a small Ub-like peptide that can be covalently attached to proteins by a three enzymes process, similar to Ub conjugation. During viral infections, ISGylation seems to target a high number of proteins at the translational level, either as an activating or inhibitory signal, while free ISG15 can also act as a cytokine [
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The large number of potential targets in multiple signaling cascades makes its role difficult to delineate, however it is clear that it acts as an effector and a modulator of the antiviral response [
 <xref rid="B17-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. ISGylation can antagonize the formation of viral molecular complexes required for replication, activate molecules involved in immune pathways and act as a negative feedback for upstream factors. Interestingly, ISG15 deficiency in mice leads to increased and often deadly viral infections, but in humans seems to involve increased susceptibility to
