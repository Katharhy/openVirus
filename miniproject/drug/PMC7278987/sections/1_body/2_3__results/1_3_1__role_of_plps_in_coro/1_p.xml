The multifunctional activities of PLPs, namely as cysteine proteases, DUBs and deISGylating enzymes, play two important roles in coronavirus pathogenesis: the first involves the production of non-structural proteins (nsp) required for the replication process and the second consists of blocking the innate immune system of the infected host cell.
