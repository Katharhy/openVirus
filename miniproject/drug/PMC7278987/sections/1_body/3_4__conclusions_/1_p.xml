<p>In summary, coronaviruses PLPs are multifunctional enzymes with cysteine protease, DUB and deISGylating activities that contribute significantly to infection pathogenesis. The efficacy of targeting PLPs as an antiviral therapy is demonstrated, at least in vitro, with further in vivo studies strongly recommended. Several compounds, both clinical and preclinical, have documented actions against these proteins, and thus may provide an attractive therapeutic strategy for COVID-19.</p>
