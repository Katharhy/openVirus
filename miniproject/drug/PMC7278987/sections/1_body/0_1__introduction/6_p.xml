 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family member codes for DUBs, named viral papain-like proteases (PLPs), which remove ubiquitin from target proteins and alter cellular pathways important for infection. Some members encode two, but, SARS, MERS CoVs and the novel SARS-CoV2 [
 <xref rid="B3-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] only encode one, named SARS-CoV PLP, MERS-CoV PLP and SARS-CoV2 PLP respectively. For many coronaviruses, viral PLPs have been studied extensively and shown to play a crucial role during viral infection of the host cell. These enzymes are multifunctional and in addition to their DUB activity, also containing intrinsic cysteine protease and deISGylating activity that are required for viral replication and the evasion of host responses [
