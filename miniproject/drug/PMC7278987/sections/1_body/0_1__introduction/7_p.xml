<p>The deISGylating activity of PLPs is similar to DUB activity and involves deconjugating interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG)-15 moieties from tagged proteins. ISG15 is a small Ub-like peptide that can be covalently attached to target proteins in a mechanism similar to Ub, resulting in a large number of regulatory effects. ISG15 is largely stimulated during antiviral responses, and although its broad functions are not fully elucidated, it acts as an effector and a regulator of the host cells innate immune response during viral infections [
