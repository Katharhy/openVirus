<p>A pneumonia of unknown cause was detected in Wuhan, People’s Republic of China and first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) Country Office on 31 December 2019. The pathogen was subsequently discovered to be a novel coronavirus (CoV) and named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV2, based on sequence similarity with members of the β-coronavirus family, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, two highly pathogenic coronaviruses responsible for previous epidemics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome, respectively [

 <xref rid="B4-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Genomes of coronaviruses are typically organized with a certain degree of similarity, suggesting analogous pathogenic mechanisms. Other human coronaviruses include the NL63, 229E, OC43 and HKU1, which are usually responsible for common colds and/or other respiratory infections in children and older or immunocompromised individuals [
