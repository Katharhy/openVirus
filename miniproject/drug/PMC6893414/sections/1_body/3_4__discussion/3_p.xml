<p>Ery-Est, one of the macrolide antibiotics, can block the protein synthesis of bacteria and is mainly used for 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> infection and other diverse bacillosis [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, the anti-ZIKV effects of Ery-Est had not been previously evaluated at the time of our study. Besides, some macrolide antibiotics, such as azithromycin and ivermectin, have been previously found to effectively inhibit ZIKV infection. Moreover, azithromycin was reported to not only inhibit ZIKV in vitro, but also to prevent ZIKV-induced lethality in the suckling mouse model [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f003">Figure 3</xref>B), probably caused by different effects on viral particles and host cells due to their different structures. Further research about why macrolide antibiotics exhibit different inhibitory mechanisms against ZIKV is needed. As the effective macrolides with diverse characteristics and advantages are constantly discovered [
