<p>In our study, Ery-Est was demonstrated to inhibit ZIKV infection in a dose-dependent manner in plaque assay (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B). It was also shown that Ery-Est could still suppress viral growth and exhibit inhibitory activity against ZIKV infection even with relatively higher viral dose (
