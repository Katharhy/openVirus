<p>In our study, besides the inhibitory activity against different ZIKV strains, Ery-Est was also demonstrated to potently inhibit other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including DENV and YFV. This presents an opportunity for clinical applications to patients, who may suffer co-infections by ZIKV and DENV, in epidemic areas where the viral vector, 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, is prevalent. Moreover, it was reported that preexisting DENV antibodies may aggravate the ZIKV infection through an antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect [

 <xref rid="B55-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], the phenomenon in which certain antibodies promote the entry of some heterogeneous viruses into host cells [
