<p>To determine the ready-to-use inhibitors for ZIKV infection, we screened a drug library consisting of FDA-approved medical drugs with good safety, and erythromycin estolate (Ery-Est), which could be safely used by pregnant women, was found to inhibit ZIKV infection efficiently. Ery-Est, one of the macrolide antibiotics, is the lauryl sulfate ester of propionyl erythromycin (Ery) (

Besides, some macrolide antibiotics have been studied to treat a wide spectrum of viruses. For example, clarithromycin and the macrolide therapy have been utilized to treat respiratory syncytial virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection respectively, and ivermectin and azithromycin (Azi) were identified to effectively inhibit ZIKV infection [

 <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the anti-ZIKV activity of Ery-Est has been reported. Its antiviral effects in vitro and in vivo were also investigated in the present study. Furthermore, we explored the inhibitory mechanism of Ery-Est against ZIKV.
