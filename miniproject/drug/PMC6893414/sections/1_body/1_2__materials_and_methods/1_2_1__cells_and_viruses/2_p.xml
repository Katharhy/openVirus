<p>Three ZIKV strains, SZ01 (GenBank: KU866423), FLR (GenBank: KU820897.5), and MR766 (GenBank: LC002520), were used in this study. SZ01 was originally isolated from a patient who returned from Samoa [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Both FLR, isolated from the blood of a human in Colombia [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and MR766, isolated from a sentinel monkey in Uganda in 1947 [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], were obtained from ATCC. YFV strain 17D was obtained from Beijing Tiantan Biological products, Ltd. and prepared as previously described [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. DENV II strain New Guinea C was kindly provided by Zhigang Song at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. The ZIKV strains SZ01 (passage 6–8), MR766 (passage 4–6) and FLR (passage 4–6), DENV II strain New Guinea C (passage 5–7), and YFV strain 17D (passage 5–7) were used in the experiments. Besides the ZIKV strain SZ01 prepared in Vero cells (V-ZIKV), all flaviviruses used in this study were propagated in C6/36 cells.
