<p>For the drug screen, equal volume of ZIKV strain SZ01 (100 PFU/mL) and compounds diluted in serum-free DMEM at the final concentration of 10 µM were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. BHK21 cells (2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>) were infected with compounds-treated ZIKV at 37 °C for 12 h, followed by replacing the viral supernatant with fresh DMEM containing 2% FBS. When the ZIKV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) was obvious, CCK8 was used to detect the antiviral activity of compounds according to the instruction manual.
