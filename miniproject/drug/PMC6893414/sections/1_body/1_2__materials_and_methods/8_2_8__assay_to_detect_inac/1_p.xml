<p>Inactivated virions were separated and detected as previously described [

 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Simply, 100 µL Ery-Est and Ery were serially diluted and mixed with 100 µL viruses (500 PFU). After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, 50% PEG-8000 (Amersco) and 5 M NaCl were added to the mixture at the final concentration of 10% and 0.67 M respectively, and followed by the incubation on ice for 2 h. Then, the treated viruses were centrifuged for 1 h at 20,200 
 <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the free drugs was removed, and the pellet containing viral particles was washed by 3% PEG-8000 in PBS containing 10 mg/ mL BSA (Amresco, West Chester, PA, USA). After centrifugation, the viruses in the pellet were resuspended in DMEM and the infectivity of viral particles was detected by plaque assay.
