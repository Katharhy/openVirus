<p>ZIKV (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU) with 100 µM Ery-Est, Ery, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% DMSO treatments respectively or without treatment were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Then, the treated or untreated ZIKV was gently loaded onto the top of the sucrose step gradient (20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70%), followed by centrifugation in a swinging bucket rotor (SW41Ti, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) using an Optima L-100 XP ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) at 107,170 g for 3 h at 4 °C. Fractions were collected from the top to bottom and detected for E protein by western blot and viral genomic RNA by RT-qPCR. Anti-E mAb 4G2 (10 µg/mL) was used to detect the E protein [
