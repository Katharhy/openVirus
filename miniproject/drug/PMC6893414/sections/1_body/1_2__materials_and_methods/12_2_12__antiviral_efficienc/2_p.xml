<p>To evaluate the protective efficiency of Ery-Est in vivo, A129 mice were used as previously described [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Forty-eight 4-week-old A129 mice were randomly assigned into six groups and three groups were infected with ZIKV strain SZ01 intraperitoneally (i.p.) at a dose of 1 Ã— 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU/ mouse. At 1 h post ZIKV challenge, infected mice were i.p. administrated with Ery-Est and Ery at 50 mg/kg of body weight or vehicle control (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8) once a day for 7 consecutive days, followed by observations of body weight, clinical syndrome, and mortality of mice, and it was deemed to be protected if a mouse survived to 21 days post infection (dpi). The viral RNA loads of sera were measured 2 dpi by RT-qPCR. The grade clinical signs were scored as previously described [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]: 0, healthy; 1, lethargy and inactivity; 2, wasting; 3, limb weakness; 4, hind-limb or fore-limb paralysis and tremors; and 5, moribund or death. Mice administrated with heat-inactivated ZIKV (iZIKV) or only administrated with Ery-Est and Ery at 50 mg/kg of body weight were used as mock controls. The above animal studies were conducted in Biosafety Level 2 facility at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center with Institutional Biosafety Committee approval.
