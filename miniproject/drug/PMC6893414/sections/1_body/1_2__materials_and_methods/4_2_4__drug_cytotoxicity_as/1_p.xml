<p>BHK21 and Vero cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well in 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Then, Ery-Est and Ery, serially diluted in DMEM containing 2% FBS, were added to cells and incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8, Dojindo, Japan) was used to detect the cell vitality as previously described [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In the detection using CCK8, orange-colored formazan could be formed by WST-8 through catalyzing with dehydrogenase in living cells, and the amount of formazan was proportional to the number of living cells. After the absorbance was determined at 450 nm wavelength, the cell proliferation was calculated according to the instruction manual.
