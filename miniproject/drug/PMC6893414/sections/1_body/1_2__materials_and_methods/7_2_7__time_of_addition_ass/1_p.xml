<p>To determine at which stage the drug displayed inhibitory efficiency, a time-of-addition assay was developed as previously described [

 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. BHK21 cells were incubated at 37 °C overnight to be infected with 100 PFU of ZIKV. Ery-Est (20 µM) was added to the infected cells at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10 h post infection. After incubation at 37 °C for 12 h, the supernatant was replaced with DMEM containing 1% LMP agarose and 2% FBS. After incubation for approximately 5 days, infected cells were fixed by 4% formaldehyde and stained with 1% crystal violet for plaque visualization.
