<p>For the entry experiment, BHK21 cells were infected with ZIKV in the presence of Ery-Est at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by the washes to remove unbound viruses and drugs. For the attachment assay, cells were infected with ZIKV in the presence of Ery-Est at 4 °C for 1 h, and then were washed to remove unbound viruses and drugs. For the fusion assay, BHK21 cells were firstly infected with ZIKV at 4 °C for 1 h to allow viral attachment. After three washes to remove unbound viruses, Ery-Est was added to cells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Then the drug was removed. In the post-entry assay, after BHK21 cells were infected with ZIKV at 37 °C for 1 h to allow viral entry, the drug was added to cells and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. Finally, the supernatant was replaced with DMEM containing 1% LMP agarose and 2% FBS. After incubation for approximately 5 days, infected cells were fixed by 4% formaldehyde and stained with 1% crystal violet for plaque visualization. Azi, Ery, and DMSO were also included.</p>
