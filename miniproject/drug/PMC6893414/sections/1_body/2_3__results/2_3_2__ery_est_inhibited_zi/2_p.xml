<p>Following this, we also researched whether Ery-Est was able to inhibit other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, such as DENV and YFV. It was demonstrated that Ery-Est potently inhibited infections of DENV II and YFV 17D with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of about 1.22 ± 0.63 and 2.70 ± 1.03 µM respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f002">Figure 2</xref>C,D). While Ery-Est, on the other hand, showed no inhibitory activity against other enveloped viruses of pseudotyped MERS-CoV and VSV at the concentration range tested (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f002">Figure 2</xref>E,F). To rule out the possibility that Ery-Est only inhibits ZIKV prepared in mosquito cells, we further tested whether Ery-Est could effectively inhibit the infection of ZIKV (V-ZIKV) produced in one kind of mammalian cells, Vero cells. 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-01064">Supplementary Figure S3</xref> showed that Ery-Est significantly inhibited V-ZIKV infection with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of about 3.66 ± 0.11 µM, which was similar to the inhibitory activity against ZIKV propagated in mosquito cells. Meanwhile, both Ery-Est and Ery had low toxicity to BHK21 and Vero cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f002">Figure 2</xref>G,H). These results indicate that Ery-Est may effectively inhibit flavivirus infections with a broad spectrum.
