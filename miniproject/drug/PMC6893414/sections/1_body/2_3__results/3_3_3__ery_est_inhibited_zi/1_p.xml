<p>To determine which step of the viral cycle was susceptible to Ery-Est inhibition, we developed the time-of-addition experiment with different time points for Ery-Est addition post ZIKV infection. At 12 h post infection, the supernatant was replaced with maintained medium for plaque assay to evaluate inhibitory effects of Ery-Est at different time points. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f003">Figure 3</xref>A, addition of Ery-Est to BHK21 cells at 0 h post infection significantly decreased the plaque numbers caused by ZIKV, showing the potent impact on the reproduction of ZIKV. Ery-Est, with addition time from 1 h to 4 h, showed gradually lower inhibitory activity but barely suppressed virus infection from 8 h post infection. Generally, Ery-Est inhibited ZIKV infection mainly in the early 2 h stage post infection, indicating that Ery-Est inhibits ZIKV infection in the early stage.
