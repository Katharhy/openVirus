<p>To determine the inhibitory activity of Ery-Est against ZIKV, the plaque assay was used as it could precisely exhibit the inhibitory effects. Ery-Est and Ery of serially diluted concentrations were incubated with ZIKV strain SZ01 at 37 °C for 1 h, and then the treated viruses were added to BHK21 cells, which were reported to be susceptible to ZIKV and develop obvious cytopathic effects (CPE) after infection [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f001">Figure 1</xref>B, numbers of ZIKV plaques were reduced more as the concentration of Ery-Est increased. There were scarcely any plaques formed with the Ery-Est treatment of 10 µM or more, while plaques treated by Ery of any concentrations used in the assay were generally unchanged. This suggests that Ery-Est inhibits ZIKV infection in a dose-dependent manner. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) value of Ery-Est against ZIKV was 3.22 ± 0.28 µM in the plaque assay (

To test the inhibitory activity of Ery-Est against ZIKV in neuronal cells whose damage caused by ZIKV was especially serious, which would reduce fetal brain growth, U-251 MG cells were infected by ZIKV with serially diluted Ery-Est and Ery treatments. It was found that Ery-Est significantly reduced infection rates of U-251 MG cells with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 7.14 ± 0.96 µM (
