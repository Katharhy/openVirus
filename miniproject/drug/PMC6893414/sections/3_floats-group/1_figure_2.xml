  <p>Inhibition of Ery-Est against flavivirus infection with a broad spectrum and its cytotoxicity. BHK21 cells (2 × 10
   <sup>6</sup>) were infected by ZIKV strains (
   <bold>A</bold>) FLR, (
   <bold>B</bold>) MR766, (
   <bold>C</bold>) DENV II, and (
   <bold>D</bold>) YFV 17D with the treatment of serial concentrations of Ery-Est and Ery, and then covered with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 2% FBS and 1% LMP agarose. After incubation for about 5 days, infected cells were stained with 1% crystal violet for plaque visualization and the inhibitions of infection were calculated. Huh7 cells (2 × 10
   <sup>4</sup>) were infected by (
   <bold>E</bold>) pseudotyped MERS-CoV and (
   <bold>F</bold>) VSV with the treatment of Ery-Est and Ery, the inhibitory activity was measured by the luciferase assay systems after incubation for 3 days. (
   <bold>G</bold>) BHK21 and (
   <bold>H</bold>) Vero cells (2 × 10
   <sup>4</sup>) were treated with Ery-Est and Ery for 72 h, and the cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) was used to detect cell viability. The experiments were tested in triplicate and data are represented as means ± SD. Each experiment was repeated at least twice and similar results were obtained. Statistical analysis: Two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons for (
   <bold>A</bold>–
   <bold>F</bold>). *
