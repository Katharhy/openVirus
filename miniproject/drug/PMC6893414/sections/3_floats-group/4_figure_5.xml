  <p>Protective activity of Ery-Est against vertical transmission of ZIKV in pregnant C57BL/6 mice. C57BL/6 pregnant mice were infected by 2 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU ZIKV, followed by treatments of Ery-Est (50 mg/kg), Ery (50 mg/kg) and vehicle respectively. Viral RNA loads (
   <bold>A</bold>) in sera of pregnant mice, (
   <bold>B</bold>) in placentas, and (
   <bold>C</bold>) in fetal heads at 1 day post infection were measured by RT-qPCR. Three embryos of each pregnant mouse were randomly collected for placentas and fetal heads. Statistical analysis: Mann–Whitney test for (
   <bold>A</bold>–
   <bold>C</bold>). Data are presented as means ± SD. ns = not significant. *
