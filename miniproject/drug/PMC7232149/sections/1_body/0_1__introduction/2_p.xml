<p>Seasonal influenza vaccines are divided into types: trivalent, which consists of influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and one influenza B strain (B/Yam or B/Vic); or quadrivalent, which contains all four strains. The threat of IBV has been recently recognized [

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which will have greater efficacy in the case of emergent of reassortant IBVs. Vaccines designs seek to provide protection against seasonal influenza viruses by eliciting antibody responses to surface viral HA proteins. Constant antigenic drift in HA necessitates regular updating of vaccine strains to ensure that the antigenic profile of circulating strains and vaccine components match [
