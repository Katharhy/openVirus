<p>Despite the fact that IBVs have repeatedly caused human epidemics, their genetic determinants of virulence and transmission are still poorly understood. Limited data on the range of hosts and the absence IBV modes of transmission complicate several areas including the study of pathogenicity factors, assessment of antiviral drugs, and vaccines effectiveness. The aim of this study is to develop non-lethal infection models, using clinically-relevant viruses, which facilitate testing of (anti-influenza) vaccine-induced protection. BALB/c mice were infected with mouse-adapted influenza B virus (B/Vic) and were characterized for illness, inflammation, viral load, and histopathology. Anti-influenza drugs and vaccine efficiency were also estimated in vitro and in vivo.</p>
