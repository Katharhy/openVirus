<p>In this work, we serially passaged a Victoria lineage IBV 17 times in BALB/c mice. The mouse-adapted IBV caused influenza pneumonia on day 6 post inoculation. Apparently, selective accumulation of amino acid substitutions in the mouse-adapted IBV, including changes to HA (T214I) and NA (D432N), may increase pathogenicity following the adaptation and be important for the virions to attach to hosts airways. However, the specific effects of these amino acid substitutions on mammalian pathogenicity requires further study. Spherical and elliptical IBV virion morphologies were also shown. Assessment of the investigational anti-influenza drug oseltamivir ethoxysuccinate and influenza vaccine Ultrix
 <sup>Â®</sup> showed effectiveness against our mouse-adapted influenza B virus. In summary, we demonstrated productive infection and clinically apparent signs of disease of Victoria lineage mouse-adapted IBVs (strain 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic>) which are useful for estimation of anti-influenza drugs and protective efficacy of influenza vaccines in vitro and in vivo.
