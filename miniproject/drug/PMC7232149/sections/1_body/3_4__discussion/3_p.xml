<p>Since preclinical trials of anti-influenza drugs are conducted mainly in mice [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], we also sought a mouse model. An antigenically-relevant B/Vic virus (strain 
 <italic>B/2017</italic> (VicHA–VicNA), which had circulated and predominated in 2017) was chosen and adapted in mice in order to receive the antigenically- and clinically-relevant strain (
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic>) for use in in vitro studies, and also in experimental infection on mice to evaluate the therapeutic and preventive effectiveness of antiviral drugs and vaccines in vivo. In our work we demonstrate productive infection and clinically apparent signs of disease of mouse-adapted IBV Victoria lineage which was first obtained in Russia. Both strains (
 <italic>B/2017</italic> and 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic>) were deposited in the State collection of causative agents of viral infections and rickettsioses of the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology “Vector” (Koltsovo, Russia) under registration numbers V-810 and V-811, accordingly. Amino acid substitutions associated with IBV adaptation to mice were identified. They likely increase the pathogenicity and enhanced replication ability in infected mammals.
