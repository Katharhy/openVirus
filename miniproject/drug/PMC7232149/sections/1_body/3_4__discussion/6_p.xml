<p>Due to their roles in elevating seasonal morbidity and mortality among humans worldwide, influenza A and B viruses have epidemiological, social, and economic significance [

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Selective inhibition of neuraminidase is used in the treatment of influenza to control the processes of budding and release of mature virions from the surface of an infected host cell (as a result of cleavage of sialic acid residues from hemagglutinin). In addition, NA plays a key role in the initial stages of infection, ensuring the penetration of influenza viruses into cells. Due to the specific activity of NA, inhibitors work effectively against influenza A and B viruses. Oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir are long-acting neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment and prophylaxis of human influenza virus infection [

 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Between the NA inhibitors of oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu
 <sup>®</sup>) and zanamivir (Relenza
 <sup>®</sup>), the former is considered the most effective because of its higher bioavailability (30–100%) [

 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In addition, it has been shown that Tamiflu
 <sup>®</sup> is a lot less effective in treating influenza B, compared to influenza A [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Due to the facts that the investigational drug (oseltamivir ethoxysuccinate) is a modified version of Tamiflu
 <sup>®</sup> and that it has shown (like Tamiflu
 <sup>®</sup>) high effectiveness against the mouse-adapted IBV, oseltamivir ethoxysuccinate is a promising drug for the treatment of influenza caused by the B virus.
