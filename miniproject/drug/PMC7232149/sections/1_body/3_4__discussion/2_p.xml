<p>In the field of virology, there is an entire branch devoted to obtaining recombinant strains for vaccines. IBV strains that are commonly used in experiments in Russian laboratories are recombinant strains obtained for vaccines [

Such IBV strains, however, are attenuated and apatogenous for experimental animals, which, in turn, does not provide an opportunity to study the pathological process of influenza infection and makes it difficult to perform studies of anti-influenza drug effectiveness in vivo. Consequently, they do not provide an opportunity to study the pathological process of influenza infection. Moreover, many of the presented recombinant strains have lost their antigenic relevance today.
