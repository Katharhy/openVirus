<p>Comparative analysis of nucleotide and amino acid substitutions between wild strain 
 <italic>B/2017</italic> and its mouse-adapted variant 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> strain revealed non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions that led to amino acid substitutions in two proteins, HA and NA. One of the amino acid substitutions identified (T214I in HA) is localized in the antigenically active subunit HA-HA1, thereby affecting the biological properties of the virus. Interestingly, the same substitution was present in 0.46% of IBVs reported from 2008 to 2016 [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This fact may explain severe cases and poor clinical outcomes in some patients infected with IBVs. Another substitution was found in NA and characterized as rare [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In light of the above, we assume that the Asn amino acid at position 432 of the NA protein in complex with other substitution(s) in the surface glycoprotein HA might jointly be responsible for the high pathogenicity.
