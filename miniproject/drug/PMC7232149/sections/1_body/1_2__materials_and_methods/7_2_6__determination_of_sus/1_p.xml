<p>The susceptibility of the 
 <italic>B/2017</italic> and 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> strains to oseltamivir (Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) was evaluated by published NA inhibition assays [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Briefly, viruses were standardized to a NA activity level 10-fold higher than that of the background, as measured by the production of fluorescent product from methylumbelliferyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA) substrate (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany). Drug susceptibility profiles were determined by the extent of NA inhibition (NAI) after incubation with 3-fold serial dilutions of NAIs. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) were determined from the dose-response curve.
