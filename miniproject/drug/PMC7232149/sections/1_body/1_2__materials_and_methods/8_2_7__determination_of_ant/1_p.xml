<p>We studied anti-influenza efficacy of oseltamivir ethoxysuccinate and Tamiflu
 <sup>®</sup> on 6–8-week-old BALB/c mice (FSRI SRC VB ‘’VECTOR”, Koltsovo, Russia) (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10 per group). All mice of groups №1–3 were lightly anesthetized with Rometar (2 mg/kg) and then i.i. with 10 MID
 <sub>50</sub> of 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> strains in 50 µL. Mice of group №4 were i.i. with 50 µL of PBS and served as the control. Then mice of group №1 were treated per os (oral administration) with a dose of 25 mg/kg/day of oseltamivir ethoxysuccinate (200 µL in each) during the 5 d.p.i. Mice in group №2 were treated per os with the same dose of Tamiflu
 <sup>®</sup> during the 5 d.p.i. Mice from group №3 received 200 μL of distilled water per os during the 5 d.p.i. All animals were monitored for signs of illness, weight loss, temperature changes, mortality, and lethality over the 14 d.p.i.
