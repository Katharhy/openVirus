<p>The IBV nucleotide sequences being investigated were combined with sequences retrieved from the GISAID database. For multiple alignments, a MUSCLE program was used [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Comparative pairwise sequence alignment of 2 investigated strains was performed via BioEdit. Phylogenetic trees were built via MEGA 5 using maximum likelihood and utilizing the general time reversible (GTR) nucleotide substitution model. Bootstrap support values were generated using 500 rapid bootstrap replicates.
