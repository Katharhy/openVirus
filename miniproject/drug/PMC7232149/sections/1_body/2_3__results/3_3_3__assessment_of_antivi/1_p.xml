<p>Here, we measured the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of oseltamivir ethoxysuccinate that is necessary to reduce the NA activity of the 
 <italic>B/2017</italic> and 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> strains (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00470-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Thus, analysis of the NA inhibition in vitro showed that oseltamivir ethoxysuccinate and Tamiflu
 <sup>Â®</sup> reduced the neuraminidase activity of the 
 <italic>B/2017</italic> and 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> strains equally effectively.
