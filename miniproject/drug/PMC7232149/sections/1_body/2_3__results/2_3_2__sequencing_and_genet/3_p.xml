<p>To identify strains that are the most genetically related to 
 <italic>B/2017</italic> and 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic>, BLAST analysis was performed. The results revealed that the study strains are 99–100% identical to the IBV variants that circulated in the human population in the Novosibirsk region, Altai Republic, and the Republic of Kazakhstan (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00470">Table S1</xref>). Thus, strain 
 <italic>B/2017</italic> is a typical genetic variant of the IBV that circulated during the 2016–2017 epidemic season, and it is most genetically related to the strains that circulated in Asia at that time.
