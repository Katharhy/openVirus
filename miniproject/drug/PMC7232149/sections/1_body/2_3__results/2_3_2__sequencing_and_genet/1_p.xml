<p>According to nucleotide sequence analysis of all eight genome segments, the 
 <italic>B/2017</italic> virus and, consequently, its mouse-adapted variant 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> belong to the B/Vic genetic lineage. In addition, analysis of these strains of HA amino acid sequences revealed mutations (I117D, N129D, V146I) relative to earlier reference strains. These mutations are characteristic of strains belonging to the 1A genetic subgroup of the B/Vic lineage. The strains NA substitutions were also found to feature amino acid substitutions characteristic of genetic group 1A of the B/Vic lineage (N340D, E358K, S295R, I120V, and K220N). To assess the phylogenetic relationships between 
 <italic>B/2017</italic> and 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic>, all genome segments were analyzed using phylogenetic dendrograms. Analysis used IBV nucleotide sequences, available in the GISAID database, isolated from residents of Russia and Kazakhstan, as well as vaccine and reference strains according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification.
