<p>Histopathological analysis of mouse lungs infected with the 
 <italic>B/2017</italic> virus showed slight damage, such as: small numbers of eosinophilic cells in the bronchioles; low blood filling of the capillaries; and edema with a high protein content on the 6th d.p.i. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00470-f002">Figure 2</xref>C). In contrast, on the same d.p.i., pathomorphological changes in lungs of mice infected with the 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> virus were more pronounced due to viral triggered apoptosis, leading to desquamation of the bronchial epithelium (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00470-f002">Figure 2</xref>C, insertion). Other features noted included: a greater number of eosinophilic cells in the bronchioles; lymphocytic infiltration of various lung regions; and capillaries stasis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00470-f002">Figure 2</xref>C). All of the pathomorphological changes listed were predominantly located in the root, cranioventral, and middle regions of the left and right lungs of the 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> virus infected mice.
