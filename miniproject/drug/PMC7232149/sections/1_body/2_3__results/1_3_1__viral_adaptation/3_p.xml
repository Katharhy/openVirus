<p>At 3 and 6 d.p.i., three mice were sacrificed, and their organs (lungs, brain, heart, liver, kidneys, spleen) were harvested. Viral titers in the collected organs were determined by the Kerber method with Ashmarin–Vorobyov modification. The strain 
 <italic>B/2017</italic> could replicate in mouse lungs only 3 days with titers 2.9 ± 0.2 log
 <sub>10</sub>TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL. In contrast, strain 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> replicated very well in mouse lungs, with higher titers and a longer period: on the 3rd d.p.i., the titer was the 5 ± 0.1 log
 <sub>10</sub>TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL; and on the 6th d.p.i. it was 3.3 ± 0.3 log
 <sub>10</sub>TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL. Therefore, the mouse-adapted B virus strain 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> displayed much higher replication capability in mouse lungs. In other organs (such as brain, heart, liver, kidneys, or spleen) we did not find a viral load from either strain.
