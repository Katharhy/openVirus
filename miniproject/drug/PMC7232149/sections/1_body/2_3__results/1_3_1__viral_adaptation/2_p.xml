<p>All mice i.i. with 
 <italic>B/2017</italic> virus survived and showed no obvious clinical signs such as body weight or temperature changes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00470-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B). In contrast, another experimental group of mice i.i. with 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> showed gradually weight loss: approximately 10% at 3 d.p.i.; 15% at 4 d.p.i.; 20% at 5 d.p.i.; 25% at 6 d.p.i.; and 30% at 7 d.p.i. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00470-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). Temperature measurements indicated the peak infection time frame to be from the 4th to the 7th d.p.i. (
