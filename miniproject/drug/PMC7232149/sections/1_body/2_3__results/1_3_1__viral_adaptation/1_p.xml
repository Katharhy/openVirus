<p>To study the adaptation of B virus isolated from humans, we serially passaged the wild type IBV Victoria lineage strain 
 <italic>B/2017</italic> in BALB/c mice. After 17 passages total, the mouse-adapted B virus 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> was obtained. We compared the pathogenicity of the 
 <italic>B/2017</italic> and 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> strains. Groups of twelve 6–8-week-old male BALB/c mice were i.i. with 50 μL of B/2017 or 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> viruses at 10
 <sup>4</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> (10 MID
 <sub>50</sub>). Body weight, temperature changes, morbidity, and mortality were monitored during 14 d.p.i, and the PBS-inoculated group of mice served as the controls. On the 3rd and 6th d.p.i., 3 animals from each group were sacrificed by decapitation, and internal organ samples (lungs, brain, heart, liver, kidneys, spleen) were taken for comparative virological analysis. On day 3 and 6 p.i., lungs were taken for examination by electron microscopy.
