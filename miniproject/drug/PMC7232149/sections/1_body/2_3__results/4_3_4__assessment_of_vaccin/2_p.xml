<p>Infection induced by 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> in non-immunized mice was characterized by body weight loss and hypothermia from the 2nd d.p.i, as well as conjunctivitis (up to 30%), with onsets between 1 and 3 d.p.i. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00470-f003">Figure 3</xref>A–C). All mice in this group huddled together, and their fur was ruffled on the 4th d.p.i. Peak illness was determined to be from the 5th to the 10th d.p.i., as seen by a large percentage of total body weight lost and visibly increased breathing effort caused by severe pathological processes in the lungs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00470-f003">Figure 3</xref>D). All mice unimmunized and i.i. with 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> lost significant amounts of body weight relative to the comparison groups (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). In addition, mice in the vaccinated and 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> infected group experienced statistically-significant reductions in body weight from the 4th up to the 7th d.p.i., compared to the control group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Temperatures were also measured, and statistically-significant differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) between the vaccinated and 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> infected mice and intact mice were detected on the 5th, 7th, and 10th d.p.i. The data suggest that the adapted IBV affects vaccinated mice for up to 10 d.p.i. No other influenza signs were observed in vaccinated mice, which indicate a mild IBV illness and effective Ultrix
 <sup>®</sup> vaccination.
