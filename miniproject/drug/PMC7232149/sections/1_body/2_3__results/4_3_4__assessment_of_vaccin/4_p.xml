<p>Macroscopic examination of unvaccinated mouse lungs revealed inflammation in the root and cranioventral regions on the 3rd d.p.i. In contrast, minor patchy areas of alveolar hemorrhage (

 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> infected group. By the 6th d.p.i., the inflammatory process had worsened only in lungs of unvaccinated mice, as characterized by interstitial pneumonia, affecting almost the entire lung, except for the caudal sections (
