<p id="p0030">Antigen that encodes either plasmid DNA or RNA i.e. mRNA or viral replicon, are used in the nucleic acid based approaches. After being taken and expressed by a cell, these antigens, which are encoded by nucleic acid, induce antibody and cell -mediated response as well. Owing to the simplicity in the alteration of antigen they permit, both the approaches are tremendously adaptable. Antigen production in the target cells suggests the benefit of imitating synthesis of protein throughout infectivity. Prominently, they allow any preference antigen delivery, despite of the fact that it was either isolated from bacteria, virus or any parasite thereby permitting development of vaccine against broad pathogen group. Further vaccine characteristics are not dependent on encoded proteins so, there is no need to set up new production, purification, validation methods and manufacturing services for production of nucleic acid based vaccines in large scale.</p>
