<p id="p0085">Adenovirus based delivery systems have several benefits including their ease of administration by oral or nasal route, their non-pathogenicity in humans [
 <xref rid="bb0420" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], particularly for mutants with compromised replication [
 <xref rid="bb0425" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Defending power of Ad-vectored vaccines against SARS-CoV was first demonstrated in rhesus macaques in 2003 [
 <xref rid="bb0430" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. They were immunized with three Ad5–SARS-CoV Ad-based vector constructs expressing genes for N, S and M proteins. The vaccine induced antibody reaction against spike S1 fragment, production of SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies and T-cell proliferation against the N protein [
 <xref rid="bb0430" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. In a similar study when Ad vector expressing SARS N- protein was used to vaccinate C57BL/6 strain mice, surprisingly no neutralizing antibodies were produced but SARS-CoV-specific IFN-γ secretion and T-cell production was detected [
 <xref rid="bb0420" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. When 129S6/SvEv strain mice was co- immunized with 2 Ad vector constructs containing genes coding for SARS-CoV S and N proteins by either nasal or muscular route, it suggested that former induced Ig A and effectively checks SARS-CoV reproduction in nasal and alveolar tissues while the later works by proliferating neutralizing antibodies [

A number of studies analyzing efficacy of these vaccines have been done in ferrets, being it the only model that resembles most of the symptoms of human patients including fever, transmission by respiratory route, discharge of virus from upper airways and lung injuries [
 <xref rid="bb0440" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0445" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. When ferrets were primed with adenoviral construct coding S-protein and boosted with a different adenovirus from chimpanzee, a significant reduction in viral load and other clinical symptoms was observed [
 <xref rid="bb0450" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Targeting that serotype to which humans are naïve is the focal point of recent adenoviral constructs. For this Chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOx1) is a promising candidate owing to its lack of persistent immunity in humans [
 <xref rid="bb0455" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] and superior safety status. Presently, a potential MERS-CoV vaccine named MERS001 is at clinical trial, having ChAdOx1coding for S-protein of MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bb0460" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. But restricted cloning ability, limited host range [
 <xref rid="bb0465" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] and pre-existent immunity against adenovirus in significant proportion of human population [
 <xref rid="bb0415" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0470" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] are some of their limitations which makes their animal testing challenging and retards their clinical use as a vector for vaccine designing.
