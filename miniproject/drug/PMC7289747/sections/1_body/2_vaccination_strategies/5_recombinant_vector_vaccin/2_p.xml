<p id="p0080">Recombinant vector vaccines can be defined as live, dividing viruses that are genetically manipulated to harbor some additional pathogenic gene, coding for foreign proteins, responsible for eliciting immune response [
 <xref rid="bb0410" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Recombinant vector vaccines are highly efficient in triggering an immune response as they can infect cells and sustain in the body for quite a long time and can react to antigen-presenting cells directly. Also viral proteins in such vaccines can act like adjuvant [

Several attempts have been made in the direction of the development of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) vaccine for which various viral vectors are genetically engineered to express SARS-CoV proteins in them. Adenovirus and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) are the two most common viral vectors used in the development of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccines.
