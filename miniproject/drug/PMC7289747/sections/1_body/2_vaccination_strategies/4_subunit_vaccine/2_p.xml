<p id="p0060">Considering safety efficacy, subunit vaccines involving pure antigens are said to be advantageous, as the constituent only includes synthetic peptides or recombinant proteins that expresses only particular fragments of immunogen, excluding the participation of contagious viruses. In addition to this, subunit vaccines are less prone to generate the side effects at the site of inoculation. Due to stable conditions and definite fragments of pathogen, subunit vaccines achieve reliable production. Due to all these qualities of subunit vaccines are helpful in making it an interesting candidate for vaccine. A number of structural proteins comprising spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) are expressed by SARS-CoV that may act as antigens to activate neutralizing antibodies and generate defensive response.</p>
