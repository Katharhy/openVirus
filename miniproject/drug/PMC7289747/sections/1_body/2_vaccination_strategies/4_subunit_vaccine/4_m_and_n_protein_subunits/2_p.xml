<p id="p0075">Besides the above mentioned proteins, expression of various other proteins have also been reported on the virion surface with the production of antibodies in SARS patients serum [
 <xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], further these proteins can also be evaluated to check the protective efficacy against SARS-CoV. For instance, counteracting action of the antibodies toward M proteins has also been reported [
 <xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Membrane or M protein plays an essential role in upholding the configuration of viral envelope [
 <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] and M protein carries out this by making interactions with different CoV proteins [
 <xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], incorporating Golgi complex into novel virions [
 <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], and stabilizing proteins of the nucleocapsid [
 <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Investigations on animal CoV vaccines have reported that the Nucleocapsid protein (N) of CoV could serve as additional target for the development of vaccine [
 <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Even though the antibodies to N proteins of CoV does not have mechanism to neutralize the virus, but generation of CoV-restricted CD8+ T cells has been reported [
 <xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0375" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>], consequently providing protection subsequent to infection in animals [
 <xref rid="bb0385" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] therefore, this suggest that in vivo defense could be offered by the protein by eliciting cell-mediated response [
 <xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Research have shown that precise IgG antibodies, as well as subtypes IgG1 and IgG2a were induced when Freund's adjuvant was conjugated with SARS-CoV N protein that was plant expressed while, conjugating adjutants like cysteine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) and Montanide ISA-51 with N protein that was 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>-expressed, results in induction of definite IgG antibodies toward a Th1 (IgG2a)-type response in mice [
 <xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. However, the conserved N protein across CoV families implies that it is not a suitable candidate for vaccine development, and the antibodies against the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 do not provide immunity to the infection [
 <xref rid="bb0405" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>].
