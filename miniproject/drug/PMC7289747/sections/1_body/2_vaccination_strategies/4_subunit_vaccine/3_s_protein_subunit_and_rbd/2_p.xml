<p id="p0065">Spike protein (S) of virus performs significant part in entering the host [
 <xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The CoV-RNA genome is allowed to go inside the cells of host through the early interactions of S1 domain to its receptor in the host i.e. PP 4 in MERS-CoV and ACE2 in SARS-CoV, followed by the viral and host membrane fusion facilitated by the S2 segment. To develop vaccines based on CoV subunit, S proteins are the preferred candidate, because S proteins have sites for binding of receptor as well as for membrane fusion; vaccines based on S protein are likely to activate antibodies that prevent the binding of virus and later fusion of membranes as well thereby counteracting infection of virus [
 <xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV which is shown to bind the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is an interesting candidate to target for both vaccine and therapeutic improvement [
 <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. This practice is robustly encouraged by the discovery that illustrates the infectivity by SARS-CoV is powerfully counteracted by human mAb that binds to S protein through N-terminal and thereby prevents binding of receptor by hindering the formation of syncytia [
 <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. On the other hand, few epitopes that are not neutralizing are also present in the immmuno-predominant sites of the S protein of SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] that could elicit the immune responses which might be harmful [
 <xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. For that reason, the identification and elimination of such epitopes in S protein is obligatory. Moreover, the S protein have been reported to produce serum neutralizing antibodies and protected African green monkeys and mice challenged with SARS-CoV [

 <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. S-ectodomain proteins of full length merged with/without S or S-foldon i.e. fold on trimeric motif, may induce precise antibody response and neutralizing antibody thus causing protection of the vaccinated mice to SARS-CoV infection [
 <xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Besides this, S protein associated with SARS-CoV is also shown to be responsible for eliciting responses by T-cell (CD4+ and CD8+) [
