<p id="p0025">Viral zoonosis had resulted into many disease epidemics in recent years and emergence of new strains from their zoonotic hosts makes them very difficult to predict [

Such repeated transmission leading to global economy losses makes CoV vaccines highly desirable, as presently there are no antiviral drugs available against CoV. Various areas explored for the search of an ideal vaccine against SARS-CoV, includes inactivated virus vaccines, recombinant viral vaccines, subunit vaccine, DNA vaccines and attenuated vaccines [
