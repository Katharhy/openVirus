  <p>Mechanism of action of various vaccine candidates: I) Recombinant Virus Vector act as an endogenous antigen, thus after processing in the proteasome, they are presented by MHC I to the CD8+ Tc cells leading to Cell Mediated Immune (CMI) response; II) DNA Vaccine are transcribed and translated in the host cell, the protein synthesized then moves to MHC class I pathway or the protein would be released outside the host cell where it act as an exogenous antigen and are presented by MHC II to the CD4+ TH cells leading to humoral immune response, also release of some cytokines by TH cells leads to CMI response as well; III) mRNA vaccines exposed PAMP (Pathogen Associated Molecular Pattern)are recognized by the soluble PRR (Pathogen Recognition Receptor) endocytosed and lead to MHC class II pathway, Thus eliciting the humoral immune response.</p>
