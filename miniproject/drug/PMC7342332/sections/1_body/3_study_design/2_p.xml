 <italic>et al</italic>. who conducted the clinical Ebola trial recommend that individual patient's interests must prevail over reliability of trial methodology when the patients face a high risk of death.[
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In a pandemic scenario, high number of serious patients presenting simultaneously and high mortality rate make random allocation of patients from within the same family or location to receive or not receive an experimental drug, ethically unacceptable.[
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Furthermore, critically ill patients would find randomization procedure difficult to understand. It would be considered unethical and impractical to conduct randomized controlled trial (RCT) asking the patients or family members to consent to standard care when a potentially beneficial therapy is available. For example, in LOTUS China open-label RCT, families of 31 patients (8.6%) did not give consent.[
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In the Ebola trial, the investigators decided to conduct single-arm open-label nonrandomized trial, in which all patients received favipiravir along with standardized care.[

 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The investigators used historical mortality data to define efficacy endpoints – target mortality threshold – a priory, which was valuable in deciding whether to stop or continue the trial and to guide analysis and interpretation of the data.[
