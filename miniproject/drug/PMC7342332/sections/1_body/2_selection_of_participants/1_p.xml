<p>In an outbreak setting, clinical trials usually include patients who are most severely affected. LOTUS China trial[
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] included adult patients 18 years of age or older, with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, suffering from pneumonia and SARS.[
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In contrast, French clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in COVID-19 included hospitalized patients who were asymptomatic or suffered from upper or lower respiratory infection due to SARS-CoV-2.[
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The favipavir study included adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia but excluded critical patients whose expected survival time was &lt;48 h.[
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] This study showed a significant clinical recovery in patients who suffered from mild COVID-19 and who were not critically ill.[
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Late recruitment of patients in infection, who had considerable tissue damage, could be a possible reason for the failure of lopinavir.[

 <italic>Post hoc</italic> subgroup analysis of patients treated within 12 days after the onset of symptoms showed accelerated clinical recovery and reduced mortality compared to those treated later.[
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] This means that the investigator should make efforts to include COVID-19 patients with a shorter duration of illness. Early recruitment of patients and rapid initiation of treatment would, in turn, require quick turn round of laboratory data and availability of site staff at odd times to complete the clinical study procedures for enrolling patients in the trial.
