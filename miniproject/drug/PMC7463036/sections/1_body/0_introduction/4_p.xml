<p id="p0035">Oseltamivir is a competitive inhibitor of neuraminidase designed by computer-assisted technology. In this context, the effective binding of oseltamivir to the active site of key proteins of SARS-CoV-2 is particularly important. Therefore, here we: 1. analyzed whether S protein, NC protein, 3CLpro, PLpro, and Pol/RdR have active centers similar to neuraminidase; 2. explored whether oseltamivir can form effective docking with key protein active centers of the virus using molecular simulation; 3. accessed the antiviral effect of oseltamivir against SARS-CoV-2 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>; 4. used case review to analyze whether oseltamivir is a factor to improve the conditions of patients with COVID-19.
