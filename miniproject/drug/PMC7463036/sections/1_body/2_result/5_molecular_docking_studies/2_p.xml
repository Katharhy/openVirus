<p id="p0095">To pursue our hypothesis, we used molecular docking to analyze whether oseltamivir carboxylic acid could stably bind to the active center of the viral protein structure. The docking conformations were described in 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A–D. The results showed that the docking energies of oseltamivir carboxylic acid with NRBD, 3CLpro, PLpro, and Pol/RdRp were −4.7 kcal/mol, −7.0 kcal/mol, −5.8 kcal/mol, and −5.4 kcal/mol, respectively (
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> ). The lower the binding energy, the more suitable the binding of the inhibitor molecule to the receptor. In terms of binding energy, oseltamivir carboxylic acid was more favorable to bind to the active site of 3CLpro effectively. To further analyze the ability of oseltamivir to inhibit 3CLpro, we selected N3 inhibitor as the positive group, which exhibited strong inhibition for 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2

 <italic>.</italic> The result showed that its docking energy was −8.5 kcal/mol, which was lower than that of oseltamivir carboxylic acid. The docking conformation was shown in 
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A and B. It was found that the conformation of ligand (Purple) docked into the active site was almost identical to the original ligand (Green), suggesting the reliability of this docking program. Based on the results described above, we considered that the ability of oseltamivir to inhibit 3CLpro is not strong compared with N3 inhibitor.
