<p id="p0085">Subsequently, we used the SAVES v5.0 program (servicesn.mbi.ucla.edu/SAVES/) to carry out a model evaluation. The results are shown in 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> , suggesting all three models passed the evaluation. Among them, the ERRAT score was based on whether the error value of the alignment of the non-bonding interaction among the atoms in the structure and the high-resolution crystal structure was within a reasonable confidence interval. If the percentage of the reasonable confidence interval is higher, the quality is higher. Almost all residues of NRBD, Pol/RdRp, and PLpro were within reasonable confidence intervals, and the final scores were 96.4602, 95.9157, and 92.7586, respectively (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A–C). Verify3D was used to analyze the compatibility of the 3D structure and the primary sequence in the model. A 3D-1D score ≥ 0.2 of a residue is reasonable. The higher the ratio of reasonable residues, the higher the quality of the model. The majority of residues of NRBD, Pol/RdRp, and PLpro belonged to reasonable residues (green), and there were 91.27%, 89.91%, and 98.73% reasonable residues in NRBD, Pol/RdRp, and PLpro respectively (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A–C). The results of Procheck were mainly shown by Ramachandran plots. As can be seen in the Ramachandran plot, there were A, B, L, a, b, l, p, ~a, ~b, ~p, and ~l labeled areas. In Porcheck, A, B, and L are classified as reasonable areas; a, b, l are relatively reasonable regions, whereas ~a, ~b, ~p, and ~l are acceptable regions. The distributions of amino acid residues in the structure were observed. The large proportion of amino acids in reasonable regions proves that the model is of high quality. It can be seen that most of the residues of NRBD, Pol/RdRp, and PLpro were in A, B, and L, and the reasonable region residues accounted for 92.9%, 92.5%, and 90.0%, respectively (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A–C). The above results suggested that the three modeled structures passed the evaluation, were of good quality, and could be used for further research.
