 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A showed that treatment of oseltamivir did not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, with half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) value above 100 μM. Chloroquine was selected as a positive control, which can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). Therefore, we concluded that oseltamivir is ineffective against SARS-CoV-2.
