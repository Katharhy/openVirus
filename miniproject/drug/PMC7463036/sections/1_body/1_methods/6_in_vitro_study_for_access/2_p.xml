<p id="p0060">The antiviral efficiency of oseltamivir against SARS-CoV-2 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> was evaluated using the method described in the previous work 
 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Briefly, Vero E6 cells (ATCC, no. 1586) were cultured in MEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> humidified incubator. And cells were precultured at 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>/48-well plate overnight and pretreated with different doses of the oseltamivir carboxylic acid (CAS No. 187227-45-8/HY-13318) for 1h before infecting with the SARS-CoV-2 (nCoV-2019BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05 for 2 h. After that, cell culture supernatants were replaced with fresh complete medium containing different concentrations of oseltamivir. Virus-containing supernatants were collected at 24h after transfection for extracting RNA by the MiniBEST Viral RNA/DNA Extraction Kit (Takara, CAT No. 9766) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then cDNA synthesis was performed with a PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara, Cat no. RR047A). The qRT-PCR assay was conducted to evaluate the quantification of viral copy numbers in the cell supernatant with TB Green Premix Ex Taq II (Takara, CAT No. RR820A). The primers were targeted nCoV-2019 S gene, forward primer CAATGGTTTAACAGGCACAG; reverse primer CTCAAGTGTCTGTGGATCACG
