The structures of NC, PLpro, and Pol/RdRp were built by homology modeling. We first obtained the protein sequences of NC (YP_009724397.2), nsp3 (YP_009725299.1), and Pol/RdRp (YP_009725307.1) from the GenePept protein sequence database, and suitable templates were found for these protein sequences through the Swiss-model (
