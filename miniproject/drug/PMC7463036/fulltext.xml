During the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), most patients with COVID-19 who are symptomatic have used oseltamivir.

Interestingly, the active center of 3CL pro was found to be similar to the active center from the neuraminidase of influenza A.

Since then, it has played an essential role in treating against influenza A and influenza B and is becoming more widespread. The atypical pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that broke out in Guangzhou, China, in 2003, linked oseltamivir to coronavirus. Zhang et al. found that the active site of the Spike (S) 1 Protein of SARS is similar to that of neuraminidase, suggesting that neuraminidase inhibitors may be useful to treat SARS-CoV <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. However, despite this similarity, no clinical data suggest that oseltamivir is effective in treating SARS-CoV. With the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, oseltamivir has once again become a hot topic. A study from Thailand reported that a 71-year-old patient with severe COVID-19 on January 29, 2020 underwent a 48h treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir combined with oseltamivir, which improved the patient&#x02019;s condition, and the throat swab test became negative <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Although a single case report does not prove the effectiveness of oseltamivir for COVID-19, it once again linked oseltamivir to the treatment of a coronavirus-induced disease. As frontline healthcare workers fighting against COVID-19, we were interested in the treatment regimen of this case and found most patients with COVID-19 who were symptomatic have used oseltamivir. We believed that it is of practical significance to further study the effect of oseltamivir on COVID-19. Because of its significant effectiveness on influenza and being sold over the counter, oseltamivir is not only stocked in common households but also a common antiviral drug in primary hospitals. Therefore, if oseltamivir is effective for COVID-19, the treatment could be family-oriented. If, instead, the treatment effectiveness is not significant, the use of oseltamivir should be stopped, which will avoid delaying other treatments and multiple oseltamivir adverse reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, epilepsy, elevated liver enzymes, and arrhythmias <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Therefore, the study of the antiviral effect of oseltamivir against SARS-CoV-2 could have a positive effect on the treatment of COVID-19.</p><p id="p0030">SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the &#x003b2;-genus of the coronavirus family and is the seventh coronavirus found to infect humans.

, suggesting all three models passed the evaluation. Among them, the ERRAT score was based on whether the error value of the alignment of the non-bonding interaction among the atoms in the structure and the high-resolution crystal structure was within a reasonable confidence interval. If the percentage of the reasonable confidence interval is higher, the quality is higher. Almost all residues of NRBD, Pol/RdRp, and PLpro were within reasonable confidence intervals, and the final scores were 96.4602, 95.9157, and 92.7586, respectively (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A&#x02013;C). Verify3D was used to analyze the compatibility of the 3D structure and the primary sequence in the model. A 3D-1D score&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;0.2 of a residue is reasonable. The higher the ratio of reasonable residues, the higher the quality of the model. The majority of residues of NRBD, Pol/RdRp, and PLpro belonged to reasonable residues (green), and there were 91.27%, 89.91%, and 98.73% reasonable residues in NRBD, Pol/RdRp, and PLpro respectively (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A&#x02013;C).

In Porcheck, A, B, and L are classified as reasonable areas; a, b, l are relatively reasonable regions, whereas ~a, ~b, ~p, and ~l are acceptable regions. The distributions of amino acid residues in the structure were observed. The large proportion of amino acids in reasonable regions proves that the model is of high quality. It can be seen that most of the residues of NRBD, Pol/RdRp, and PLpro were in A, B, and L, and the reasonable region residues accounted for 92.9%, 92.5%, and 90.0%, respectively (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A&#x02013;C).

The alignment of the structure of influenza B neuraminidase (PDB ID: 4CPY) with 3Ti6 was selected as a positive control. TM-score was used to analyze the structural similarity.

By comparing 4CPY with 3Ti6, the TM-score of the two was found to be 0.94460, which proved that the two were structurally homologous. Subsequently, we aligned the structures of S protein, NRBD, 3CL pro, PLpro, and Pol/RdRp with 3Ti6; the TM-scores were 0.30077, 0.19254, 0.28766, 0.30666, and 0.34047, respectively (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>
). The results suggested that there was only a structural similarity between the protein structure of the above SARS-CoV-2 and 3Ti6. The active center of the S protein was mainly the RBD domain (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B green region) and S2 subunit heptad-repeat 1 domain (HR1) (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B blue region), which were also two important targets for studying the inhibition of S protein <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. We found that the similar structure of 3Ti6 and S protein is located in the <italic>N</italic>-terminal domain (NTD) region of S protein. As the active center of NC, we found that NRBD did not match the active center of 3Ti6 (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C). The active center of 3CLpro was determined based on that it is homologous to the 3CLpro from SARS-CoV. Previous studies have confirmed the active center of 3CLpro of SARS-CoV. Thus, this region was used as the active center of 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. By alignment, we found that the active centers of the two proteins were similar (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D).

At the same time, oseltamivir, as an over-the-counter drug, is also a popular antiviral drug. As healthcare workers fighting against COVID-19, we have found that many patients experiencing discomfort or considered to be infected with a virus take oseltamivir. From SARS-CoV in 2003 to MERS- CoV in 2012, and now the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, there is not plenty of evidence showing that oseltamivir is effective against coronavirus. Still, there is also no sufficient evidence to refute its ineffectiveness. We cannot predict whether there will be a pandemic of respiratory coronavirus in the future, so we hope to initiate such research and preliminarily explore whether oseltamivir is effective for COVID-19, which can better guide healthcare workers in the selection of appropriate antiviral drugs in the face of coronavirus epidemics. Although there was no expression of neuraminidase in SARS-CoV-2, Zhang et al, who discovered through homology modeling that the S1 protein of SARS-CoV had a similar active center as neuraminidase and considered that neuraminidase inhibitors were likely to inhibit SARS-CoV through targeting S1 protein activity, which provided us inspiration for research the structural similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and neuraminidase <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Considering the homology of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, we conducted a structural alignment of the crystal structure of S protein with influenza A neuraminidase. We found that the active center of neuraminidase was not similar to the RBD domain on the S1 subunit and the HR1 domain on the S2 subunit, which were the active sites of S protein. We were not surprised by these findings because the sequence conservation of S1 in both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV was only 71%, and there were structural variations <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. We, therefore, focused our attention on the NC protein, 3CLPro, PLpro, and Pol/RdRp, which have been widely studied in SARS-CoV, are highly conserved with SARS-CoV-2, and are the main proteins targeted by drugs. We used structural alignment to discover that, except for 3CLpro, the active centers of the other three proteins did not match that of neuraminidase. We observed that in the reported regimen in Thailand, the dosage of oseltamivir was 300&#x000a0;mg/day, and our patients&#x02019; treatment dose was still based on the conventional dose of 150&#x000a0;mg/day for flu (news link: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://xw.qq.com/cmsid/20200221A0HN1400%3ff%3dnewdc" id="ir030">https://xw.qq.com/cmsid/20200221A0HN1400?f=newdc</ext-link>), so we next studied the relationship between dose of oseltamivir and therapeutic effect.
