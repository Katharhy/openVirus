  <p>Differential inhibition of HIV-1 entry into human glia by maraviroc and a bivalent CCR5-MOR antagonist (BVL) with cell-specific interactions in combination with morphine. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Construction of a MOR-CCR5 heterodimer model in a membrane (
   <italic>gray</italic>), and aqueous surrounds (
   <italic>red</italic>) system. The green protein represents MOR and the blue protein represents CCR5, while the bivalent ligand is colored in yellow. (

   <bold>c</bold>) Construction of a chemical probe that interacts with both the MOR and CCR5 receptors simultaneously. To monitor HIV-1 infection (
   <bold>d</bold>) astrocytes and (
   <bold>e</bold>) microglia were transfected with a pBlue3′LTR-luc reporter sensitive to Tat expression and luciferase activity was measured. Data indicate that maraviroc’s antiviral effects are completely negated in both astrocytes and microglia when morphine is present (
   <italic>red bars</italic>). Interestingly, unlike maraviroc, the bivalent compound blocked HIV entry in astrocytes irrespective of morphine treatment. By contrast, the bivalent antagonist exacerbated HIV infectivity in microglia in the presence of morphine (
   <italic>red bars</italic>). The findings reveal fundamental differences in co-regulation of MOR and CCR5 expression in astroglia and microglia upon HIV and/or morphine exposure (see El-Hage et al.
