  <p>Morphine exacerbates the excitotoxic effects of HIV Tat by mobilizing Ca
   <sup>2+</sup> from ryanodine (RyR)-sensitive internal stores. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Tat-induced increases in [Ca
   <sup>2+</sup>]
   <sub>i</sub> were not attenuated by ryanodine, whereas ryanodine and pyruvate attenuate combined Tat and morphine-induced increases in [Ca
   <sup>2+</sup>]
   <sub>i</sub>. Nimodipine (L-type Ca
   <sup>2+</sup> channel blocker) and dantrolene did not show any effects. (

   <sup>2+</sup>]
   <sub>i</sub>, whereas no effects were noted for nimodipine, dantrolene, or pyruvate. *

   <bold>c</bold>) Summary of HIV-1 Tat and morphine interactive neuronal injury in striatal medium spiny neurons. Combined Tat and morphine promotes structural and functional defects in dendrites via α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPAR), 
   <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDAR), and MOR, causing influxes of Na
   <sup>+</sup> and/or Ca
   <sup>2+</sup>, compensatory increases in Na
   <sup>+</sup>/K
   <sup>+</sup>-dependent ATPase activity, and a rapid loss in ATP mobilization with an inability to extrude excess Na
   <sup>+</sup> via Na
   <sup>+</sup>/K
   <sup>+</sup>-ATPase caused by mitochondrial hyperpolarization. Dysregulation of [Ca
   <sup>2+</sup>]
   <sub>i</sub> homeostasis by combined Tat and morphine appears to be mediated downstream of [Na
   <sup>+</sup>]
   <sub>i</sub> at the level of calcium mobilization, which in turn appears to be regulated via ryanodine (RyR)-sensitive sites, and enhanced by morphine exposure likely via MOR-dependent stimulation of PI3-kinase and Ca
   <sup>2+</sup> mobilization via the Gβγ protein subunit. (
