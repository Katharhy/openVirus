<p id="Par28">HIV likely damages OLs through both direct and indirect actions. OLs lack CD4, and reports of OL infection by HIV are variable (Esiri et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1996</xref>; Wohlschlaeger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR543">2009</xref>); thus, HIV infection of OLs is unlikely a major avenue of OL or white matter damage (discussed below). Alternatively, bystander damage to OLs through the production of “virotoxins” and “cellular toxins” (Nath 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR357">1999</xref>) by infected neighboring cells is more likely to be operative (Hauser et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR208">2009</xref>; Zou et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR228">2019</xref>; Zou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR562">2019</xref>). ARVs also contribute to OL cytotoxicity (Jensen et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">2019</xref>; Jensen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR228">2019</xref>). HIV-1 Tat directly induces damage in isolated OLs through α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)/

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR561">2015</xref>) and is also associated with abnormal Kv1.3 activity (Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR295">2017</xref>). Immature OLs are preferentially targeted by Tat compared to differentiated OLs (Khurdayan et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR562">2019</xref>). While the reasons why immature OLs are more susceptible to Tat are unclear, unlike mature OLs, Tat preferentially upregulates GSK-3β signaling in undifferentiated OLs by inhibiting Ca
