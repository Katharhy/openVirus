 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR228">2019</xref>), few studies have examined how opiate exposure affects OLs and myelin in neuroHIV (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Increased demyelination is reported in SIV-infected rhesus macaques chronically treated with morphine (4× daily, up to 59 weeks) (Marcario et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR306">2008</xref>). Specifically, morphine-treated SIV macaques developed more subtle, focal, dysmyelinating lesions, with accumulations of macrophages in areas of myelin loss (Marcario et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR306">2008</xref>), as well as accompanying gliosis (Marcario et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR306">2008</xref>; Rivera-Amill et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR428">2010a</xref>; Bokhari et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2011</xref>). Morphine exposure increased degeneration of OLs in Tat+ mice, which was accompanied by elevations in caspase-3 activation and TUNEL reactivity in OLs and reversible by naloxone or naltrexone, respectively (Hauser et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR208">2009</xref>). Although OLs can express MOR both in vivo (Stiene-Martin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR487">2001</xref>) and in vitro (Hauser et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR208">2009</xref>), it remains unclear the extent to which MOR activation in OLs directly mediates HIV pathogenesis.
