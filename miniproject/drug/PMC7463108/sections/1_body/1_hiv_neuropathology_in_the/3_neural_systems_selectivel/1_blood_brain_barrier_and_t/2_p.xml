<p id="Par24">Using a primary human brain microvascular endothelial cell (BMEC) and astrocyte co-culture model, Mahajan et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR303">2008</xref>) were among the first to demonstrate that co-exposure to morphine and HIV-1 Tat resulted in greater increases in TNF-α and IL-8 levels and decreases in barrier tightness (measured by TEER) than either morphine or Tat alone. Morphine and Tat co-exposure also additively increased JAM-2, while zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) levels were decreased by morphine or by Tat individually, and occludin protein levels were decreased by morphine alone but not Tat (Mahajan et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR274">2019</xref>), also demonstrated that HIV-1 Tat and morphine act independently to disrupt BBB integrity. In these studies, morphine, and to a lesser extent Tat, exposure increased the leakage of fluorescently labeled dextrans from the circulation into the brain (Leibrand et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR274">2019</xref>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Morphine exposure decreased the penetration of select ARVs in the brain, in a region-specific manner (Leibrand et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR274">2019</xref>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Morphine exposure also resulted in increased expression and function of the drug efflux transport protein, P-gp, suggesting a mechanism by which morphine decreased the ARV concentrations (Leibrand et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR274">2019</xref>). This finding suggests that morphine exposure could impact the efficient delivery of any therapeutic drug that is a substrate of P-gp into the CNS. Future research should also investigate morphine’s impact on other drug transport proteins important for ARV delivery to the brain.
