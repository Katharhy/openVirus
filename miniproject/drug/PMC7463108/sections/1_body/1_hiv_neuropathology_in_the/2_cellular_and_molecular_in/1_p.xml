<p id="Par15">Prior reviews have outlined how opiate drugs likely exacerbate neuroHIV pathology in neurons and glia (Hauser et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">2015</xref>; Meng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR334">2015</xref>). Opioid-HIV pathophysiological interactions are complex and differ depending on the timing and duration of co-exposure, the pharmacology of the opioid drug involved, the cell types and brain regions targeted, host and viral genetics, and are highly contextual (Hauser and Knapp 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">2014</xref>,
