<p id="Par53">Opiate self-administration as seen with addiction can have different CNS consequences than “steady-state” (e.g., continuous via a pump or time-release drug implant) exposure to the same drug (Kreek

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR257">2001</xref>; Kreek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR259">2002</xref>), and we predict the pharmacokinetic differences in opiate exposure will markedly impact neuroHIV progression. Differential effects based on “on-off” and “steady-state” drug administration schedules have been reported for the stress-responsive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the endogenous opioid system, and the dopamine system (Kreek

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR259">2002</xref>; George et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">2012</xref>). Acute opiate exposure typically activates the HPA axis, corticotropin releasing factor, and peripheral steroidogenesis in a species-dependent manner (Koob and Kreek 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR249">2007</xref>; Cleck and Blendy 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2008</xref>). Alternatively, chronic self-administration of short-acting opiates suppresses diurnal cortisol rhythmicity (Facchinetti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">1984</xref>; Vuong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR531">2010</xref>), while opiate withdrawal typically evokes HPA activation (Culpepper-Morgan and Kreek 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">1997</xref>; Kreek 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR258">2007</xref>; Paris et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR378">2020</xref>). The daily, repeated bouts of relative withdrawal seen with opiate addiction cause sustained HPA activation, stress (Koob and Kreek 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR249">2007</xref>; Koob 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR248">2020</xref>), and immune suppression (Eisenstein 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2019</xref>). Importantly, maintenance therapy with the long-acting drug methadone achieves steady-dose opiate levels and normalization of the HPA axis (Kreek 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR255">1973</xref>). Further, it is known that HIV infection significantly alters the HPA axis, due to CNS toxicity and cytokine production (Costa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2000</xref>; George and Bhangoo 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">2013</xref>; Chrousos and Zapanti
