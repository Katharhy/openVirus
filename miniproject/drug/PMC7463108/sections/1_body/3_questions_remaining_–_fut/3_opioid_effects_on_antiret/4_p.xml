<p id="Par62">A few studies have investigated the impact of opioids and ARV administration on drug concentrations within the brain. One study investigated the impact of 5 d continuous exposure to morphine on ARV brain concentrations (dolutegravir, lamivudine and abacavir) and demonstrated that morphine exposure resulted in regionally specific decreases in the concentrations of select ARV drugs (Leibrand et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR274">2019</xref>) and, furthermore, that the decreases in ARV concentrations (dolutegravir and abacavir) were likely due to increased efflux by the drug efflux transport protein, P-gp (Leibrand et al.
