<p id="Par63">HIV preferentially infects microglia and perivascular macrophages within the brain, although BMECs, astrocytes, and pericytes can also be infected (Kramer-Hammerle et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR253">2005</xref>). Achieving optimal intracellular ARV concentrations are essential to suppress the infection. Few studies have examined whether ARV drugs differentially accumulate within different neural cell types and especially within cells of the neurovascular unit. Although nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are efficacious in inhibiting viral replication within monocyte-derived macrophages, only a few drugs within each ARV class can effectively inhibit viral replication within astrocytes (Gray et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188">2013</xref>), which could be a result of poor intracellular accumulation within astrocytes. In vitro studies have demonstrated darunavir and raltegravir intracellular concentrations to be approximately 100-fold lower (with higher EC
 <sub>50</sub> values) in microglia than in PBMCs (Asahchop et al.
