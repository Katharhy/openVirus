<p id="Par59">Opioid misuse has been linked to poor adherence to cART (Jeevanjee et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR226">2014</xref>). However, adherence to ARV therapy improves after initiation of opioid substitution therapy (Nosyk et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR370">2015</xref>; Low et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR297">2016</xref>; Adams et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>). Although better adherence can improve therapeutic outcomes in PWH, little information is currently available on the interaction between opioids or opioid substitution therapies and cART specifically within the CNS.
