<p id="Par64">Another study measured intracellular concentrations of dolutegravir, tenofovir and emtricitabine in primary human astrocytes, microglia, pericytes and BMECs (Patel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR384">2019</xref>). Intracellular ARV concentrations were typically significantly higher in BMECs than in the other brain cell types. Dolutegravir achieved the highest relative concentrations within each cell type, whereas tenofovir accumulated the least (Patel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR384">2019</xref>). Furthermore, 24Â h treatment with morphine significantly decreased intracellular accumulation of composite ARV concentrations, but only in astrocytes. In contrast, morphine exposure significantly increased the net accumulation of drugs within BMECs compared to controls. BMECs may sequester ARV drugs as a protective mechanism (Patel et al.
