<p id="Par43">The ability of opiates to modulate CCR5 expression in the CNS has been demonstrated to occur in various cell types, including microglia (Bokhari et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2009</xref>), and astrocytes (Mahajan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR301">2002</xref>). Specifically, in astrocytes MOR activation enhanced CCR5 and additional HIV-1 entry co-receptor (CCR3 and CXCR2) expression, whereas local production of HIV-1 protective chemokines (IL-8, CCL4) was inhibited (Mahajan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR301">2002</xref>). Deletion of CCR5 significantly attenuates morphine-induced increases in astrocyte CCL2 immunoreactivity in Tat transgenic mice (El-Hage et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2008a</xref>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Interestingly, the proportion of CCL2 immunoreactive macrophages/microglia in CCL5(−/−) mice after Tat and morphine co-administration still showed a significant upregulation, suggesting CCL5 regulates Tat and morphine-induced increases in CCL2 in astrocytes, but not in microglia (El-Hage et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2008a</xref>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).
