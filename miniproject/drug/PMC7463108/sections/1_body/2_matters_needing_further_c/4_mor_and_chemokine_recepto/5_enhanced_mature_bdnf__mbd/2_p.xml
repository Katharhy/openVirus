<p id="Par47">Exogenous mBDNF treatment has been found to mimic the pro-survival effect of glial CCR5 deficiency against Tat ± morphine, and its neuroprotective effects have been supported in other neurodegenerative disease models (Cai et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2014</xref>; Xu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR553">2018</xref>). Collectively, the findings suggest that the loss of CCR5 may fundamentally change MOR signaling in HIV-exposed glia in a BDNF-dependent manner. Thus, overall the interaction of opioid and chemokine receptors, specifically MOR and CCR5, may alter the neuropathogenesis of HIV in a qualitatively unique manner not seen with either disorder alone.
