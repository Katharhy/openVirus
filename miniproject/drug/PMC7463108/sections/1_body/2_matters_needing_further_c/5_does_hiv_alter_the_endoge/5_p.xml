<p id="Par52">The effects of HIV Tat on expression levels of opioid peptide and receptor levels depend on the individual CNS region involved as well as levels of 
 <italic>tat</italic> transgene expression (Fitting et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">2010b</xref>). For example, while 
 <italic>PDYN</italic> mRNA levels were significantly reduced in the hippocampus and striatum of Tat-expressing mice, 
 <italic>POMC</italic> was only significantly reduced by Tat induction in the striatum and 
 <italic>PENK</italic> mRNA levels in the hippocampus were affected by chronic (but not acute) Tat exposure (Fitting et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">2010b</xref>). Thus, HIV may alter the endogenous opioid system by modifying the expression of opioid peptides and their receptors in a brain- and cell-type specific manner. The consequences of HIV-1-dependent alterations in the endogenous opioid system to HAND are uncertain.
