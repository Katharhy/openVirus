 <italic>PENK</italic> was downregulated in brain samples from 446 PWH compared to 67 HIV negative patients (Gelman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">2012</xref>). The subjects with HIV also expressed higher levels of interferon regulatory factor 1 (
 <italic>IRF1</italic>) transcripts. The idea that higher opioid peptide expression levels are neuroprotective has been supported in human studies and experimental animal models (Solbrig and Koob

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR452">2015</xref>; Nam et al.

 <italic>PENK</italic> expression are deleterious.
