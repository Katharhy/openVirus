<p id="Par50">Postmortem clinical studies indicate the endogenous opioid system is disrupted in neuroHIV (Gelman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">2012</xref>; Yuferov et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR558">2014</xref>). Specifically, 
 <italic>OPRK1</italic> mRNA is significantly upregulated in PWH (Yuferov et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR558">2014</xref>) and in transgenic neuroHIV rodent models (Chang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2007</xref>; Fitting et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">2010b</xref>) potentially as a compensatory neuroprotective function in response to inflammatory processes in the presence of HIV infection (Yuferov et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR558">2014</xref>). The upregulation of mRNA coding 
 <italic>OPRK1</italic> is triggered by factors released by activated macrophages and glia and is supported by mechanistic studies in dorsal root ganglia (Puehler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR408">2006</xref>; Gabrilovac et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">2012</xref>). Since leukocytes, including macrophages, can express β-endorphin and enkephalins, it is important to consider the potential influence of leukocyte-derived endogenous opioid peptides in neuroinflammation (Rittner et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR424">2001</xref>). Granulocytes express about 10-fold higher levels of β-endorphin, a preferential MOR and lower affinity KOR endogenous ligand, than lymphocytes (Pallinger and Csaba 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR377">2008</xref>). Increases in β-endorphin expression by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (Gironi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">2000</xref>; Gironi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">2003</xref>), coincide with inflammation and relapse in multiple sclerosis. Moreover, increases in inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), have been demonstrated to differentially increase the expression of proenkephalin transcripts in primary astrocytes cultured from different brain regions (Ruzicka and Akil 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR442">1997</xref>) and increase IL-10-stimulated β-endorphin expression in cultured primary microglia (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR547">2017</xref>). Interestingly, 
 <italic>OPRM1</italic> mRNA levels do not differ between HIV+ and HIV− subjects (Yuferov et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR558">2014</xref>).
