<p id="Par3">Opioid abuse in the United States (U.S.) has reached catastrophic levels. According to the latest World Drug Report, 53.4 million people worldwide used opioids in 2017, which is 56% higher than in the previous year (UNODC

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR519">c</xref>). In 2017, the burden of opioid use in the U.S. had accounted for 42 million healthy years of life lost due to premature death and disability (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR517">2019a</xref>). During 2017, there were 70,237 overdose related deaths, out of which 47,600 (67.8%) were caused by opioids, which was a 12% increase from 2016 (Scholl et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR391">2016</xref>). In fact, the opioid crisis is seen as a major roadblock in several aspects of public health, including thwarting the goal of eliminating HIV within the next decade (Fauci et al.
