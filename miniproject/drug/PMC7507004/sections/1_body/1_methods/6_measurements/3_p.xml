<p>The operational definitions of the primary endpoints, retention and viral suppression, were established according to the definitions outlined by the Eswatini Ministry of Health Integrated HIV Management Guidelines 2015 (Table 
 <xref rid="jia225610-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). See Figures 
 <xref rid="jia225610-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="jia225610-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> for further details about these definitions. The combined endpoint was defined as the date when either non‐retention in care or elevated viral load (VL) occurred, and survival time was the minimum of the times from enrolment to any events qualifying for non‐retention or elevated VL. Unlike viral suppression, which considers the patients who survived six months or more beyond ART‐initiation, the combined endpoint is a fully randomized endpoint.
