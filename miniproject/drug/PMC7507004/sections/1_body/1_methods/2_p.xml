<p>This trial was designed and conducted by the MaxART Consortium – led by the Eswatini Ministry of Health – from September 2014 to August 2017. The trial methods and power calculations have been reported elsewhere [
 <xref rid="jia225610-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>]. Briefly, we implemented a clinic‐based stepped‐wedge design in which the participating 14 clinics were randomly assigned in pairs, matched by catchment size and geographic proximity, to shift from standard of care (SoC) to EAAA at pre‐specified dates. After four months of baseline data collection in all clinics, one pair of clinics transitioned at each four‐month step. The last pair was transitioned on 1 October 2016 instead of 1 January 2017, because on the former date, Eswatini changed its SoC from CD4 ≤ 500 to EAAA. This change was approved by the trial’s Data Safety Monitoring Board, Advisory Board, Primary Research Team and the Eswatini Ministry of Health. The health workers, trial participants and trial staff were blinded to the timing of the clinic transition to minimize bias.
