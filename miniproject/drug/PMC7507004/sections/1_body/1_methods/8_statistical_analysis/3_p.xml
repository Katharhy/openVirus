<p>The combined endpoint is a means of considering the impact of the intervention on viral suppression with less need for assumptions about those missing VLs. It has been reported that 91.9% of those who report being on ART are virally suppressed [
 <xref rid="jia225610-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>]. Thus, in sensitivity analysis, we varied the unsuppression rate among those missing VLs from 5% to 10% to 20%, randomly assigning those who experience the combined endpoint through missing VL to being considered unsuppressed at the assumed percentage.
