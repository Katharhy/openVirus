<p>Under SoC, participants meeting SoC ART eligibility criteria were referred for ART initiation, while those who did not were enrolled in pre‐ART care. Pre‐ART participants received follow‐up appointments to re‐assess ART eligibility and screen for tuberculosis symptoms in three‐month intervals. Over the course of the trial, changes to the national SoC for ART eligibility were incorporated into the trial implementation. Prior to 1 December 2015, the national ART initiation threshold was CD4 ≤ 350 and/or WHO Stage 3 or 4. On 1 December 2015, the threshold changed to CD4 ≤ 500 and/or WHO Stage 3 or 4, and on 1 October 2016, Eswatini adopted EAAA as SoC.</p>
