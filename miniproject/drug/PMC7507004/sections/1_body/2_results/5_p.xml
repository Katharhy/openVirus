<p>In addition, we carried out subgroup analyses in participants eligible for ART at the time of enrolment under the current SoC (“SoC eligible”), and in participants eligible only under EAAA (“SoC ineligible”). There was strong evidence of similar rates of improvement in retention, viral suppression at six months or more after ART initiation, and the combined endpoint for both subpopulations (Table

 <xref rid="jia225610-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>). The estimated effect sizes and significance levels for both retention and viral suppression increased after multivariable adjustment (Table
