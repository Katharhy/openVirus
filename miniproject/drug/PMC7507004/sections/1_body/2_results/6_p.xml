<p>In our analysis, 74% of the unsuppressed VLs were due to the lack of any measurements six months or more following ART initiation. Among those lacking measurements, 50% of those participants were missing VL due to no clinic visits during this time, with the other 50% had missing VL despite having had a least one clinical visit in this time window. In an attempt to separate out the effects of EAAA itself from the health system capacity to conduct adequate VL monitoring, we conducted several sensitivity analyses, with multivariable‐adjusted results as follows: 1) Including only participants with VL measured after baseline, the effect of EAAA on viral suppression and ability to provide VL measurements six months or more after ART initiation among those retained was 3.60 (95% CI: 2.13 to 6.09) times higher among those under EAAA compared to SoC. 2) Considering the most extreme scenario for those missing VLs – that participants enrolled under EAAA were considered unsuppressed, and participants enrolled under SoC were considered suppressed – we found that EAAA participants were 2.09 (95% CI: 1.26 to 3.46) times as likely to be suppressed by end of follow‐up compared to SoC participants. 3) Considering that those with missing VLs six months or more following ART initiation were treated as suppressed at all clinic visits, assuming that even if there were no VLs recorded, participants were appropriately treated at their visits, results were substantially attenuated in this analysis: the steptime‐adjusted HRs (95% CI, 
 <italic>p</italic>‐value) were 1.89 (1.13 to 3.17, 0.01) compared to 14.51 (7.31 to 28.79, &lt;0.001) in the original approach. These two results can be considered an upper and lower bound on the effectiveness of EAAA on viral suppression six months post ART initiation among those retained. Since some participants attending clinic without VLs were likely unsuppressed, if all VLs were available, the findings would likely be somewhere in between these two bounds. Of course, missed clinic visits leads to non‐adherence, since the provision of medications was matched to the clinic visit schedule; thus, it is reasonable to treat missing clinic visits as unsuppressed VLs. Clearly, the strong effect of EAAA on viral suppression was both a function of the EAAA itself as well as the enhanced health system capabilities. Competing risk analysis for this endpoint produced HRs materially unchanged from the primary analysis (data not shown).
