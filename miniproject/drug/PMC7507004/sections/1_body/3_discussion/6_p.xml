<p>These real‐world limitations highlight the significant implementation challenges for the scale‐up of VL testing. The relatively poor performance in ensuring regular and timely VL testing is in line with results from public sector ART programmes in six other sub‐Saharan African countries [

Anecdotally reported reasons for the relatively poor VL testing performance included unavailability of daily sample transport, improper timing of sample pickups and a lack of centrifuge and plasma storage capabilities. Our trial was conducted under “real life” conditions. In contrast, at least two of the trials testing the effect of EAAA on HIV incidence have been carried out in a research‐grade clinical trial setting supported by dedicated trial staff. In these trials, VL testing occurred with adherence to recommended schedules that exceeded the level achieved in public‐sector provision in “real life” [
