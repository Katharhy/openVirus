    "This study presents two new concepts and definitions to the medical literature. One of those is “endogenous retinoic acid theory” and the other “retinoic acid depletion syndrome”. A new classification will be provided for the immune system: “retinoic acid-dependent component” and “retinoic acid non-dependent component”. If this theory is verified, all the diseases where the retinoic acid metabolism is defective and retinoic acid levels are low will be identified and new approaches will be developed fortreating such diseases. When the need for retinoic acids increases, such as acute infection, high fever, severe catabolic process, or chronic antigenic stimulation, cytochrome oxidase enzymes are inhibited by drugs or internal mechanisms. Metabolism and excretion of retinoic acids stored in the liver are prevented. In this way, retinoic acid levels in the blood are raised to therapeutic levels. This is called “Endogenous Retinoic Acid Theory”. Retinoic acids also manage their metabolism through feedback mechanisms. Despite compensatory mechanisms, causes such as high fever, serious catabolic process and excessively large viral genome (SARS-CoV-2), excessive use of RIG-I and Type I interferon synthesis pathway using retinoic acid causes emptying of retinoic acid stores. As a result, the RIG-I pathway becomes ineffective, Type I IFN synthesis stops, and the congenital immune system collapses. Then the immune mechanism passes to TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, MDA5 and UPS pathways in the monocyte, macrophage, neutrophil and dendritic cells of the adaptive immune defense system that do not require retinoic acid. This leads to excessive TNFα and cytokine discharge from the pathway. With the depletion of retinoic acid stores as a result of this overuse, the immune defense mechanism switches from the congenital immune system to the adaptive immune system, where retinoic acids cannot be used. As a result of this depletion of retinoic acids, the shift of the immune system to the NFκB arm, which causes excessive cytokine release, is called “retinoic acid depletion syndrome”. COVID-19 and previously defined sepsis, SIRS and ARDS are each retinoic acid depletion syndrome. We claim that retinoic acid metabolism is defective in most inflammatory diseases, particularly COVID-19 (cytokine storm) sepsis, SIRS and ARDS. Finding a solution to this mechanism will bring a new perspective and treatment approach to such diseases."
