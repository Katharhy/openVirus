 <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">Glick et al., 2020</xref>). Disruption of harm reduction programs due to COVID-19 may lead to increased sharing of injection equipment, thereby increasing the risk of HIV and HCV, and of non-injection equipment like cookers, pipes and vapes, increasing the risk of COVID-19. Harm reduction programs remain essential services, and their continued accessibility during the pandemic ensures access to sterile drug use equipment, medication-assisted treatment and overdose education and naloxone distribution. These are vital for reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission within drug using networks, managing chronic conditions such as HIV or viral hepatis, and reducing the risk of overdose among people with OUDs, especially upon community re-entry.
