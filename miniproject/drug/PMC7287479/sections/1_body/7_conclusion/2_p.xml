<p id="para0013">Criminal justice reform alone is not enough to curb COVID-19 if prevention measures are not in place upon community re-entry. Adequate discharge planning and re-entry services will be crucial for reducing community transmission of COVID-19, as well as preventing HIV, hepatitis, TB, and overdose that often accompany incarceration. We recommend jurisdictions allocate funding and other resources to temporarily quarantine inmates in empty hotels and motels to allow for adequate discharge planning that includes insurance enrollment, linkage to harm reduction and other community services to manage substance use disorders, ensure continuity of care, and temporarily relieve homelessness. COVID-19 threatens to exacerbate already existing epidemics of opioid use, HIV and inequality that have been created and sustained prior to the pandemic. This strategy offers a multi-faceted solution to a complex problem that is mutually beneficial for former inmates, their families and the greater community at large for the duration of the pandemic, and may reduce social, economic and health disparities that result from incarceration in the long run.</p>
