 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00703-f008">Figure 8</xref> summarizes the effects of combined treatments. Inhibition of at least 90% could be achieved with either oseltamivir and itraconazole single treatment. Combination treatments, except for the 10 µM oseltamivir treatment, the highest concentration used, tended to yield better inhibitory effects, and ≥90% inhibition already could be reached when 0.5 µM itraconazole was added to 0.1 µM oseltamivir (in case of pdm09) or when cells were treated with 1 µM oseltamivir (for both strains).
