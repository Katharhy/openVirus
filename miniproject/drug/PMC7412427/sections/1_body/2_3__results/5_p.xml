<p>We first compared the half-maximum effective concentration of both drugs in combination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00703-f005">Figure 5</xref>). For both virus subtypes, oseltamivir logEC
 <sub>50</sub> values were shifted toward lower concentrations required to reach EC
 <sub>50</sub> in the presence of itraconazole, and similarly shifted logEC
 <sub>50</sub> values were also found for itraconazole in combination with oseltamivir.
