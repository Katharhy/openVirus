<p>Clinical translation to exploit the effectiveness of a drug combination requires detailed knowledge of the pharmacokinetic drug profiles when given in combination, and novel combinations might be associated with hitherto unobserved side effects. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic profiles need to be complementary in order to provide the required bioavailable doses at the same time. Transferring in vitro findings into clinical applications thus remains a challenge and might require the development of novel formulations and delivery approaches. This is especially relevant in the case of itraconazole, which has low a bioavailability after oral application [

However, because the conversion into the soluble form is impaired by conditions impacting the gastric acidity such as fasting, chronic low gastric acidity, infections, and medications, effective itraconazole levels are difficult to adjust. Indeed, acidic beverages improve itraconazole absorption [

Results from our previous study exploring the benefit of itraconazole treatment in IAV-infected mice already documented the antiviral activity in vivo, and the results obtained in this study may help design trials in the treatment of influenza virus infections.
