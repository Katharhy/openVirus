<p>Combination therapy, i.e., the treatment of influenza virus infection with at least two drugs with different modes of action, is considered a promising strategy for circumventing therapy resistance, based on the notion that the virus will stay susceptible to at least one of the drugs. A wide number of studies have investigated the combinatory use of antivirals belonging to the adamantanes and NA inhibitors [

 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In this study, we explored the effect of a combinatory use of the antiviral drug oseltamivir and the host-directed anti-infective drug itraconazole on IAV infection in a cell culture model of polarized bronchial cell monolayers. Combinations of oseltamivir and itraconazole exerted significantly stronger antiviral activities compared to the respective monotherapies, and lower oseltamivir concentrations were required. Assessment of the mode of action indicated that the combination of both drugs showed additivity. The additional antiviral effect of itraconazole might safeguard patients infected with influenza strains with heightened oseltamivir resistance.
