<p>With 3–5 million severe cases worldwide and 300,000–700,000 fatalities annually, influenza virus is not only a major threat to public health, but also poses a substantial burden on health care resources. In addition to the annual epidemics, sudden and unpredictable pandemics present global health emergencies. Vaccination is a very effective measure that has been available for more than six decades [
