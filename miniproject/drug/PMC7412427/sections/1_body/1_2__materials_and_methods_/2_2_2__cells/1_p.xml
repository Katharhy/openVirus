<p>The human bronchial epithelial cell lines Calu-3 and the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) II cells were cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 10% standardized fetal bovine serum (FBS Superior; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and 1% non-essential amino acids (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Polarized Calu-3 monolayers were established on semipermeable supports with a 0.4 µm pore size (12-well format, Corning, New York, N.Y., USA) for 4 days. The transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of the confluent monolayers was measured with a Millicell-ERS (Electrical Resistance System) voltohmmeter (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) and reached around 800 Ωcm
 <sup>2</sup>. To assess polarization on the cytomorphological level, polarized cells grown to confluency were evaluated for the distribution of the tight junction-associated protein Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) as a marker for the apical surface, and the basolateral marker β-catenin. In brief, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with anti-ZO-1 antibodies (rabbit polyclonal, Invitrogen, Waltham, M.S., USA) and anti-β-catenin antibodies (mouse monoclonal, BD Transduction Laboratories, Heidelberg, Germany). Nuclei were visualized with DAPI (300 nM). Z-stacks (11 focal planes/stack) were acquired on an LSM 800 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 oil immersion objective. Images were analyzed with Imaris microscopy image analysis software (Oxford Instruments, Zurich, Switzerland).
