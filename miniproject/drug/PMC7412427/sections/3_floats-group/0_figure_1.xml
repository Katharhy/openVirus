  <p>Establishment of polarized monolayers of the airway epithelial cell line Calu-3 cultured on semipermeable supports. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured over the 4 days culture period. (
   <bold>b</bold>) 3D confocal microscopy image of polarized Calu-3 cells. To evaluate cell differentiation and polarization, the tight junction-associated protein ZO-1 (red signal) at the apical surface and the basolateral marker β-catenin (green signal) were immunostained. Nuclei were visualized with DAPI. Note the honeycomb-like ZO-1 pattern. Scale bar, 15 µm.
