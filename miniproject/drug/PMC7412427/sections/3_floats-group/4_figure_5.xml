  <p>Analysis of the anti-IAV activity of oseltamivir and itraconazole in combinatory treatments. Polarized Calu-3 monolayers were infected with 0.1 MOI of (
   <bold>a</bold>,
   <bold>c</bold>) pdm09 or (
   <bold>b</bold>,
   <bold>d</bold>) Panama for 24 h. At 2 h p.i. cells were treated with combinations of oseltamivir and itraconazole at the indicated concentrations for 16 h. Data represent mean percentages Â± SEM of inhibition, with mean virus titer in control cells (treated with the solvent DMSO) set to 100%; 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3. LogEC
   <sub>50</sub> values were determined by fitting a non-linear regression model and were compared for shared logEC
   <sub>50</sub> values.
