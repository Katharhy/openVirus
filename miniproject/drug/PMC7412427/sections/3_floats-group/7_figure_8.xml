  <p>Overview of anti-IAV activities of combination treatments with oseltamivir and itraconazole. Polarized Calu-3 monolayers were infected with 0.1 MOI of (
   <bold>a</bold>) pdm09 or (
   <bold>b</bold>) Panama for 24 h. Oseltamivir and itraconazole were added at the indicated combinations 2 h p.i. Colored cells indicate ≥90% significant reduction in viral titers. Combinations with higher inhibitory activities than the respective individual drug concentrations are highlighted in yellow. Orange cells indicate inhibition ≥90% for combinations, with the individual drug treatment reaching inhibition ≤90%. Red cells indicate combinations leading to significant cytotoxicity. Asterisks indicate significant differences in antiviral activities when the reduction in viral titers found with the combined treatments was compared to the respective oseltamivir concentration.
