    "The diagnosis of Zika virus infection is complicated and includes testing for nucleic acids and IgM and IgG antibodies, depending on the stage of infection. Zika IgG is an important marker of infection after the acute stage; however, IgG assays can lack specificity due to the similarities between Zika and other flaviviruses. In this study, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the Elecsys® Zika IgG assay were assessed in 496 samples from Zika endemic regions, and specificity only was assessed in 1685 blood screening and diagnostic samples from Zika non-endemic regions. Cross-reactivity was also assessed against a panel of 202 potentially cross-reacting samples. The performance of the Elecsys® Zika IgG assay was compared with the anti-Zika virus ELISA IgG. In the samples from the Zika endemic regions, the Elecsys® Zika IgG assay had 92.88% (95% confidence interval 89.42-95.48) sensitivity and 100% specificity and in the samples from Europe the Elecsys® Zika IgG assay specificity was ≥99.62%. The Elecsys® Zika IgG assay was highly specific in samples from both prevalent and non-endemic regions."
