<p>In 1685 routine diagnostic and blood screening samples from Europe, the Elecsys
 <sup>®</sup> Zika IgG assay had a specificity of 99.88% (95% CI, 99.57–99.99) (
 <xref rid="tropicalmed-05-00097-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The specificity was 100% in most groups and only differed in the general European blood donor group. Specificity was not reduced in patients from the high TBE vaccination status group. Due to the small number of Zika-positive samples in this cohort, it was not appropriate to assess the assay sensitivity.
