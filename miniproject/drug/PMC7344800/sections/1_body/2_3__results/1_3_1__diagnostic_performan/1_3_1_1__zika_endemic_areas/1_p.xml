<p>The Elecsys
 <sup>®</sup> Zika IgG assay was assessed in a total of 496 samples from ZIKV endemic areas. In these samples, the Elecsys
 <sup>®</sup> Zika IgG assay had 100% specificity, correctly determining 151 Zika-negative samples (
 <xref rid="tropicalmed-05-00097-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The 99 samples that were determined negative by both the Elecsys
 <sup>®</sup> Zika IgG assay and the anti-Zika virus ELISA IgG were not further tested and did not need resolution. In total, 52 samples that were confirmed negative by resolution testing were either reactive or borderline with the anti-Zika virus ELISA IgG which had 65.56% (95% CI, 57.40–73.10) specificity.
