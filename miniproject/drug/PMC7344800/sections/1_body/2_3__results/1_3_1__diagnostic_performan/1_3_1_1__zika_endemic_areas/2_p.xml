<p>To assess the sensitivity of the Elecsys
 <sup>®</sup> Zika IgG assay compared with the anti-Zika virus ELISA IgG, the 397 samples that were either concordant positive or discordant were further tested with the resolution algorithm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tropicalmed-05-00097-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The Elecsys
 <sup>®</sup> Zika IgG assay identified 287 of the 309 positive samples and was 92.88% (95% CI, 89.42–95.48) sensitive. The anti-Zika virus ELISA IgG identified all 309 samples as Zika positive or borderline and was 100% (95% CI, 98.81–100) sensitive. Of the 22 samples that were Elecsys
 <sup>®</sup> Zika IgG negative but discrepant, further testing found that 10 were positive for DENV IgG antibodies, 10 were positive for flavivirus IgGs and two samples remained inconclusive.
