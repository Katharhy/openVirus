<p>Frozen serum/plasma specimens from different populations from prevalent and non-endemic regions were used to assess the specificity of the Elecsys
 <sup>®</sup> Zika IgG assay. Samples from prevalent areas included patients from Latin America with suspected Zika infection (N = 396) and patients in the Côte d’Ivoire (N = 100). Samples from non-endemic countries included presumed negative samples from Latin America (collected prior to Zika epidemics; N = 94), samples from pregnant women from Europe (N = 500), blood donors from Europe (N = 532), and blood donors from tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) endemic regions with high TBE vaccination coverage (N = 559). All samples were obtained from the following commercial vendors: Medical Research Networx LLC, Biomex AG, Blood-Bank Innsbruck, Teragenix Inc., Biomex AG, TrinaBioreactives AG, Agencia Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitaria, and Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Indianapolis. The study was conducted according to the study protocol provided by Roche Diagnostics and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki: patient samples were fully anonymized, leftover samples that were obtained with signed informed consent and were preserved for research use.
