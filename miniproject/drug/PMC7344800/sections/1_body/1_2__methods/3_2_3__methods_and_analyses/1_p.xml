<p>The sensitivity and specificity of the Elecsys
 <sup>Â®</sup> Zika IgG assay were determined using a testing algorithm: the comparator serologic test, followed by further resolution of any discrepant samples using blocking experiments (using Zika/Dengue full length NS1 protein) and/or the

 <xref rid="B19-tropicalmed-05-00097" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The testing algorithm provided a surrogate standard for assessing diagnostic performance. Diagnostic specificity, diagnostic sensitivity, and confidence intervals ((CI) 95%, two-sided) were calculated using a validated statistical analysis system (SAS) tool (developed by Biostatistics, Roche Diagnostics GmbH).
