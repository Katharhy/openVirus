<p>Due to the similarity of ZIKV to other viruses, the Elecsys
 <sup>®</sup> Zika IgG assay was developed as a highly specific assay to limit cross-reaction and reduce the occurrence of false-positive results. The objective of this study was to evaluate the specificity of the Elecsys
 <sup>®</sup> Zika IgG assay, a qualitative one-step double-antigen sandwich (DAGS) immunoassay using recombinant ZIKV antigens, designed for the in vitro detection of anti-Zika IgG antibodies in human serum and plasma, using samples from: ZIKV prevalence areas, blood donors from Europe, pregnant women from Europe, and samples from other viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections.
