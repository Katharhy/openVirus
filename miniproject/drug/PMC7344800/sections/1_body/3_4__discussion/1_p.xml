<p>In this study, the specificity of the Elecsys
 <sup>®</sup> Zika IgG assay was high in all sample cohorts from endemic and non-endemic areas. This is important as cases of Zika are reported in both scenarios and also in the interest of being able to detect historic infection and to help predict future outbreaks of the disease [

 <xref rid="B21-tropicalmed-05-00097" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; however, in this study we found no cross-reactivity with any of the other infections that were assessed. The Elecsys
 <sup>®</sup> Zika IgG assay was also highly specific in patients with high vaccine status for TBE. In the samples from Zika endemic regions, there were no false positives using the Elecsys
 <sup>®</sup> Zika IgG assay and only two samples yielded false positives with the Elecsys
 <sup>®</sup> Zika IgG assay in this study. Further analysis of the negative Elecsys
 <sup>®</sup> Zika IgG discrepant samples from the Zika endemic region found that some were DENV positive or positive for general flavivirus. This suggests that the Elecsys
 <sup>®</sup> Zika IgG does not cross-react with DENV, which is a known problem for Zika IgG assays [

 <sup>®</sup> Zika IgG assay was designed to target antibodies to the ZIKV NS1 antigen; however, the Elecsys
 <sup>®</sup> Zika IgG assay targeted only the immunodominant wing domain in order to avoid cross-reactivity [
 <xref rid="B24-tropicalmed-05-00097" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition to the specificity shown in this study, the sensitivity of the Elecsys
 <sup>®</sup> Zika IgG was &gt;92% and was similar to that of the anti-Zika virus ELISA IgG. This suggests that the specificity of the Elecsys
 <sup>®</sup> Zika IgG assay is not improved by compromising the sensitivity of the assay. This is important as commercially available Zika assays have been shown to have either low sensitivity or specificity in a clinical setting [
