<p>SOLIDARITY trial is a study conducted by WHO and the first patients with SARS-COV-2 were already included (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). The purpose of the study is to identify the most effective antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2, between lopinavir/ritonavir (with or without interferon beta), and remdesivir and chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine). Spain and Norway are the countries that have administered the treatment, out of the 45 who have joined this project, so far. The Norwegian component of the SOLIDARITY study is registered on the official Clinical Trials platform and provides more details on the progress of the study; the first patients included in Norway are part of the proposed cohort of 700 patients, who will be randomly assigned to three study subgroups: remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, and standard (supportive) treatment. According to WHO indications, the objectives pursued are mortality, length of hospitalization, and the proportion of patients who require intensive medical support in the intensive care units. In addition, Norwegian doctors will also track the rate at which the virus is eliminated from the body (viral clearance from blood and respiratory samples) and biological markers of its impact on the body (inflammation, endothelial, and platelet activation) (
