<p>Hydroxychloroquine is a derivative of chloroquine, and significantly less (~40%) toxic (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> through an anti-inflammatory mechanism (

 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). Hydroxychloroquine (600 mg daily) was administered to patients and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily. After 6 days of treatment, 20 cases showed a significant reduction of the viral load. Interestingly, the addition of azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine significantly eliminated the virus as compared to a single therapy (
