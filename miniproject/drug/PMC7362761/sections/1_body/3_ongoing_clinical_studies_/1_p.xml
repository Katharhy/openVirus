<p>MIRACLE is the first trial to have begun in China against SARS-CoV-2. The combination of lopinavir/ritonavir protease inhibitors (marketed under the name Kaletra for the treatment of HIV infection), with or without IFNÎ², is a viable candidate in the fight against SARS-CoV-2. A team of experts from Wuhan (the city where the infection occurred) developed a good practice guide, following the management of a large number of patients (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). In addition to supportive treatment, the guide includes the use of lopinavir + ritonavir + IFN, which is supported, however, by only a low level of scientific certainty (the recommendation is based on the use of SARS and MERS infections, related to, but not identical to, SARS-CoV-2-2). Lopinavir/ritonavir acts by inhibiting the protease similar to 3-chemotrypsin, from the structure of SARS, MERS, and SARS-Cov-2. In addition to the combination with IFN, the two protease inhibitors are administered in studies and in combination with ribavirin (guanosine analog and RNA synthesis inhibitor, which within SARS-COV-2 could inhibit papain-like proteinase), emtricitabine/tenofovir (other approved therapies against HIV, which inhibit the enzyme reverse transcriptase), or with umifenovir (inhibitor of viral fusion by human cell membranes).
