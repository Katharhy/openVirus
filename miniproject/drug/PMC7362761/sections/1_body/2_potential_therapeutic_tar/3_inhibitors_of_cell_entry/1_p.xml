<p>SARS-CoV-2 can only bind to ACE2 receptors (activated mainly in people with chronic diseases, while in healthy people ACE1 receptors are activated primarily) and TMPRSS2 protease to bind S (spike) receptors of the virus to ACE2 receptors. In the cell SARS-CoV-2 needs the TMPRSS2 protease, present in the human body, to enter into cells. So, this protease is a potential target for therapeutic interventions.</p>
