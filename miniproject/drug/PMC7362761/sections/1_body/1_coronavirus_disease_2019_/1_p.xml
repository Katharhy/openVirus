<p>SARS-CoV-2 is a β-coronavirus with an envelope and genetic information in the form of an RNA. The non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are RNA polymerase, helicase, and proteases similar to 3-chemotrypsin and papain, and could be therapeutic targets. Surround the RNA molecule are the viral structural proteins, the most important of which is the S protein, which has the function of binding to the conversion enzyme of angiotensinogen II (ECA2), acting as a receptor in the case of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS viruses (
