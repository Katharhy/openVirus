<p>Several traditional herbal medicines have been reported for their plausible antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2 (

 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>–
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>). Glycyrrhizin and it derivatives from liquorice roots (

 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>). In combination with herbal preparations, indomethacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, showed potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>). These formulations might stop the replication of SARS-CoV-2 through inhibition of one or more viral proteins including SARS-CoV-23CL protease. This protease is an important factor that regulates the proteolytic processing of replicase polypeptides into functional proteins, and plays a key role in viral replication (
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>). Thus, SARS-CoV-23CL protease can be a suitable target for drug candidates against SARS-CoV.
