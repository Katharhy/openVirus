<p id="p0055">Healthcare professionals are expected to be up to date with accurate and reliable information in order to provide information with utmost accuracy and clarity. Being located at the heart of the community and easy accessibility, community pharmacies can be a valuable source of reliable and evidence-based information for consumers. Pharmacies are also among essential business sectors that continue to serve the public despite the declaration of total lockdowns in several countries.
