<p id="p0070">The media suggestions on the potential efficacy of certain drugs, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, have resulted in hoarding of the drugs in many countries. In Australia, this was accompanied by an increase in off-label prescribing and concerns about the potential shortage of hydroxychloroquine. Given the limited evidence on efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) implemented restrictions on the medical specialists that can initiate hydroxychloroquine prescribing. Further to this, TGA has released a statement highlighting the absence of approved medicines for COVID-19 treatment, therefore prescribing of any drug for this indication is considered off-label use.

 </xref> Pharmacists are in the front-line to act as stewards, and at the local level, they are involved in updating the prescribers with new legislative changes implemented by the TGA. In addition to hydroxychloroquine, there has been an increased demand in relation to adjunct treatments, such as salbutamol, ibuprofen, and paracetamol as well as pressure from the public to get more refills leading to shortages at various locations across Australia. This has resulted in enforcing new limits on dispensing of prescription and sales of over-the-counter medicines to one-month supply or one unit by the TGA in liaison with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the PSA. Again, pharmacists are on the front line enforcing these new restrictions whilst educating consumers the need for such changes during the pandemic in order to avoid medicine shortages. It is therefore imperative for pharmacists become aware of such developments to provide evidence-based information in a timely fashion.
