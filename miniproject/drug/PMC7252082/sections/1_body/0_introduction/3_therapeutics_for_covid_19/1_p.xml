<p id="p0020">Research into potential vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 commenced immediately after the outbreak, with the aim to prevent infection, reduce the transmission and/or manage the severe outcomes of the disease. The usual process of vaccine development is a long, complex process typically takes about 6–10 years to reach the markets – but currently researchers and regulators around the globe are working to accelerate this process. Nonetheless stopping this new virus may require a more aggressive approach. Repurposing existing drugs with good safety profiles and have activity against HIV, hepatitis C or similar virus strains might be the most feasible and timely approach. To this end, several clinical trials are currently underway, including in Australia, China, Japan, Europe and the USA to test the effectiveness of various drugs previously approved for other diseases for use against COVID-19.</p>
