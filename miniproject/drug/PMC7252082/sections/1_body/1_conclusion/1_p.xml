<p id="p0155">Pharmacists around the globe are currently engaged in serving their communities and helping patients cope with COVID-19 pandemic. While they are faced with this unparalleled public health crisis — fighting on multiple fronts, their authorities to test and treat are inconsistent across different jurisdictions. In addition to their routine roles, pharmacists are contributing significantly towards the overall COVID-19 pandemic control. These include rapid point of care tests for COVID-19 (varied depending on jurisdictions) and vigilant surveillance measures on suspected cases; procative steps in identifying, mitigating drug shortages, and ensuring the medicine quality; prioritized availability of up to date, reliable COVID-19 information to their communities via flyers and social media platforms; and ensuring education and home care for individuals, suspected patients, and related family members while in self isolation, including appropriate referrals for psychological support. However, COVID-19 presents the world with a parallel pandemic of falsified medicines, medical supplies and ‘infodemic’ of misinformation. While collaborative efforts and global partnerships are required to fight these pandemics, pharmacists are uniquely positioned in this battle along with other frontline health professionals.</p>
