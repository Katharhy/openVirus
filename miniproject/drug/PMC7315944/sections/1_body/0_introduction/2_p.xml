To address this global novel pandemic, WHO, scientists and clinicians in medical industries are searching for new technology to screen infected patients in various stages, find best clinical trials, control the spread of this virus, develop a vaccine for curing infected patients, trace contact of the infected patient. Recent studies identified that Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are promising technology employed by various healthcare providers as they result in better scale-up, speed-up processing power, reliable and even outperform human in specific healthcare tasks
