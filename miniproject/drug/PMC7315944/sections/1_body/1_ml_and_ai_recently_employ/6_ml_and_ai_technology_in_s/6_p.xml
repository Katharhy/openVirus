<p id="para0024">The selected review paper adopted various methodologies and technologies addressing the classical method of classification based on statistics to an advanced modern AI and ML algorithm. The use of computational tools, combined with docking application, was found to be more active in predicting the reusability of an existing old drug on Covid-19 medication and dramatically minimize the level of a risk factor in the development of medicine more cost-effective process. During this urgency, the use of ML and AI can augment the drug development process by lessening the time slot on discovering a supplementary treatment and medication for the carrier by drawing a vast probability over security, manageability, and clinical information on the existing drug compound. Issues and challenges found in this area were the limited resource of comprehensive hybrid data and real-life deployment of the application.</p>
