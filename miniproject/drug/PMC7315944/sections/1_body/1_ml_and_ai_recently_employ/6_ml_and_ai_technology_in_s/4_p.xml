<p id="para0022">A novel molecule transformer-drug target interaction model was proposed jointly by researchers from the US and Korea to tackle the need for an antiviral drug that can treat the Covid-19 virus 
 <xref rid="bib0043" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. The study compares the accessible virtual screening and molecular docking application called AutoDock Vina with the proposed model employing a deep learning algorithm on 3C-like proteinase of Covid-19 and FDA approved 3,410 existing drugs available in the market. The result revealed that a popular antiretroviral drug used to treat HIV called Antazanavir (Kd of 94.94 nM) is the best drug for Covid-19 medication, followed by Remdisivir (Kd of 113.13 nM). Furthermore, results revealed that some medications like darunavir, ritonavir, and lopinavir were outlined to tackle viral proteinases. It was also found that various antiviral compounds like Kaletra might be utilized for the medicine of Covid-19 human patients.
