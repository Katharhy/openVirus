<p id="para0023">A group of researchers from the USA discovered an antiviral drug for treating the Ebola virus. The discovery was first active in the year 2014 
 <xref rid="bib0044" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, starting with ML and AI-based pharmacophore computational analyzing on a limited size of in vitro infected carriers of the Ebola virus. The study proposed an amodiaquine and chloroquine compound popularly used to treat the malaria virus. Furthermore, after uncovering a decade of drug development based on ML and AI technology, a fusion of computational screening method with docking application and machine learning for choosing supplementary medication to investigate on SARS-CoV-2 was proposed 
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Researchers refer to the successful discovery of Ebola 
 <xref rid="bib0044" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, and the Zika virus 
 <xref rid="bib0046" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> experience gain belief that the same model could be repeatedly utilized for drug discovery on Covid-19 and future virus pandemic ahead.
