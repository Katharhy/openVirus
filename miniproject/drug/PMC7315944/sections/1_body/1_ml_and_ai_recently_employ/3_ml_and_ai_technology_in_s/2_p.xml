Fast diagnosis and screening process helps prevent the spread of pandemic diseases like SARS-CoV-2, cost-effective, and speed up the related diagnosis. The development of an expert system for health care assists in the new order of identification screening and management of SARS-CoV-2 carrier by more cost-effective compared to the traditional method. ML and AI are used to augment the diagnosis and screening process of the identified patient with radio imaging technology akin to Computed Tomography (CT), X-Ray, and Clinical blood sample data. In this regard, 
 <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">TableÂ 1</xref> shows selective information on diagnosis and screening proposed for the Coronavirus disease. The healthcare expert can use radiology images like X-ray and CT scans as routine tools to augment traditional diagnosis and screening. Unfortunately, the performance of such devices is moderate during the high outburst of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this regard, studies 
 <xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> show the potential of AI and ML tools by suggesting a new model that comes with rapid and valid method SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using Deep Convolutional Network. The study shows that diagnosis utilizing an expert system employing AI and ML on 1020 CT images of 108 Covid-19 infected patients along with viral pneumonia of 86 patients, the remarkable performance suggests the use of the convolutional neural network (Resnet-101) as an adjuvant tool for radiologist resulting 86.27%, 83.33% of accuracy and specificity respectively.
