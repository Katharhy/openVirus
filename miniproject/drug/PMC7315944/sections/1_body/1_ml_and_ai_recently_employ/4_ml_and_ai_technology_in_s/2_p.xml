<p id="para0016">If a person diagnoses and is confirmed with Covid-19, the next important step is contact tracing prevention of the wider spread of the disease. According to WHO, the infection spreads from person-to-person primarily through saliva, droplets, or discharges from the nose through contact transmission 
 <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. To take control on the spread of SARS-Cov-2, contact tracing is an essential public health tool used to break the chain of virus transmission 
 <xref rid="bib0033" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The process of contact tracing is to identify and manage people who are recently exposed to an infected Covid-19 patient to avoid further spread. Generally, the process identifies the infected person with a follow-up for 14 days since the exposure. If employed thoroughly, this process can break the transmission chain of the current novel coronavirus and suppress the outbreak by giving a higher chance of adequate controls and helping reduce the magnitude of the recent pandemic. In this regard, various infected countries come up with a digital contact tracing process with the mobile application, utilizing different technologies like Bluetooth, Global Positioning System (GPS), Social graph, contact details, network-based API, mobile tracking data, card transaction data, and system physical address. The digital contact tracing process can perform virtually real-time and much faster compared to the non-digital system. All these digital apps are designed to collect individual personal data, which will be analyzed by ML and AI tools to trace a person who is vulnerable to the novel virus due to their recent contacted chain.
