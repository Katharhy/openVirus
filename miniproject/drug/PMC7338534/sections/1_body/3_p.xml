<p id="Par5">For years, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have subsidized molecular testing in the developing world. One such program, the introduction of “all-in-one cartridge” systems for RNA sample isolation and PCR-based testing, has been used for HIV and tuberculosis diagnosis

 </sup>. Importantly, this platform has a higher cost and lower throughput than other PCR-based approaches. It allows the processing of only up to four samples per run, severely limiting its utility for COVID-19 and HIV PCR-based testing in larger communities. Moreover, governmental laboratories with RNA testing capabilities are currently saturated in many low- and middle-income countries
