<p id="Par6">Regulations worldwide have forbidden paid organ and tissue donations for decades. Yet, these measures remain far from effective, particularly, in the developing world

Plasma donations are compensated with thousands of dollars, several times the local average monthly salary, and can be performed once a week. Patients who recover following convalescent plasma infusion are then encouraged to donate their plasma. In addition to resembling a pyramid-type scheme, such practice does not have a solid scientific rationale, as these patients are highly unlikely to have developed any neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. In fact, even among individuals who recover from SARS-CoV-2 on their own, one-third have low or undetectable neutralizing antibody titers
