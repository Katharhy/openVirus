<p>In conclusion, all these data provide important insights to better understand the early spreading mechanisms of COVID-19, and to direct scientific research toward the study of the existing antimalarials drugs (e.g., chloroquine, amodiaquine, mefloquine, or doxycycline). Further studies should be carried out promptly to verify the hypothesis presented here without overlooking the innumerable advantages given by the implementation of a suitable strategy in the shortest possible time frame. Delaying such studies could lead to unbearable loss in terms of human lives and economic resources.</p>
