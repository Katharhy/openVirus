<p id="Par40">EV-positive epidemics are similar in terms of age and gender distribution and other factors worldwide. Overall, this entity remains a rather benign form of meningitis with a rather short length of stay in hospital, but may be associated with complicated courses that may lead to persistent neurological disability or even death. Routine CSF testing (pleocytosis, protein level) may not be suitable to distinguish EV-positive and EV-negative cases, but CSF protein level may correlate with hospitalization.
