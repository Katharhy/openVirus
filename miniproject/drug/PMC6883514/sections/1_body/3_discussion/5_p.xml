<p id="Par36">Our data indicate that the course of EV-positive meningitis is predominantly benign, and that hospitalization time was significantly shorter in EV-positive, compared to EV-negative cases. This was also the case, when we did not consider the above-mentioned meningitis cases that received specific antiviral therapy (varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus 2). Moreover, a higher ratio of affected children and young adults were found in EV-positive cases. This could be explained by affected parents of young, diseased children. Hence, earlier convalescence in EV-positive groups may be explained by differences of age between both groups rather than different courses of the disease in general. In our cohort, routine CSF analysis (pleocytosis, protein level) is not a useful tool to discriminate between EV-positive and negative cases, but CSF protein level may correlate with length of stay in hospital.</p>
