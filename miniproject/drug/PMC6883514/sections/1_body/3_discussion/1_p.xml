<p id="Par32">Enteroviruses are highly neurotropic and can manifest as meningitis, meningoencephalitis, poliomyelitis-like anterior myelitis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In our cohort, enteroviral infections were associated with meningitis. The prevalence of enteroviral meningitis is high worldwide (estimated 75,000 cases annually in the United States) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which makes this type of meningitis highly relevant to both caregivers and patients. We were able to show that the rate of infection peaks in the summer and early autumn months (June, July and August; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). With age, the incidence of enteroviral meningitis decreases. Therefore, the incidence is highest in infants and toddlers [

 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
