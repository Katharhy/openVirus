<p id="Par39">The mean age of EV-positive patients in our centers was 15 (3.25; 32.75) years, which accurately fits to previous data of Shandong [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and Finland [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] (Finland 2009 15 years 8 months, Finland 2010 17 years 6 months, Shandong 2014 children within 15 years of age). The mean age of EV-negative pediatric patients (8 (7.25; 14.75) years) in our cohort was quite similar to that in a large South Korean pediatric cohort (8.4 ± 5 years) [
