<p id="Par33">The following findings and assumptions of our study are of significant interest, as they stress differences between EV-positive and EV-negative meningitis and may be of relevance for the treating physician: Overall, caregivers may expect shorter hospitalization times in EV-positive meningitis cases. Furthermore, routine CSF parameters that may already be determined in the emergency unit are not a sufficient tool to discriminate between EV-positive and EV-negative meningitis. When caregivers experience an unusual accumulation of aseptic meningitis cases in the summer and early autumn, patients should be tested for enterovirus infections and cases should be reported to the authorities. Contrary to previous studies regarding viral meningitis in general our data show that EV-positive meningitis is rather associated with a benign disease course.</p>
