<p id="Par21">We identified 72 EV-positive cases (31 females, 41 males) with a median age of 15 (3.25; 32.75) years. Among these 72 patients, 38 (52.8%) were echovirus-positive (18 pediatric and 20 adult cases, median age 18.5 (5.25; 31.25) years; echovirus 18 (1), echovirus 2 (1), echovirus 30 (31), echovirus 33 (1), echovirus 9 (4)), 1 patient was enterovirus 71 (EV-A71)-positive, 1 patient was coxsackie A9-positive, 1 patient was enterovirus B-positive and the specific enterovirus species of the remaining 31 EV-positive cases remained unknown or were not further typed, as not enough CSF was available for further analysis. EV-positive meningitis cases peaked in July/August (Fig.Â

Among EV-negative cases, three were related to varicella zoster infection, one to herpes simplex 2 and no virus could be identified in the other patients.
