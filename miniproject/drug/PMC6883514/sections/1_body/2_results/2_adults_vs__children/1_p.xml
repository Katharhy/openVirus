<p id="Par26">A significantly higher ratio of children was found in the enterovirus-positive cohort, compared to the enterovirus negative group (38/72 vs. 4/45, Chi-Square-test, adj. 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Children (both EV-positive and EV-negative) had a shorter period of hospitalization (adj. 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and lower CSF protein levels than adults (adj. 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference of CSF cell counts (Mann-Whitney
