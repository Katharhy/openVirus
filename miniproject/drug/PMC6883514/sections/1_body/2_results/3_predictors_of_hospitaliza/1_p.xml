<p id="Par28">In general, the duration of inpatient stay correlated with age (Spearman’s Rho correlation coefficient 0.418, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), CSF total protein (Spearman’s Rho correlation coefficient 0.319, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and the delay from symptom onset to lumbar puncture (Spearman’s Rho correlation coefficient 0.232, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.023). For nominal variables, enterovirus status (η = − 0,32) correlated with the duration of inpatient stay. In contrast, echovirus status, gender, and location (Neurological center the patient was treated) did not show a relevant correlation with the duration of the inpatient stay (| η | &lt; 0,3).
