<p id="Par12">Periodic aseptic meningitis epidemics can be a challenge in patient- and health care. A large retrospective analysis of a US-American cohort revealed that in 21% of cases the etiology of aseptic meningitis remains unknown [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] by an inflammation of the leptomeninx in which the causative agent cannot be identified by cerebrospinal fluid culture [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Viruses are the most common causes of this disease [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Viral meningitides are predominantly caused by enteroviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which belong to the picornaviridae consisting of species A-D. The main route of infection is fecal-oral, but infestation of the respiratory tract and a droplet infection are also possible. In previous studies, viral meningitis in adults was rather associated with herpes simplex and West Nile virus, whereas children were more likely to be tested positive for enterovirus (EV) [

Therefore, multiple studies have been conducted in order to better understand this phenomenon: A Danish nation-wide prospective observational study between 1st of January 2015 and 30th of June 2016 revealed an unfavorable outcome of viral meningitis in 17% of all patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. According to a UK study, the infection rates of viral meningitis are mainly driven by an EV predominance of echovirus 30 [
