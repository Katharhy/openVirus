<p id="Par16">We conducted a retrospective chart review study at the Departments of Neurology of the Heinrich-Heine University Düsseldorf, the University Hospital of Cologne, the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin and the Department of General Pediatrics, Neonatology and Pediatric Cardiology of the Heinrich-Heine University Düsseldorf searching for all patients with aseptic CNS infection in 2013. The study was approved by the ethics committee, University of Düsseldorf (registry number 4423). We used ICD-10 codes to identify cases of interest. As such, priority was given to the ICD-10 keys A87 and G02 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, as patient data may not have been in the categories listed above due to less precise encryption despite manifest illness, a wider query was additionally performed to identify all patient data encoded as A85-A89 (Other viral encephalitis, not elsewhere classified; Unspecified viral encephalitis; Viral meningitis; Other viral infections of central nervous system, not elsewhere classified; Unspecified viral infection of central nervous system, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and G02–05 (Meningitis in other infectious and parasitic diseases classified elsewhere; Meningitis due to other and unspecified causes; Encephalitis, myelitis and encephalomyelitis; Encephalitis, myelitis and encephalomyelitis in diseases classified elsewhere, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Virological testing of CSF for enteroviruses was performed in a standardized manner by the National Reference Laboratory for Poliomyelitis and Enteroviruses at the Robert Koch Institute.
