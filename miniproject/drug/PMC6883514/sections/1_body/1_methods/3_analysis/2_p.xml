<p id="Par19">In order to put this data in perspective, we performed a query of the German-wide database of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI; EVSurv) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] of all EV-positive meningitis cases in 2013. Data was obtained in the context of the National Enterovirussurveillance, which is based on voluntary reporting and investigation of hospitalized patients with suspected aseptic meningitis/encephalitis and/or acute flaccid paralysis. All samples were tested at the RKI using RT-nested PCR with the primers targeting the 5′NCR gene, as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. All PCR products were sequenced and - based on the resulting EV species - tested with species-specific PCR assays in the VP1 region for typing as recently described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].
