<p id="Par20">Statistical analyses were performed as indicated using SPSS Version 20 (IBM Corp. NY, USA); non-parametric testing was performed since all investigated variables were non-normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk-test); 
 <italic>p</italic> values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. If not specified otherwise, data are provided as median (25th; 75th percentile). Furthermore, a Chi-Square-test was performed in order to compare adults with children and a Spearman’s correlation was performed in order to explore predictors of hospitalization. Adjusted 
 <italic>p</italic>-values (adj. p) were calculated using Bonferroni correction, values below 0.05 were considered significant. To enhance readability of the results section, significant values are provided in three categories: &lt; 0.05, &lt; 0.01, and &lt; 0.001, respectively. Finally, a multivariate, stepwise linear regression was performed in order to extract variables of potential predictive value for the time of hospitalization.
