<p id="par0195">The first known case of SARS occurred in southern China in November 2002 [
 <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The disease spread to more than 30 countries, infected over 8000 individuals, and resulted in about 800 deaths [
 <xref rid="bib0400" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. SARS-CoV-1 was identified as the causative agent [
 <xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0785" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>] and the pandemic was controlled in less than four months through the measures of infection control instead of drug prevention or therapy [
 <xref rid="bib1070" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>]. During the SARS outbreak, ribavirin was most frequently used to inhibit viral RNA synthesis [
 <xref rid="bib0370" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Ribavirin is a guanosine analog that inhibits guanosine-triphosphate (GTP) synthesis, viral mRNA capping, and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [
 <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. At the time, ribavirin was used for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy [
 <xref rid="bib1165" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>] and pediatric respiratory syncytial viral (RSV) infection [
 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The reported uses of ribavirin in SARS cases showed conflicting results with numerous methodological issues and its effect could not be distinguished from other treatments such as corticosteroids or other antivirals. Ribavirin treatment for SARS was not tested in clinical trials, so its efficacy remains to be assessed [
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0835" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. Since the SARS outbreak 17 years ago, all antiviral drugs or vaccines tested in controlled trials have shown to be ineffective [
 <xref rid="bib1175" ref-type="bibr">235</xref>] and lack translation in antiviral efficacy from pre-clinical studies to human patients [
 <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Below we discuss the current developments in peptide-based therapies, vaccines, and detection methods specific to SARS-CoV-1 and how they can help fill the 17-year void.
