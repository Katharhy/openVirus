<p id="par0215">Currently, SARS-CoV-1 infection is diagnosed by detection of viral RNA in clinical samples by qRT-PCR, serological detection of specific antibody to SARS-CoV-1, and virus growth in cell culture, which requires a biosafety level III facility [

 <sub>603âˆ’634</sub> and N1 peptide immunogens could also be used as a tool for detecting SARS-CoV-1 antibodies in patient serological samples. PL8 (PSSKRFQPFQQFGRDVSDFTDSVRDPKTSE) showed a 70 % positive response rate to sera from diagnosed SARS patients and 5% false-positive response to uninfected individuals, suggesting that further development is needed to optimize the peptide sequence for accurate diagnosis [
