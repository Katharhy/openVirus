<p id="par0210">SARS-CoV-1 vaccines can be used to prevent viral infection and transmission thereby aid in the control of outbreaks. Inactive virus particles generated by formaldehyde, UV light, and β-propiolactone were common strategies to serve as vaccines [
 <xref rid="bib0515" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>] and tested for safety in Phase I clinical trials in China [
 <xref rid="bib0615" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Despite the promising safety results, these candidate vaccines induced an immunopathologic respiratory disease in small animal studies when the immunized mice were challenged with SARS-CoV-1 [
 <xref rid="bib0990" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>]. Consequently, attention was diverted to other approaches. Synthetic peptides that overlapped the entire S protein were tested against antisera from small animals immunized with inactive SARS-CoV-1 sera and from SARS patients [
 <xref rid="bib0440" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The results revealed a major immunodominant epitope of S protein at residues 528−635. Therefore, the synthetic peptide S
 <sub>603−634</sub> was generated and showed to react with sera from all SARS patients, but not with control serum samples from healthy donors or hepatitis patients. This approach was shown to be effective to design and optimize peptide-based vaccines against SARS and to provide a potential antigen for diagnostic application. In another study, bioinformatic analysis was employed for vaccine development using peptides from the major structural N protein [
 <xref rid="bib0620" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Two peptides, N1 and N2, were predicted to have similar Antigenic Index (AI) to induce antibody generation. Rabbits immunized with synthetic N1 and N2 peptides produced specific antibodies against both peptides. Only N1 peptide-induced antiserum showed strong binding to recombinant SARS-CoV-1 N protein by western blot. The immunogen N1 peptide reacted to sera of SARS patients in ELISA, suggesting that N1 peptide could serve as the epitope of the N protein to induce an immune response.
