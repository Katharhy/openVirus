<p id="par0190">Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by SARS coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1), a subgroup B betacoronavirus. The SARS-CoV-1 genome consists of 29.7 Kb positive-stranded RNA composed of replicase and structural regions [
 <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The replicase region encodes two polyproteins that contain 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1 through nsp16) required for viral replication and transcription. The polyproteins are cleaved into individual functional proteins by two proteases, papain-like protease (PL
 <sup>pro</sup>) and 3C-like protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> or M
 <sup>pro</sup>) [
 <xref rid="bib0945" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. The structural region encodes four primary structural proteins; spike protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N) along with several accessory proteins that interfere with the host innate immune response with unknown or poorly understood function. The viral infection begins when the S protein binds to the host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This allows cellular entry where the viral RNA genome is released, transcribed, and translated. The newly formed viral proteins and genomic RNA assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum-golgi intermediate compartment and fuse to the plasma membrane releasing the virus [
