<p id="par0205">Targeting viral proteases has been exploited for peptide antiviral drug therapies. Molecular modeling and docking studies were used to identify an octapeptide AVLQSGFR that docked to the viral M
 <sup>pro</sup> protease [
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The peptide acted as an enzyme inhibitor with confirmed antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-1 [
 <xref rid="bib0340" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The octapeptide showed a dose-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-1 in Vero E6 cell-based assays with low toxicity, suggesting that it can serve as a starting scaffold for an effective SARS-CoV-1 protease inhibitor. In addition, the peptide P9 (NGAICWGPCPTAFRQIGNCGHFKVRCCKIR), mentioned earlier, exhibits antiviral effects against multiple respiratory viruses including influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-1. By binding to the viral glycoprotein, P9 was able to alter endosomal acidification, block viral membrane fusion, and RNA viral release [
 <xref rid="bib1155" ref-type="bibr">231</xref>]. P9 showed efficacy in cell-based assays and viral load reduction in small animal models when used as prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-1. The potential peptide-based therapies for SARS are summarized in
