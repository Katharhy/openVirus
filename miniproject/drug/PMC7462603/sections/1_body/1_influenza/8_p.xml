<p id="par0080">Novel peptide discoveries are facilitated by the use of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> peptide selection platforms. Peptide f1 (ARLSPTMVHPNGAQP) was identified from the phage library and inhibited the interaction of sialylglyco-conjugate receptors on the host cell surface with viral HA protein. Optimized f1 was an alkylated peptide (C-18-s2(1−5) C
 <sub>17</sub>H
 <sub>35</sub>CO-ARLPR-NH) with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.9 μM and 1.6 μM for H1N1 and H3N2, respectively. The alkylation was implemented to enhance inhibitory activity through multivalency. The docking simulation suggested that the peptide makes the same hydrogen bond interactions with HA as the sialic acid [

The peptide bound to NA with nanomolar affinity and inhibited H1N1 infection at μM concentration in MDCK cells. Administration of the peptide in infected mice reduced virus-induced inflammation, lung tissue damage, and mortality [
