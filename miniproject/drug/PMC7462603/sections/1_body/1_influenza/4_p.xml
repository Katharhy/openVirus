<p id="par0060">Naturally occurring AMPs, such as defensins and cathelicidins, provide great starting scaffolds for drug development. Mouse β-defensin-4 (mBD4) has been shown to have antiviral activity against influenza A virus (H5N1 and H1N1). Truncations of mBD4 identified a 30-residue long peptide P9 that interacted with HA at high affinity. Pretreatment of P9 with the virus was shown to alter endosomal acidification and inhibit viral RNA release and replication. Potent antiviral activities of P9 against influenza viruses (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N7, H7N9) were reported in MDCK cells and mice [

Tripathi and colleagues have shown that the helical fragment of LL-37, a human cathelicidin, is essential for its antiviral activity. Helical fragment of LL-37 showed greater activity in viral reduction with H1N1 strain (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 3.2 μM) than the full-length LL-37 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 11.3 μM) [
