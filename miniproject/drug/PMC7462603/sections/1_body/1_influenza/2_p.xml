<p id="par0050">Influenza (flu), a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by influenza virus, is classified into three types: influenza A, B, and C. Influenza types A and B are the major causes of the seasonal epidemics [
 <xref rid="bib0460" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] and caused 36 million illnesses during the 2018â€“2019 flu season [
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Two viral capsid proteins, Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) play key roles during viral infection [

 <xref rid="bib0935" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. Based on the different combinations of HA and NA proteins, influenza A and B viruses are further classified into different groups and subtypes [
 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. HA is presented on the viral surface as a homotrimer composed of HA1 and HA2 subunits linked by a disulfide bond. The infection event is triggered by HA1 binding to sialylated receptors on the host cell surface. Upon binding, the virus enters the host cell by endocytosis. The acidic environment of the endosome induces conformational changes in HA2, resulting in exposure of the fusion initiation region (FIR). This allows FIR to interact with the host endosomal membrane. This is followed by the interaction of matrix-2 (M2) ion channel with the viral envelope and release of viral ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) and genome into the host cell cytosol. The viral RNA is then replicated, translated, and assembled into viral particles. Virus particles then leave the host cells by budding out when NA cleaves sialic acid to enable viral release [
