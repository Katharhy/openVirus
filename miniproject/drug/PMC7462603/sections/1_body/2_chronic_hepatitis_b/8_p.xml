 <italic>de novo</italic> peptide inhibitors of virus pre-S1 were also investigated for the treatment of CHB. A short peptide B10 (SGSGLRNIRST) was identified by the phage peptide library selection against pre-S1 (1–60). The peptide disrupted the interaction of HBV with human hepatocyte carcinoma cells [
 <xref rid="bib0435" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. B10 was optimized based on the key motif (LRNIR) to generate a concatemer 4B10 (LRNIRLRNIRLRNIRLRNIR) with three-fold stronger affinity to pre-S1 (28–42) of HBV. Peptide 4B10 was shown to inhibit HBV infection in both primary tupaia and human hepatocytes [

In a separate study, a 12-residue random phage library was selected against pre-S1 region (21–47) resulting in the discovery of peptides with a common linear motif (WTXWW) specific for pre-S1. The common motif was used to identify novel membrane and extracellular proteins that are involved in HBV infection such as lipoprotein lipase [
