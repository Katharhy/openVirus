<p id="par0150">Peptides are also used for the diagnosis of HBV. Traditionally, HBV DNA can be detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HBsAg and HBcAg can be detected using immunostaining. Queiroz de Souza and colleagues designed a recombinant peptide complex (rMEHB) by assembling four conserved HBcAg epitopes (epitope 1: 61–83 aa; epitope 2: 107–118 aa; epitope 3: 128–133 aa; and epitope 4: 134–145 aa). rMEHB exhibited high sensitivity as a detection agent in ELISA by presenting multiple epitopes for binding to the anti-hepatitis B core antibody [
