<p id="par0145">Peptide-based vaccines have been developed to prevent HBV infection in healthy individuals. It should be noted that in one study, HBsAg (113–135) derived peptides, a B-cell epitope, were displayed on a novel chimeric virus-like particle carrier that was derived from the truncated roundleaf bat HBcAg. The carrier was further optimized by the introduction of one CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell epitope and two CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes. The resulted construct was shown to induce a specific antibody response to the HBsAg (113–135) with enhanced T cell response. In addition, the particle induced a lasting response resulting in the virus DNA clearance in mouse model, and effective antibody production in rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys [

A grass pollen allergy vaccine, BM32, containing a pre-S domain (pre-S1 and pre-S2) fused with allergen-derived peptides, has previously been shown to induce preS-specific immune responses. It was tested for HBV-specific immune responses and was shown to be successful in inducing IgG antibodies against HBV. BM32 also protected rabbits from HIV infection as effectively as the approved vaccine Engerix-B [

These include Pediarix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals), VAXELIS (MSP Vaccine Company), Twinrix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals), Recombivax HB (Merck &amp; Co, Inc), ENGERIX-B (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals), and HEPLISAV-B (Dynavax Technologies Corporation).
