<p id="par0115">Peptides have also demonstrated significant potential in interrupting virus infection in preclinical research. HBsAg is composed of three types of envelope glycoproteins: large (L) protein with pre-S1, pre-S2 and S domain; middle (M) protein with pre-S2 and S domain; and Small (S) protein with S domain only. The pre-S1 domain initiates virus infection by binding to the host receptor called sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) and the low-affinity HBV co-receptor heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) [
