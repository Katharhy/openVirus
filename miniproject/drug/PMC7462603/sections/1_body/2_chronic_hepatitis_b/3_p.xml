<p id="par0105">The current FDA-approved treatment for CHB is based on two main strategies: 1) block HBV replication using nucleoside or nucleotide analogs such as tenofovir and entecavir, which suppress polymerase activity, inhibit reverse transcription of viral RNAs, and stop the synthesis of cccDNA; 2) stimulate the immune response directly using Interferon α (IFN-α) or pegylated interferon. Nucleoside or nucleotide analogs are fast-acting and induce minimal drug resistance with a 90 % relapse rate within a year after treatment is stopped. IFN-α was expected to provide a gold standard therapy due to its immunomodulating function. However, only a moderate response rate (30–40 %) was observed in the clinic [
