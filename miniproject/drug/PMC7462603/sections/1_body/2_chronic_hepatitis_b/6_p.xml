<p id="par0120">Novel NTCP binding macrocycles of 6â€“17 residues were identified from a random peptide integrated discovery screening platform. Among the top ten candidates that were selected based on unique sequences, some showed sub-micromolar IC
 <sub>50</sub> for inhibiting HBV cell entry in hepatocytes, five-fold more potent than CsA in the same assay [
 <xref rid="bib0780" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. Another example is a 47-mer lipopeptide derived from pre-S1, Myrcludex-B, that binds to NTCP and inhibit HBV infection in cell culture and animal models [

 <xref rid="bib0380" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0795" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. Liposomal formulation of Myrcludex B allows for oral administration and has been investigated as a hepatitis B peptide drug in the clinic [
 <xref rid="bib0995" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>]. A Phase IIa clinical evaluation of Myrcludex-B in patients with HBeAg Negative CHB was completed in 2018 (NCT02881008). The clinically used immunosuppressant, Cyclosporin A (CsA), has also been shown to bind to NTCP and efficiently block HBV in cell entry [

In the search of additional NTCP binders, Donkers and colleagues screened Prestwick Chemical Library, comprised of 1280 approved and off-patented drugs with known safety information. The five most potent drugs were tested in the HBV infection assay using human hepatic cell line HepaRG. They are the antidiabetic insulin sensitizer Rosiglitazone, the leukotriene inhibitor zafirlukast for asthma, antihistamines, and decongestants TRIAC targeting thyroid hormone receptor, glutathione transferase inhibitor sulfasalazine for inflammation, and pain and vital dye Chicago Sky Blue 6B. All five drugs were shown to block HBV infection at similar levels of potency. Although, Donker's unique approach suggested an efficient way for developing HBV prevention medicine [
