<p id="par0125">The host receptor, HSPG binds to pre-S1 to initiate the viral integration to host cells. This is followed by the interaction between HBV and the high-affinity receptor NTCP for endocytosis [

 <xref rid="bib0420" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Liu and colleagues designed an array of pre-S1 truncations displayed on liposomes (LPs). The cellular attachment of the truncations was tested and the fragment pre-S1 (30â€“42) was identified with the highest affinity to mimic the binding of HBV to HSPG. It was shown that the complex targeted liver cells and induced endocytosis. The results also offered a promising approach for the specific delivery of HBV drugs to human liver cells [
