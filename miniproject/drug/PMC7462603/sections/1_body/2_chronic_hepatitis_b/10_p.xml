<p id="par0140">Another strategy for treating CHB patients is using vaccine-based therapies. Due to the immune tolerance of CHB patients, vaccine-based therapies can help restore the immune response for viral elimination [
 <xref rid="bib0710" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. A pilot study of a peptide-based T cell vaccine, CY-1899, was tested on 19 patients with CHB. This vaccine is composed of a palmitic acid linked peptide with the sequence of the T cell epitope. CY-1899 failed to induce vigorous cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity or viral clearance possibly due to T-cell exhaustion in CHB patients [

 <sup>+</sup> T-cell epitopes and three CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell epitopes. In a healthy state, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> helper T-cells enhance the immune response regulated by CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells. Activated CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells release inflammatory cytokines resulting in killing the infected host cells. In CHB patients, CD8 
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells are not activated properly by mitogenic stimuli. However, the study showed that human monocyte-derived dendritic cells presented fragments of SLP as antigens to activate CD8
 <sup>+</sup> and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells
