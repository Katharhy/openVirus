<p id="par0040">Peptides can be divided into two groups: natural and synthetic. Natural peptides, such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), have been shown to present antiviral and immunosuppressant activity and are reviewed extensively [
 <xref rid="bib0670" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Other examples of natural peptides include hormones, neurotransmitters, and immunomodulators [
 <xref rid="bib1130" ref-type="bibr">226</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0970" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>]. Alternatively, synthetic peptides are 
 <italic>de novo</italic> peptides that are conceptualized by rational designs or discovered by the use of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> peptide discovery platforms such as phage and mRNA display [

 <xref rid="bib1090" ref-type="bibr">218</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Both natural and synthetic peptides can contain proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids as building blocks, which can improve the pharmacokinetic properties and enhance their efficacy and safety profiles [
