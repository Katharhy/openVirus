<p id="par0035">Viruses propagate only inside the living cell and their lifecycles include five stages: attachment to the host cell, fusion/cell entry, replication inside the host cell, assembly, and release from the host cell [
 <xref rid="bib0655" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. A significant number of antiviral agents have been developed to target host cell receptors and/or stages of the viral lifecycle. These antiviral agents can be divided into six classes, including nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors, integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, fusion inhibitors, and coreceptor antagonists [
 <xref rid="bib0655" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. While current drugs have shown to be effective in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with the viral infection, the rapid mutation rate in the viral genome enables viruses to quickly adapt and develop drug resistance [
 <xref rid="bib0490" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. This challenge emphasizes the need for the discovery and development of novel molecules, such as peptide-based agents.
