<p id="par0250">Kalita and team utilized a similar 
 <italic>in silico</italic> approach to design a multi-peptide subunit-based epitope vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine contained human Î²-defensin as an adjuvant and 33 highly antigenic epitopes of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte, helper T-lymphocyte, and B-cell linked by specific linkers [

 <xref rid="bib0910" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0405" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Further, computational analysis suggested that the multi-epitope subunit vaccine was non-toxic, thermostable, and immunogenic [

 <xref rid="bib0860" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib1050" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>]. Molecular docking and dynamics studies validated the stability of the vaccine construct [

 <xref rid="bib0545" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>] and 
 <italic>in silico</italic> cloning proposed potential expression in microbial expression system [
 <xref rid="bib0390" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The extensive bioinformatics data suggest that the multi-epitope based subunit vaccine has a high probability of protective efficacy and safety against SARS-CoV-2. However, its synthesis and experimental evaluation have to be conducted to validate the predictions. Additionally, it is important to note that there are on-going efforts to generate peptide-based vaccines specific to SARS-CoV-2 with the internal discovery platforms from Generex, Vaxil, IMV Inc., and Axon Neuroscience.
