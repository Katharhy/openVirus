<p id="par0240">The PL
 <sup>pro</sup> and M
 <sup>pro</sup> enzymes of SARS-CoV-2 are also targets for peptide-based inhibitors. Through the use of a combinatorial library, one group has developed peptide inhibitors against M
 <sup>pro</sup> and PL
 <sup>pro</sup> [
 <xref rid="bib0900" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0895" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>]. Substrates for both proteases were identified using a library that contained proteogenic and non-proteogenic amino acids. The best substrate candidates were then converted into peptide inhibitors through the addition of irreversible reactive group at the C-terminus, resulting in M
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitor QS1 (Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-VS), and PL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors VIR251 and VIR250 (Ac-hTyr-Dap-Gly-Gly-VME and Ac-Abu(Bth)-Dap-Gly-Gly-VME, respectively). Kinetic analysis of these peptides against the SARS- CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> and PL
 <sup>pro</sup> indicated inhibition.
