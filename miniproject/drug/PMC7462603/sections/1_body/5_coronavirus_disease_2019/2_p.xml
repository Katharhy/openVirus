<p id="par0225">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus shares 79 % genetic similarity with SARS-CoV-1 and its 29.9 Kb genome consists of the same replicase and structural regions [
 <xref rid="bib1080" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0310" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the host ACE2 receptor for cellular entry with higher affinity compared to its other family members [
