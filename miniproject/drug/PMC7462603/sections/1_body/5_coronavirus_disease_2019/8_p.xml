<p id="par0255">Current laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics involve the detection of viral RNA by qRT-PCR and the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [
 <xref rid="bib0930" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. Tests based on qRT-PCR are commonly used with samples collected from the nasopharyngeal and throat swabs or saliva. The qRT-PCR targets one or more SARS-CoV-2 genes from the E, N, S, polymerase, or open reading frame 1 (ORF1). Serological testing is utilized for patients with mild symptoms or who are asymptomatic. In a peptide-based diagnostic, 20 biotinylated synthetic SARS-CoV-2 antigens from the ORF1a/b, S, and N proteins were studied [
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Among the peptides tested, a peptide from the S protein showed high specificity to SARS-CoV-2 with no cross-reactivity. Sera samples were added to the biotinylated S peptide in complex with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was detected by luminescence. In this assay IgG and IgM from COVID-19 patients were detected with an accuracy of 71.4 % and 57.2 %, respectively.
