<p id="par0260">Infectious diseases are an ongoing global health concern with a significant consequence of morbidity and mortality. The COVID-19 pandemic is the most recent example that has caused unprecedented global initiatives to expedite therapy, vaccine, and diagnostic development. Challenges such as rising microbial resistance and poor specificity and efficacy of the anti-viral compounds demand the discovery of novel molecules. In this review, we have highlighted the potential peptide-based anti-viral therapeutics and vaccines in early-development and their application in the diagnosis of viral infections. Peptide-based therapeutics hold great promises as a novel approach due to their high specificity, efficacy, and safety. However, the use of naturally and synthetically derived peptides is limited by their short 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> half-lives caused by proteolysis and renal clearance. Incorporation of D-amino acid in peptide sequences has been shown to increase peptide potency and proteolytic stability. The small size of peptides results in renal filtration; therefore, lipid moieties are introduced to add to their size and improve their half-life of peptides. Peptide-based therapies with extended-release dosing hold potential in the future for HIV drugs and can alleviate daily drug administration. Nanoparticle conjugation of peptides has been shown to enhance their solubility and efficacy and provide delivery to the targeted cell. In summary, peptide-based therapies such as Enfuvirtide is FDA approved for AIDS, while others such as Flufirvitide-3 (phase I) and Myrcludex-B (phase IIa) for influenza, and Sifuvirtide (phase III in China) for AIDS are ongoing clinical trials.
