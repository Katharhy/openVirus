<p id="par0175">Despite over 30 years of effort, there is no available vaccine to prevent HIV infection and progression. Most vaccines that have been developed have failed to induce a protective immune response against HIV-1 infection in clinical trials. Eliciting neutralizing antibodies using gp120 as an immunogen is a less than ideal strategy for developing HIV vaccines. The VAX003 and VAX004 trials conducted by VaxGen Inc. determined the safety and efficacy of two bivalent subtypes B and E recombinant gp120 proteins, AIDSVAX(B/B) and AIDSVAX(B/E), respectively. The trials failed during phase III due to insufficient antibody induction and inability to maintain immune response after subsequent boosts [
