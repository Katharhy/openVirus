<p id="par0165">A few natural peptides act as the first line of defense to protect against HIV infection. AMPs from bacteria, plants, animals, and humans have been extensively reviewed for their anti-HIV activities [

 <xref rid="bib0720" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>] and some have been considered as potential microbicide candidates [
 <xref rid="bib0790" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. Microbicides are a preventive option used to stop the transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse in women. As mentioned earlier, retrocyclins are natural θ-defensins produced by primates. Retrocyclins have been shown to be capable of binding to both HIV-1 and host cell glycoproteins to prevent HIV entry and have been considered as microbicides [
 <xref rid="bib0790" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. The only human cathelicidin-derived AMP, LL-37, has also shown anti-HIV activity. Three peptides, LL-37 and its two fragments LL13−37 and LL17−32, inhibit HIV-1 protease with weak potency with no reports of toxic effects [
