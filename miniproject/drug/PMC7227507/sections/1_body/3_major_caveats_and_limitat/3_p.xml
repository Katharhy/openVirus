<p id="p0140">A major limitation is inherent with NERD with its reliance on the binary choice of infected cases versus uninfected. The limitation results from oversimplifying the actual process of transmission, which is undoubtedly a function of the magnitude of the delivered dose of viral particles. This exposure “intensity” likely results in a continuum of severity of symptoms, rate of disease progression, and modulation of disease outcomes. But this important aspect of Covid-19 is ignored in the concept of NERD developed here simply because there is no current way to easily determine exposure intensity. It is important to recognize that it is within the actual complexities of the disease, such as exposure intensity, that NERD attempts to reveal drugs that impact the disease. So any apparent indication that a drug might correlate with positive or negative disease outcomes might instead simply be a confounding reflection of the type of exposure and not the drug itself.</p>
