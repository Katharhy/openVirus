<p id="p9100">There are currently two general categories of tests for Covid-19: tests that indicate active infection and tests that primarily indicate past infection that has resolved. The former currently relies on RT-PCR or antigen testing, and the latter relies on serum testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2; conceivable future tests would be those predicting vulnerability to disease progression. These two groups provide complementary information for clinical, epidemiological, and public health purposes. For NERD, however, the drug usage data collected from these two approaches would yield insights for the screening of drugs with a higher probability of success in repurposing.</p>
