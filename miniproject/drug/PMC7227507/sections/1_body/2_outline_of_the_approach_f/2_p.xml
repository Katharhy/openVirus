   <p id="p0060">As Covid-19 epidemiological surveillance screening and diagnostic testing proceeds, a national database would be continually populated with drug usage data collected from each case among three different combinations of sub-groups based upon whether they tested positive or negative for active SARS-CoV-2 infection or tested positive for past SARS-CoV-2 infection (see 
    <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). Patients would provide a list of all drugs they have used over a time period that safely encompasses the earliest possible date at which they could have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (for example, 2Â months prior). Data for all types of drugs would be collected: legend, OTC, and recreational/illicit drugs - both small-molecule drugs and biologics, as well as vaccines.
