<p id="p0080">But asymptomatic cases often progress to being pre-symptomatic, where symptoms become evident days after testing positive. This distinction, however, does not matter for NERD, as all of these cases can be considered positive for infection. So the term “asymptomatic” will be used here.

    <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Normalized usage rates that have significant associations with a particular group may have potential for enhancing protection or therapeutic outcomes or, alternatively, the potential for increasing the risk for developing overt signs of infection or exacerbating clinical outcomes. The database would have to be coded to account for patients who receive multiple tests. Because of the natural heightened rate of mutation with RNA viruses, it would be important to constantly re-screen the same universe of existing drugs for therapeutic efficacy. This would occur automatically as the database is updated in real time.
