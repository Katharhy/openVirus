<p id="p0130">Drugs with PROTECTIVE or THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL for Covid-19 (with minimal adverse effects) would have a D
 <sub>x</sub>UR distribution associated predominantly with the Option #1 test group. Drugs with potential adverse impacts would have a D
 <sub>x</sub>UR distribution associated predominantly with the Option #2 test group (positive test for active infection). This latter group could point to: (i) potential contraindications and warn of those drugs to AVOID for Covid-19 treatment, (ii) potential for increasing the risk of developing more serious infection or exacerbating clinical outcomes, and (iii) drugs that might also make exposed individuals more susceptible to developing serious disease (thereby allowing for more vigilance in avoiding exposure). A positive correlation with severe, critical, or especially fatal outcomes could point to negative interactions of a drug with the disease, and thereby inform recommendations to avoid taking the drug during an epidemic (possible examples being the use of IL-6 inhibitors and steroids; see: [
 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). Conversely, also for the positive-test group, a lower D
 <sub>x</sub>UR for a particular drug among severe and critical cases (or higher D
 <sub>x</sub>UR among negative cases) could also indicate a protective or prophylactic effect of the drug.
