<p id="p0150">Worth noting is that additional opportunities with the natural experiment presented by the Covid-19 epidemic (as well as any future epidemic) include epidemiologic surveys regarding not just common risk factors such as smoking, but also occupational exposures and real-world inadvertent human exposures to known environmental hazards (e.g., volatile algal toxins and pulmonary toxicants such as atmospheric particulate matter and synthetic chemicals, asbestos, silica, and beryllium). In particular, the possibility exists for discovering whether such non-drug exposures increase the susceptibility or vulnerability to more serious Covid-19 outcomes. This might be especially germane to explaining cases of serious Covid-19 disease among healthy younger adults and reported gender and racial disparities. This would entail a more ambitious data collection effort involving collaboration with industrial and environmental toxicologists to extend the utility beyond drug usage by broadening the exposome and incorporating known occupational and environmental hazards.</p>
