Each potential drug candidate could be revealed by whether its per capita usage rate for each test group is significantly higher or lower than the usage rates for the other groups. Usage rates that have significant associations with a particular group may have either increased or reduced potential for providing protection or ameliorating adverse therapeutic outcomes in treating Covid-19.</p>
