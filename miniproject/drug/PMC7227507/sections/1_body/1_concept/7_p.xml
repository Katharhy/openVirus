<p id="p0050">A major obstacle to successfully implementing NERD also needs to be stressed. Initially, the only type of therapeutic drug usage data that would be straightforward to collect would be for drugs used in long-term maintenance therapies (both small-molecule and biologics); vaccines and hormonal agents should also be included. Therapy would needed to have begun several weeks before exposure but exposure dates would almost always have to be inferred. In contrast, drugs used in short-term therapy could be problematic to collect at first because many additional details would be needed: daily dose, duration of therapy, and time-frame of therapy. Many patients may be unable to supply this level of detail. Moreover, the fact that the short-term therapy might overlap with different intervals of the disease progression would make interpretation of collected data much more challenging.</p>
