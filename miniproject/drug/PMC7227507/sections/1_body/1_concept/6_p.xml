<p id="p0045">Important to emphasize is that NERD might prove useful not just for revealing potential therapeutics, but also reveal those drugs that might be contraindicated or actually potentiate the progression of adverse Covid-19 outcomes. Many different scenarios can be hypothesized for how drug usage might be associated with Covid-19 clinical outcomes. Consider the two bookend case outcomes for Covid-19: (1) the vast majority that resolve with little to no morbidity and (2) the minority that become acutely serious. The most general hypothesis is that there are drugs (or combinations of drugs) that have protective effects and perhaps others that have adverse effects. To explain the lower incidence of serious Covid-19 outcomes compared with favorable outcomes, perhaps it is the drugs with the lowest overall clinical usage rates that could explain at least a portion of the serious outcomes - especially among clinical cases having no apparent underlying risk factors. It is likely that widespread Covid-19 testing among the general asymptomatic population will reveal that its infected subpopulation is even larger than currently believed for the subpopulation that progresses to serious outcomes. This would point even further to the possibility that perhaps it is the seldom-used drugs that play a role in serious outcomes.</p>
