<p id="Par57">SARS-CoV-2 viral entry requires two host proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]: the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) Androgen receptor activity has been considered a requirement for the transcription of TMPRSS2 gene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>] and TMPRSS2 is the most frequently altered gene in primary prostate cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. The modulation of TMPRSS2 expression by testosterone has been postulated to contribute to male predominance of COVID-19 infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. Since TMPRSS2 is expressed also at pulmonary level, the use of TMPRSS2 inhibitors, currently being used for prostate cancer, represents an appealing target for prevention or treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia [
