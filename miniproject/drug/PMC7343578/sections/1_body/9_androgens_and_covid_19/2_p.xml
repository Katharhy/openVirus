<p id="Par56">A possible mechanism that may drive clinical outcomes is a compromised antiviral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in men. Generally, androgens have an immune suppressive effect and women are disproportionately affected with inflammatory disease. Regarding SARS-CoV infected mice in males, gonadectomy or treatment with an antiandrogen compound did not affect the morbidity and mortality; conversely, estrogen depletion by ovariectomy or treatment with an estrogen receptor antagonist dramatically increased both morbidity and mortality suggesting a protective effect for the estrogen receptor signaling pathway [
