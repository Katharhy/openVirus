<p id="Par37">Persons with obesity who become COVID-19 ill and require treatment in intensive care units present very important challenges in their therapeutic management, as it is more difficult to intubate them. It can also be more difficult to obtain diagnostic imaging (as there are weight limits on imaging machines) and patients are more difficult to position and transport by nursing staff. Also, the decision to extubate those patients is more challenging when it comes to these patients. Healthcare systems in general are not yet well set up enough to manage an increasing number of patients with obesity in ICUs and the current crisis could probably highlight their limitations even more.</p>
