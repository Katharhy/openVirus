<p id="Par29">The high impact of H1N1 Influenza and now COVID-19 in patients with obesity and severe obesity is probably related to the deleterious effects of obesity on pulmonary function (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Obesity is associated with decreased expiratory reserve volume, functional capacity and respiratory system compliance. Severe obesity causes sleep apnea syndrome and in those with increased abdominal obesity, pulmonary function is further impaired by decreased diaphragmatic excursion.
