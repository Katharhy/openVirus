<p id="Par33">Obese individuals may exhibit greater viral shedding suggesting potential for enhanced viral exposure, especially if several family members are overweight. This may be aggravated in overcrowded multigenerational households, which are more common in the socioeconomically deprived communities in which obesity is prevalent [

The altered microenvironment associated with obesity supports the emergence of more virulent influenza virus population capable of inducing greater disease severity. This could be related to an impaired interferon response, which is seen in experimental models, both in obese mice and obesity-derived human bronchial epithelial cells [
