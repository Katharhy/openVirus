<p id="Par32">When it comes to the immune response, there is a clear association between obesity and chronic inflammation that can modify innate and adaptive immune responses, making the immune system more vulnerable to infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Obesity is related to low-grade inflammation that is associated to adipocyte hypoxia and dysfunction. This results in an exuberant secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF- α), interleukin (IL) 1β and interleukin 6 and adipokines that lead to the recruitment of immune cells macrophage, T cell and B-cells, creating an auto-regenerating inflammation loop [

In addition, there are alterations of lymphocyte phenotype with a decrease in T regulatory and Th2 cells and an increase in Th1 an Th17. Viral infection may amplify the already primed organ cytokine response in adipose tissue [

In parallel, one of the most important mechanisms underlying the severity of lung disease in COVID-19 is represented by the so called “cytokine storm”, which can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome or even multiple organ failure in the worst case. The cytokine storm identified in multiple respiratory viral infections including COVID-19 exhibits an overproduction of interferon, tumor necrosis factor α, interleukins, and different chemokines. Thus, considering that subjects with obesity have also a pre-set proinflammatory milieu, it is expected that COVID-19 could further exacerbate inflammation exposing them to higher levels of circulating inflammatory molecules compared to lean human subjects. This seems a feasible mechanistic explanation of the increased risk of severe complications of COVID-19 in subjects with obesity [
