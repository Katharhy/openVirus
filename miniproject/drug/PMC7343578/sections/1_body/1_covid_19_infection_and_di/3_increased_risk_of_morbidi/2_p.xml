An additional report from China including 1590 hospitalized cases analyzed a composite endpoint including admission to ICU, intensive ventilation, or death, and after adjusting for smoking status and age. It was found that diabetes significantly increased the risk of severity according to the composite endpoint (hazard ratio 1.59, 95% CI 1.03â€“2.45); in this series, 34.6% of severe cases had diabetes compared to 14.3% in non-severe cases [
