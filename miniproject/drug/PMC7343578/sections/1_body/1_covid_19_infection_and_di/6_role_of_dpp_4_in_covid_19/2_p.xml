<p id="Par26">Thus, the question is whether DPP-4 inhibitors used currently for treatment of type 2 diabetes play a role not just regarding metabolic control, but also contributing to modify COVID-19 attack in these patients, either inducing protection or progression of infection (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). It is tempting to postulate that inhibition of DDP-4 with the current antidiabetic drugs such as sitagliptin, vildagliptin or linagliptin may impair the virus/DPP-4 interaction, thereby protecting the cell from virus entrance. However, the binding of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV takes place at residues not located nearby the DPP-4i binding pocket of current gliptin drugs, thus requiring more studies in order to clarify this question [
