<p id="Par25">Remarkably, human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) has also been identified as a functional receptor of the S-protein of MERS-Co-V [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. MERS-CoV binds to the DPP-4 receptor-binding domain and interacts with T cells and nuclear factors, such as nuclear factor kappa b (NF-kB), a key factor in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders. DPP-4 plays an important role in the regulation of the immune system by activating T cell repertoire and upregulating nuclear factor kappa b pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Transgenic mouse models expressing human DPP-4 exposed to MERS-CoV had impaired inflammatory monocyte/macrophage phenotype, CD4+ T cells and lower expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6 and Arg1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Remarkably, it has been recently demonstrated that human DPP-4/CD26 may interact with the S1 domain of the viral spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, thus allowing an additional way for the virus to enter the cell, beside the main one, which is angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 [
