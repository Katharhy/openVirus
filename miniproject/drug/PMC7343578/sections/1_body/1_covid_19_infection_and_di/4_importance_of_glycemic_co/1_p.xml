<p id="Par21">To date, only a limited number of studies have addressed the role of hyperglycemia in the pathogenesis and prognosis of viral respiratory diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, it has been shown that elevated blood glucose levels can directly rise glucose concentrations in airway secretion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In vitro glucose exposure of pulmonary epithelial cells significantly increases influenza virus infection and replication. In addition, elevated glucose levels impair the antiviral immune response. As a consequence, patients with diabetes use to have a higher viral charge as well as a much severe disease when infected with respiratory viruses. These findings are consistent with the reports of patients infected with the highly pathogenic avian influenza, in which hyperglycemia was associated with increased fatal outcome. Hyperglycemia may also affect pulmonary function, and therefore, respiratory dysfunction induced by influenza virus is exacerbated in patients with diabetes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In viral disease animal models, diabetes is associated with numerous lung structural changes, including augmented permeability of the alveolo-capillary membrane and a collapsed alveolar epithelium [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It is anticipated that glycemic control can have beneficial effects in patients with coexistent diabetes and viral respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. However, in the clinical setting, optimal metabolic control has been difficult to achieve mostly because of practical limitations encountered during the treatment of this patients’ group [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Interleukin 6 and D-dimer levels are more elevated in hyperglycemic patients compared to normoglycemic ones. Both, patients with hyperglycemia not previously known as having diabetes and patients with known diabetes had a higher risk of severe disease than those without diabetes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This emphasizes the importance of early detection of hyperglycemia at the hospital setting and the necessity of its prompt and effective treatment with insulin [
