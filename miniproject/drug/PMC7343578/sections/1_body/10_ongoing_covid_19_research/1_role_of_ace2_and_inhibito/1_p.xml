<p id="Par59">The SARS-CoV binds to the zinc peptidase ACE2, a surface molecule that is localized in the endothelial cells of arteries and veins, arterial smooth muscle, respiratory tract epithelium, epithelia of the small intestine, and immune cells, to enter the host cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. With SARS-CoV, it was shown that ACE2 overexpression facilitated viral entry and replication in cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 probably targets the same spectrum of cells targeted by SARS-CoV, which in the lungs are primarily localized in pneumocytes and macrophages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is the most serious complication of both SARS and COVID-19, is likely explained by this lung tropism. Moreover, extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 may also be related to the systemic distribution of ACE2 in the gastrointestinal tract and the heart [
