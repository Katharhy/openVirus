<p id="Par61">At present, to our knowledge, there are no peer reviewed experimental or clinical data demonstrating a specific benefit or risk of using ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, or renin angiotensin aldosterone antagonists in COVID-19 patients.

In this regard, the European Society of Cardiology, Council on Hypertension; American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association and the Heart Failure Society of America and the American Society of hypertension have released policy statements strongly recommending that patients should continue treatment with their usual antihypertensive therapy because there is no clinical or empirical scientific evidence to suggest that treatment with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers should be discontinued because of the COVID-19 infection [
