<p id="Par60">There is evidence that ACE2 expression increases on the cell membrane with the use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. There is a theoretical concern that by increasing ACE2 expression they could facilitate the entry of virus into the host cell and increase the chances of infection or its severity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Unfortunately, data if ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers modify ACE2 levels or activity (or both) are lacking in experimental animal models or in humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 appears not only to gain initial entry through ACE2 but also to subsequently downregulate ACE2 expression in order that the enzyme is unable to exert protective effects in organs and this may be in part responsible for organ injury in Covid-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. At present, we cannot rule out that long-term intake of ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin-receptor blockers may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry and virus replication. Conversely, it is yet unknown whether intake of ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin-receptor blockers, when infected, is beneficial with regard to pulmonary outcome. Possibly, we are dealing here with a double-edged sword, depending on the phase of the disease: increased baseline ACE2 expression could potentially rise infectivity and ACE inhibitors/ angiotensin-receptor blockers use would be an addressable risk factor. Conversely, once infected, downregulation of ACE2 may be the hallmark of COVID-19 progression. Consequently, upregulation by preferentially using renin-angiotensin system blockade and ACE2 replacement in the acute respiratory syndrome phase may turn out to be beneficial [
