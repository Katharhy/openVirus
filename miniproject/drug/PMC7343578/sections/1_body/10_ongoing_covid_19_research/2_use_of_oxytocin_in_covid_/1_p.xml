<p id="Par62">Oxytocin exerts a dual effect by mobilizing the immune defenses, and by suppressing pathogenic responses due to overreactions of the innate immunity. In humans, in the early phases of infectious disease, oxytocin can limit the excessive proinflammatory and oxidative stress reactions, by decreasing interleukins levels [

In humans, activation of the oxytocin receptor, which is expressed in the pulmonary artery, can produce a vasolidatory effect [
