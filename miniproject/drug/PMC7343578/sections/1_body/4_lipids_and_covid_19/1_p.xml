<p id="Par40">Hypertrygliceridemia has been described as a side effect during COVID-19 infection, with four cases reported up to date. In two of them hypertrygliceridemia was related with lopinavir/ritonavir treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] and in two others, patients were receiving a combination of this therapy with tocilizumab [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Lopinavir/ritonavir has been previously associated with lipid abnormalities, including elevations of total cholesterol and triglycerides [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Chronic use of tocilizumab in rheumatoid arthritis has also been shown to increase lipid parameters, in particular triglycerides [
