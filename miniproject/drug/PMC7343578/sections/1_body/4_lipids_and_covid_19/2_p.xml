<p id="Par41">Statins have been postulated as a possible add-on treatment for COVID-19 patients, based on their known immunomodulatory properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Statins exert pleiotropic effects on inflammation and oxidative stress and modulate the immune response at different levels, including immune cell adhesion and migration, antigen presentation, and cytokine production [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. As statins are low-cost, extensively tested, well-tolerated drugs in a health crisis such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, they could be an option when treatment with more expensive drugs may not be implemented. Continuation of preexisting statin therapy must be recommended.
