<p id="Par50">Regarding cortisol dynamics, autopsy studies performed on patients who died from SARS-CoV showed degeneration and necrosis of the adrenal cortical cells, pointing to a direct cytopathic effect of the virus. Hence, it is likely that cortisol dynamics may be altered in patients with SARS (and also with SARS-CoV-2) [

In addition, there is an interesting hypothesis that certain amino acid sequences in the SARS-CoV are molecular mimics of the host adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This could blunt the stress-induced cortisol rise, as antibodies produced against the viral particles will inadvertently destroy the circulating ACTH [
