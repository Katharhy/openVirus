<p id="Par49">Adrenal insufficiency may confer a potentially increased risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection, as this condition is associated to an impaired natural immunity function, with a defective action of neutrophils and natural killer-cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. This may explain, in part, the slightly increased rate of infectious diseases in these patients, as well as an overall higher mortality. Although patients with adrenal insufficiency may have a greater risk of complications due to the potential for an adrenal crisis to be triggered by the infection, there is still no evidence that those patients have a more severe course of COVID-19 [
