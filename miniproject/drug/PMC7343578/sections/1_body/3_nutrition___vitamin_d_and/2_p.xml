<p id="Par39">Vitamin D deficiency is widespread in Southern Europe where vitamin D fortified food is not widely used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Vitamin D insufficiency has been reported to increase predisposition to systemic infections and to impair immune response or even to enhance the development of autoimmune diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Moreover, it has been shown that vitamin D supplementation can prevent respiratory infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and poor vitamin D status may aggravate the health outcome of ICU patients while its correction could decrease morbidity and mortality in this clinical setting [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Therefore, besides the hypothesis that hypovitaminosis D may be a predisposing factor to COVID-19 infection and aggressiveness in some European countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], we strongly recommend to maintain vitamin D treatment in those already diagnosed with hypovitaminosis D [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] and suggest considering the supplementation with vitamin D of elderly comorbid persons at home confinement if they are no yet under supplementation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Studies on levels of 25 OH Vitamin D and their prognostic role in COVID-19 as well as on potential benefits of vitamin D intervention in this clinical setting are underway [
