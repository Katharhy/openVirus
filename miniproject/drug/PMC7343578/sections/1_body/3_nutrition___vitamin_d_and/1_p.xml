<p id="Par38">Regarding undernourished subjects, COVID-19 infection is associated to a high risk of malnutrition development, mostly related to augmenting requirements and the presence of a severe acute inflammatory status. These patients show also a hyporexic state, thus contributing to an acute negative nutritional balance. Estimated nutritional requirements for these patients are 25–30 kcal/kg of weight and 1.5 g protein/kg/day [

A nutrient dense diet is recommended in hospitalized cases including high protein supplements, administered in 2–3 intakes per day and containing at least 18 g of protein per intake. If nutritional requirements are not met during hospital stay, complementary or complete enteral feeding may be required and, in case that enteral feeding may not be possible due to inadequate gastrointestinal tolerance, the patient should be put on parenteral nutrition. COVID-19 patients’ outcome is expected to improve with an adequate nutritional support.
