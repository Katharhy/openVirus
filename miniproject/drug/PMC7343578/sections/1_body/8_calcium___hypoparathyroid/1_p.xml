<p id="Par54">Several studies showed a key role of calcium in viral fusion for many enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and Ebolavirus. Moreover, calcium promoted their replication directly interacting with fusion peptides of these viruses [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. This case suggested that hypocalcemia may occur also in COVID-19 infection. In fact, very recently we found in a retrospective single Institution study including 531 patients with COVID-19 a high prevalence of hypocalcemia (in about 80% of cases) on initial hospital evaluation. Hypocalcemic patients were more frequently elderly males with linear correlation between calcium levels and LDH and PCR levels. In multivariate analyses, hypocalcemia was an independent risk factor associated with hospitalization whereas it predicted ICU admission and mortality only in univariate analysis. [
