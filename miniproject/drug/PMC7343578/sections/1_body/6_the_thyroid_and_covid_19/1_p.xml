<p id="Par45">Data on thyroid involvement by coronavirus are most scarce. A study conducted during the SARS outbreak in 2003 had reported that serum Triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels were lower in patients with SARS as compared to controls, both during the acute and convalescent phases. This could simply imply an underlying euthyroid sick syndrome. However, a study of the autopsy in five patients with SARS has shown marked destruction of the follicular and parafollicular thyroid cells [71] and not a reduction in thyroid follicular size associated with euthyroid sick syndrome [72]. Destruction of follicular cells may also be identified as a low triiodothyronine and thyroxine profile. Data on thyroid function or thyroid pathology are yet not available in COVID-19 [
