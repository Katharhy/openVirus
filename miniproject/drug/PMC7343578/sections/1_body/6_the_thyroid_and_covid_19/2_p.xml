<p id="Par46">Regarding Gravesâ€™ disease, COVID-19 can be a precipitating factor for initiation or relapse of the disease (M. Marazuela, personal experience). Several medical societies have recommended to take special care to patients with hyperthyroidism receiving antithyroid drugs, because symptoms of the rare side effect of agranulocytosis can overlap with COVID-19.
