<p id="Par42">Evidence of altered pituitary function in SARS was first reported by Leow et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Sixty-one survivors of the SARS outbreak were evaluated after recovery: 40% had evidence of central mild hypocortisolism and 5% also had central hypothyroidism [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. In the case of COVID-19 both the hypothalamic and pituitary tissues express ACE2 and could also be viral targets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Currently, we do not have any such data in COVID-19; however, considering the high frequency of neurological symptoms, one can assume that SARS-CoV-2 may affect the hypothalamusâ€“pituitary as well, directly or via immune-mediated hypophysitis [
