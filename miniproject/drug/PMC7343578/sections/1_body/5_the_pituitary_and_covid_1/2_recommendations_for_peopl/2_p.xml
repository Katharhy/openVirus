<p id="Par44">Patients with pre-existing endocrine conditions may be vulnerable to perturbations in plasma sodium in more severe cases of COVID-19. None of the published reports so far have reported a higher prevalence of dysnatremia in COVID-19 [69]. Regarding management of diabetes insipidus, since patients have limited accessibility to blood testing, the priority should be to avoid hyponatremia [70]. This can be performed delaying desmopressin to allow regular periods of free water clearance to prevent dilutional hyponatremia. It is also useful to measure body weight daily. In addition, patients with diabetes insipidus who develop respiratory complications of COVID-19 are at significantly increased risk of dysnatremia and should have a close monitorization [70].</p>
