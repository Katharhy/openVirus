  <p>Potential mechanisms that link obesity to worse outcomes in COVID-19. Obese patients have 1) a impaired respiratory function; 2) associated cardiovascular, metabolic and thrombotic comorbidities which reduce the capability to cope with COVID-19. In addition, obese patients have 3) increased viral shedding and viral load and 4) an amplified immune response due to altered balance between inflammatory and regulatory cells. During COVID-19 infection there is also an altered immune response that is amplified by the dysregulated immune system of the obese patients</p>
