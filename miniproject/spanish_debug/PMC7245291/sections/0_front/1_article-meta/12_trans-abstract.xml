 <p>The world population is experiencing a pandemic due to infection with the SARS-Cov-2 virus, which causes the COVID-19 disease. In Spain, the growth rate of the epidemic is 6.79% since the alarm activation with 9,1% of deaths of the total infected. Recommendations of the National Government to prevent health professional contagion include the placement of personal protection devices (FPP2 mask, gloves, waterproof gown, hat, and protective glasses or screen). Once healthcare professionals are using protective equipment, it is necessary to argue about the humanization of nursing caring in people suffering dying situation, who are infected with COVID-19, regarding a clinical case. The aim is to enhance nursing thinking to bridge that distance, and maintain care as human and close as possible, at the end of life.</p>
