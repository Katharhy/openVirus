<p>The gain in EELV by increasing the PEEP has two phases.

 <sup>)</sup> in which the diaphragm and abdominal contents are moved caudally, increasing the Pes. However, during the successive ventilations, Pes gradually returns to its basal level, whereas the airway pressure remains constant, and P
 <sub>L</sub> increases. Therefore, the second phase of insufflation, termed time-dependent volume, is exclusively related to the characteristics of the lung (

 <sup>)</sup> Consequently, if the time-dependent volume adjusts to the mechanical characteristics of the functional lung, the response of the chest wall to slow insufflation ("viscoelastic" model), not alveolar recruitment, may explain these findings.
