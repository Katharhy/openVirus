<p>The position of the diaphragm depends on the interplay between the force in the direction of expansion of the rib cage, the elastic recoil of the lung and the IAP.

 <sup>)</sup> During inspiration, the descent of the diaphragm displaces the abdominal contents caudally. To achieve this displacement, the resistance exerted (related to the IAP) must be overcome, and therefore, the end-expiratory Pes will increase, which becomes evident only when insufflation occurs at the expense of the tidal volume or during the first ventilatory cycles after a PEEP step ("viscoelastic" response to rapid deformation).

 <sup>)</sup> After a period of stabilization, the end-expiratory Pes returns to baseline values, while the volume in the respiratory system continues to increase.

 <sup>)</sup> This finding could be explained by the theory of the "net effect" of the diaphragm, wherein the expansion of the caudal area of the rib cage puts tension in its circumferential fibers (passive tension), thereby preventing the IAP from exerting its effect on the thoracic cavity

 <sup>)</sup> This behavior can be exemplified by the load an individual must overcome to push a car up an inclined plane. Disregarding the friction with the surface, the force (in the respiratory system, pressure) that must be made for the displacement (in the respiratory system, volume gain) is related to the weight of the vehicle and to the slope of the inclined plane (variables representing the E
 <sub>CW</sub>). Once this force is removed, the vehicle will return to its initial position with a magnitude of force identical to that necessary to produce the ascent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>, viscoelastic response to rapid deformation). If, after pushing the car up the slope, the load is sustained over time (insufflation with PEEP), the response changes abruptly; that is, the car continues moving along the plateau, wherein the force required is negligible (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>, viscoelastic response to slow deformation). Lastly, if the individual tries to push the car up over a new incline in this new situation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>), the necessary force will again depend on the weight of the vehicle and on the slope of the incline (E
 <sub>CW</sub>), which, as mentioned above, remains constant, with a magnitude equal to that of phase 1.
