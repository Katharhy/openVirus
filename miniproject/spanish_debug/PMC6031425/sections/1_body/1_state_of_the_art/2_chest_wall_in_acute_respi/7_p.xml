<p>Chiumello et al. assessed respiratory mechanics variables in patients with ARDS stratified according to body mass index. Even at different PEEP levels (5 and 15cmH
 <sub>2</sub>O), the E
 <sub>CW</sub> of obese patients had a median of 5cmH
 <sub>2</sub>O/liter, within the normal range.

 <sup>)</sup> Conversely, tomographic analysis showed that overweight and obese patients had a lower EELV than patients with normal weight. The authors attributed this finding to the lower vertex-base pulmonary distance (determined by the cephalic displacement of the diaphragm).

 <sup>)</sup> Hence, in obese patients with ARDS, the chest wall behavior supports the PEEP role in reestablishing the EELV.
