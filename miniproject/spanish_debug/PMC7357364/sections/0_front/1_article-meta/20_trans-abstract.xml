  <title>Introduction: </title>
  <p>The antiretroviral therapy for the treatment of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a therapeutic strategy linked to drug-related problems that cause or can cause the appearance of negative results associated with the medication. It is important, therefore, to identify their incidence, characterize them, and classify them to design strategies to minimize their impact.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Objective: </title>
  <p>To estimate the overall incidence and the incidence of each one of the antiretroviral drugs-related problems in the treatment of the HIV infection in a cohort of hospitalized patients in Bogotá, Colombia.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Materials and methods: </title>
  <p>We conducted a descriptive, retrospective cohort study in patients aged 18 years or more diagnosed with HIV infection and under antiretroviral treatment hospitalized between January 1st, 2015, and December 31st, 2016, in the 
   <italic>Hospital Santa Clara</italic>, Bogotá.
  </p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Results: </title>
  <p>The overall incidence of antiretroviral drug-related problems was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.85-0.93). The incidence of drug-drug interactions was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.80-0.90), 0.28 (95% CI: 0.22-0.35) for adverse reactions, and 0.12 (CI 95%: 0.08-0.17) for prescription errors.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Conclusion: </title>
  <p>Drug-related problems should be studied, diagnosed, prevented, and treated. Their knowledge can enable health care professionals to anticipate their emergence, reduce their incidence, implement risk management plans, and optimize adherence to antiretroviral treatment.</p>
