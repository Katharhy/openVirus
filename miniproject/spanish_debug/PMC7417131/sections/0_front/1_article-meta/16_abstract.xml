  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p> the judicialization of health care consists of obtaining assets and rights in the courts. These assets and rights are essential to ensure the health of citizens but have been denied in various instances, often due to the omission of the executive and legislative powers. Analyzing the judicialization of health care amidst the pandemic brings focus and highlights the importance of giving voice and visibility to the enormous contingent of the Brazilian society unassisted by public authorities.</p>
