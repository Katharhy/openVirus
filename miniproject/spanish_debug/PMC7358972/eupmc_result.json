    "The COVID-19 pandemic from a prevention science perspective, including research topics, is discussed. Political considerations that influence prevention activities, with examples from the pandemic and from more typical prevention initiatives in schools and communities, are presented. The definitions of prevention science and prevention interventions are delineated, and a brief summary of prevention history is given. The relationship between health disparities and COVID-19 is discussed. Two theoretical perspectives that may help to inform effectiveness of COVID-19 prevention measures, Health Belief Model and Theory of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior, are summarized. The article emphasizes the importance of adapting prevention applications to the intended recipients, especially ethnic and cultural groups. The need to strengthen prevention training in graduate education and strategies to reform the education to meet accreditation and licensing standards are suggested."
