<p>Due to the recent emergence of the COVID-19, there is not sufficient scientific evidence to provide precise guidelines and protocols to fight the disease. Nonetheless, prior knowledge from different health fields and the results reported by the papers available enabled mapping the various practices that can be recommended in obstetrical and neonatal care, as follows: companions and health workers are supposed to prevent the transmission of the virus to NB by adopting isolation measures and contact, droplets and/or aerosols precautions; keep strict hand hygiene; health workers, mothers, and companions must wear PPE when providing care to NB; consider when a pregnancy should be interrupted or anticipated; decrease the circulation and number of people involved in the care provided to women and NB. Skin-to-skin contact during childbirth and water births is not recommended. The route of childbirth should be chosen following conventional obstetrical indications and the womenâ€™s clinical conditions. If anesthesia is indicated, the epidural is preferred over general anesthesia.</p>
