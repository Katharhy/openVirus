<p>Decisions regarding the course of pregnancy or its resolution should take into account: the mother’s clinical condition, fetal wellbeing, gestational age, and the mother’s autonomy.

If, however, the safety of either mother or fetus is compromised due to SARS or there is no satisfactory response to the therapy implemented against COVID-19, or yet, in the presence of severe pneumonia or critical condition, a premature delivery should be considered to safeguard mother and infant, as an anticipated birth decreases fetal hypoxemia and the maternal condition is expected to improve
