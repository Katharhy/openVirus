 <p>Cystic fibrosis (CF), a condition produced by mutations in the gene that encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, is the most prevalent autosomal-recessive hereditary disease in caucasian populations. Among other repercussions, this defect leads to an alteration of respiratory secretions and determines a predisposition for chronic bronchopulmonary colonization-infection, which is the main driver of the high morbidity and early mortality of CF patients. Colonization by 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
  <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> is frequent in children younger than 10 years, but mucoid 
  <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is by far the most relevant pathogen in adults with CF and is responsible for the progressive bronchopulmonary deterioration. As a consequence of repeated, long-lasting antimicrobial treatments and deterioration of lung function, colonization by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, such as 
  <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter</italic> spp. and 
  <italic>Burkholderia cepacia complex,</italic> is also frequent in adult CF patients. The special characteristics of the pathologic process and the microorganisms implicated in CF make it advisable to consider microbiological follow-up of chronic bronchopulmonary colonization-infection in these patients a specific diagnostic entity.
