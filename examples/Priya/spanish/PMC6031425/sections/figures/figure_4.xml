  <p>Exemplification of different chest wall responses to deformation as the load a subject must overcome to push a car up an inclined plane. A) Viscoelastic response to rapid deformation: The force [in the respiratory system, pressure change ∆P] required to push the car up (in the respiratory system, volume gain, ∆V) is related to the weight of the vehicle and to the slope of the inclined plane (in the respiratory system, chest wall elastance). Once the force is removed, the vehicle will return to its initial position with a magnitude of force identical to that necessary to push the car up. B) Viscoelastic response to slow deformation. If, after the ascent, the load (pressure) is sustained over time (PEEP insufflation), the car continues moving through a plateau (ΔV), where the required force is negligible. C) If the car is pushed up a new slope with the same characteristics (no change in chest wall elastance), the necessary force will be of equal magnitude to that of phase A.</p>
