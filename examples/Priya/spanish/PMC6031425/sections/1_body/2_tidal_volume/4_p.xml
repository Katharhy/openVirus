<p>Lastly, Cort√©s-Puentes et al. conducted a study with pigs also showing that the airway driving pressure behaves similarly to the transpulmonary driving pressure under normal conditions, unilateral massive atelectasis, and unilateral and bilateral lung injury, also reporting that abdominal hypertension distorts this relationship and that the model compatible with ARDS is the least affected by this variable. This model showed significant differences in absolute values; however, the relationship between airway and transpulmonary driving pressure remains constant when comparing abdominal hypertension with normal IAP.
