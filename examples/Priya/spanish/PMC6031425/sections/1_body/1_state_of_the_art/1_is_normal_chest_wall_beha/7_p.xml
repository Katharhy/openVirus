<p>Another possible explanation is based on the potential error of assuming Pes as a surrogate for pleural pressure. The latter shows a heterogeneous response to the impact of gravity force, and esophageal manometry is only able to estimate it when horizontal to it.

 <sup>)</sup> Thus, the question remains of whether positive Pes in lung-dependent areas responds to the chest wall effect or reflects the pressure of the lung to the chest wall fixed against the support plane.
