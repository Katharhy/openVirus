   <p>- Significant differences were observed when comparing the end-expiratory Pes change assessed by esophageal manometry and predicted by multiplying the chest wall elastance (E
    <sub>CW</sub>) by the end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) change after a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) step. In all cases, the end-expiratory Pes was markedly lower than expected for an elastic behavior.

   <p>- An elastic structure, at the same volume, exerts a specific recoil pressure, regardless of the way in which it was insufflated. 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> shows that when the chest wall is insufflated by tidal volume, the generated displacement pressure is substantially higher than that required by PEEP steps.

   <p>- In an elastic model, the volume gain by pressure change should respond to the mechanical characteristics of both composing structures. However, the change in EELV between 4 and 16 cmH
    <sub>2</sub>O PEEP only obtained a good correlation (r
    <sup>2</sup> = 0.83) with the change predicted by the equation [PEEP change (∆PEEP) × lung elastance (E
    <sub>L</sub>)], indicating that the chest wall effect is negligible when the respiratory system is insufflated with PEEP
