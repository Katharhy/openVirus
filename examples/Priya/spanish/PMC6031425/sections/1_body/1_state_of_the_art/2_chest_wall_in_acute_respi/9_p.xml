<p>Another comorbidity that could affect the chest wall behavior in ARDS is the increase in IAP.

 <sup>)</sup> This condition causes a marked deterioration in both lung volume and respiratory system mechanics. The magnitude of such an effect depends on the relationship between the PEEP level and IAP. As long as the IAP remains lower than the PEEP, it will have no impact on EELV or respiratory mechanics. Conversely, when the IAP exceeds the PEEP, the EELV decreases linearly, and the airway pressure and the end-inspiratory Pes increase, thus increasing the E
 <sub>CW</sub> and the E
 <sub>RS</sub>.

 <sup>)</sup> However, the end-expiratory Pes remains virtually unresponsive to changes in IAP. Therefore, abdominal hypertension affects the chest wall behavior differently, according to the insufflation method, with a strong effect under dynamic conditions (tidal volume) and with a negligible effect under static conditions (PEEP)
