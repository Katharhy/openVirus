<p>Pleural effusion increases the imposed pressure, causing the passive collapse of the adjacent pulmonary parenchyma. In a model with healthy pigs, Graf et al. observed that using moderate PEEP levels is sufficient to significantly reduce the lung collapse and that under these conditions, the chest wall expansion contain the entire volume of the pleural effusion.

 <sup>)</sup> In 2013, Chiumello et al. included 129 patients with ARDS and pleural effusion in their study. The patients with a higher volume of pleural effusion showed no significant differences in the elastance of the respiratory system (E
 <sub>RS</sub>), lung (E
 <sub>L</sub>) and chest wall (E
 <sub>CW</sub>) from patients with a lower volume of pleural effusion. The lower chest wall elastance, in comparison with the lung, likely helps the pressure exerted by the pleural effusion to move the chest wall closer to its relaxation volume without affecting its mechanical properties (
