<p id="par0070">Synthetic Peptide vaccines have chemically produced from fragments of antigens that elicites the immune response. These vaccines are inexpensive, easy for preparation, and quality control. But display low immunogenicity, thus antigen modification and adjuvant required during formulation. Fragments of antigen has B_ and/or Tepitope activity, which affect the specificity of the immune response. Currently, a set of B and T cell epitopes isolated from S and N proteins of SARS-Cov, these epitopes are highly conserved in SARS-CoV-2 and may assist efforts to develop vaccine for covid-19 disease.

 </xref> Several pharmaceutical companies like Generex Biotechnology developing peptide based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 viruses by producing synthetic peptides that mimic crucial antigens from a virus that is chemically bonded to the 4-amino acid Ii-Key to ensure robust immune system activation.
