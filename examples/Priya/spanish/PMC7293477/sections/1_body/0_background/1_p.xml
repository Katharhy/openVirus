<p id="par0005">Viruses have a great potential to become a dangerous life-threatening and cause irreparable loss to human beings. Hardly the world learns to cope with one strain of virus when another emerges and poses a threat to the future of humanity. A similar situation has emerged when a new strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has not been previously known in human history. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are nonsegmented, enveloped, single-strand, positive-sense, ribonucleic acid viruses belonging to the Coronaviridae family. CoVs named due to their Sun's corona or crown-like surface projections. CoVs are the largest group of host-specific RNA viruses infecting birds, snakes, bats, and mammals including humans. CoVs grouped into 
 <italic>Alphacoronaviruses</italic> and 
 <italic>Betacoronaviruses</italic> which mostly mammals like bats, civets, rodents, and humans and 
 <italic>Gammacoronaviruses</italic> and 
 <italic>Deltacoronaviruses</italic> which are mostly found in birds.

 </xref> In the 21st century, three CoVs outbreaks emerged from their reservoirs to cause disease in human. Several members of the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family infect humans. Humans are infected and developed upper respiratory tract diseases with different CoVs strains including 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1. OC43 and 229E causes common cold mainly during winter with 4%-15% prevalence. NL63 causes mild respiratory tract disease, especially in children with a prevalence of 10% of all respiratory diseases. HKU1was isolated from a 71-year-old man with pneumonia.
