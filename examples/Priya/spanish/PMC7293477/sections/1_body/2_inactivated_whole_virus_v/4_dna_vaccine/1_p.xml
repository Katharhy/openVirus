<p id="par0060">DNA vaccines (DVs) have a plasmid into which a particular gene incorporated that encodes the antigens that identified from the pathogenic microorganism. The bacterial plasmid carrying the desired gene delivered into the host and translated the antigenic protein that stimulates the immune system normally activated by the pathogenic microorganism. DVs elicit both the cell-mediated and humoral immune system. DVs induce long-lasting immunity that defends the diseases effectively in the future. DVs are very stable, can be produced within weeks because they does not need culture or fermentation; instead used synthetic processes and began clinical trial within monthes. Currently, DNA vaccine not approved for the market.

 </xref> Several pharmaceutical companies have advanced DNA platforms for COVID-19 vaccine discovery. Most DVs candidates encode the S protein or the S1 domain to prevent attachment to the human ACE2 receptor, a receptor for viral entry. The DNA translating S protein stimulates antibodies and elicits cell-mediated immune response in mice, macaques, and camels. When the immunized macaques were challenged with MERS-CoV, characteristic clinical symptoms including pneumonia were mitigated. So far, two SARS-CoV-2 DVs are under development.

 </xref> Inovio Pharmaceuticals developed a DVs candidate termed INO-4800, which is in phase 1 (NCT04336410) clinical trial. Takis/Applied DNA Sciences/Evvivax and Zydus Cadila are developing a DVs candidate for COVID-19 disease which is now in preclinical studies.
