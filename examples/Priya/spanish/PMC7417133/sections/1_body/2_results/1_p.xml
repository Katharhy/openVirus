<p>In total, 108 papers were identified in the databases, while 17 were identified in reference lists and unpublished research repositories. Of these, 29 appeared more than once and were removed. Hence, 96 papers were selected to read the titles and abstracts. Two researchers independently selected the papers, the full texts of which would be read. Then, 61 documents were excluded. The full texts of the remaining 35 eligible papers were read and 16 of these papers were excluded because they did not address the research question or did not provide significant recommendations to be included in this review. Hence, 19 met the inclusion criteria and remained in the final sample (
