<p>The Chinese studies included in this review recommend isolating the mother-infant pair after birth, as this procedure is believed to decrease NB contamination by SARS-CoV-2. For this reason, these studies recommend delayed umbilical cord clamping and skin-to-skin contact to be avoided. Therefore, NB should be placed in a warm crib in an environment different from that of mothers
