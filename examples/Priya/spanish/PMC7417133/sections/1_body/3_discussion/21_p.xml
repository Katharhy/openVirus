<p>The potential limitations of this scoping review include the fact that most studies were conducted in a single country (China), which may increase information bias, and the fact that other socio-cultural contexts are not contextualized. Note also that there is a lack of controlled clinical trials or observational studies. The sudden onset of the pandemic and intense flow of information hinders the availability of strong and/or sound recommendations. The decision to select studies written in three different languages limited the findings, as most of the scientific knowledge has been produced in China and was not available in the languages selected for this review.</p>
