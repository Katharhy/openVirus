<p id="par0055">Studies showing the behavior of the COVID-19 infection indicate that between 70 and 80% of the infected population will have mild or moderate symptoms, 15% will have severe infections manifested by severe dyspnea with hypoxemia and pulmonary infiltrates, and 5% will have critical conditions with respiratory failure, septic shock, and multi-organ dysfunction.

 </xref> Patients in higher age groups (over 60 years old) and with associated comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes have the highest mortality rates.

 </xref> Among the predictors of worse prognosis are the presence of dyspnea, lymphopenia, elevated neutrophils, and decreased monocytes and platelets. The CD4 and CD8 T lymphocyte count is lower, and the ureic nitrogen and creatinine is higher. In other words, there is an evident suppression of cellular immunity along with a severe inflammatory reaction that can lead to death. There is a greater proportion of dyspnea symptoms in patients who die compared to survivors who do not suffer fevers, headaches, and other symptoms (

 </xref> Other factors that are prevalent in patients who die from COVID-19 are a decrease in albumin, an increase in lactate, a slight decrease in the number of red cells and hemoglobin, and an increase in lactic dehydrogenase.
