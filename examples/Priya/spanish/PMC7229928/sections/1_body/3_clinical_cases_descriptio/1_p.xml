 </xref> Colchicine was used for the symptomatic management of the clinical manifestations of IA. These patients were treated with an initial impregnation dose as is done in the management of an acute attack of gout: First day: 1 mg every 8 h. Second day: 1 mg every 12 h and from the third day on a maintenance dose of 0.5–1 mg per day for 3–4 weeks until remission of symptoms. This is repeated between 1 and 3 times a year depending on the reappearance of symptoms such as: pain, erythema, arthralgia, headache, insomnia, and depression. In general, control is regained over the inflammatory or autoimmune process that occurred in these patients. A similar use has been shown and a favorable outcome has been achieved with colchicine in patients with foreign body granuloma as an inflammatory tissue reaction to exogenous material (therapeutic embolization of the facial arteries),
