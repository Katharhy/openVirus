<p id="par0015">The rapid spread of COVID-19 was mainly due to pre-symptomatic cases and traveling of cases with or without symptoms. Many countries are implementing social distancing as key containment measures.

 </xref> In a new modeling study in Singapore, Koo and colleagues found that the combined approach of physical distancing interventions, quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing, is the most effective at reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

 </xref> Because of population movement in everyday life, maintaining 6 feet distancing in public places such as work environment, restaurants, public transportation and market areas is difficult to comply with distancing. While hand washing can effectively limit transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through indirect contact, hand rubbing with alcohol based hand sanitizers and disinfectants are also recommended to be practiced by infected individuals, their close contacts as well as by the general population. This practice could help lower the risk of COVID-19 transmission.
