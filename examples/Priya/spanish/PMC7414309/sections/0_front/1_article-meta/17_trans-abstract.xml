  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>A survey was conducted of the tutors of rehabilitation departments. The questionnaire contained 31 questions divided into 6 parts about the following: general information on the department, adaptation of rehabilitation departments to the COVID pandemic, clinical work of rehabilitation physicians, the approach to rehabilitation in COVID patients, and the effects of the pandemic on the health and teaching activity of rehabilitation physicians during this period.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>A total of 54 responses were obtained. Almost half of the departments cancelled face-to-face medical consultations (40%) and 48% of the treatment rooms were turned into COVID beds. In 30 hospitals (55.6%), the physicians worked in COVID units. Most of the rehabilitation departments developed both graphic and audiovisual material with exercises, referral protocols and guidelines for the rehabilitation management and treatment of COVID 19 patients. Half of the departments reported some anxiety symptoms in medical staff. Tutorial work has been cancelled (40.7%) or reduced (35.2%).</p>

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p>The organisation of Spanish rehabilitation departments in response to the COVID pandemic has been very similar throughout the country. The response of these departments to the healthcare crisis has revealed the versatility of rehabilitation physicians.</p>
