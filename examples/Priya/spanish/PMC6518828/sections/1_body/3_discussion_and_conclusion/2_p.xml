<p>In the current study, the analysis of time series allowed the development of SARIMA models, which satisfactorily fit the dengue incidence data collected in the municipalities of Ribeirão Preto and São Paulo, in addition to forecasting the number of dengue cases for a subsequent year. Our fitted model has a larger order of the autoregressive term because it was necessary to take into account the residual autocorrelation to meet all the model assumptions. This means that the choice of an appropriate SARIMA model depends on each particular analysed time series and for each case a complete residual analyses must be accomplished, after choosing a candidate model using the AIC criteria. In this study, for the municipality of Ribeirão Preto, from 2000 to 2015, the SARIMA model (6,1,0)(2,0,0)
 <sub>12</sub> presented the best fit. On the other hand, Martinez &amp; Silva [

 <sub>12</sub> was the one that had the best fit for the incidence of dengue cases in the period from 2000 to 2008, for the same municipality. In this sense, we can see that the different series require different SARIMA models.
