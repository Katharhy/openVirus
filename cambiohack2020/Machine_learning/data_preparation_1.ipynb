      "Three leading infectious disease experts in China were invited to share their bedside observations in the management of COVID-19 patients. Professor Taisheng Li was sent to Wuhan to provide frontline medical care. He depicts the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, he observes the significant abnormality of coagulation function and proposes that the early intravenous immunoglobulin and low molecular weight heparin anticoagulation therapy are very important. Professor Hongzhou Lu, a leader in China to try various anti-viral drugs, expresses concern on the quality of the ongoing clinical trials as most trials are small in scale and repetitive in nature, and emphasizes the importance of the quick publication of clinical trial results. Regarding the traditional Chinese medicine, Professor Lu suggests to develop a creative evaluation system because of the complicated chemical compositions. Professor Wenhong Zhang is responsible for Shanghai's overall clinical management of the COVID-19 cases. He introduces the team approach to manage COVID-19 patients. For severe or critically ill patients, in addition to the respiratory supportive treatment, timely multiorgan evaluation and treatment is very crucial. The medical decisions and interventions are carefully tailored to the unique characteristics of each patient.\n",

      "As a result of the 2019 novel human coronavirus (COVID-19) global spread, medical examiner/coroner offices will inevitably encounter increased numbers of COVID-19–infected decedents at autopsy. While in some cases a history of fever and/or respiratory distress (eg, cough or shortness of breath) may suggest the diagnosis, epidemiologic studies indicate that the majority of individuals infected with COVID-19 develop mild to no symptoms. Those dying with—but not of—COVID-19 may still be infectious, however. While multiple guidelines have been issued regarding autopsy protocol in cases of suspected COVID-19 deaths, there is some variability in the recommendations. Additionally, limited recommendations to date have been issued regarding scene investigative protocol, and there is a paucity of publications characterizing COVID-19 postmortem gross and histologic findings. A case of sudden unexpected death due to COVID-19 is presented as a means of illustrating common autopsy findings, as well as diagnostic and biosafety considerations. We also review and summarize the current COVID-19 literature in an effort to provide practical evidence-based biosafety guidance for medical examiner-coroner offices encountering COVID-19 at autopsy.\n",

      "COVID‐19 is a systemic infection with a significant impact on the hematopoietic system and hemostasis. Lymphopenia may be considered as a cardinal laboratory finding, with prognostic potential. Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and peak platelet/lymphocyte ratio may also have prognostic value in determining severe cases. During the disease course, longitudinal evaluation of lymphocyte count dynamics and inflammatory indices, including LDH, CRP and IL‐6 may help to identify cases with dismal prognosis and prompt intervention in order to improve outcomes. Biomarkers, such high serum procalcitonin and ferritin have also emerged as poor prognostic factors. Furthermore, blood hypercoagulability is common among hospitalized COVID‐19 patients. Elevated D‐Dimer levels are consistently reported, whereas their gradual increase during disease course is particularly associated with disease worsening. Other coagulation abnormalities such as PT and aPTT prolongation, fibrin degradation products increase, with severe thrombocytopenia lead to life‐threatening disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which necessitates continuous vigilance and prompt intervention.

      "The ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. The etiologic agent is a novel coronavirus of presumed zoonotic origin with structural similarity to the viruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Like SARS and MERS, COVID‐19 infection manifests most frequently with lower respiratory symptoms. A minority of patients progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome/ diffuse alveolar damage. In addition to its central role in the diagnosis of COVID‐19 infection, the clinical laboratory provides critical information to clinicians regarding prognosis, disease course, and response to therapy. The purpose of this review is to 1) provide background context about the origins and course of the pandemic 2) discuss the laboratory’s role in the diagnosis of COVID‐19 infection 3) summarize the current state of biomarker analysis in COVID‐19 infection, with an emphasis on markers derived from the hematology laboratory 4) comment on the impact of COVID‐19 on hematology laboratory safety, and 5) describe the impact the pandemic has had on organized national and international educational activities worldwide.\n",

Ten kidney transplant recipients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) by polymerase chain reaction, and 9 were admitted. The median age was 57 (interquartile range [IQR] 47‐67), 60% were male, 40% Caucasian, and 30% Black/African American. Median time from transplant to COVID‐19 testing was 2822 days (IQR 1272‐4592). The most common symptom was fever, followed by cough, myalgia, chills, and fatigue. The most common chest X‐ray and computed tomography abnormality was multifocal patchy opacities. Three patients had no abnormal findings. Leukopenia was seen in 20% of patients, and allograft function was stable in 50% of patients. Nine patients were on tacrolimus and a mycophenolic antimetabolite, and 70% were on prednisone. Hospitalized patients had their antimetabolite agent stopped. All hospitalized patients received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Three patients died (30%), and 5 (50%) developed acute kidney injury. Kidney transplant recipients infected with COVID‐19 should be monitored closely in the setting of lowered immunosuppression.

As a chronic condition, osteoporosis generally requires sustained medical intervention(s) to limit the risks for additional bone loss, compromise of skeletal integrity, and fracture occurrence. Further complicating this issue is the fact that the abrupt cessation of some therapies can be associated with an increased risk for harm. It is in this context that the COVID‐19 pandemic has brought unprecedented disruption to the provision of health care globally, including near universal requirements for social distancing. In this Perspective, we provide evidence, where available, regarding the general care of patients with osteoporosis in the COVID‐19 era and provide clinical recommendations based primarily on expert opinion when data are absent.

Inability to eradicate the infected organ makes hyperinitiation of the immune system, which releases the excessive inflammatory cytokines to compensate the exhausted one as well as the low lymphocytes counts; it consequently leads to the cytokine storm syndrome. These mechanisms and the potential therapeutic targeting are discussed in this paper.\n",

      "The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a major public health crisis over the past few months. Overall case fatality rates range between 2–6%; however, the rates are higher in the elderly and those with underlying comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. Recent reports showed that about 2–11% of patients with COVID-19 had underlying chronic liver disease. During the previous SARS epidemic, around 60% of patients were reported to develop various degrees of liver damage. In the current pandemic, hepatic dysfunction has been seen in 14–53% of patients with COVID-19, particularly in those with severe disease. Cases of acute liver injury have been reported and are associated with higher mortality. Hepatic involvement in COVID-19 could be related to the direct cytopathic effect of the virus, an uncontrolled immune reaction, sepsis or drug-induced liver injury. The postulated mechanism of viral entry is through the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors that are abundantly present in type 2 alveolar cells. Interestingly, ACE2 receptors are expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, vascular endothelium and cholangiocytes of the liver. The effects of COVID-19 on underlying chronic liver disease require detailed evaluation and, with data currently lacking, further research is warranted in this area.\n",

Hyperpyrexia is an elevation of body temperature (BT) above 106.7 °F (41.5 °C) due to an abnormally increased hypothalamic thermo‐regulatory set. The pathophysiology, impact, and outcomes of hyperpyrexia in COVID‐19 patients have not yet been studied. Herein, we present clinical features and outcomes of six COVID‐19 patients who had developed hyperpyrexia during hospitalization. All patients expired shortly after the onset of hyperpyrexia. Hyperpyrexia seems to adversely impact the outcomes and mortality in patients with COVID‐19. The underlying mechanisms of developing hyperpyrexia in COVID‐19 are mysterious. We propose it may be caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 related brain injury, exuberant immune response, and thrombus formation. More research is needed to verify our results.

      "The pandemic of COVID‐19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Recent data showed that hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were the most prevalent comorbidities in COVID‐19 patients. Additionally, data indicate that hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases are important risk factors for progression and unfavorable outcome in COVID‐19 patients. There is only limited amount of data regarding follow‐up of these patients, and they provided conflicting results.

Indeed, new case definitions of vulnerability that emerge in a crisis may push previously unrecognized groups (e.g. service employees, ‘care’ facility residents) into extreme vulnerability, as borderline coping quickly becomes calamity coping.

      "In the fight against COVID-19, frontline health workers have been vital to keeping the pandemic at bay, but recognition of individual professions’ efforts have been inconsistent at all levels. Pharmacists around the world have continued to provide direct patient care and perform frontline duties for their communities during this pandemic, but are often relegated to the background and overlooked when frontline workers are heralded. Community pharmacists are the most accessible healthcare practitioners, which is further proven during the pandemic as they continued to provide direct patient care despite restrictions imposed by the government due to the pandemic. Due to the inaccessibility of other healthcare practitioners during this time, community pharmacists have reduced the burden on the healthcare system by diverting the influx of patients away from hospitals through triaging and screening patients. Community pharmacists have played various roles in supporting the healthcare system during COVID-19: delivering medications to patients, educating patients on telehealth services, assessing patients for renewal of chronic medications, performing consultations on minor ailments, clarifying misconceptions about COVID-19 treatments, and contributing to COVID-19 screening. Alongside ICU nurses, physicians, and respiratory therapists, hospital pharmacists have been part of the COVID-19 efforts and their roles include management of drug shortages, development of treatment protocols, participation of patient rounds, interpretation of lab results for COVID-19, participant recruitment for clinical trials, exploration of new drugs, medication management advice, and antimicrobial stewardship. Further support from pharmacists will be needed once a vaccine is launched in order to reach population-wide coverage. Amid COVID-19, pharmacists have not stopped working as frontline workers and they should be recognized as such.\n",

      "This review evaluates whether pregnancy is a risk factor for COVID-19 by looking at the expression of immune markers such as immune cells and cytokines in order to have a better understanding on the pathophysiology of the disease, thus reducing maternal deaths. Pregnant women are more at risk of contracting COVID-19 due to their weakened immune system. Studies demonstrate that COVID-19 is an immune condition which is marked by reduced lymphocytes and elevated selected proinflammatory cytokines. Similar immune expression has been demonstrated in pregnancy by several studies. In addition, the placenta has been shown to possess ACE2 receptors on the villous cytotrophoblast and the syncytiotrophoblast and findings suggest that the coronavirus enters the host cells via these ACE2 receptors. The immune response in pregnancy increases the risk of contracting COVID-19. Both normal pregnancy and COVID-19 are marked by decreased lymphocytes, NKG2A inhibitory receptors, and increased ACE2, IL-8, IL-10, and IP-10 it therefore safer to conclude that pregnancy is a risk factor for COVID-19 development. Furthermore, the presence of the ACE2 receptors in the placenta may increase the risk of mother to baby transmission of the virus.

COVID‐19 caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 is associated with an acute respiratory illness that varies from mild to the life‐threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The complement system is part of the innate immune arsenal against pathogens, in which many viruses can evade or employ to mediate cell entry. The immunopathology and acute lung injury orchestrated through the influx of pro‐inflammatory macrophages and neutrophils can be directly activated by complement components to prime an overzealous cytokine storm. The manifestations of severe COVID‐19 such as the ARDS, sepsis and multiorgan failure have an established relationship with activation of the complement cascade. We have collected evidence from all the current studies we are aware of on SARS‐CoV‐2 immunopathogenesis and the preceding literature on SARS‐CoV‐1 and MERS‐CoV infection linking severe COVID‐19 disease directly with dysfunction of the complement pathways.

The virus may affect the heart directly and indirectly with clinical syndromes of acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, acute coronary syndromes, heart failure, arrhythmias, and venous thromboembolism. Some therapeutics under investigation for COVID‐19 may also have adverse cardiac effects. The involvement of the RAAS system in viral entry makes it pertinent to consider the effects of medications that modulate the system. Comprehensive knowledge of peculiar cardiovascular manifestations of COVID‐19 and the role of RAAS in the prognosis of COVID‐19 disease is needed for optimal patient management.\n",

      "The COVID‐19 pandemic has provided many challenges in the field of thrombosis and haemostasis. Among these is a novel form of coagulopathy that includes exceptionally high levels of D‐dimer. D‐dimer is a marker of poor prognosis, but does this also imply a causal relationship? These spectacularly raised D‐dimer levels may actually signify the failing attempt of the fibrinolytic system to remove fibrin and necrotic tissue from the lung parenchyma, being consumed or overwhelmed in the process. Indeed, recent studies suggest that increasing fibrinolytic activity might offer hope for patients with critical disease and severe respiratory failure. However, the fibrinolytic system can also be harnessed by coronavirus to promote infectivity and where anti‐fibrinolytic measures would also seem appropriate. Hence, there is a clinical paradox where plasmin formation can be either deleterious or beneficial in COVID‐19, but not at the same time. Hence, it all comes down to timing.\n",

      "The COVID‐19 pandemic has become an urgent issue in every country. Based on recent reports, the most severely ill patients present with coagulopathy, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)‐like massive intravascular clot formation is frequently seen in this cohort. Therefore, coagulation tests may be considered useful to discriminate severe cases of COVID‐19. The clinical presentation of COVID‐19‐associated coagulopathy is organ dysfunction primarily, while hemorrhagic events are less frequent. Changes in hemostatic biomarkers represented by increase in D‐dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products indicate the essence of coagulopathy is massive fibrin formation. In comparison with bacterial‐sepsis‐associated coagulopathy/DIC, prolongation of prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time, and decrease in antithrombin activity is less frequent and thrombocytopenia is relatively uncommon in COVID‐19. The mechanisms of the coagulopathy are not fully elucidated, however. It is speculated that the dysregulated immune responses orchestrated by inflammatory cytokines, lymphocyte cell‐death, hypoxia, and endothelial damage are involved. Bleeding tendency is uncommon, but the incidence of thrombosis in COVID‐19 and the adequacy of current recommendations regarding standard venous thromboembolic dosing are uncertain.\n",

      "Recent case-series of small size implied a pathophysiological association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe large-vessel acute ischemic stroke. Given that severe strokes are typically associated with poor prognosis and can be very efficiently treated with recanalization techniques, confirmation of this putative association is urgently warranted in a large representative patient cohort to alert stroke clinicians, and inform pre- and in-hospital acute stroke patient pathways. We pooled all consecutive patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and acute ischemic stroke in 28 sites from 16 countries. To assess whether stroke severity and outcomes (assessed at discharge or at the latest assessment for those patients still hospitalized) in patients with acute ischemic stroke are different between patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19, we performed 1:1 propensity score matching analyses of our COVID-19 patients with non-COVID-19 patients registered in the Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne Registry between 2003 and 2019. Between January 27, 2020, and May 19, 2020, 174 patients (median age 71.2 years; 37.9% females) with COVID-19 and acute ischemic stroke were hospitalized (median of 12 patients per site).

      "The pandemic caused by the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus (coronavirus) and the associated illness, COVID‐19, has caused a level of worldwide upheaval unlike any most people now living have seen in their lifetimes. This crisis affects people in their most important, committed, and intimate relationships. Although this crisis has damaged the health and well‐being of individuals, crushed economies, and led to an extensive period of uncertainty about the future, there may also be positive outcomes in the motivation people have to protect their relationships. In this paper, we focus on strategies that therapists and relationship educators can use to help couples preserve and protect their relationships during such a time. We describe four foundations of safety that allow relationships to thrive: physical, emotional, commitment, and community. We then highlight three keys from our body of work that can help guide individuals and couples in protecting their relationships on a day‐to‐day and moment‐to‐moment basis: (1) decide, don’t slide; (2) make it safe to connect; (3) do your part.\n",

      "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), which began in Wuhan, China in December 2019 has caused a large global pandemic and poses a serious threat to public health. More than four million cases of COVID‐19, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), have been confirmed as of May 11, 2020. SARS‐CoV‐2 is a highly pathogenic and transmissible coronavirus that primarily spreads through respiratory droplets and close contact. A growing body of clinical data suggests that a cytokine storm is associated with COVID‐19 severity and is also a crucial cause of death from COVID‐19. In the absence of antivirals and vaccines for COVID‐19, there is an urgent need to understand the cytokine storm in COVID‐19. Here, we have reviewed the current understanding of the features of SARS‐CoV‐2 and the pathological features, pathophysiological mechanisms, and treatments of the cytokine storm induced by COVID‐19. Additionally, we suggest that the identification and treatment of the cytokine storm are important components for rescuing patients with severe COVID‐19.\n",

Infidelity is also one of the most frequently cited reasons for divorce. The increased stress brought on by the pandemic may be putting couples at an increased risk for experiencing infidelity and data collected during the pandemic have shown that people across the United States are engaging in behaviors that are associated with a high likelihood of experiencing infidelity. The negative consequences of infidelity are also likely to be exacerbated for couples during the pandemic due to the intersection with the social, emotional, and financial consequences of COVID‐19. Furthermore, couples are likely to experience disruptions and delays to the affair recovery process during the pandemic, which can negatively impact their ability to heal.

      "ML_covid_1\\PMC7366507,the covid 19 pandemic has created huge damage to society and brought panic around the world  such panic can be ascribed to the seemingly deceptive features of covid 19  compared to other deadly viral outbreaks  it has medium transmission and mortality rates  as a result  the severity of the causative coronavirus  sars cov 2  was deeply underestimated by society at the beginning of the covid 19 outbreak  based on this  in this review  we define the viruses with features similar to those of sars cov 2 as the panic zone viruses  to contain those viruses  accurate and fast diagnosis followed by effective isolation and treatment of patients are pivotal at the early stage of virus breakouts  this is especially true when there is no cure or vaccine available for a transmissible disease  which is the case for the current covid 19 pandemic  as of july 2020  more than 100 kits for covid 19 diagnosis on the market have been surveyed in this review  while emerging sensing techniques for sars cov 2 are also discussed  it is of critical importance to rationally use these kits for efficient management and control of the panic zone viruses  therefore  we discuss guidelines to select diagnostic kits at different outbreak stages of the panic zone viruses  sars cov 2 in particular  while it is of utmost importance to use nucleic acid based detection kits with low false negativity  high sensitivity  at the early stage of an outbreak  the low false positivity  high specificity  gains importance at later stages of the outbreak  when society is set to reopen from the lockdown stage of the covid 19 pandemic  it becomes critical to have immunoassay based kits with high specificity to identify people who can safely return to society after their recovery from sars cov 2 infections  finally  since a massive attack from a viral pandemic requires a massive defense from the whole society  we urge both government and the private sector to research and develop affordable and reliable point of care testing  poct  kits  which can be used massively by the general public  and therefore called massive poct  to contain panic zone viruses in the future,true\n",

      "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness is a syndrome of viral replication in concert with a host inflammatory response. The cytokine storm and viral evasion of cellular immune responses may play an equally important role in the pathogenesis, clinical manifestation, and outcomes of COVID-19. Systemic proinflammatory cytokines and biomarkers are elevated as the disease progresses towards its advanced stages, and correlate with worse chances of survival. Immune modulators have the potential to inhibit cytokines and treat the cytokine storm. A literature search using PubMed, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted through 8 July 2020 using the search terms ‘coronavirus’, ‘immunology’, ‘cytokine storm’, ‘immunomodulators’, ‘pharmacology’, ‘severe acute respiratory syndrome 2’, ‘SARS-CoV-2’, and ‘COVID-19’. Specific immune modulators include anti-cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 receptor antagonists (e.g. anakinra, tocilizumab, sarilumab, siltuximab), Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (e.g. baricitinib, ruxolitinib), anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (e.g. adalimumab, infliximab), granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factors (e.g. gimsilumab, lenzilumab, namilumab), and convalescent plasma, with promising to negative trials and other data. Non-specific immune modulators include human immunoglobulin, corticosteroids such as dexamethasone, interferons, statins, angiotensin pathway modulators, macrolides (e.g. azithromycin, clarithromycin), hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, colchicine, and prostaglandin D2 modulators such as ramatroban. Dexamethasone 6 mg once daily (either by mouth or by intravenous injection) for 10 days may result in a reduction in mortality in COVID-19 patients by one-third for patients on ventilators, and by one-fifth for those receiving oxygen. Research efforts should focus not only on the most relevant immunomodulatory strategies but also on the optimal timing of such interventions to maximize therapeutic outcomes. In this review, we discuss the potential role and safety of these agents in the management of severe COVID-19, and their impact on survival and clinical symptoms.\n",

      "Infection by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the second pandemic of the XXI century after influenza A in 2009. As of mid-June 2020, more than 4,40,000 fatal cases of SARS-CoV-2-related disease (COVID-19) have occurred worldwide. Besides its prominent expression at the level of the respiratory apparatus, COVID-19 is also characterized by a substantial degree of cardiovascular involvement, both in terms of deterioration of pre-existing conditions, and as the effect of inflammation-facilitated acute events. They include ischemic/inflammatory heart disease, ventricular arrhythmias, conduction disturbances, thrombotic events at the level of the lungs, and systemic activation of the coagulation cascade, configuring the scenario of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Herein, we summarize the main COVID-19 features of relevance for the clinicians in the cardiovascular field. The rationale, concerns, and possible side effects of specific therapeutic measures, including anticoagulants, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, and anti-inflammatory/antiviral medications applied to the treatment of COVID-19 are also discussed.\n",

Nox2 activation by soluble Nox2-derived peptide(sNox2-dp) was measured in patients hospitalized for Covid-19 (n = 182) and controls (n = 91). sNox2-dp values were higher in Covid-19 patients versus controls and in severe versus non severe Covid-19. Patients with thrombotic events(n = 35,19%) had higher sNox2-dp than thrombotic event-free ones.

      "The recent outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in Hubei province, China, in December 2019 and has spread worldwide at an alarming rate. With over eight million individuals infected and exceeding 400,000 deaths globally, the necessity to develop fast and efficient diagnostic methods is of high importance. This paper reports on currently available diagnostic screening methods for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to guide frontline healthcare workers involved with the diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patient. An electronic literature search was performed for peer-reviewed articles published from January 1, 2020, until June 19, 2020. Published articles were then reviewed and included based on the applicability to the topic. The preferred diagnostic approach is the reverse transcription (RT) of the virus’ ribonucleic acid (RNA) followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification (RT-PCR). However, this method has been proven to be time-consuming. In improving the speed and efficiency of diagnostics, newer rapid diagnostic serological tests are in development for testing SARS-CoV-2, each with its unique advantages and disadvantages. They could potentially be used as triage tests to rapidly identify patients who are very likely to have COVID-19 in combination with other accurate diagnostic methods, such as diagnostic imaging. A combination of the disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory diagnostic testing, and diagnostic imaging is crucial for making an accurate and useful diagnosis for COVID-19. Hopefully, the continuous development and use of rapid diagnostic tests and the implementation of public health measures will help control the spread of the disease.\n",

      "The recent novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is seeing a rapid increase in infected patients worldwide. The host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 appears to play a critical role in disease pathogenesis and clinical manifestations. SARS-CoV-2 not only activates antiviral immune responses, but can also cause uncontrolled inflammatory responses characterized by marked pro-inflammatory cytokine release in patients with severe COVID-19, leading to lymphopenia, lymphocyte dysfunction, and granulocyte and monocyte abnormalities. These SARS-CoV-2-induced immune abnormalities may lead to infections by microorganisms, septic shock, and severe multiple organ dysfunction. Therefore, mechanisms underlying immune abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 must be elucidated to guide clinical management of the disease. Moreover, rational management of the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, which includes enhancing anti-viral immunity while inhibiting systemic inflammation, may be key to successful treatment. In this review, we discuss the immunopathology of COVID-19, its potential mechanisms, and clinical implications to aid the development of new therapeutic strategies against COVID-19.\n",

The current COVID-19 pandemic may raise specific concerns for clinicians prescribing clozapine for patients who need it. We report on two actively psychotic patients with treatment resistant schizophrenia who required admission to our inner-London acute psychiatric unit during the COVID-19 pandemic and who were treated with clozapine. One was a young patient who developed COVID-19 symptoms and tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus while receiving clozapine and the other was an aging man who tested negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus but had contact with COVID-19 during initiation of clozapine treatment. Both responded to clozapine treatment and were safely discharged from hospital without any complication. These cases suggest that, in the absence of complications, exposure to COVID-19 per se and the onset of mild symptoms in those infected may not warrant withdrawal or postponement of clozapine treatment when this is indicated.\n",

      "Heart failure is a common disease state that can be encountered at different stages in the course of a COVID-19 patient presentation. New or existing heart failure in the setting of COVID-19 can present a set of unique challenges that can complicate presentation, management, and prognosis. A careful understanding of the hemodynamic and diagnostic implications is essential for appropriate triage and management of these patients. Abnormal cardiac biomarkers are common in COVID-19 and can stem from a variety of mechanisms that involve the viral entry itself through the ACE2 receptors, direct cardiac injury, increased thrombotic activity, stress cardiomyopathy, and among others. The cytokine storm observed in this pandemic can be a culprit in many of the observed mechanisms and presentations. A correct understanding of the two-way interaction between heart failure medications and the infection as well as the proposed COVID-19 medications and heart failure can result in optimal management. Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure should not be interrupted for theoretical concerns but rather based on tolerance and clinical presentation. Initiating specific cardiac or heart failure medications to prevent the infection or mitigate the disease is also not an evidence-based practice at this time. Heart failure patients on advanced therapies including those with heart transplantation will particularly benefit from involving the advanced heart failure team members in the overall management if they contract the virus.\n",

      "The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a world health emergency. The disease predominantly effects individuals between 30 and 79 years of age with 81% of cases being classified as mild. Despite the majority of the general population displaying symptoms similar to the common cold, COVID-19 has also induced alveolar damage resulting in progressive respiratory failure with fatalities noted in 6.4% of cases.

      "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global crisis, challenging healthcare systems worldwide. Many patients present with a remarkable disconnect in rest between profound hypoxemia yet without proportional signs of respiratory distress (i.e. happy hypoxemia) and rapid deterioration can occur. This particular clinical presentation in COVID-19 patients contrasts with the experience of physicians usually treating critically ill patients in respiratory failure and ensuring timely referral to the intensive care unit can, therefore, be challenging. A thorough understanding of the pathophysiological determinants of respiratory drive and hypoxemia may promote a more complete comprehension of a patient’s clinical presentation and management. Preserved oxygen saturation despite low partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood samples occur, due to leftward shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve induced by hypoxemia-driven hyperventilation as well as possible direct viral interactions with hemoglobin.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), similarly to other coronaviruses demonstrate neurotropism; the viral infection of the brain stem may complicate the course of the disease through damaging central cardio-respiratory control. The systemic inflammation as well as neuroinflammatory changes are associated with massive increase of the brain pro-inflammatory molecules, neuroglial reactivity, altered neurochemical landscape and pathological remodelling of neuronal networks. These organic changes, emerging in concert with environmental stress caused by experiences of intensive therapy wards, pandemic fears and social restrictions, promote neuropsychiatric pathologies including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder (BD), various psychoses, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.

      "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has expanded rapidly throughout the world. Thus, it is important to understand how global factors linked with the functioning of the Anthropocene are responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak. We tested hypotheses that the number of COVID-19 cases, number of deaths and growth rate of recorded infections: (1) are positively associated with population density as well as (2) proportion of the human population living in urban areas as a proxies of interpersonal contact rate, (3) age of the population in a given country as an indication of that population’s susceptibility to COVID-19; (4) net migration rate and (5) number of tourists as proxies of infection pressure, and negatively associated with (5) gross domestic product which is a proxy of health care quality. Data at the country level were compiled from publicly available databases and analysed with gradient boosting regression trees after controlling for confounding factors (e.g. geographic location). We found a positive association between the number of COVID-19 cases in a given country and gross domestic product, number of tourists, and geographic longitude. The number of deaths was positively associated with gross domestic product, number of tourists in a country, and geographic longitude. The effects of gross domestic product and number of tourists were non-linear, with clear thresholds above which the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths increased rapidly. The growth rate of COVID-19 cases was positively linked to the number of tourists and gross domestic product. The growth rate of COVID-19 cases was negatively associated with the mean age of the population and geographic longitude. Growth was slower in less urbanised countries. This study demonstrates that the characteristics of the human population and high mobility, but not population density, may help explain the global spread of the virus. In addition, geography, possibly via climate, may play a role in the pandemic. The unexpected positive and strong association between gross domestic product and number of cases, deaths, and growth rate suggests that COVID-19 may be a new civilisation disease affecting rich economies.\n",

      "Residential colleges and universities face unique challenges in providing in-person instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Administrators are currently faced with decisions about whether to open during the pandemic and what modifications of their normal operations might be necessary to protect students, faculty and staff. There is little information, however, on what measures are likely to be most effective and whether existing interventions could contain the spread of an outbreak on campus. We develop a full-scale stochastic agent-based model to determine whether in-person instruction could safely continue during the pandemic and evaluate the necessity of various interventions. Simulation results indicate that large scale randomized testing, contact-tracing, and quarantining are important components of a successful strategy for containing campus outbreaks. High test specificity is critical for keeping the size of the quarantine population manageable. Moving the largest classes online is also crucial for controlling both the size of outbreaks and the number of students in quarantine. Increased residential exposure can significantly impact the size of an outbreak, but it is likely more important to control non-residential social exposure among students. Finally, necessarily high quarantine rates even in controlled outbreaks imply significant absenteeism, indicating a need to plan for remote instruction of quarantined students.\n",

All medical specialties including gastroenterology are impacted by COVID-19. Here, we review the bidirectional comorbidity of chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and COVID-19, including the incidence and outcome of COVID-19 in individuals with various GI disorders and the impact of COVID-19 on the course and outcome of the underlying (or comorbid) GI disorders. Currently, there is no evidence that COVID-19 is more (or less) frequent in comorbid GI disorders. It is also reassuring that the outcome of COVID-19 is unaffected by the underlying GI disorder or its treatment, though potential concerns remain in regard to the use of immunomodulatory treatments in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and liver transplant recipients. Despite these concerns, there is now agreement among experts that ongoing immunomodulatory treatments may not be interrupted in individuals with IBD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Caution, however, may be exercised with the use of corticosteroids in the management of IBD. In addition, COVID-19 does not appear to impact the manifestations, course, outcome, and treatment of comorbid GI disorders, e.g. IBD.

Shocking statistics each day has prompted the World Health Organization to officially declare the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic in March 2020. Preliminary studies have shown increased mortality in patients with solid cancers and infection by SARS-CoV-2. Until now, the evidence on the behavior of COVID-19 in patients with a history of thyroid cancer remains scarce, and most of the recommendations given are based on common sense.

      "COVID-19 pandemia is affecting Countries worldwide with a gendered death excess as being a male represents, especially in the 50–69 years age group, an unfavourable factor. Females are constitutionally prone to defend themselves against pathogens with a stronger efficiency than males. As a fact, several genes involved into the regulation of the innate and adaptive immune response are strategically placed on the X-chromosome and, among them, pathogen-related receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptor 7, suitable to recognize ssRNAs and trigger a gendered successful anti-viral fight. On the other hand, a more regulated IL-6 production and a more contained inflammation after the encounter of a pathogen supply score points in favour of the female sex in the view that an abnormal and exaggerated cytokine release does represent the hallmark of the deathful SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sex-prevalent expression of the attachment and permissive molecules ACE2 and TMPRSS2 further supports the concept of a male-oriented vulnerability.

      "In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or (2019-nCoV) with unknown origin spread in Hubei province of China. The epidemic disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 called coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The presence of COVID-19 was manifested by several symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic/mild symptoms to severe illness and death. The viral infection expanded internationally and WHO announced a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. To quickly diagnose and control such a highly infectious disease, suspicious individuals were isolated and diagnostic/treatment procedures were developed through patients’ epidemiological and clinical data. Early in the COVID-19 outbreak, WHO invited hundreds of researchers from around the world to develop a rapid quality diagnosis, treatment and vaccines, but so far no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine has been approved by the FDA. At present, COVID-19 is managed by available antiviral drugs to improve the symptoms, and in severe cases, supportive care including oxygen and mechanical ventilation is used for infected patients. However, due to the worldwide spread of the virus, COVID-19 has become a serious concern in the medical community. According to the current data of WHO, the number of infected and dead cases has increased to 8,708,008 and 461,715, respectively (Dec 2019 –June 2020). Given the high mortality rate and economic damage to various communities to date, great efforts must be made to produce successful drugs and vaccines against 2019-nCoV infection. For this reason, first of all, the characteristics of the virus, its pathogenicity, and its infectious pathways must be well known. Thus, the main purpose of this review is to provide an overview of this epidemic disease based on the current evidence.\n",

The analysis of the detected cases, severity and outcomes of the cases within a country is important to have a clear picture of where the pandemic is heading and what measures should be taken to curb the infection before it becomes uncontrollable. We collected data regarding all the cases, recoveries and deaths attributed to COVID-19 in Nepal starting from the first case on 23 January to 21 June 2020. At present, COVID-19 has spread all over Nepal, with a rapid increase in the number of new cases and deaths, which is alarming in a low-income country with an inadequate healthcare system like Nepal.

Teletherapy became the primary means of service delivery for many who had never or only sparingly used it. The Family Institute at Northwestern University, in response to encouraging findings with respect to the effectiveness of teletherapy and recognizing advantages with respect to access to care, launched our teletherapy services in 2018. As a relationship–based organization, we were keen to exploit the opportunity that teletherapy provides to integrate additional members of the client system into the treatment. Over these two plus years we have learned a great deal. Our learning was greatly accelerated by our transition to a 100% teletherapy practice in the wake of the pandemic. Teletherapy is a different context. Intentionally managing the context’s constraints and exploiting its strengths is key to providing high quality couple and family therapy.

Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is suspected to originate from an animal host (zoonotic origin) followed by human-to-human transmission, the possibility of other routes should not be ruled out. Compared to diseases caused by previously known human CoVs, COVID-19 shows less severe pathogenesis but higher transmission competence, as is evident from the continuously increasing number of confirmed cases globally. Compared to other emerging viruses, such as Ebola virus, avian H7N9, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 has shown relatively low pathogenicity and moderate transmissibility. Codon usage studies suggest that this novel virus has been transferred from an animal source, such as bats. Early diagnosis by real-time PCR and next-generation sequencing has facilitated the identification of the pathogen at an early stage. Since no antiviral drug or vaccine exists to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2, potential therapeutic strategies that are currently being evaluated predominantly stem from previous experience with treating SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other emerging viral diseases. In this review, we address epidemiological, diagnostic, clinical, and therapeutic aspects, including perspectives of vaccines and preventive measures that have already been globally recommended to counter this pandemic virus.\n",

As we have not developed curative medicine and effective vaccine, the end of this life-threatening infectious disease is still unclear. Severe COVID-19 is often associated with hypercytokinemia, which is typically found in macrophage activation syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes this strong inflammation within the lung and propagates to respiratory and, ultimately, systemic organ malfunction.

      "COVID-19 has emerged as a pandemic with lung being the primarily afflicted organ. Deranged hemostasis has been observed in patients with COVID-19 with scales tipped towards a prothrombotic state. The pathogenesis differs from disseminated intravascular coagulation with a primary pulmonary localization. This is referred to as pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy with strong component of thrombo-inflammation. This is reflected in the lab tests with an increase in D-dimer which correlates with severity and outcomes of disease. Common coagulation tests such as prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time are only mildly prolonged while most patients have normal to increased fibrinogen and marginal thrombocytopenia. Overall, the patients have an increase in venous and arterial thrombotic events especially in ICU patients. Routine thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin is recommended in all hospitalized patients to reduce the incidence of thrombosis. Bleeding is uncommon and treated with blood products transfusion. This review shall discuss the hemostatic abnormalities in COVID-19 patients and their impact on prognosis.

First, the reporting on cases has concentrated on hospitalised and intensive care unit (ICU) patients, rather than on mild, outpatient cases.

In addition to pneumonia, other COVID‐19‐associated symptoms have been reported, including loss of smell (anosmia). However, the connection between infection with coronavirus and anosmia remains enigmatic. It has been reported that defects in olfactory cilia lead to anosmia. In this Viewpoint, we summarize transmission electron microscopic studies of cilia in virus‐infected cells. In the human nasal epithelium, coronavirus infects the ciliated cells and causes deciliation. Research has shown that viruses such as influenza and Sendai attach to the ciliary membrane. The Sendai virus enters cilia by fusing its viral membrane with the ciliary membrane. A recent study on SARS‐CoV‐2–human protein–protein interactions revealed that the viral nonstructural protein Nsp13 interacts with the centrosome components, providing a potential molecular link. The mucociliary escalator removes inhaled pathogenic particles and functions as the first line of protection mechanism against viral infection in the human airway. Thus, future investigation into the virus–cilium interface will help further the battle against COVID‐19.\n",

      "As the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic marches unrelentingly, more patients with cardiac arrhythmias are emerging due to the effects of the virus on the respiratory and cardiovascular (CV) systems and the systemic inflammation that it incurs, and also as a result of the proarrhythmic effects of COVID-19 pharmacotherapies and other drug interactions and the associated autonomic imbalance that enhance arrhythmogenicity. The most worrisome of all arrhythmogenic mechanisms is the QT prolonging effect of various anti-COVID pharmacotherapies that can lead to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in the form of torsade des pointes and sudden cardiac death. It is therefore imperative to monitor the QT interval during treatment; however, conventional approaches to such monitoring increase the transmission risk for the staff and strain the health system. Hence, there is dire need for contactless monitoring and telemetry for inpatients, especially those admitted to the intensive care unit, as well as for outpatients needing continued management.

There is variation in case fatality rate (CFR), which in some cities (like Khartoum) was low (3.8%), but in others (like North Darfur) it was very high (31.7%). The government of Sudan has implemented preventive measures during the current coronavirus disease pandemic, such as partial lockdown, contact monitoring, risk communication, social distance, quarantine and isolation to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, there are new community cases every day; this could be as a result of the weak application of these measures by the government, and the lack of commitment of people to these measures. The number of COVID-19 cases is currently decreasing in Sudan, but we are expected to see an increase in numbers of cases as a result of the massive demonstrations that occurred in Sudan recently, and as a result of the expected reopening and restoration of normal life.

To deeply explore the said matter, we divide the economic impact into six dimensions that is, Chinese economy, Central Asian economies, South Asian economies, South East and West Asian economies, European economies, Northern African, and Middle Eastern economies. The paper concludes that epidemic situations like COVID‐19 severely affect economies around the globe. The basic reasons behind such severity are immobility of labor, reduction in productivity, discontinuation of the supply chain, a decline in exports, uncertainty, and so on.

      "This case describes the successful pulmonary rehabilitation of a premorbidly independent female in the early 80s who was admitted for acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to COVID-19 requiring 14 days of intubation. Patient was admitted to the acute rehabilitation unit 1 month after hospitalisation. Patient initially had poor endurance and was only able to ambulate with a front wheel walker for 150 feet, and also had tachycardia and decreased oxygen saturation after ambulation. During patient’s rehabilitation course, therapy was focused on improving activity tolerance. Ten days after admission, patient was able to ambulate without an assistive device for 250 feet and with a rollator for over 900 feet.

      "COVID-19 is a pandemic viral disease with catastrophic global impact. This disease is more contagious than influenza such that cluster outbreaks occur frequently. If patients with symptoms quickly underwent testing and contact tracing, these outbreaks could be contained. Unfortunately, COVID-19 patients have symptoms similar to other common illnesses. Here, we hypothesize the order of symptom occurrence could help patients and medical professionals more quickly distinguish COVID-19 from other respiratory diseases, yet such essential information is largely unavailable. To this end, we apply a Markov Process to a graded partially ordered set based on clinical observations of COVID-19 cases to ascertain the most likely order of discernible symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea) in COVID-19 patients. We then compared the progression of these symptoms in COVID-19 to other respiratory diseases, such as influenza, SARS, and MERS, to observe if the diseases present differently. Our model predicts that influenza initiates with cough, whereas COVID-19 like other coronavirus-related diseases initiates with fever. However, COVID-19 differs from SARS and MERS in the order of gastrointestinal symptoms. Our results support the notion that fever should be used to screen for entry into facilities as regions begin to reopen after the outbreak of Spring 2020. Additionally, our findings suggest that good clinical practice should involve recording the order of symptom occurrence in COVID-19 and other diseases. If such a systemic clinical practice had been standard since ancient diseases, perhaps the transition from local outbreak to pandemic could have been avoided.\n",

Drug repurposing has been employed to rapidly find a cure; but despite great efforts, no drug or vaccine is presently available for treating or prevention of COVID-19. Apart from antivirals, immunotherapeutic strategies are suggested considering the role of the immune response as the host defense against the virus, and the fact that SARS-CoV-2 suppresses interferon induction as an immune evasion strategy. Active immunization through vaccines, interferon administration, passive immunotherapy by convalescent plasma or synthesized monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, as well as immunomodulatory drugs, are different immunotherapeutic approaches that will be mentioned in this review. The focus would be on passive immunotherapeutic interventions.\n",

      "In mid-December 2019, a novel atypical pneumonia broke out in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and was caused by a newly identified coronavirus, initially termed 2019 Novel Coronavirus and subsequently severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 19 May 2020, a total of 4,731,458 individuals were reported as infected with SARS-CoV-2 among 213 countries, areas or territories with recorded cases, and the overall case-fatality rate was 6.6% (316,169 deaths among 4,731,458 recorded cases), according to the World Health Organization. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is notably similar to (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) SARS-CoV that emerged in 2002–2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that spread during 2012, and these viruses all contributed to global pandemics. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to rapidly spread a pneumonia-like disease from Hubei Province, China, throughout the world has provoked widespread concern. The main symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue and lower respiratory signs. At present, nucleic acid tests are widely recommended as the optimal method for detecting SARS-CoV-2. However, obstacles remain, including the global shortage of testing kits and the presentation of false negatives. Experts suggest that almost everyone in China is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to date, there are no effective treatments. In light of the references published, this review demonstrates the biological features, spread, diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 as a whole and aims to analyse the similarities and differences among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to provide new ideas and suggestions for prevention, diagnosis and clinical treatment.\n",

The model coefficients are calculated: the growth rate and the expected number of infected people, as well as the exponent indexes in the generalized logistic equation. It is shown that the dependence of the number of the infected people on time is well described on average by the logistic curve (within the framework of a simple or generalized logistic equation) with a determination coefficient exceeding 0.8. At the same time, the dependence of the number of the infected people per day on time has a very uneven character and can be described very roughly by the logistic curve. To describe it, it is necessary to take into account the dependence of the model coefficients on time or on the total number of cases. Variations, for example, of the growth rate can reach 60%. The variability spectra of the coefficients have characteristic peaks at periods of several days, which corresponds to the observed serial intervals. The use of the stochastic logistic equation is proposed to estimate the number of probable peaks in the coronavirus incidence.\n",

We also assemble data on government policy announcements and daily COVID-19 cases for all countries. Our panic index reveals widespread consumer panic in most countries, primarily during March, but with significant variation in the timing and severity of panic between countries. Our model implies that both domestic and world virus transmission contribute significantly to consumer panic. But government policy is also important: Internal movement restrictions – whether announced by domestic or foreign governments – generate substantial short run panic that largely vanishes in a week to ten days. Internal movement restrictions announced early in the pandemic generated more panic than those announced later. Stimulus announcements had smaller impacts, and travel restrictions do not appear to generate consumer panic.\n",

      "Epidemic forecasting has a dubious track-record, and its failures became more prominent with COVID-19. Poor data input, wrong modeling assumptions, high sensitivity of estimates, lack of incorporation of epidemiological features, poor past evidence on effects of available interventions, lack of transparency, errors, lack of determinacy, looking at only one or a few dimensions of the problem at hand, lack of expertise in crucial disciplines, groupthink and bandwagon effects and selective reporting are some of the causes of these failures. Nevertheless, epidemic forecasting is unlikely to be abandoned. Some (but not all) of these problems can be fixed. Careful modeling of predictive distributions rather than focusing on point estimates, considering multiple dimensions of impact, and continuously reappraising models based on their validated performance may help. If extreme values are considered, extremes should be considered for the consequences of multiple dimensions of impact so as to continuously calibrate predictive insights and decision-making. When major decisions (e.g. draconian lockdowns) are based on forecasts, the harms (in terms of health, economy, and society at large) and the asymmetry of risks need to be approached in a holistic fashion, considering the totality of the evidence.\n",

      "COVID-19 is becoming a leading cause of mortality throughout the world, and few effective therapies are currently available. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is essential to COVID-19 pathogenesis, as the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S protein) is required for viral entry and development of COVID-19. ACE2 regulates the protective arm of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) that endows anti-hypertensive and anti-inflammatory effects in the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. Preclinical data suggest ACE2 might be downregulated after SARS-CoV-2 binding, and treatments that increase ACE2 may prevent cardiopulmonary injury. Development, testing, and mass production of novel ACE2 therapies may take years, whereas more effective treatments for COVID-19 are needed urgently. Metformin is a widely available anti-diabetic agent that has an excellent safety profile, and clinical and preclinical data suggest metformin may offer cardiopulmonary protection in COVID-19 via enhanced ACE2 expression.\n",

Quantifying the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing disease transmission is key to rational policy making in response to the current and future pandemics. In order to estimate the effectiveness of these interventions, detailed descriptions of their timelines, scale and scope are needed. The Health Intervention Tracking for COVID-19 (HIT-COVID) is a curated and standardized global database that catalogues the implementation and relaxation of COVID-19 related PHSM.

      "With the more efficient involvement of both technology and policy factors in China’s whole industry-chain, the year 2020 is a key period for photovoltaic (PV) industry to achieve grid parity. In this context, COVID-19 may trigger a certain time-delay in new installed PV projects, thereby bringing an uncertain influence on the whole PV industry. To forecast the influence degree and influence cycle of COVID-19 on PV industry, this paper firstly clarifies the key features of epidemic situation as well as the basic rule of such pandemics’ transmission along industry-chain. Then this paper constructs a system dynamics model targeting at cost accounting of PV power generation under the influence of COVID-19 and thus forecasts the variation rules, superposition effects and influence cycle of levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of PV power generation and the operations cost of each sub-system. Empirical results show that PV industry has a lag response to the COVID-19 for 1 quarter and periodic response for 4 quarters, which is mainly embodied in the rise of short-term production cost. At the same time, the influence of COVID-19 on the upstream firms of PV industry is stronger than that on downstream firms.

      "In December 2019, a striking appearance of new cases of viral pneumonia in Wuhan led to the detection of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2). By analyzing patients with severe manifestations, it became apparent that 20 to 35% of patients who died had preexisting cardiovascular disease. This finding warrants the important need to discuss the influence of SARS-CoV2 infection on the cardiovascular system and hemodynamics in the context of clinical management, particularly during mechanical ventilation. The SARS-CoV2 enters human cells through the spike protein binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is important to cardiovascular modulation and endothelial signaling. As ACE2 is highly expressed in lung tissue, patients have been progressing to acute respiratory injury at an alarming frequency during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Moreover, COVID-19 leads to high D-dimer levels and prothrombin time, which indicates a substantial coagulation disorder. It seems that an overwhelming inflammatory and thrombogenic condition is responsible for a mismatching of ventilation and perfusion, with a somewhat near-normal static lung compliance, which describes two types of pulmonary conditions. As such, positive pressure during invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) must be applied with caution. The authors of this review appeal to the necessity of paying closer attention to assess microhemodynamic repercussion, by monitoring central venous oxygen saturation during strategies of IMV. It is well known that a severe respiratory infection and a scattered inflammatory process can cause non-ischemic myocardial injury, including progression to myocarditis. Early strategies that guide clinical decisions can be lifesaving and prevent extended myocardial damage. Moreover, cardiopulmonary failure refractory to standard treatment may necessitate the use of extreme therapeutic strategies, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. \n",

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced a major re-thinking in medical education worldwide. In this commentary, we examined the current merits and limitations of the direct ophthalmoscope in both the clinical sense and in the context of infection control. Furthermore, we compared the direct ophthalmoscope with alternatives, including commercially available portable non-mydriatic fundus cameras, that would allow a change in focus during ophthalmic teaching. We concluded that the latter will better prepare our medical students for the age of telemedicine and deep-learning systems. While the COVID-19 pandemic will not be the sole reason for the ‘death’ of the direct ophthalmoscope, the global situation will inevitably serve to expedite long overdue changes in our teaching of ophthalmic skills to non-ophthalmic physicians.\n",

      "The COronaVirus DISease 19 (COVID-19) is a pandemic infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Older age and presence of comorbidities, including diabetes, were shown to be associated with a more severe course and a higher fatality rate. Studies from the most affected countries, including China, United States and Italy, seem to indicate that prevalence of diabetes among patients affected by COVID-19 is not higher than that observed in the general population, thus suggesting that diabetes is not a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, a large body of evidence demonstrate that diabetes is a risk factor for disease progression towards critical illness, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, need for mechanical ventilation or admission to intensive care unit, and ultimately death. The mechanisms underlying the relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes remain to be elucidated. In particular, it is still unresolved whether is diabetes per se, especially if poorly controlled, or rather the various comorbidities/complications associated with it that predispose patients with COVID-19 to a worse prognosis. In fact, conditions that cluster with diabetes in the context of the metabolic syndrome, such as obesity and hypertension, or complicate chronic hyperglycemia, such as cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease, have also been associated with poor prognosis in these individuals and the available studies have not consistently shown that diabetes predict disease severity independently of them.\n",

We present a typical laboratory confirmed case of COVID-19 pneumonia, that was hospitalized due to hypoxemia but did not require mechanical ventilation. Although initially the patient was evaluated with a favorable outcome, in the third week of the disease, the symptomatology deteriorated due to a massive hypertensive pneumothorax with no known previous risk factor. Since the first cases of COVID-19 have been described, pneumothorax was characterized as a potential, though uncommon, complication. It has been reported that diffuse alveolar injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 can cause alveolar rupture, produce air leakage and interstitial emphysema. Although uncommon, pneumothorax should be listed as a differential diagnosis for COVID-19 patients with sudden respiratory decompensation. As a life-threatening event, it requires prompt recognition and expeditious treatment.\n",

      "The consequences of COVID-19 infecting pregnant women and the potential risks of vertical transmission have become a major issue. Since little is currently known about COVID-19 in pregnancy, the understanding of COVID-19 in this particular group will be updated in time, and a comprehensive review will be useful to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in pregnancy. Based on recently published literature and official documents, this review provides an introduction to the pathogenesis, pathology, and clinical features of COVID-19 and has focused on the current researches on clinical features, pregnancy outcomes and placental histopathological analysis from pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These viruses trigger a cytokine storm in the body, produce a series of immune responses, and cause changes in peripheral leukocytes and immune system cells leading to pregnancy complications that may be associated with viral infections. The expression of ACE2 receptors in the vascular endothelium may explain the histological changes of placentas from pregnant women infected by SARS-CoV-2. Pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia show similar clinical characteristics compared with non-pregnant counterparts. Although there is no unequivocal evidence to support the fetal infection by intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 so far, more and more articles began to report maternal deaths due to COVID-19. In particular, from February 26, 2020 (date of the first COVID-19 case reported in Brazil) until June 18, 2020, Brazil reported 124 maternal deaths. Therefore, pregnant women and neonates require special attention regarding the prevention, diagnosis and management of COVID-19.\n",

With a parallel comparison to previous pandemics such as SARS-CoV, H1N1 and MERS, we developed outlines for simulating the impact of the pandemic on the insurance industry. The study used qualitative and quantitative interviews to estimate the impact of the pandemic. Presently, the trend is an economic recession with decreasing profits but increasing claims. Due to the cancellation of travels, events and other economic losses, the Ghanaian insurance industry witnessed a loss currently estimated at GH Ȼ112 million. Our comparison and forecast predicts a normalization of economic indicators from January 2021. In the meantime, while the pandemic persists, insurers should adapt to working from remote locations, train and equip staff to work under social distancing regulations, enhance cybersecurity protocols and simplify claims/premium processing using e-payment channels. It will require the collaboration of the Ghana Ministry of Health, Banking Sector, Police Department, Customs Excise and Preventive Service, other relevant Ministries and the international community to bring the pandemic to a stop.\n",

      "Alcohol's impact on global health is substantial and of a similar order of magnitude to that from COVID‐19. Alcohol now also poses specific concerns, such as increased risk of severe lung infections, domestic violence, child abuse, depression and suicide. Its use is unlikely to aid physical distancing or other preventative behavioural measures. Globally, alcohol contributes to 20% of injury and 11.5% of non‐injury emergency room presentations. We provide some broad comparisons between alcohol‐attributable and COVID‐19‐related hospitalisations and deaths in North America using most recent data. For example, for Canada in 2017 it was recently estimated there were 105 065 alcohol‐attributable hospitalisations which represent a substantially higher rate over time than the 10 521 COVID‐19 hospitalisations reported during the first 5 months of the pandemic. Despite the current importance of protecting health‐care services, most governments have deemed alcohol sales to be as essential as food, fuel and pharmaceuticals. In many countries, alcohol is now more readily available and affordable than ever before, a situation global alcohol producers benefit from and have helped engineer. We argue that to protect frontline health‐care services and public health more generally, it is essential that modest, evidence‐based restrictions on alcohol prices, availability and marketing are introduced. In particular, we recommend increases in excise taxation coupled with minimum unit pricing to both reduce impacts on health‐care services and provide much‐needed revenues for governments at this critical time.\n",

The timing and content of the policy response as well as different possible explanations for what happened are considered. Undertaking a forensic analysis of policy in regard to the overall plan, monitoring and protection as well as funding and resources, the first part lays bare the slow, late and inadequate response to the risk and reality of COVID‐19 in care homes as against that in the National Health Service (NHS). A two‐pronged, multidimensional explanation is offered: structural, sectoral specificities; political and socio‐cultural factors. Amongst the relevant structural factors are the institutionalised separation from the health system, the complex system of provision and policy for adult social care, widespread market dependence. There is also the fact that logistical difficulties were exacerbated by years of austerity and resource cutting and a weak regulatory tradition of the care home sector. The effects of a series of political and cultural factors are also highlighted. As well as little mobilisation of the sector and low public commitment to and knowledge of social care, there is a pattern of Conservative government trying to divest the state of responsibilities in social care. This would support an interpretation in terms of policy avoidance as well as a possible political calculation by government that its policies towards the care sector and care homes would be less important and politically damaging than those for the NHS.\n",

      "The World Health Organization recognized SARS-CoV-2 as a public health concern and declared it as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Over 12 million people have been affected across several countries since it was first recognized. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to commonly spread via respiratory droplets formed while talking, coughing, and sneezing of an infected patient. As several cases, with an absence of travel history to the majorly affected areas were identified, a strong possibility of community transmission could have been possible. Broadly, two modes of transmission of COVID-19 exist—direct and indirect. The direct mode includes (1) transmission via aerosols formed via surgical and dental procedures and/or in the form of respiratory droplet nuclei; (2) other body fluids and secretions, for example, feces, saliva, urine, semen, and tears; and (3) mother-to-child. Indirect transmission may occur via (1) fomites or surfaces (e.g., furniture and fixtures) present within the immediate environment of an infected patient and (2) objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer). As many of these modes may be underestimated, it is necessary to emphasize and illustrate them. The goal of this paper is to briefly review how SARS-CoV-2 is shown to transmit via various modes and propose measures to reduce the risk of spread within the population and operating personnel.\n",

      "Während das durch das SARS-CoV-2-Virus ausgelöste COVID-19-Syndrom zunächst hauptsächlich als Lungenerkrankung angesehen wurde, ist die Zahl der Berichte über vaskuläre Komplikationen zuletzt angestiegen. Ziel der vorliegenden Übersichtsarbeit ist es, die relevantesten vaskulären Beteiligungen bei COVID-19 zusammenzufassen. Hierzu zählen venöse und arterielle thrombembolische Ereignisse sowie lokale Thrombosen, die sich im Rahmen der Zytokinausschüttung direkt am Endothel bilden können. Eine generalisierte Koagulopathie scheint ebenfalls den thrombogenen Zustand zu begünstigen. Mit einer Rate von etwa 20 % zählen tiefe Beinvenenthrombosen (TVT) bei intensivpflichtigen COVID-19-Patienten zu den häufigsten thrombembolischen Ereignissen. Zudem konnten auch bei vaskulär vorerkrankten Patienten arterielle Ereignisse wie Schlaganfälle oder akute Koronarsyndrome beobachtet werden. Kinder weisen selten vaskuläre Komplikationen auf. Hier wird von einer Systemreaktion berichtet, die dem Kawasaki-Syndrom und Toxic-shock-Syndrom ähnlich ist. Nach aktueller Datenlage ist das Risiko für thrombembolische Ereignisse bei stationären COVID-19-Patienten deutlich erhöht, sodass eine Thromboseprophylaxe mit niedermolekularem bzw. unfraktioniertem Heparin notwendig ist. Bei Kontraindikationen gegen eine medikamentöse Thromboseprophylaxe sollte die intermittierende pneumatische Kompression erfolgen. Zudem empfiehlt sich bei der stationären Aufnahme von Patienten mit SARS-CoV-2-Verdacht oder -Nachweis die Bestimmung der D‑Dimere und bei positivem Befund die großzügige Indikationsstellung zur Kompressionssonographie der tiefen Beinvenen. So können TVT frühzeitig erkannt und therapiert werden. Die Behandlung der Thrombosen erfolgt leitliniengerecht mittels therapeutischer Antikoagulation. Weitere Studien und Register sind notwendig, um den Zusammenhang zwischen einer COVID-19-Infektion und dem Auftreten von thrombembolischen Ereignissen besser zu verstehen.\n",

      "Besides advanced age and the presence of multiple comorbidities as major contributors to increased risk of severe disease and fatal outcome from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19), there is now emerging evidence that overweight and obesity predispose to severe symptoms and negative prognosis. Remarkably, the severity of COVID-19 appears to rise with increasing body mass index (BMI). The association between COVID-19 outcomes and overweight/obesity has biological and physiological plausibility. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms that may explain this strong association include the chronic pro-inflammatory state, the excessive oxidative stress response, and the impaired immunity that is commonly reported in these individuals. The role of cytokines, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and altered natural killer cell polarization in the dangerous liaison between COVID-19 and obesity are discussed here. These pathways can favor and accelerate the deleterious downstream cellular effects of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, obesity is well known to be associated with reduced lung function and poor response to mechanical ventilation, thus placing these individuals at high risk of severe illness and mortality from COVID-19. Furthermore, obesity may lead to other complications, such as renal failure, cardiovascular dysfunction, hypertension, and vascular damage, which in turn can further accelerate negative clinical outcomes from COVID-19. Obese individuals should be shielded against any potential viral exposure to SARS-CoV-2 with consequential considerations for compulsory protection devices and social distancing. Health care providers should be aware that obesity predisposes to severe symptoms and negative prognosis in COVID-19 patients.\n",

We argue that the 2019–2020 Coronavirus Pandemic has the potential to produce this outcome, as recent public opinion polls highlight widespread discontent with male-led governments’ responses to the pandemic and elevated concerns surrounding public health. Recent positive media reports of female world leaders’ responses to the pandemic provide further reason to suspect a forthcoming increase in political support for female candidates.

As with all past pandemics, the specific mechanism of its emergence in humans remains unknown. Nevertheless, a large body of virologic, epidemiologic, veterinary, and ecologic data establishes that the new virus, SARS-CoV-2, evolved directly or indirectly from a β-coronavirus in the sarbecovirus (SARS-like virus) group that naturally infect bats and pangolins in Asia and Southeast Asia. Scientists have warned for decades that such sarbecoviruses are poised to emerge again and again, identified risk factors, and argued for enhanced pandemic prevention and control efforts. Unfortunately, few such preventive actions were taken resulting in the latest coronavirus emergence detected in late 2019 which quickly spread pandemically. The risk of similar coronavirus outbreaks in the future remains high. In addition to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, we must undertake vigorous scientific, public health, and societal actions, including significantly increased funding for basic and applied research addressing disease emergence, to prevent this tragic history from repeating itself.\n",

      "The COVID-19 pandemic has forced numerous businesses such as department stores and supermarkets to limit the number of shoppers inside the store at any given time to minimize infection rates. We construct and analyze two models designed to optimize queue sizes and customer waiting times to ensure safety. In both models, customers arrive randomly at the store and, after receiving permission to enter, pass through two service phases: shopping and payment. Each customer spends a random period of time shopping (first phase) and then proceeds to the payment area of the store (second phase) where cashiers are assigned to serve customers. We propose a novel approach by which to calculate the risk of a customer being infected while queueing outside the store, while shopping, and while checking out with a cashier. The risk is proportional to the second factorial moment of the number of customers occupying the space in each phase of the shopping route. We derive equilibrium strategies for a Stackelberg game in which the authority acts as a leader who first chooses the maximum number of customers allowed inside the store to minimize the risk of infection. In the first model, store’ management chooses the number of cashiers to provide to minimize its operational costs and its customers’ implied waiting costs based on the number allowed in the store. In the second model, the store partitions its total space into two separate areas – one for shoppers and one for the cashiers and payers – to increase cashiers’ safety. Our findings and analysis are useful and applicable for authorities and businesses alike in their efforts to protect both customers and employees while reducing associated costs.\n",

      "COVID-19 management guidelines have largely attributed critically ill patients who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, to a systemic overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Cardiovascular dysfunction may also represent a primary phenomenon, with increasing data suggesting that severe COVID-19 reflects a confluence of vascular dysfunction, thrombosis and dysregulated inflammation. Here, we first consolidate the information on localized microvascular inflammation and disordered cytokine release, triggering vessel permeability and prothrombotic conditions that play a central role in perpetuating the pathogenic COVID-19 cascade. Secondly, we seek to clarify the gateways which SARS-CoV-2, the causative COVID-19 virus, uses to enter host vascular cells. Post-mortem examinations of patients' tissues have confirmed direct viral endothelial infection within several organs. While there have been advances in single-cell RNA sequencing, endothelial cells across various vascular beds express low or undetectable levels of those touted SARS-CoV-2 entry factors. Emerging studies postulate alternative pathways and the apicobasal distribution of host cell surface factors could influence endothelial SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication. Finally, we provide experimental considerations such as endothelial polarity, cellular heterogeneity in organoids and shear stress dynamics in designing cellular models to facilitate research on viral-induced endothelial dysfunctions.

      "HIV fatalism, or the belief that HIV acquisition and mortality is out of one's control, is thought to contribute to HIV risk in fishing populations in East Africa. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the association between fatalism and sexual risk behaviours (unprotected sex, engagement in transactional sex), beyond the influence of other known HIV risk factors (e.g. food insecurity, mobility), and identify demographic, psychosocial, and structural correlates of HIV fatalism. Ninety-one men and women living in fishing villages on two islands in Lake Victoria, Uganda completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire after testing HIV-positive during home or community-based HIV testing between May and July 2015. Multivariate logistic regression was used to test the association between HIV fatalism and transactional sex and multivariate linear regression was used to identify demographic, psychosocial, and structural correlates of HIV fatalism.

      "Two HIV virus types exist: HIV-1 is pandemic and aggressive, whereas HIV-2 is confined mainly to West Africa and less pathogenic. Despite the fact that it has been almost 40 years since the discovery of AIDS, there is still no cure or vaccine against HIV. Consequently, the concepts of functional vaccines and cures that aim to limit HIV disease progression and spread by persistent control of viral replication without life-long treatment have been suggested as more feasible options to control the HIV pandemic. To identify virus-host mechanisms that could be targeted for functional cure development, researchers have focused on a small fraction of HIV-1 infected individuals that control their infection spontaneously, so-called elite controllers. However, these efforts have not been able to unravel the key mechanisms of the infection control. This is partly due to lack in statistical power since only 0.15% of HIV-1 infected individuals are natural elite controllers. The proportion of long-term viral control is larger in HIV-2 infection compared with HIV-1 infection. We therefore present the idea of using HIV-2 as a model for finding a functional cure against HIV. Understanding the key differences between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections, and the cross-reactive effects in HIV-1/HIV-2 dual-infection could provide novel insights in developing functional HIV cures and vaccines.\n",

      "Thailand has the highest prevalence of HIV among countries in Asia but has also been a pioneer in HIV prevention and treatment efforts in the region, reducing the incidence of new infections significantly over the last two decades. Building upon this remarkable history, Thailand has set an ambitious goal to stop the AIDS epidemic in the country by 2030. A key component of the strategy to achieve this goal includes scale-up of HIV screening programs to facilitate early HIV diagnosis and investment in mechanisms to support immediate initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Initiation of ART during early or acute HIV infection not only reduces viremia, thereby halting onward transmission of HIV, but also may facilitate HIV remission by reducing the size of the latent HIV reservoir and preserving immune function. In Thailand, many efforts have been made to reduce the time from HIV infection to diagnosis and from diagnosis to treatment, especially among men who have sex with men and transgender women. Successfully identifying and initiating ART in individuals with acute HIV infection has been leveraged to conduct groundbreaking studies of novel strategies to achieve HIV remission, including studies of broadly-neutralizing HIV-specific monoclonal antibodies and candidate therapeutic vaccines. These efforts have mostly been deployed in Bangkok and future efforts should include other urban and more rural areas. Continued progress in HIV prevention, screening, and treatment will position Thailand to substantially limit new infections and may pave the way for an HIV cure.\n",

It is a progressive myelopathy that shares features with subacute combined degeneration seen in vitamin B12 deficiency as well as other neurological diseases and can occur synchronously with HIV-associated dementia (HAD). Here, we describe a rare case in which a patient's initial presentation of HIV/AIDS was both HIV-VM and HAD. A fifty-three-year-old man presented with a six-month history of numerous falls due to progressive gait instability with associated memory loss, tremor, urinary retention, and impotence. His exam was significant for hyperreflexia and weakness in bilateral lower extremities, upgoing plantar reflex, dysmetria, and ataxic gait. MRI-brain was notable for nonspecific volume loss and diffusely increased T2 signal throughout the supratentorial white matter.

      "HIV-related stigma has been associated with worse health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among people living with HIV (PLWH). Little is known about how different types of HIV-related stigma (i.e., anticipatory, internalized, or enacted HIV-related stigma) influence HRQoL and whether these relationships differ by gender. The sample included 912 PLWH aged 18 years or older enrolling in HIV care at four health facilities in Tanzania. HRQoL was assessed with the life satisfaction and overall function subscales of the HIV/AIDS-Targeted Quality of Life (HAT-QoL) instrument. Sex-stratified multivariable logistic regression modeled the association of anticipatory, internalized, and enacted HIV-related stigma on poor HRQoL. Across all participants, the mean life satisfaction score was 63.4 (IQR: 43.8, 81.3) and the mean overall function score was 72.0 (IQR: 58.3, 91.7). Mean HRQoL scores were significantly higher for women compared to men for overall function (5.1 points higher) and life satisfaction (4.3 points higher). Fourteen percent of respondents reported recent enacted HIV-related stigma and 13% reported recent medium or high levels of internalized stigma. In multivariable models, high internalized and high anticipatory stigma were significantly associated with higher odds of poor life satisfaction and poor overall function in both men and women. Psychosocial interventions to prevent or reduce the impact of internalized and anticipatory stigma may improve HRQoL among persons in HIV care. Future research should longitudinally examine mechanisms between HIV-related stigma, poor HRQoL, and HIV care outcomes.\n",

      "Recently, a second individual (the “London patient”) with HIV-1 infection and concomitant leukemia was cured of both diseases by a conditioning myeloablative regimen followed by transplantation of stem cells bearing the homozygous CCR5 Δ32 mutation. The substantial risks and cost associated with this procedure render it unfeasible on a large scale. This strategy also indicates that a common pathway toward a cure for both HIV and cancer may exist. Successful approaches to curing both diseases should ideally possess three components, i.e., (1) direct targeting of pathological cells (neoplastic cells in cancer and the HIV-infected reservoir cells), (2) subsequent impediment to reconstitution of the pool of pathological cells and (3) sustained, immunologic control of the disease (both diseases are characterized by detrimental immune hyper-activation that hinders successful establishment of immunity). In this review, we explore medications that are either investigational or FDA-approved anticancer treatments that may be employed to achieve the goal of curing HIV-1. These include: thioredoxin reductase inhibitors (phases 1–3), immune checkpoint inhibitors (phases 1, 3), Jak inhibitors (FDA approved for arthritis and multiple cancer indications, summarized in Table 1).

As HLA molecules are highly polymorphic at the population level, horizontal transmission events are most commonly between HLA-mismatched donor/recipient pairs, representing new immune selection environments for the transmitted virus. In this study, we utilised a deep sequencing approach to determine the HIV quasispecies in 26 mother-to-child transmission pairs where the potential for founder viruses to be pre-adapted is high due to the pairs being haplo-identical at HLA loci. This scenario allowed the assessment of specific HIV adaptations following transmission in either a non-selective immune environment, due to recipient HLA mismatched to original selecting HLA, or a selective immune environment, mediated by matched donor/recipient HLA.

We observed that both levels of IgG antibodies to gp41 at baseline and post-vaccination levels of IgG antibodies to the Con.6.gp120.B, ZM96.gp140 and gp70 B.CaseA V1-V2 antigens were associated with three co-occurring clusters of family level microbial taxa. One cluster contained several families positively associated with gp41-specific IgG and negatively associated with vaccine-matched gp120, gp140 and V1-V2-specific IgG responses. A second cluster contained families that negatively associated with gp41 and positively associated with gp120, gp140 and V1-V2-specific IgG responses. A third cluster contained microbial groups that did not correlate with any immune responses. Baseline and post-vaccination levels of gp41 IgG were not significantly correlated, suggesting that factors beyond the microbiome that contribute to immune response heterogeneity. Sequence variant richness was positively associated with gp41, p24, pg140 and V1-V2 specific IgG responses, gp41 and p24 IgA responses, and CD4+ T cell responses to HIV-1 proteins.

      "No effective therapy to eliminate the HIV latently infected cell reservoir has been developed. One approach, “shock and kill”, employs agents that activate HIV, subsequently killing the activated infected cells and/or virus. Shock and kill requires agents that safely and effectively activate HIV. One class of activation agents works through classical NF-κB pathways, but global NF-κB activators are non-specific and toxic. There exist two major IκBs: IκBα, and IκBε, which hold activating NF-κB subunits in the cytoplasm, releasing them for nuclear transit upon cell stimulation. IκBα was considered the main IκB responsible for gene expression regulation, including HIV activation. IκBε is expressed in cells constituting much of the latent HIV reservoir, and IκBε knockout mice have a minimal phenotype, suggesting that IκBε could be a valuable target for HIV activation and reservoir depletion. We previously showed that targeting IκBε yields substantial increases in HIV expression. Here, we show that IκBε holds c-Rel and p65 activating NF-κB subunits in the cytoplasm, and that targeting IκBε with siRNA produces a strong increase in HIV expression associated with enhanced c-Rel and p65 transit to the nucleus and binding to the HIV LTR of the activating NF-κBs, demonstrating a mechanism through which targeting IκBε increases HIV expression. The findings suggest that it may be helpful to develop HIV activation approaches, acting specifically to target IκBε and its interactions with the NF-κBs.\n",

      "Molecular basis of HIV-1 life cycle regulation has thus far focused on viral gene stage-specificity, despite the quintessence of post-function protein elimination processes in the virus life cycle and consequent pathogenesis. Our studies demonstrated that a key pathogenic HIV-1 viral protein, Nef, interacted with ubiquitin (Ub)-protein ligase E3A (UBE3A/E6AP), suggesting that interaction between Nef and UBE3A is integral to regulation of viral and cellular protein decay and thereby the competing HIV-1 and host cell survivals. In fact, Nef and UBE3A degraded reciprocally, and UBE3A-mediated degradation of Nef was significantly more potent than Nef-triggered degradation of UBE3A. Further, UBE3A degraded not only Nef but also HIV-1 structural proteins, Gag, thus significantly inhibiting HIV-1 replication in Jurkat T cells only in the presence of Nef, indicating that interaction between Nef and UBE3Awas pivotal for UBE3A-mediated degradation of the viral proteins. Mechanistic study showed that Nef and UBE3A were specific and antagonistic to each other in regulating proteasome activity and ubiquitination of cellular proteins in general, wherein specific domains of Nef overlapping with the long terminal repeat (LTR) were essential for the observed actions. Further, Nef itself reduced the level of intracellular Gag by degrading a cardinal transcription regulator, Tat, demonstrating a broad role for Nef in the regulation of the HIV-1 life cycle. Taken together, these data demonstrated that the Nef and UBE3A complex plays a crucial role in coordinating viral protein degradation and hence HIV-1 replication, providing insights as to the nature of pathobiologic and defense strategies of HIV-1 and HIV-infected host cells. \n",

      "Cells that are latently infected with HIV-1 preclude an HIV-1 cure, as antiretroviral therapy does not target this latent population. HIV-1 is highly genetically diverse, with over 10 subtypes and numerous recombinant forms circulating worldwide. In spite of this vast diversity, much of our understanding of latency and latency reversal is largely based on subtype B viruses. As such, most of the development of cure strategies targeting HIV-1 are solely based on subtype B. It is currently assumed that subtype does not influence the establishment or reactivation of latent viruses. However, this has not been conclusively proven one way or the other.

      "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) capsid plays important roles at multiple stages of viral replication. At the initial stages, controlled uncoating (disassembly) of the capsid ensures efficient reverse transcription of the single-stranded RNA genome, into the double-stranded DNA. Whereas at later stages, a proper assembly of capsid ensures the formation of a mature infectious virus particle. Hence, the inhibition of capsid assembly and/or disassembly has been recognized as a potential therapeutic strategy, and several capsid inhibitors have been reported. Of these, PF-3450074 (PF74) has been extensively studied. Recently reported GS-CA inhibitors (GS-CA1 and GS-6207), have shown a strong potential and appear to contain a PF74 scaffold. The location of resistance mutations and the results of structural studies further suggest that GS-CA compounds and PF74 share the same binding pocket, which is located between capsid monomers. Additionally, phenylalanine derivatives containing the PF74 scaffold show slightly enhanced capsid inhibiting activity. A comparison of capsid structures in complex with host factors and PF74, reveals the presence of common chemical entities at topologically equivalent positions. Here we present the status of capsid inhibitors that contain PF74 scaffolds and propose that the PF74 scaffold may be used to develop strong and safe capsid inhibitors.\n",

      "The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) accessory protein Nef plays a major role in establishing and maintaining infection, particularly through immune evasion. Many HIV-2-infected people experience long-term viral control and survival, resembling HIV-1 elite control. HIV-2 Nef has overlapping but also distinct functions from HIV-1 Nef. Here we report the crystal structure of HIV-2 Nef core. The di-leucine sorting motif forms a helix bound to neighboring molecules, and moreover, isothermal titration calorimetry demonstrated that the CD3 endocytosis motif can directly bind to HIV-2 Nef, ensuring AP-2-mediated endocytosis for CD3. The highly conserved C-terminal region forms a α-helix, absent from HIV-1. We further determined the structure of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Nef harboring this region, demonstrating similar C-terminal α-helix, which may contribute to AP-1 binding for MHC-I downregulation. These results provide insights into the distinct pathogenesis of HIV-2 infection.\n",

      "Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB), including multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), is considered a potential obstacle for elimination of TB globally. HIV coinfection with M/XDR-TB further complicates the scenario, and is a potential threat with challenging management. Reports have shown poor outcomes and alarmingly high mortality rates among people living with HIV (PLHIV) coinfected with M/XDR-TB. This coinfection is also responsible for all forms of M/XDR-TB epidemics or outbreaks. Better outcomes with reductions in mortality have been reported with concomitant treatment containing antiretroviral drugs for the HIV component and antitubercular drugs for the DR-TB component. Early and rapid diagnosis with genotypic tests, prompt treatment with appropriate regimens based on drug-susceptibility testing, preference for shorter regimens fortified with newer drugs, a patient-centric approach, and strong infection-control measures are all essential components in the management of M/XDR-TB in people living with HIV.\n",

The HBV co-infection prevalence rate was the highest (8.8%) in patients born between 1960 and 1964 and the lowest (0%) among those born between 1995 and 1999. A decreasing linear trend of HBV co-infection rate was observed according to the 5-year interval changes. HBsAb-positive rate was only 58.1% in our study. The national HBV vaccination programs have effectively lowered the HBV co-infection rate in HIV population. However, it is identified that the HIV population has low HBsAb positive rate. Further evidences supporting efficacy of booster immunization for HBsAb negative HIV patients are required and efforts should be made to increase HBsAb positive rates among HIV patients to prevent horizontal transmission.\n",

      "Estimating HIV incidence is crucial for monitoring the epidemiology of this infection, planning screening and intervention campaigns, and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures. However, owing to the long and variable period from HIV infection to the development of AIDS and the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, accurate incidence estimation remains a major challenge. Numerous estimation methods have been proposed in epidemiological modeling studies, and here we review commonly-used methods for estimation of HIV incidence. We review the essential data required for estimation along with the advantages and disadvantages, mathematical structures and likelihood derivations of these methods. The methods include the classical back-calculation method, the method based on CD4+ T-cell depletion, the use of HIV case reporting data, the use of cohort study data, the use of serial or cross-sectional prevalence data, and biomarker approach. By outlining the mechanistic features of each method, we provide guidance for planning incidence estimation efforts, which may depend on national or regional factors as well as the availability of epidemiological or laboratory datasets.\n",

      "The T‐cell response is central in the adaptive immune‐mediated elimination of pathogen‐infected and/or cancer cells. This activated T‐cell response can inflict an overwhelming degree of damage to the targeted cells, which in most instances leads to the control and elimination of foreign invaders. However, in conditions of chronic infection, persistent exposure of T cells to high levels of antigen results in a severe T‐cell dysfunctional state called exhaustion.

This study aimed to explore factors that contribute to stigma and discrimination against HIV-positive men married to women in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted to collect data from participants using a snowball sampling technique. A framework analysis was used to guide the analysis of the data. HIV stigma framework was also applied in the conceptualisation and the discussion of the findings. The findings indicate that participants experienced external stigma within healthcare facilities, communities and families. This external stigma was expressed in various discriminatory attitudes and behaviours by healthcare professionals and community and family members. Similarly, participants experienced anticipated stigma as a result of HIV stigma and discrimination experienced by other people living with HIV. Individual moral judgement associating HIV status with amoral behaviours and participants’ negative self-judgement were determinants of perceived stigma. The current findings indicate the need for training programs about HIV stigma issues for healthcare professionals.

      "Innate immunity represents the human immune system’s first line of defense against a pathogenic intruder and is initiated by the recognition of conserved molecular structures known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by specialized cellular sensors, called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a unique human RNA virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in infected individuals. During the replication cycle, HIV-1 undergoes reverse transcription of its RNA genome and integrates the resulting DNA into the human genome. Subsequently, transcription of the integrated provirus results in production of new virions and spreading infection of the virus. Throughout the viral replication cycle, numerous nucleic acid derived PAMPs can be recognized by a diverse set of innate immune sensors in infected cells. However, HIV-1 has evolved efficient strategies to evade or counteract this immune surveillance and the downstream responses. Understanding the molecular underpinnings of the concerted actions of the innate immune system, as well as the corresponding viral evasion mechanisms during infection, is critical to understanding HIV-1 transmission and pathogenesis, and may provide important guidance for the design of appropriate adjuvant and vaccine strategies. Here, we summarize current knowledge of the molecular basis for sensing HIV-1 in human cells, including CD4\n",

We identified a HIV-1-seropositive woman who spontaneously suppressed HIV replication and had normal CD4-cell counts, no HIV-disease, no replication-competent virus and no cell HIV DNA detected with a routine assay. We suspected that dramatic HIV DNA degradation occurred post-infection. We performed multiple nested-PCRs followed by Sanger sequencing and applied a multiplex-PCR approach. Furthermore, we implemented a new technique based on two hybridization steps on beads prior to next-generation sequencing that removed human DNA then retrieved integrated HIV sequences with HIV-specific probes. We assembled ≈45% of the HIV genome and further analyzed the G-to-A mutations putatively generated by cellular APOBEC3 enzymes that can change tryptophan codons into stop codons. We found more G-to-A mutations in the HIV DNA from the woman than in that of her transmitting partner. Moreover, 74% of the tryptophan codons were changed to stop codons (25%) or were deleted as a possible consequence of gene inactivation. Finally, we found that this woman’s cells remained HIV-susceptible \n",

      "Dendritic cells (DCs) are involved in human and simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV and SIV) pathogenesis but also play a critical role in orchestrating innate and adaptive vaccine-specific immune responses. Effective HIV/SIV vaccines require strong antigen-specific CD4 T cell responses, cytotoxic activity of CD8 T cells, and neutralizing/non-neutralizing antibody production at mucosal and systemic sites. To develop a protective HIV/SIV vaccine, vaccine regimens including DCs themselves, protein, DNA, mRNA, virus vectors, and various combinations have been evaluated in different animal and human models. Recent studies have shown that DCs enhanced prophylactic HIV/SIV vaccine efficacy by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines, improving T cell responses, and recruiting effector cells to target tissues. DCs are also targets for therapeutic HIV/SIV vaccines due to their ability to reverse latency, present antigen, and augment T and B cell immunity. Here, we review the complex interactions of DCs over the course of HIV/SIV prophylactic and therapeutic immunizations, providing new insights into development of advanced DC-targeted HIV/SIV vaccines.\n",

      "Today HIV infection cannot be cured due to the presence of a reservoir of latently infected cells inducing a viral rebound upon treatment interruption. Hence, the latent reservoir is considered as the major barrier for an HIV cure. So far, efforts to completely eradicate the reservoir via a shock-and-kill approach have proven difficult and unsuccessful. Therefore, more research has been done recently on an alternative block-and-lock functional cure strategy. In contrast to the shock-and-kill strategy that aims to eradicate the entire reservoir, block-and-lock aims to permanently silence all proviruses, even after treatment interruption. HIV silencing can be achieved by targeting different factors of the transcription machinery. In this review, we first describe the underlying mechanisms of HIV transcription and silencing. Next, we give an overview of the different block-and-lock strategies under investigation.\n",

However, the small-scale geography of migration networks and movement of HIV-positive individuals between communities is poorly understood. Here, we use population-based data from ~22,000 persons of known HIV status to characterize migratory patterns and their relationship to HIV among 38 communities in Rakai, Uganda with HIV prevalence ranging from 9 to 43%. We find that migrants moving into hotspots had significantly higher HIV prevalence than migrants moving elsewhere, but out-migration from hotspots was geographically dispersed, contributing minimally to HIV burden in destination locations. Our results challenge the assumption that high prevalence hotspots are drivers of transmission in regional epidemics, instead suggesting that migrants with high HIV prevalence, particularly women, selectively migrate to these areas.\n",

      "The proportion of new diagnoses of HIV infection in immigrants residing in Italy raised from 11% in 1992 to 29.7% in 2018. To investigate the HIV clades circulating in this community a retrospective study was performed in 557 HIV-infected immigrants living in 12 Italian cities. Immigrants originated from East-Europe and Central-Asia (11.7%), North Africa and Middle East (7.3%), South and South-East Asia (7.2%), Latin America and the Caribbean (14.4%), and sub-Saharan Africa (59.4%). More than 87% of immigrants were on antiretroviral therapy (ART), although 26.6% of them were viremic. A 22.0% of immigrants had hepatitis (HBV and/or HCV) and/or tuberculosis. HIV phylogenetic analysis on sequences from 192 immigrants showed the presence of clades B (23.4%), G (16.1%), C (10.4%), A1 (9.4%), F1 (5.2%), D (1.6%) and Circulating Recombinant Forms (CRFs) (33.9%). CRF02_AG represented 72.3% of the total CRFs. Clusters between immigrants and Italian natives were also present. Drug resistance mutations to NRTI, NNRTI, and PI drug classes occurred in 29.1% of ART-treated and in 12.9% of ART-naïve individuals. These data highlight the need for tailored public health interventions in immigrants to avoid spreading in Italy of HIV genetic forms and ART-resistant variants, as well as HIV co-morbidities.\n",

      "Despite reductions in mortality from the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the presence of latent or transcriptionally silent proviruses prevents HIV cure/eradication. We have previously reported that DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) facilitates HIV transcription by interacting with the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) complex recruited at HIV LTR. In this study, using different cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HIV-infected patients, we found that DNA-PK stimulates HIV transcription at several stages, including initiation, pause-release and elongation. We are reporting for the first time that DNA-PK increases phosphorylation of RNAP II C-terminal domain (CTD) at serine 5 (Ser5) and serine 2 (Ser2) by directly catalyzing phosphorylation and by augmenting the recruitment of the positive transcription elongation factor (P-TEFb) at HIV LTR. Our findings suggest that DNA-PK expedites the establishment of euchromatin structure at HIV LTR. DNA-PK inhibition/knockdown leads to the severe impairment of HIV replication and reactivation of latent HIV provirus. DNA-PK promotes the recruitment of Tripartite motif-containing 28 (TRIM28) at LTR and assists the release of paused RNAP II through TRIM28 phosphorylation. These results provide the mechanisms through which DNA-PK controls the HIV gene expression and, likely, can be extended to cellular gene expression, including during cell malignancy, where the role of DNA-PK has been well-established.\n",

      "Late diagnosis of HIV is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Infected individuals need to be identified early and started on antiretroviral therapy to increase their survival and to limit transmission to the community. Historically speaking, late diagnosis has been a common occurrence in the United States, despite the majority of those patients having had a medical encounter in the year prior to their diagnosis. These visits represent missed opportunities for HIV testing and therefore delays in initiation of appropriate antiretroviral therapy. Herpes zoster is a common infection that may indicate a weakened immune system, and as such should prompt consideration for HIV testing, even in patients who lack or deny classic risk factors such as “risky sexual behavior” or drug use. Here, we present a case of severe herpes zoster in a middle aged woman with no other HIV risk factors, who was tested and found to be HIV positive. Her CD4 count at diagnosis was <200 cells/mcL, consistent with AIDS.\n",

      "The interaction between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) has been of great interest. However, it remains unclear whether HSPCs can act as viral reservoirs. Many studies have reported the presence of latently infected HSPCs in the bone marrow of HIV-infected patients, whereas many other investigators have reported negative results. Hence, further evidence is required to elucidate this controversy. The other arm of HSPC investigations of HIV infection involves dynamics analysis in the early and late stages of infection to understand the impact on the pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Several recent studies have suggested reduced amounts and/or functional impairment of multipotent, myeloid, and lymphoid progenitors in HIV infection that may contribute to hematological manifestations, including anemia, pancytopenia, and T-cell depletion. In addition, ongoing and future studies on the senescence of HSPCs are expected to further the understanding of HIV pathogenesis. This mini review summarizes reports describing the basic aspects of hematopoiesis in response to HIV infection and offers insights into the association of HIV infection/exposure of the host HSPCs and hematopoietic potential.\n",

      "HIV Tat protein is a critical protein that plays multiple roles in HIV pathogenesis. While its role as the transactivator of HIV transcription is well-established, other non-viral replication-associated functions have been described in several HIV-comorbidities even in the current antiretroviral therapy (ART) era. HIV Tat protein is produced and released into the extracellular space from cells with active HIV replication or from latently HIV-infected cells into neighboring uninfected cells even in the absence of active HIV replication and viral production due to effective ART. Neighboring uninfected and HIV-infected cells can take up the released Tat resulting in the upregulation of inflammatory genes and activation of pathways that leads to cytotoxicity observed in several comorbidities such as HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), HIV associated cardiovascular impairment, and accelerated aging. Thus, understanding how Tat modulates host and viral response is important in designing novel therapeutic approaches to target the chronic inflammatory effects of soluble viral proteins in HIV infection.\n",

      "Most people living with HIV (PLHIV) with reliable access to antiretroviral treatment (ART) have a life expectancy similar to uninfected populations. Despite this, HIV can negatively affect their social and psychological wellbeing. This study aimed to enhance understanding of the expectations PLHIV hold for HIV cure research and the implications this has for HIV cure research trials. We interviewed 20 Australian PLHIV about their expectations for HIV cure research outcomes and the impact a potential cure for HIV may have on their everyday lives. Data were analysed thematically, using both inductive and deductive approaches. The significance of a cure for HIV was expressed by participants as something that would offer relief from their sense of vigilance or uncertainty about their health into the future. A cure was also defined in social terms, as alleviation from worry about potential for onward HIV transmission, concerns for friends and family, and the negative impact of HIV-related stigma. Participants did not consider sustained medication-free viral suppression (or remission) as a cure for HIV because this did not offer certainty in remaining virus free in a way that would alleviate these fears and concerns. A cure was seen as complete elimination of HIV from the body. There is an ethical need to consider the expectations of PLHIV in design of, and recruitment for, HIV cure-related research. The language used to describe HIV cure research should differentiate the long-term aspiration of achieving complete elimination of HIV from the body and possible shorter-term therapeutic advances, such as achieving medication free viral suppression.\n",

We aimed to examine factors associated with HIV testing and high-risk behaviors among HIV-negative MSM. From July 2016 to June 2017, participants were recruited by snowball sampling from WeChat groups, bars, and other venues. HIV testing was performed to exclude HIV-positive MSM. Face-to-face questionnaires regarding HIV testing and high-risk behaviors were conducted; 988 MSM were included, and 57.1% of participants underwent HIV testing in the past year. The proportion of high-risk behaviors was 49.9%. Factors associated with HIV testing were bisexual orientation, substance use to adjust psychiatric disorders, and receiving acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) interventions. Being married, bisexual orientation, and receiving AIDS interventions were risk factors for high-risk sexual behaviors, while college or higher degree was a protective factor. We determined that HIV transmission factors are widespread, and the rate of HIV testing is relatively low.

      "HIV-1 capsid core disassembly (uncoating) must occur before integration of viral genomic DNA into the host chromosomes, yet remarkably, the timing and cellular location of uncoating is unknown. Previous studies have proposed that intact viral cores are too large to fit through nuclear pores and uncoating occurs in the cytoplasm in coordination with reverse transcription or at the nuclear envelope during nuclear import. The capsid protein (CA) content of the infectious viral cores is not well defined because methods for directly labeling and quantifying the CA in viral cores have been unavailable. In addition, it has been difficult to identify the infectious virions because only one of ∼50 virions in infected cells leads to productive infection. Here, we developed methods to analyze HIV-1 uncoating by direct labeling of CA with GFP and to identify infectious virions by tracking viral cores in living infected cells through viral DNA integration and proviral DNA transcription. Astonishingly, our results show that intact (or nearly intact) viral cores enter the nucleus through a mechanism involving interactions with host protein cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 6 (CPSF6), complete reverse transcription in the nucleus before uncoating, and uncoat <1.5 h before integration near (<1.5 μm) their genomic integration sites. These results fundamentally change our current understanding of HIV-1 postentry replication events including mechanisms of nuclear import, uncoating, reverse transcription, integration, and evasion of innate immunity.\n",

      "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a chronic infection that destroys the immune system in infected individuals. Although antiretroviral therapy is effective at preventing infection of new cells, it is not curative. The inability to clear infection is due to the presence of a rare, but long-lasting latent cellular reservoir. These cells harboring silent integrated proviral genomes have the potential to become activated at any moment, making therapy necessary for life. Latently-infected cells can also proliferate and expand the viral reservoir through several methods including homeostatic proliferation and differentiation. The chromosomal location of HIV proviruses within cells influences the survival and proliferative potential of host cells. Proliferating, latently-infected cells can harbor proviruses that are both replication-competent and defective. Replication-competent proviral genomes contribute to viral rebound in an infected individual. The majority of available techniques can only assess the integration site or the proviral genome, but not both, preventing reliable evaluation of HIV reservoirs.\n",

      "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals treated with anti-retroviral therapy often develop chronic non-infectious lung disease. To determine the mechanism of HIV-1-associated lung disease we evaluated the dynamics of lung leukocytes in HIV-1 transgenic (Tg) mice with integrated HIV-1 provirus. In HIV-Tg mice, lipopolysacharide (LPS) induced significantly higher levels of neutrophil infiltration in the lungs compared to wild-type (WT) mice. In WT mice, the initial neutrophil infiltration was followed by macrophage infiltration and fast resolution of leukocytes infiltration. In HIV-Tg mice, resolution of lung infiltration by both neutrophils and macrophages was significantly delayed, with macrophages accumulating in the lumen of lung capillaries resulting in a 45% higher rate of mortality. Trans-endothelial migration of HIV-Tg macrophages was significantly reduced in vitro and this reduction correlated with lower HIV-1 gene expression. HIV-1 transcription inhibitor, 1E7-03, enhanced trans-endothelial migration of HIV-Tg macrophages in vitro, decreased lung neutrophil infiltration in vivo, and increased lung macrophage levels in HIV-Tg mice. Moreover, 1E7-03 reduced levels of inflammatory IL-6 cytokine, improved bleeding score and decreased lung injury. Together this indicates that inhibitors of HIV-1 transcription can correct abnormal dynamics of leukocyte infiltration in HIV-Tg, pointing to the utility of transcription inhibition in the treatment of HIV-1 associated chronic lung disease.\n",

      "The widespread use of combination antiretroviral therapies (cART) has converted the prognosis of HIV infection from a rapidly progressive and ultimately fatal disease to a chronic condition with limited impact on life expectancy. Yet, HIV-infected patients remain at high risk for critical illness due to the occurrence of severe opportunistic infections in those with advanced immunosuppression (i.e., inaugural admissions or limited access to cART), a pronounced susceptibility to bacterial sepsis and tuberculosis at every stage of HIV infection, and a rising prevalence of underlying comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, atherosclerosis or non-AIDS-defining neoplasms in cART-treated patients aging with controlled viral replication. Several patterns of intensive care have markedly evolved in this patient population over the late cART era, including a steady decline in AIDS-related admissions, an opposite trend in admissions for exacerbated comorbidities, the emergence of additional drivers of immunosuppression (e.g., anti-neoplastic chemotherapy or solid organ transplantation), the management of cART in the acute phase of critical illness, and a dramatic progress in short-term survival that mainly results from general advances in intensive care practices. Besides, there is a lack of data regarding other features of ICU and post-ICU care in these patients, especially on the impact of sociological factors on clinical presentation and prognosis, the optimal timing of cART introduction in AIDS-related admissions, determinants of end-of-life decisions, long-term survival, and functional outcomes.

      "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) affects over 36 million people worldwide. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is expanding and improving HIV viral suppression, resulting in increasing exposure to drugs and drug interactions. Polypharmacy is a common complication as people are living longer on ART, increasing the risk of drug toxicities. Polypharmacy is related not only to ART exposure and medication for opportunistic infections, but also to treatment of chronic lifestyle diseases. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is frequent in HIV and is commonly the result of sepsis, dehydration and drug toxicities. Furthermore, HIV itself increases the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Drug treatment is often complicated in people living with HIV because of a greater incidence of AKI and/or CKD compared to the HIV-negative population. Impaired renal function affects drug interactions, drug toxicities and importantly drug dosing, requiring dose adjustment. This review discusses ART and its nephrotoxic effects, including drug–drug interactions. It aims to guide the clinician on dose adjustment in the setting of renal impairment and dialysis, for the commonly used drugs in patients with HIV.\n",

      "In a context of high rates of HIV prevalence, concerns over hormonal contraceptive use and the potential for increased risk of HIV acquisition have led to increased attention to counseling messages, particularly for users of the injectable. However, the consequence of adding additional HIV risk messages to family planning counseling sessions was not well understood. This evaluation assessed the effect of providing revised injectable and HIV risk counseling messages on contraceptive knowledge and behavior during a three month pilot intervention. The pilot intervention was conducted September-November 2018 with all eligible family planning clients in ten healthcare facilities located in the Iringa and Njombe regions of Tanzania. Data collection for the evaluation occurred November-December 2018 and included 471 client exit interviews, 26 healthcare provider interviews, and the extraction of service statistics for 12 months prior to the intervention and three months of the intervention. Univariate and bivariate analyses were used to assess quantitative interview data. Thematic qualitative assessment was used to assess qualitative interview data from healthcare providers. Interrupted time series analysis was used to assess changes in the trend of contraceptive uptake. Results indicate that the counseling messages did not cause a decrease in the uptake of injectables (Depo-Provera): 97 percent of interviewed clients received Depo-Provera at their visit; sixty percent reported an intention to use condoms for dual protection. The analysis of service statistics showed no statistical difference in the trend of Depo-Provera uptake between the pre-intervention and intervention periods (p = 0.116). Overall knowledge of counseling messages by clients was good; however only 64.8% of women correctly responded that women at risk of getting HIV can use any method of family planning. Providers’ knowledge of the messages was high, though it appears that not all messages were consistently provided during the counseling sessions. The findings from this evaluation provide evidence that complex HIV counseling messages can be implemented in family planning programs in Tanzania, and potentially in other countries that are considering how to better integrate HIV risk messages into family planning counseling.\n",

      "Significant advances in the treatment of HIV infection have been made in the last three decades. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is now potent enough to prevent virus replication and stop disease progression. However, ART alone does not cure the infection, primarily because HIV can persist in stable long-term reservoir cells including latently-infected CD4 + T cells. A central goal of the HIV research field is to devise strategies to eliminate these reservoirs and thereby develop a cure for HIV. This requires robust in vivo model systems to facilitate both the further characterization of persistent HIV reservoirs and evaluation of methods for eliminating latent virus. Humanized mice have proven to be versatile experimental models for studying many basic aspects of HIV biology. These models consist of immunodeficient mice transplanted with human cells or tissues, which allows development of a human immune system that supports robust infection with HIV. There are many potential applications for new generations of humanized mouse models in investigating HIV reservoirs and latency, but these models also involve caveats that are important to consider in experimental design and interpretation. This review briefly discusses some of the key strengths and limitations of humanized mouse models in HIV persistence studies.\n",

      "In the context of HIV-related stigma and discrimination, people living with HIV (PLHIV) might be vulnerable to a ‘syndemic’ of co-occurring psychosocial challenges that can affect sexual behavior. The present study examined how HIV-related discrimination contributes to co-occurring psychosocial syndemic problems and results in inconsistent condom use among PLHIV in Hong Kong. Two-hundred and ninety-one PLHIV were recruited to complete a self-report questionnaire. More than one-quarter of the sample experienced two or more psychosocial syndemic problems, and 74.1% of the participants who had sex with steady partners reported inconsistent condom use over the past three months. The results indicated that HIV-related discrimination was positively predictive of the number of psychosocial syndemic problems. HIV-related discrimination and psychosocial syndemics were associated with increased odds of inconsistent condom use with steady partners (AOR = 5.40 and AOR = 3.09 respectively). Findings from structural equation modeling showed that psychosocial syndemics mediated the effect of HIV-related discrimination on condom use consistency with steady partners. PLHIV in Hong Kong suffered from the syndemic effects of stigma, social isolation, and poor mental health, which rendered them vulnerable to condomless sex. In order to curb the rapidly increasing incidence of HIV, multi-level strategies should be adopted to concurrently address the structural inequities and psychosocial syndemics faced by PLHIV.\n",

Our goal was to address the current literacy related to HIV, including biomedical prevention methods and barriers to care, such as cultural factors, from a sample of college students. Methods: We conducted a convergent parallel mixed methods analysis where both qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analyzed separately. A thematic analysis was conducted to assess qualitative results, while descriptive statistics were conducted to assess quantitative survey results. Results: HIV literacy was limited, with several participants reporting that they did not understand what HIV meant. While the majority knew the use of condoms, knowledge of other biomedical prevention methods was limited, as was the understanding the risk factors of HIV, with participants noting sharing a toilet seat and promiscuity as risk factors. Self-efficacy for HIV prevention was low among participants with many reporting that cultural barriers prevented discussion of risky behaviors and prevention methods in their families and social groups. Conclusion: Targeted, culturally sensitive, health education initiatives are needed to understand the high, low, or no risks of HIV as well as address stigmas related to HIV.\n",

      "HIV-1 eradication strategies aim to achieve viral remission in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The development of an HIV-1 cure remains challenging due to the latent reservoir (LR): long-lived CD4 T cells that harbor transcriptionally silent HIV-1 provirus. The LR is stable despite years of suppressive ART and is the source of rebound viremia following therapy interruption. Cure strategies such as “shock and kill” aim to eliminate or reduce the LR by reversing latency, exposing the infected cells to clearance via the immune response or the viral cytopathic effect. Alternative strategies include therapeutic vaccination, which aims to prime the immune response to facilitate control of the virus in the absence of ART. Despite promising advances, these strategies have been unable to significantly reduce the LR or increase the time to viral rebound but have provided invaluable insight in the field of HIV-1 eradication. The development and assessment of an HIV-1 cure requires robust assays that can measure the LR with sufficient sensitivity to detect changes that may occur following treatment. The viral outgrowth assay (VOA) is considered the gold standard method for LR quantification due to its ability to distinguish intact and defective provirus. However, the VOA is time consuming and resource intensive, therefore several alternative assays have been developed to bridge the gap between practicality and accuracy. Whilst a cure for HIV-1 infection remains elusive, recent advances in our understanding of the LR and methods for its eradication have offered renewed hope regarding achieving ART free viral remission.\n",

      "Consistent medical care among people living with HIV is essential for both individual and public health. HIV-positive individuals who are ‘retained in care’ are more likely to be prescribed antiretroviral medication and achieve HIV viral suppression, effectively eliminating the risk of transmitting HIV to others. However, in the United States, less than half of HIV-positive individuals are retained in care. Interventions to improve retention in care are resource intensive, and there is currently no systematic way to identify patients at risk for falling out of care who would benefit from these interventions. We developed a machine learning model to identify patients at risk for dropping out of care in an urban HIV care clinic using electronic medical records and geospatial data. The machine learning model has a mean positive predictive value of 34.6% [SD: 0.15] for flagging the top 10% highest risk patients as needing interventions, performing better than the previous state-of-the-art logistic regression model (PPV of 17% [SD: 0.06]) and the baseline rate of 11.1% [SD: 0.02].

      "HIV testing services are an important component of HIV program and provide an entry point for clinical care for persons newly diagnosed with HIV. Although uptake of HIV testing has increased in Kenya, men are still less likely than women to get tested and access services. There is, however, limited understanding of the context, barriers and facilitators of HIV testing among men in the country. Data are from in-depth interviews with 30 men living with HIV and 8 HIV testing counsellors that were conducted to gain insights on motivations and drivers for HIV testing among men in the city of Nairobi. Men were identified retroactively by examining clinical CD4 registers on early and late diagnosis (e.g. CD4 of ≥500 cells/mm, early diagnosis and <500 cells/mm, late diagnosis). Analysis involved identifying broad themes and generating descriptive codes and categories. Timing for early testing is linked with strong social support systems and agency to test, while cost of testing, choice of facility to test and weak social support systems (especially poor inter-partner relations) resulted in late testing. Minimal discussions occurred prior to testing and whenever there was dialogue it happened with partners or other close relatives. Interrelated barriers at individual, health-care system, and interpersonal levels hindered access to testing services. Specifically, barriers to testing included perceived providers attitudes, facility location and set up, wait time/inconvenient clinic times, low perception of risk, limited HIV knowled ge, stigma, discrimination and fear of having a test. High risk perception, severe illness, awareness of partner’s status, confidentiality, quality of services and supplies, flexible/extended opening hours, and pre–and post–test counselling were facilitators. Experiences between early and late testers overlapped though there were minor differences. In order to achieve the desired impact nationally and to attain the 90-90-90 targets, multiple interventions addressing both barriers and facilitators to testing are needed to increase uptake of testing and to link the positive to care.\n",

      "While primary care providers in New York State (NYS) are mandated to offer all patients a HIV test, still many NYS residents miss the HIV screening opportunity. To fill the gap, and as the CDC recommends, this study aimed to examine the feasibility of implementing HIV screening in dental setting, identify patient characteristics associated with acceptance of HIV rapid testing, and discuss best practices of HIV screening in dental setting. New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) collaborated with the Northeast/Caribbean AIDS Education and Training Center (NECA AETC) and three dental schools in New York State to offer free HIV screening tests as a component of routine dental care between February 2016 and March 2018. Ten clinics in upstate New York and Long Island participated in the study. HIV screening was performed using the OraQuick™ In-Home HIV Test. 14,887 dental patients were offered HIV screening tests; 9,057 (60.8%) were screened; and one patient (0.011%) was confirmed HIV positive and linked to medical care. Of all dental patients, 33% had never been screened for HIV; and 56% had not had a primary care visit or had not been offered an HIV screening test by primary care providers in the previous 12 months. Multi-level generalized linear modeling analysis indicated that test acceptance was significantly associated with patient’s age, race/ethnicity, gender, country of origin, primary payer (or insurance), past primary care visits, past HIV testing experiences, and the poverty level of patient’s community. HIV screening is well accepted by dental patients and can be effectively integrated into routine dental care. HIV screening in the dental setting can be a good option for first-time testers, those who have not seen a primary care provider in the last 12 months, and those who have not been offered HIV screening at their last primary care visit.\n",

      "Individuals involved in the criminal justice (CJ) system continue to be at disproportionate risk for HIV infection, and often have a greater prevalence of substance use and sexual related risk behaviors relative to their non-CJ involved peers. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a once daily antiretroviral medicine, is an evidence-based approach for reducing the risk of contracting HIV but limited data exist regarding the use of PrEP among CJ populations, especially in the U.S. South. This study was conducted at the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility (PCRDF) in Little Rock, Arkansas (AR), the largest county jail in the state. We explored knowledge about PrEP and HIV, perceptions about PrEP feasibility in both the jail and community settings and barriers to PrEP program implementation, through in-depth qualitative interviews with 21 jail detainees. We purposively sampled individuals based on specific self-reported risk behavior, including sexual risk (both heterosexual and same-sex) and drug related risk (e.g. IDU), among all eligible individuals. We identified five primary themes from the interviews: 1) accessing healthcare during community reentry was a low priority; 2) perception of risk and interaction with people with HIV was low; 3) there are many barriers to disclosing HIV risk behaviors in jail settings; 4) knowledge of PrEP is low but willingness to use is high; and 5) multiple barriers exist to PrEP uptake post-release. Our findings are contextually unique and therefore have important implications for future implementation of PrEP access either within jail settings or linkage to PrEP post release.\n",

Semistructured interviews were conducted with 26 people with HIV and peripheral neuropathic pain symptoms. Interviews explored the impact of pain and participants' pain management strategies. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. Four themes and 11 subthemes were identified. Theme 1 reflects the complex characterisation of neuropathic pain, including the perceived unusual nature of this pain and diagnostic uncertainty. Theme 2 centred on the interconnected impacts of pain on mood and functioning and includes how pain disrupts relationships and threatens social inclusion. Theme 3 reflects the struggle for pain relief, including participants' attempts to “exhaust all options” and limited success in finding lasting relief. The final theme describes how pain management is complicated by living with HIV; this theme includes the influence of HIV stigma on pain communication and pain as an unwanted reminder of HIV.

Chronically infected individuals thus carry a genomic burden of virus-derived sequences that persists through antiretroviral therapy. This burden consists of a small fraction of intact, but transcriptionally silenced, i.e. latent, viral genomes and a dominant fraction of defective sequences. Remarkably, all viral-derived sequences are subject to interaction with host cellular physiology at various levels. In this review, we focus on epigenetic aspects of this interaction. We provide a comprehensive overview of how epigenetic mechanisms contribute to establishment and maintenance of HIV-1 gene repression during latency. We furthermore summarize findings indicating that HIV-1 infection leads to changes in the epigenome of target and bystander immune cells. Finally, we discuss how an improved understanding of epigenetic features and mechanisms involved in HIV-1 infection could be exploited for clinical use.\n",

We investigated HIV-1 transmission networks in men who have sex with men (MSM), injecting drug users (IDU), female sex workers (FSW) and heterosexuals (HET) in coastal Kenya. We used maximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetics to analyse new (N = 163) and previously published (N = 495) HIV-1 polymerase sequences collected during 2005–2019. Of the 658 sequences, 131 (20%) were from MSM, 58 (9%) IDU, 109 (17%) FSW, and 360 (55%) HET. Overall, 206 (31%) sequences formed 61 clusters. Most clusters (85%) consisted of sequences from the same risk group, suggesting frequent within-group transmission. The remaining clusters were mixed between HET/MSM (7%), HET/FSW (5%), and MSM/FSW (3%) sequences. One large IDU-exclusive cluster was found, indicating an independent sub-epidemic among this group. Phylodynamic analysis of this cluster revealed a steady increase in HIV-1 infections among IDU since the estimated origin of the cluster in 1987.

      "The HIV-1 capsid protein makes up the core of the virion and plays a critical role in early steps of HIV replication. Due to its exposure in the cytoplasm after entry, HIV capsid is a target for host cell factors that act directly to block infection such as TRIM5α and MxB. Several host proteins also play a role in facilitating infection, including in the protection of HIV-1 capsid from recognition by host cell restriction factors. Through an unbiased screening approach, called HIV-CRISPR, we show that the CPSF6-binding deficient, N74D HIV-1 capsid mutant is sensitive to restriction mediated by human TRIM34, a close paralog of the well-characterized HIV restriction factor TRIM5α. This restriction occurs at the step of reverse transcription, is independent of interferon stimulation, and limits HIV-1 infection in key target cells of HIV infection including CD4+ T cells and monocyte-derived dendritic cells. TRIM34 can also restrict some SIV capsids. TRIM34 restriction requires TRIM5α as knockout or knockdown of TRIM5α results in a loss of antiviral activity. Through immunofluorescence studies, we show that TRIM34 and TRIM5α colocalize to cytoplasmic bodies and are more frequently observed to be associated with infecting N74D capsids than with WT HIV-1 capsids. Our results identify TRIM34 as an HIV-1 CA-targeting restriction factor and highlight the potential role for heteromultimeric TRIM interactions in contributing to restriction of HIV-1 infection in human cells.\n",

      "HIV-1 infection in humans is the result of cross-species transmission of a related primate lentivirus from chimpanzees. In order to adapt to replicate in human cells, HIV-1 adapted to host proteins that restrict infection by viruses. The HIV-1 capsid protein encapsidates the HIV-1 genome, allowing it to be delivered to the host cell for integration into the host chromosome. However, on delivery to the cytoplasm the HIV-1 capsid protein is exposed to an array of capsid-targeting restriction factors that act to limit infection. Viral mutants can be used to reveal some of these restriction factors. Our results show that TRIM34 is an antiviral effector that blocks infection of an HIV with a particular mutation in capsid. TRIM34 also inhibits some lentiviruses that infect monkeys. This block requires the closely-related paralog TRIM5α, a capsid-targeting restriction factor with well-characterized antiviral activity in primates. These results highlight the complex interaction between HIV-1 with human antiviral proteins.\n",

      "Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) treatment with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has improved the life quality of many patients since its implementation. However, resistance mutations and the accumulation of severe side effects associated with cART remain enormous challenges that need to be addressed with the continual design and redesign of anti-HIV drugs. In this review, we focus on the importance of the HIV-1 Gag polyprotein as the master coordinator of HIV-1 assembly and maturation and as an emerging drug target. Due to its multiple roles in the HIV-1 life cycle, the individual Gag domains are attractive but also challenging targets for inhibitor design. However, recent encouraging developments in targeting the Gag domains such as the capsid protein with highly potent and potentially long-acting inhibitors, as well as the exploration and successful targeting of challenging HIV-1 proteins such as the matrix protein, have demonstrated the therapeutic viability of this important protein.

      "In Vietnam, harm reduction programs to control HIV among people who inject drugs (PWID) were implemented approximately 10 years ago. Since then, the HIV prevalence has declined in this population, however, the impact of these programs on the rate of new HIV and Hepatitis C (HCV) infections remains unknown as high mortality can exceed the rate of new infections. We evaluated HIV and HCV incidences in a cohort of active PWID in HaiPhong in 2014, who were recruited from a community-based respondent driven sampling (RDS) survey and followed for 1 year. Only HIV-negative or HCV-negative participants not on medication assisted treatment (MAT) were eligible. HIV/HCV serology was tested at enrollment and at 32- and 64-week follow-up visits. Among 603 RDS participants, 250 were enrolled in the cohort, including 199 HIV seronegative and 99 HCV seronegative PWID. No HIV seroconversion was reported during the 206 person-years (PY) of follow-up (HIV incidence of 0/100PY, one-sided 97.5%CI:0-1.8/100 PY). Eighteen HCV seroconversions were reported for an incidence of 19.4/100 PY (95%CI;11.5-30.7).

      "HIV-related stigma has been identified as a significant stressor affecting Quality of Life of Youth Living With HIV/AIDS (YLWHA). Gaining a contextualized understanding of how this stigma is experienced by YLWHA in Western Uganda is crucial in addressing it in this group and setting. In this study, we explored the lived experiences of YLWHA with HIV-related stigma. Photovoice was used to gain insight into the lived experiences of HIV-related stigma in 11 YLWHA (15–19 years), purposively selected from a hospital-based peer support group. Group interview transcripts, notes and photographs were subjected to phenomenological hermeneutic analysis. Encounters with enacted, anticipated and internalized stigmas and their myriad sequels were prevalent in the photos and narratives of participants. Our findings were categorized and presented in 5 main themes that were identified through the analysis: being devalued, experiencing fear, experiencing injustices, feeling lonely, and lacking future perspectives. HIV-related stigmas were experienced in various socio-ecological domains but predominantly in homes and schools that ought to be supportive surroundings for youths. A multilevel approach, targeting the entire society where the root causes of stigma can be found and specific contexts like schools and homes where youth are confronted with stigma on a daily basis is proposed for a wholistic intervention.\n",

In 2018, FDA approved revised labeling for TDF/FTC that expanded the indication for PrEP to include adolescents weighing at least 77 lb (35 kg) who are at risk for acquiring HIV. In 2019, FDA approved the combination product tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)/FTC as PrEP for adolescents and adults weighing at least 77 lb (35 kg), excluding those at risk for acquiring HIV through receptive vaginal sex. This exclusion is due to the lack of clinical data regarding the efficacy of TAF/FTC in cisgender women.\n",

      "Clinical providers who evaluate adolescents for PrEP use must consider certain topics that are unique to the adolescent population. Important considerations related to adolescents include PrEP safety data, legal issues about consent for clinical care and confidentiality, the therapeutic partnership with adolescents and their parents or guardians, the approach to the adolescent patient’s clinical visit, and medication initiation, adherence, and persistence during adolescence. Overall, data support the safety of PrEP for adolescents. PrEP providers should be familiar with the statutes and regulations about the provision of health care to minors in their states. Providers should partner with the adolescent patient for PrEP decisions, recognizing the adolescent’s autonomy to the extent allowable by law and including parents in the conversation about PrEP when it is safe and reasonable to do so. A comprehensive approach to adolescent health is recommended, including considering PrEP as one possible component of providing medical care to adolescents who inject drugs or engage in sexual behaviors that place them at risk for acquiring HIV. PrEP adherence declined over time in the studies evaluating PrEP among adolescents, a trend that also has been observed among adult patients.

HA incidence was assessed between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2017 and included all symptomatic patients with virologically confirmed HA. Preventive measures consisted in identifying at risk and not immunised patients to propose them a free HAV vaccination, and an anonymous survey related to transmission routes of STD and to sexual behaviours. Twenty HA were diagnosed. All were homosexual men recently diagnosed with HIV and another STD. None were vaccinated against hepatitis A virus (HAV). Hospitalisation was required for 52%. We identified 250 patients at risk to acquire HAV and invited them to a free immunisation program. A total of 110 (44%) were vaccinated, of whom 74 responded to our survey. A majority of them (84%) reported recent active anal and oral sexuality with multiple (52%) male partners (81%), and ChemSex consumption (14%). Internet was the meeting link for 58%. Another STD history was found in 69%. One third of these individuals had no idea about STD transmission modes.

      "Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) at suppressing HIV-1 infection, a cure that eradicates all HIV-1-infected cells has been elusive. The latent viral reservoir remains intact in tissue compartments that are not readily targeted by the host immune response that could accelerate the rate of reservoir decline during ART. However, over the past decade, numerous broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) have been discovered and characterized. These bNAbs have also given rise to engineered antibody-like inhibitors that are just as or more potent than bNAbs themselves. The question remains whether bNAbs and HIV-1 inhibitors will be the effective “kill” to a shock-and-kill approach to eliminate the viral reservoir. Additional research over the past few years has sought to develop recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors to circumvent the need for continual administration of bNAbs and maintain persistent expression in a host. This review discusses the advancements made in using rAAV vectors for the delivery of HIV-1 bNAbs and inhibitors and the future of this technology in HIV-1 cure research. Numerous groups have demonstrated with great efficacy that rAAV vectors can successfully express protective concentrations of bNAbs and HIV-1 inhibitors. Yet, therapeutic concentrations, especially in non-human primate (NHP) models, are not routinely achieved. As new studies have been reported, more challenges have been identified for utilizing rAAV vectors, specifically how the host immune response limits the attainable concentrations of bNAbs and inhibitors. The next few years should provide improvements to rAAV vector delivery that will ultimately show whether they can be used for expressing bNAbs and HIV-1 inhibitors to eliminate the HIV-1 viral reservoir.\n",

Here, we present approaches for incorporating full-length, wild-type HIV-1 Env, as well as C-terminally truncated and stabilized versions, into lipid assemblies, providing a modular platform for Env structural studies by single particle electron microscopy. We reconstitute a full-length Env clone into a nanodisc, complex it with a membrane-proximal external region (MPER) targeting antibody 10E8, and structurally define the full quaternary epitope of 10E8 consisting of lipid, MPER, and ectodomain contacts. By aligning this and other Env-MPER antibody complex reconstructions with the lipid bilayer, we observe evidence of Env tilting as part of the neutralization mechanism for MPER-targeting antibodies. We also adapt the platform toward vaccine design purposes by introducing stabilizing mutations that allow purification of unliganded Env with a peptidisc scaffold.\n",

      "The prefusion conformation of HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) is recognized by most broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Studies showed that alterations of its membrane-related components, including the transmembrane domain (TMD) and cytoplasmic tail (CT), can reshape the antigenic structure of the Env ectodomain. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we determine the structure of an Env segment encompassing the TMD and a large portion of the CT in bicelles. The structure reveals that the CT folds into amphipathic helices that wrap around the C-terminal end of the TMD, thereby forming a support baseplate for the rest of Env. NMR dynamics measurements provide evidences of dynamic coupling across the TMD between the ectodomain and CT. Pseudovirus-based neutralization assays suggest that CT-TMD interaction preferentially affects antigenic structure near the apex of the Env trimer. These results explain why the CT can modulate the Env antigenic properties and may facilitate HIV-1 Env-based vaccine design.\n",

      "Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) serves as an effective strategy to combat HIV infections by suppressing viral replication in patients with HIV/AIDS. However, HAART does not provide HIV/AIDS patients with a sterilizing or functional cure, and introduces several deleterious comorbidities. Moreover, the virus is able to persist within latent reservoirs, both undetected by the immune system and unaffected by HAART, increasing the risk of a viral rebound. The field of immunoengineering, which utilizes varied bioengineering approaches to interact with the immune system and potentiate its therapeutic effects against HIV, is being increasingly investigated in HIV cure research. In particular, nanoparticle-based immunoengineered approaches are especially attractive because they offer advantages including the improved delivery and functionality of classical HIV drugs such as antiretrovirals and experimental drugs such as latency-reversing agents (LRAs), among others. Here, we present and discuss the current state of the field in nanoparticle-based immunoengineering approaches for an HIV cure. Specifically, we discuss nanoparticle-based methods for improving HAART as well as latency reversal, developing vaccines, targeting viral fusion, enhancing gene editing approaches, improving adoptively transferred immune-cell mediated reservoir clearance, and other therapeutic and prevention approaches. Although nanoparticle-based immunoengineered approaches are currently at the stage of preclinical testing, the promising findings obtained in these studies demonstrate the potential of this emerging field for developing an HIV cure.\n",

      "During chronic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, upregulation of inhibitory molecules contributes to effector cell dysfunction and exhaustion. This, in combination with the ability of HIV-1 to reside dormant in cellular reservoirs and escape immune recognition, makes the pathway to HIV-1 cure particularly challenging. An idealized strategy to achieve HIV-1 cure proposes combined viral and immune activation by “shock”ing HIV-1 out of latency and into an immunologically visible state to be recognized and “kill”ed by immune effector cells. Here we outline the potential for blockade of the inhibitory immune checkpoint T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and ITIM domains (TIGIT) to overcome natural killer (NK) cell and T cell inhibition associated with HIV-1 infection and invigorate antiviral effector cell responses against HIV-1 reactivated from the latent cellular reservoir.\n",

      "Amyloid beta (Aβ) depositions are more abundant in HIV-infected brains. The blood–brain barrier, with its backbone created by endothelial cells, is assumed to be a core player in Aβ homeostasis and may contribute to Aβ accumulation in the brain. Exposure to HIV increases shedding of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from human brain endothelial cells and alters EV-Aβ levels. EVs carrying various cargo molecules, including a complex set of proteins, can profoundly affect the biology of surrounding neurovascular unit cells. In the current study, we sought to examine how exposure to HIV, alone or together with Aβ, affects the surface and total proteomic landscape of brain endothelial EVs. By using this unbiased approach, we gained an unprecedented, high-resolution insight into these changes. Our data suggest that HIV and Aβ profoundly remodel the proteome of brain endothelial EVs, altering the pathway networks and functional interactions among proteins. These events may contribute to the EV-mediated amyloid pathology in the HIV-infected brain and may be relevant to HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders.\n",

      "This study explored the HIV-related stressors that people living with HIV (PLWH) commonly experience and express as stressful at the time of diagnosis and 1 year later. The factors associated with stress levels and whether social support would moderate the negative effects of stress on psychological health (depressive and anxiety symptoms) were also investigated. Newly diagnosed PLWH were consecutively recruited in this study. Participants rated their stress with the HIV/AIDS Stress Scale at baseline and 1 year later. Social support, depression, and anxiety were also self-reported at both time points. There were significant decreases in stress levels 1 year after diagnosis. Stressors regarding confidentiality, disclosure, emotional distress, fear of infecting others, and excessive attention to physical functions were the most problematic at baseline and 1-year follow-up. A younger age, married status, not living alone, less income, presence of HIV symptoms, and lack of social support were associated with higher levels of stress. No stress-buffering effect of social support on depressive and anxiety symptoms was found in this study. Interventions to reduce stress among PLWH should take into consideration the following priority stressors: confidentiality, discrimination/stigma, serostatus disclosure, distressing emotions, fear of infecting others, and excessive attention to physical functions. More attention should be paid to PLWH with younger age, not living alone, less income, presence of HIV symptoms, and lack of social support.\n",

      "Despite its current relatively low global share of cases and deaths in Africa compared to other regions, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has the potential to trigger other larger crises in the region. This is due to the vulnerability of health and economic systems, coupled with the high burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB), and malaria. Here we examine the potential implications of COVID-19 on the control of these major epidemic diseases in Africa. We use current evidence on disease burden of HIV, TB, and malaria, and epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 in Africa, retrieved from the literature. Our analysis shows that the current measures to control COVID-19 neglect important and complex context-specific epidemiological, social, and economic realities in Africa. There is a similarity of clinical features of TB and malaria, with those used to track COVID-19 cases. This coupled with institutional mistrust and misinformation might result in many patients with clinical features similar to those of COVID-19 being hesitant to voluntarily seek care in a formal health facility. Furthermore, most people in productive age in Africa work in the informal sector, and most of those in the formal sector are underemployed. With the current measures to control COVID-19, these populations might face unprecedented difficulties to access essential services, mainly due to reduced ability of patients to support direct and indirect medical costs, and unavailability of transportation means to reach health facilities. Therefore, if not accompanied with appropriate economic and epidemiological considerations, we anticipate that these measures might result in unprecedented difficulties among vulnerable segments of society to access essential services, including antiretroviral and prophylactic drugs among people living with HIV and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, anti-tuberculosis drugs, and curative and preventive treatments for malaria among pregnant women and children. This might increase the propensity of patients taking substandard doses and/or medicines, which has the potential to compromise drug efficacy, and worsen health inequalities in the region. COVID-19 responses at country level should include measures to protect vulnerable and under-served segments of society.\n",

We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 46 LGBT persons and six key informants (e.g. healthcare providers). Participants described depression, substance use, and HIV as mutually reinforcing and situated in larger social contexts of stigma. Alcohol use was a stigma coping strategy and a way to build LGBT connections. At the same time, alcohol use elevated HIV vulnerabilities by lowering condom use uptake. Pervasive stigma reinforced barriers to healthcare engagement. Community-led support and services were leveraged to navigate stigma, reduce HIV vulnerabilities, and ultimately improve health.

      "HIV reactivation from latency is induced by cytokines but also by cell contact with other cells. To better understand this, J1.1 cells, a latent HIV-1-infected Jurkat derivative, were cocultured with its parental Jurkat. J1.1 cells became p17MA-positive and produced a high level of HIV p24CA antigen, only when they were cocultured with stimulated Jurkat with cell-to-cell contact. In contrast, very little p24CA was produced when they were cocultured without cell contact. Similar results were obtained when latent ACH-2 and its parental A3.01 cells were cocultured. Confocal microscopy revealed that not only HIV-1 p17MA and gp120Env but also LFA-1, CD81, CD59, and TCR CD3 accumulated at the cell contact site, suggesting formation of the virological synapse-like structure. LFA-1–ICAM-1 interaction was involved in the cell-to-cell contact. When J1.1 was cocultured with TCR-deficient Jurkat, the p17MA-positive rate was significantly lower, although the cell-to-cell contact was not impaired. Quantitative proteomics identified 54 membrane molecules, one of which was MHC class I, that accumulated at the cell contact site. Reactivation from latency was also influenced by the presence of stromal cells. Our study indicated that latent HIV-1 in J1.1/ACH-2 cells was efficiently reactivated by cell-to-cell contact with stimulated parental cells, accompanying the virological synapse-like structure.\n",

      "The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) establishes a chronic infection that can be well controlled, but not cured, by combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Interventions have been explored to accomplish a functional cure, meaning that a patient remains infected but HIV is undetectable in the blood, with the aim of allowing patients to live without cART. Tat, the viral transactivator of transcription protein, plays a critical role in controlling HIV transcription, latency, and viral rebound following the interruption of cART treatment. Therefore, a logical approach for controlling HIV would be to block Tat. Tackling Tat with inhibitors has been a difficult task, but some recent discoveries hold promise. Two anti-HIV proteins, Nullbasic (a mutant of Tat) and HT1 (a fusion of HEXIM1 and Tat functional domains) inhibit viral transcription by interfering with the interaction of Tat and cellular factors. Two small molecules, didehydro-cortistatin A (dCA) and triptolide, inhibit Tat by different mechanisms: dCA through direct binding and triptolide through enhanced proteasomal degradation.

      "Introduction: The World Health Organisation recommends HIV self-testing as an alternative testing method to help reach underserved populations, such as men in sub-Saharan Africa. Successful implementation and scale-up of HIV self-testing (HIVST) in Rwanda relies heavily on relevant stakeholders’ involvement. We sought to explore HIVST key stakeholders’ perceptions of the implementation and scale-up of HIVST in Rwanda. Method: We conducted in-depth interviews with personnel involved in HIV response projects in Rwanda between September and November 2019. We purposively sampled and interviewed 13 national-level key stakeholders from the Ministry of Health, Rwanda Biomedical Center, non-governmental organizations and HIV clinics at tertiary health facilities in Kigali. We used a thematic approach to analysis with a coding framework guided by Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (intervention characteristics, inner setting, outer setting, characteristics of individuals involved in the implementation and the implementation process). Results: Key stakeholders perceived HIVST as a potentially effective initiative, which can be used in order to ensure that there is an improvement in uptake of testing services, especially for underserved populations in Rwanda. The following challenges for implementation and scale-up of HIVST were revealed: lack of awareness of the kits, high cost of the self-test kits, and concerns on results interpretation. Key stakeholders identified the following as prerequisites to the successful implementation and scale-up of HIVST in Rwanda; creation of awareness, training those involved in the implementation process, regulation of the selling of the self-test kits, reduction of the costs of acquiring the self-test kits through the provision of subsidies, and ensuring consistent availability of the self-test kits. Conclusions: Key stakeholders expressed confidence in HIVST’s ability to improve the uptake of HIV testing services.

      "Currently, most HIV tests are performed with blood samples, or alternatively saliva samples are used for HIV testing. Simple HIV tests need to be performed in hospitals or other medical agencies instead of more invasive HIV blood tests. To enable point-of-care (POC) HIV diagnostics, based on a recently developed lateral flow strip for HIV urine testing, a microfluidic immunoassay cassette with a handheld optical reader is developed. Based on lateral flow strip with gold colloid reporter, the integrated immunoassay cassette can perform sample introduction, metering, discharging, applying and detection which simplifies HIV testing. An indicator is incorporated into the cassette to guide sample introduction based on color change, and further, the excess test sample is stored inside the sealed cassette to avoid any contamination. The low-cost handheld optical reader can provide a test result within a few seconds, which is useful for simple, sensitive and affordable HIV onsite detection. Instead of using normal white LEDs, a customized back light module embedded with green LEDs is adopted to illuminate the lateral flow strip with an appropriate working current to achieve optimal performance. Compared to the standard lateral flow strips using a benchtop reader, with the disposable immunoassay cassette assisted by the handheld optical reader, more convenient, easier-to-operate, and more affordable HIV urine testing can be achieved in POC diagnostics.\n",

The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA≤ 50 copies/mL at week 48 using a non-inferiority margin of –10%. At week 48, 79 of 92 (85.9%) participants in the lower dose regimen group and 78 of 92 (84.8%) in the standard dose regimen group achieved HIV-1 RNA≤ 50 copies/mL (treatment difference 1.1%, 95% CI −9.1 to 11.3) in the intention-to-treat analysis.

      "HIV self-testing (HIVST), which allows people to test in private, is an innovative testing strategy that has been shown to increase HIV testing among men. Delivering HIVST kits to men via women is one promising assisted partner service strategy. Little research has been conducted on HIVST secondary distribution to men by women living with HIV (WLWH) in the Caribbean and other settings. The purpose of this study was to assess the perspectives of WLWH, their male partners, and healthcare professionals on the perceived advantages and disadvantages of HIVST, and recommendations for implementing HIVST in Haiti, with a focus on secondary distribution of HIVST to men by WLWH. Sixteen key informant interviews and nine focus groups with 44 healthcare workers, 31 Option B+ clients, and 13 men were carried out in Haiti. Key informants were representatives of the Ministry of Health and of a non-governmental agency involved in HIV partner services. Focus group members included program leads and staff members from the HIV care and treatment program, the Option B+ program, the community health service program, and the HIV counseling and testing services from 2 hospitals. Perceived HIVST advantage included an increase in the number of people who would learn their HIV status and start treatment. The perceived disadvantages were lack of support to ensure self-testers initiate treatment, uncertainty about male partner’s reaction, risk of violence towards women delivering HIVST kits after receiving an HIVST kit from a woman, and the inability of women to counsel a man in case his self-test result is positive. Recommendations for integrating HIVST and secondary distribution of HIVST by WLWH included coupling HIVST distribution with public information, education, and communication through media and social marketing, relying on community health workers to mediate use of HIVST and ensure linkage to care, piloting HIVST programs on a small scale. HIVST is an appropriate and feasible strategy HIV prevention for men and women; however, more research is needed on how best to implement different strategies for this approach in the Caribbean.\n",

      "Chronic HIV-infected children suffer from premature aging and aging-related diseases. Viral replication induces an ongoing inflammation process, with the release of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), the activation of the immune system, and the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Although combined highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly modified the natural course of HIV infection, normalization of T and B cell phenotype is not completely achievable; thus, many HIV-infected children display several phenotypical alterations, including higher percentages of activated cells, that favor an accelerated telomere attrition, and higher percentages of exhausted and senescent cells. All these features ultimately lead to the clinical manifestations related to premature aging and comorbidities typically observed in older general population, including non-AIDS-related malignancies. Therefore, even under effective treatment, the premature aging process of HIV-infected children negatively impacts their quality and length of life. This review examines the available data on the impact of HIV and ART on immune and biological senescence of HIV-infected children.\n",

      "The HIV-infected population is at a dramatically increased risk of developing pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a devastating and fatal cardiopulmonary disease that is rare amongst the general population. It is increasingly apparent that PAH is a disease with complex and heterogeneous cellular and molecular pathologies, and options for therapeutic intervention are limited, resulting in poor clinical outcomes for affected patients. A number of soluble HIV factors have been implicated in driving the cellular pathologies associated with PAH through perturbations of various signaling and regulatory networks of uninfected bystander cells in the pulmonary vasculature. While these mechanisms are likely numerous and multifaceted, the overlapping features of PAH cellular pathologies and the effects of viral factors on related cell types provide clues as to the potential mechanisms driving HIV-PAH etiology and progression. In this review, we discuss the link between the DNA damage response (DDR) signaling network, chronic HIV infection, and potential contributions to the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension in chronically HIV-infected individuals.\n",

      "The major barrier to HIV cure is a population of long-lived cells that harbor latent but replication-competent virus, are not eliminated by antiretroviral therapy (ART), and remain indistinguishable from uninfected cells. However, ART does not cure HIV infection, side effects to treatment still occur, and the steady global rate of new infections makes finding a sustained ART-free HIV remission or cure for HIV-seropositive individuals urgently needed. Approaches aimed to cure HIV are mostly based on the “shock and kill” method that entails the use of a drug compound to reactivate latent virus paired together with strategies to boost or supplement the existing immune system to clear reactivated latently infected cells. Traditionally, these strategies have utilized CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL) but have been met with a number of challenges. Enhancing innate immune cell populations, such as γδ T cells, may provide an alternative route to HIV cure. γδ T cells possess anti-viral and cytotoxic capabilities that have been shown to directly inhibit HIV infection and specifically eliminate reactivated, latently infected cells \n",

      "The article deals with the ways Russian authorities have constructed the social problem of HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome) in Russia. The statistical construction of HIV/AIDS includes data indicating the significant rise of HIV prevalence in Russia since 2000. The study focuses on what and how Russian authorities speak about HIV/AIDS, while there are official data on the rapid spread of the virus in the country. The work is based on a discourse analysis of the authorities’ rhetoric about HIV/AIDS. During his first presidential terms, Vladimir Putin constructed HIV/AIDS not as an epidemic in the country, but as a “global problem,” representing Russia as a participant in international efforts to combat AIDS. The president problematized the HIV spread through the rhetoric of endangerment but without its crucial term “epidemic,” while at the same time de-problematized HIV in Russia by the strategy of naturalizing (“this is a problem that all countries face”). The Russian authorities appealed to traditional moral values and spoke about marginal or risk groups, rather than risk practices. After the deterioration of relations with Western countries since 2007, the Russian president excluded HIV/AIDS problem from his public agenda, despite the existence of the data on steep HIV growth in Russia. The Russian president's traditionalism, de-problematization, and silence concerning HIV/AIDS lead to the absence of the HIV/AIDS issues in media agenda, the agenda of local authorities, and consequently the personal agendas of Russian citizens. The consequences are ignorance, fears, stigmatization of people living with HIV, semi-legal status of needle, and syringe exchange programs for intravenous drug users, low antiretroviral therapy coverage, and the continuing HIV epidemic.\n",

      "General practitioners (GPs) play a key role in reducing the hidden HIV-epidemic, but many diagnostic opportunities are missed in primary care. This study aimed at informing the development of an HIV-testing intervention for GPs in Flanders (Belgium) using formative research with a participatory approach. Through the active involvement of an advisory board and 16 group discussions with 122 Flemish GPs, GPs’ current HIV-testing practices and perceived practical relevance of 2 distinct HIV-testing strategies (i.e. provider-initiated testing of key populations and indicator condition-based testing) were explored in terms of their relevance and feasibility in routine primary care. Self-reported HIV-testing practices revealed that most tests performed were patient-initiated, pretest counseling was rarely done, and post-test counseling was offered mainly for patients with an HIV-diagnosis. GPs reported multiple barriers to provider-initiated HIV-testing, i.e. personal discomfort, fear of offending their patient, limited knowledge of benefits of early HIV-diagnosis, misconceptions about HIV-risks, lack of guidelines and time. Difficulties to identify patient’s sexual orientation or ethical concerns were mentioned as barriers for target group-based HIV testing. GPs assessed the current list of 64 indicator conditions as too difficult to integrate in routine care, deeming a reduced list of GP-relevant conditions as more feasible. Combined strategies (i.e. target group- and indicator-based testing) supported by official screening recommendations were perceived as successful strategies for provider-initiated HIV-testing in primary care. This formative research delivered qualitative evidence for the development of an HIV-testing intervention for primary care settings.\n",

      "The evolution of therapeutics for and management of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection has shifted it from predominately manifesting as a severe, acute disease with high mortality to a chronic, controlled infection with a near typical life expectancy. However, despite extensive use of highly active antiretroviral therapy, the prevalence of chronic widespread pain in people with HIV remains high even in those with a low viral load and high CD4 count. Chronic widespread pain is a common comorbidity of HIV infection and is associated with decreased quality of life and a high rate of disability. Chronic pain in people with HIV is multifactorial and influenced by HIV-induced peripheral neuropathy, drug-induced peripheral neuropathy, and chronic inflammation. The specific mechanisms underlying these three broad categories that contribute to chronic widespread pain are not well understood, hindering the development and application of pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to mitigate chronic widespread pain. The consequent insufficiencies in clinical approaches to alleviation of chronic pain in people with HIV contribute to an overreliance on opioids and alarming rise in active addiction and overdose. This article reviews the current understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic widespread pain in people with HIV and identifies potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets to mitigate it.\n",

      "Gene expression in HIV-1 is regulated by the promoters in 5’ long-terminal repeat (LTR) element, which contain multiple DNA regulatory elements that serve as binding sites for cellular transcription factors. YY1 could repress HIV-1 gene expression and latent infection. Here, however, we observed that virus production can be increased by YY1 over-expression and decreased under YY1 depleted condition by siRNA treatment. To identify functional domain(s) of YY1 activation, we constructed a number of YY1 truncated mutants. Our data show that full-length YY1 enhances the viral transcription both through U3 and U3RU5 promoters. Moreover, the C-terminal region (296-414 residues) of YY1 is responsible for the transcriptional upregulation, which could be enhanced further in the presence of the viral Tat protein. The central domain of YY1 (155-295 residues) does not affect LTR activity but has a negative effect on HIV-1 gene expression. Taken together, our study shows that YY1 could act as a transcriptional activator in HIV-1 replication, at least in the early stages of infection.\n",

      "How the reverse-transcribed genome reaches the host nucleus remains a main open question related to the infectious cycle of HIV-1. The HIV-1 core has a size of ∼100 nm, largely exceeding that of the NPC channel (∼39 nm). Thus, a rearrangement of the viral CA protein organization is required to achieve an effective nuclear translocation. The mechanism of this process remains undefined due to the lack of a technology capable of visualizing potential CA subcomplexes in association with the viral DNA in the nucleus of HIV-1-infected cells. By the means of state-of-the-art technologies (HIV-1 ANCHOR system combined with CLEM), our study shows that remodeled viral complexes retain multiple CA proteins but not an intact core or only a single CA monomer. These viral CA complexes associated with the retrotranscribed DNA can be observed inside the nucleus, and they represent a potential PIC. Thus, our study shed light on critical early steps characterizing HIV-1 infection, thereby revealing novel, therapeutically exploitable points of intervention.

      "Retroviral replication proceeds through obligate integration of the viral DNA into the host genome. In particular, for the HIV-1 genome to enter the nucleus, it must be led through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). During the HIV-1 cytoplasmic journey, the viral core acts as a shell to protect the viral genetic material from antiviral sensors and ensure an adequate environment for reverse transcription. However, the relatively narrow size of the nuclear pore channel requires that the HIV-1 core is reshaped into a structure that fits the pore. On the other hand, the organization of the viral CA proteins that remain associated with the preintegration complex (PIC) during and after nuclear translocation is still enigmatic. In this study, we analyzed the progressive organizational changes of viral CA proteins within the cytoplasm and the nucleus by immunogold labeling. Furthermore, we set up a novel technology, HIV-1 ANCHOR, which enables the specific detection of the retrotranscribed DNA by fluorescence microscopy, thereby offering the opportunity to uncover the architecture of the potential HIV-1 PIC. Thus, we combined the immunoelectron microscopy and ANCHOR technologies to reveal the presence of DNA- and CA-positive complexes by correlated light and electron microscopy (CLEM). During and after nuclear translocation, HIV-1 appears as a complex of viral DNA decorated by multiple viral CA proteins remodeled in a pearl necklace-like shape. Thus, we could describe how CA proteins are reshaped around the viral DNA to permit the entrance of the HIV-1 in the nucleus. This particular CA protein complex composed of the integrase and the retrotranscribed DNA leads the HIV-1 genome inside the host nucleus. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the early steps of HIV-1 infection and provide new insights into the organization of HIV-1 CA proteins during and after viral nuclear entry. Of note, we are now able to visualize the viral DNA in viral complexes, opening up new perspectives for future studies on virus’s fate in the cell nucleus.\n",

Thus, additional preventive strategies beyond ART will be required to close the remaining gap and end the pediatric HIV epidemic. A maternal active immunization strategy that synergizes with maternal ART could further reduce infant HIV infections. In this study, we found that two historic HIV Env vaccines did not enhance the ability of HIV-infected pregnant women to neutralize autologous viruses. Therefore, next-generation maternal HIV vaccine candidates must employ alternate approaches to achieve potent neutralizing antibody and perhaps nonneutralizing antibody responses to effectively impede vertical virus transmission.

      "Innate immunity is the first line of defense against invading pathogens and may mediate HIV-1 resistance in HIV-1–exposed seronegative (HESN) individuals. This study aims to identify components of innate immunity that confer natural HIV-1 resistance in Chinese HESN individuals. Specifically, we compared the expression levels of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and associated pathway molecules in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes/macrophages, and plasma obtained from HESN and control individuals. HESN individuals had higher expression of TLR9, IRF7, IFN-α/β, RANTES, and MIP-1α/1β in PBMCs and plasma than control subjects. Upon TLR9 stimulation, significantly higher expression of TLR9 and IRF7, as well as higher production of IFN-α/β, RANTES, and MIP-1α/1β, was observed in PBMCs and monocytes/macrophages from HESN individuals than in the corresponding cells from control individuals. More importantly, both with and without TLR9 stimulation, the levels of HIV-1 replication in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from HESN individuals were significantly lower than those in MDMs from control individuals. These data suggest that increased TLR9 activity and subsequent release of antiviral factors contribute to protection against HIV-1 in HESN individuals.\n",

      "Increased life expectancy of patients diagnosed with HIV in the current era of antiretroviral therapy is unfortunately accompanied with the prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs) and risk of comorbidities such as Alzheimer-like pathology. HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein has been shown to induce the production of toxic neuronal amyloid protein and also enhance neurotoxicity. The contribution of astrocytes in Tat-mediated amyloidosis remains an enigma. We report here, in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)+ rhesus macaques and patients diagnosed with HIV, brain region–specific up-regulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Aβ (40 and 42) in astrocytes. In addition, we find increased expression of β-site cleaving enzyme (BACE1), APP, and Aβ in human primary astrocytes (HPAs) exposed to Tat. Mechanisms involved up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α), its translocation and binding to the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) BACE1‐antisense transcript (BACE1-AS), resulting, in turn, in the formation of the BACE1-AS/BACE1 RNA complex, subsequently leading to increased BACE1 protein, and activity and generation of Aβ-42. Gene silencing approaches confirmed the regulatory role of HIF-1α in BACE1-AS/BACE1 in Tat-mediated amyloidosis. This is the first report implicating the role of the HIF-1α/lncRNABACE1-AS/BACE1 axis in Tat-mediated induction of astrocytic amyloidosis, which could be targeted as adjunctive therapies for HAND-associated Alzheimer-like comorbidity.\n",

      "Background: Secondary distribution of HIV self-testing kits (HIVST) to pregnant women attending antenatal care (ANC) clinics to give to their male partners is a promising strategy to increase testing coverage among men, but its costs are unknown. Methods: We conducted micro-costing of a trial evaluating secondary distribution of HIVST on pregnant women living with HIV (PWLHIV) in an ANC in Kampala, Uganda. Costs (2019 USD) were collected from program budgets, expenditure records, time and motion observations, and staff interviews and estimated for three scenarios: as-studied, reflecting full costs of the research intervention, Ministry of Health (MOH) implementation, reflecting the research intervention if implemented by the MOH, and MOH roll-out, the current strategy being used to roll out HIVST distribution. Results: In the as-studied scenario, cost of HIVST provision was $13.96/PWLHIV reached, and $11.89 and $10.55 per HIV-positive and HIV-negative male partner, respectively, who linked to a clinic for facility-based testing. In the MOH implementation scenario, costs were $9.45/PWLHIV, and $7.87 and $6.99, respectively, per HIV-positive and HIV-negative male partner linking to the clinic. In the MOH roll-out scenario, the cost of HIVST provision to pregnant women regardless of HIV status was $3.70/woman, and $6.65/HIV-positive male partner. Conclusion: Secondary distribution of HIVST from pregnant women can be implemented at reasonable cost to increase testing among men in Uganda and similar settings in Africa.\n",

Interestingly, two classes of non-neutralizing CD4-induced (CD4i) antibodies, present in the majority of HIV-1-infected individuals have been described to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in the presence of small CD4 mimetic compounds (CD4mc). These antibodies recognize the coreceptor binding site (CoRBS) and the constant region one and two (C1C2 or inner domain cluster A) of the gp120. In combination with CD4mc they have been shown to stabilize an antibody-vulnerable Env conformation, known as State 2A. Here we evaluated the importance of these two families of Abs in ADCC responses by immunizing guinea pigs with gp120 immunogens that have been modified to elicit or not these types of antibodies. Underlying the importance of anti-CoRBS and anti-cluster A Abs in stabilizing State 2A, ADCC responses were only observed in the presence of these two types of CD4i antibodies. Altogether, our results suggest that these two families of CD4i antibodies must be taken into account when considering future strategies relying on the use of CD4mc to eliminate HIV-1-infected cells in vivo.\n",

Little is known about the rates and types of incidental findings found on brain MRI in patients with HIV infection, who may be at risk for HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND). Methods: The parent study included 108 adults with HIV infection and 125 demographically-matched uninfected controls who completed MRI and neuropsychological testing. Incidental findings were classified by the study team as vascular, neoplastic, congenital, other neurologic, or non-neurologic. Categorical measures were compared using Pearson chi-square tests; continuous measures were compared using t-tests. Results: Among participants with HIV infection, 36/108 (33%) had incidental findings compared to 33/125 (26%) controls (p = 0.248). Rates of incidental findings were significantly correlated with increasing age in both participants with HIV infection (p = 0.013) and controls (p = 0.022). We found no correlation between presence of incidental findings and sex or race/ethnicity among either cohort, and no correlation with CD4 count or HAND status for the HIV-infected cohort. Conclusions: Incidental findings were common in both participants with HIV infection and controls, at higher rates than previously reported in healthy populations.

      "HIV-1 establishes a life-long infection when proviral DNA integrates into the host genome. The provirus can then either actively transcribe RNA or enter a latent state, without viral production. The switch between these two states is governed in great part by the viral protein, Tat, which promotes RNA transcript elongation. Latency is also influenced by the availability of host transcription factors, integration site, and the surrounding chromatin environment. The latent reservoir is established in the first few days of infection and serves as the source of viral rebound upon treatment interruption. Despite effective suppression of HIV-1 replication by antiretroviral therapy (ART), to below the detection limit, ART is ineffective at reducing the latent reservoir size. Elimination of this reservoir has become a major goal of the HIV-1 cure field. However, aside from the ideal total HIV-1 eradication from the host genome, an HIV-1 remission or functional cure is probably more realistic. The “block-and-lock” approach aims at the transcriptional silencing of the viral reservoir, to render suppressed HIV-1 promoters extremely difficult to reactivate from latency. There are unfortunately no clinically available HIV-1 specific transcriptional inhibitors. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate latency is expected to provide novel targets to be explored in cure approaches.\n",

      "The HIV-1 reservoir consists of latently infected cells that persist despite antiretroviral therapy (ART). Elucidating the proviral genetic composition of the reservoir, particularly in the context of pre-therapy viral diversity, is therefore important to understanding reservoir formation and the persistence of latently infected cells. Here we investigate reservoir proviral variants from 13 Zambian acutely-infected individuals with additional pre-therapy sampling for a unique comparison to the ART-naïve quasispecies. We identified complete transmitted/founder (TF) viruses from seroconversion plasma samples, and additionally amplified and sequenced HIV-1 from plasma obtained one year post-infection and just prior to ART initiation. While the majority of proviral variants in the reservoir were most closely related to viral variants from the latest pre-therapy time point, we also identified reservoir proviral variants dating to or near the time of infection, and to intermediate time points between infection and treatment initiation. Reservoir proviral variants differing by five or fewer nucleotide changes from the TF virus persisted during treatment in five individuals, including proviral variants that exactly matched the TF in two individuals, one of whom had remained ART-naïve for more than six years. Proviral variants during treatment were significantly less divergent from the TF virus than plasma variants present at the last ART-naïve time point. These findings indicate that reservoir proviral variants are archived throughout infection, recapitulating much of the viral diversity that arises throughout untreated HIV-1 infection, and strategies to target and reduce the reservoir must therefore permit for the clearance of proviruses encompassing this extensive diversity.\n",

      "Despite reducing viremia to levels below the limit of detection in standard assays, effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) does not eradicate cells latently infected with HIV-1. These cells serve as a reservoir for viral rebound if therapy is interrupted; thus, understanding the composition of the reservoir may yield further targets for HIV-1 cure strategies. We have taken a genetic approach to elucidating the reservoir in 13 Zambian subtype C seroconvertors who were followed longitudinally through ART initiation and virologic suppression. In five of the 13 individuals, provirus sequences identical to or differing by five or fewer nucleotides from the transmitted/founder virus were detected, indicating archiving and persistence of early infection variants for more than six years following infection. While the majority of proviral variants in latently infected cells were most closely related to plasma virus circulating immediately prior to treatment initiation, additional variants dating to intermediate time points in the infection were also observed. These findings demonstrate that virus is archived during all stages of ART-naïve infection, and these variants persist throughout ART. HIV-1 cure strategies to eliminate the reservoir must address the broad genetic diversity of a within-host proviral quasispecies including variants archived from acute through chronic infection.\n",

      "Antibodies mediate a broad array of non-neutralizing Fc-mediated functions against HIV-1 including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). Accordingly, ADCC and ADCP induced by anti-HIV envelope gp120 IgG have been correlated to the limited success of the HIV-1 phase III vaccine trial RV144. It remains elusive whether ADCP can also be triggered by IgA, the isotype predominant at mucosal surfaces through which HIV-1 is mainly transmitted. Yet, we have previously shown that the HIV envelope subunit gp41-specific broadly neutralizing antibody 2F5 under the IgA isotype (2F5-IgA) triggers ADCC and cooperates with 2F5-IgG to increase HIV-1-infected cell lysis. Here, we now demonstrate that 2F5-IgA, more efficiently than 2F5-IgG, induces ADCP not only of gp41-coated beads but also of primary HIV-1-infected cells in a FcαRI-dependent manner. Both primary monocytes and neutrophils can act as effector cells of 2F5-IgA-mediated ADCP, although with different kinetics with faster neutrophil phagocytosis. However, unlike for ADCC, 2F5-IgA and 2F5-IgG do not cooperate to increase ADCP. Altogether, our results reveal that gp41-specific IgA mediate the efficient phagocytosis of HIV-1-infected cells. Inducing such ADCC and ADCP-prone IgA response by vaccination in addition to anti-HIV envelope IgG, might increase the protection against HIV acquisition at mucosal level.\n",

      "The type one interferon induced restriction factor Myxovirus resistance B (MxB) restricts HIV-1 nuclear entry evidenced by inhibition of 2-LTR but not linear forms of viral DNA. The HIV-1 capsid is the key determinant of MxB sensitivity and cofactor binding defective HIV-1 capsid mutants P90A (defective for cyclophilin A and Nup358 recruitment) and N74D (defective for CPSF6 recruitment) have reduced dependency on nuclear transport associated cofactors, altered integration targeting preferences and are not restricted by MxB expression. This has suggested that nuclear import mechanism may determine MxB sensitivity. Here we have use genetics to separate HIV-1 nuclear import cofactor dependence from MxB sensitivity. We provide evidence that MxB sensitivity depends on HIV-1 capsid conformation, rather than cofactor recruitment. We show that depleting CPSF6 to change nuclear import pathway does not impact MxB sensitivity, but mutants that recapitulate the effect of Cyclophilin A binding on capsid conformation and dynamics strongly impact MxB sensitivity. We demonstrate that HIV-1 primary isolates have different MxB sensitivities due to cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) selected differences in Gag sequence but similar cofactor dependencies. Overall our work demonstrates a complex relationship between cyclophilin dependence and MxB sensitivity likely driven by CTL escape. We propose that cyclophilin binding provides conformational flexibility to HIV-1 capsid facilitating simultaneous evasion of capsid-targeting restriction factors including TRIM5 as well as MxB.\n",

      "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of pattern recognition receptors and part of the first line of defense against invading microbes. In humans, we know of 10 different TLRs, which are expressed to varying degrees in immune cell subsets. Engaging TLRs through their specific ligands leads to activation of the innate immune system and secondarily priming of the adaptive immune system. Because of these unique properties, TLR agonists have been investigated as immunotherapy in cancer treatment for many years, but in recent years there has also been growing interest in the use of TLR agonists in the context of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) cure research. The primary obstacle to curing HIV-1 is the presence of a latent viral reservoir in transcriptionally silent immune cells. Due to the very limited transcription of the integrated HIV-1 proviruses, latently infected cells cannot be targeted and cleared by immune effector mechanisms. TLR agonists are very interesting in this context because of their potential dual effects as latency reverting agents (LRAs) and immune modulatory compounds. Here, we review preclinical and clinical data on the impact of TLR stimulation on HIV-1 latency as well as antiviral and HIV-1-specific immunity. We also focus on the promising role of TLR agonists in combination strategies in HIV-1 cure research. Different combinations of TLR agonists and broadly neutralizing antibodies or TLRs agonists as adjuvants in HIV-1 vaccines have shown very encouraging results in non-human primate experiments and these concepts are now moving into clinical testing.\n",

      "HIV/AIDS is the second cause of mortality globally and there are 5000 new infections each day. Globally, sex workers are 13 times more at risk of HIV than the general population and in Senegal they have an HIV prevalence 16.5 times greater. Therefore, it is urgent to encourage behaviour change, which requires a better understanding of the reasons why sex workers engage in risky behaviours. We provide new evidence of the role of risk preferences on sexual behaviours, health behaviours and health outcomes of 600 female sex workers in Senegal in July and August 2017. We measure risk aversion of sex workers using an incentivised Gneezy and Potters task in addition to specific risk-taking scales in four domains (in general, finance, health and sex). Understanding of the experimental task was high despite low literacy level of participants. Using ordinary least squares, we find that risk aversion is an important predictor of sex workers’ sexual behaviours. We find that sex workers with higher level of risk aversion have less sex acts with clients, have less clients at risk of HIV, are more likely to engage in protected sex acts and as a result earn less money per sex act. Furthermore, we find that sex workers exhibiting higher level of risk aversion are less likely to be infected with sexually transmitted infections. Results highlight that some associations between risk preferences and sexual and health behaviours are domain specific. To conclude, our results confirm the role of risk preferences in the spread of HIV/AIDS epidemic and suggest the importance of collecting information on self-reported risk aversion to identify individuals who are at a greater risk of HIV/AIDS. Finally, our results provide some rationale in using lottery-based financial incentives to prevent sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS among high-risk populations.\n",

      "In most HIV-infected persons, the natural history of untreated infection is one of sustained viremia, progressive CD4 T cell depletion with resultant morbidity and mortality. The advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) that controls HIV replication has altered this landscape dramatically. Yet a rare population of HIV-infected persons—elite controllers (EC)—can control HIV replication such that plasma levels of virus are “undetectable” without ART. The EC phenotype is heterogeneous, with some subjects durably controlling the virus—persistent elite controllers—and some eventually losing viral control—transient elite controllers. Overall, EC tend to have robust HIV-specific T cell responses and in some cases, mainly in transient elite controllers, elevated activation and inflammation indices that diminish with ART suggesting that endogenous defenses against this persistent pathogen come at the cost of heightened activation/inflammation. A limited data set suggests that cardiovascular disease risk as well as the occur-rence of other morbid events may be greater in the overall EC population than in treated HIV infection. ART in EC decreases activation indices but does not appear to increase circulating CD4 T cell numbers nor do we know if it alters clinical outcomes. Thus, it is difficult to recommend or discourage a decision to start ART in the EC population but the authors lean toward treatment particularly in those EC whose activation indices are high and those who are progressively losing circulating CD4 T cell numbers. Biomarkers that can reliably predict loss of virologic control and immune failure are needed.\n",

Therefore, we focus this perspective on HIV-related alterations that may drive hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in aviremic patients, with a focus on Kupffer cells and Hepatic Stellate Cells. Persistent CD4+ T cell depletion in the gut resulting in increased gut permeability has been postulated to play a role in systemic immune activation in HIV patients. The liver, with its unique location, remains the gatekeeper between the gut and the systemic circulation. The resident liver macrophage, Kupffer cell, is responsible for clearing and responding to these products.

      "The interaction of human immunodeficiency virus with human cells is responsible for all stages of the viral life cycle, from the infection of CD4+ cells to reverse transcription, integration, and the assembly of new viral particles. To date, a large amount of OMICs data as well as information from functional genomics screenings regarding the HIV–host interaction has been accumulated in the literature and in public databases. We processed databases containing HIV–host interactions and found 2910 HIV-1-human protein-protein interactions, mostly related to viral group M subtype B, 137 interactions between human and HIV-1 coding and non-coding RNAs, essential for viral lifecycle and cell defense mechanisms, 232 transcriptomics, 27 proteomics, and 34 epigenomics HIV-related experiments. Numerous studies regarding network-based analysis of corresponding OMICs data have been published in recent years. We overview various types of molecular networks, which can be created using OMICs data, including HIV–human protein–protein interaction networks, co-expression networks, gene regulatory and signaling networks, and approaches for the analysis of their topology and dynamics. The network-based analysis can be used to determine the critical pathways and key proteins involved in the HIV life cycle, cellular and immune responses to infection, viral escape from host defense mechanisms, and mechanisms mediating different susceptibility of humans to infection. The proteins and pathways identified in these studies represent a basis for developing new anti-HIV therapeutic strategies such as new drugs preventing infection of CD4+ cells and viral replication, effective vaccines, “shock and kill” and “block and lock” approaches to cure latent infection.\n",

      "This study explored factors associated with interest in taking PrEP among men who have sex with men (MSM) attending HIV testing venues in Sweden. Data from 658 HIV-negative respondents, surveyed by a questionnaire at six sites, were analyzed descriptively and by univariable and multivariable logistic regression. A total of 453 (68.8%) of the respondents expressed interest in taking PrEP. Reporting self-perceived risk of HIV acquisition as moderate or high, reporting ≥ 5 partners for condomless anal intercourse during the past year, and reporting hard drug use during the past year were independently associated with interest in taking PrEP. However, an aggregated variable of self-reported rectal gonorrhea, rectal chlamydia, or syphilis infection during the past year was not associated with interest in taking PrEP. Overall, Swedish MSM were well-informed regarding PrEP, and interest in taking PrEP was positively associated with sexual risk indicators.\n",

      "High risk human Papillomavirus (HPV) infections ultimately cause cervical cancer. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected women often present with multiple high-risk HPV infections and are thus at a higher risk of developing cervical cancer. However, information on the circulating high-risk HPV genotypes in Kenya in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women is still scanty. This study is aimed at determining the phylogeny and the HPV genotypes in women with respect to their HIV status and at correlating this with cytology results. This study was carried out among women attending the Reproductive Health Clinic at Kenyatta National Hospital, a referral hospital in Nairobi, Kenya. A cross-sectional study recruited a total of 217 women aged 18 to 50 years. Paired blood and cervical samples were obtained from consenting participants. Blood was used for serological HIV screening while cervical smears were used for cytology followed by HPV DNA extraction, HPV DNA PCR amplification, and phylogenetic analysis. Out of 217 participants, 29 (13.4%) were HIV seropositive, while 68 (31.3%) were positive for HPV DNA. Eight (3.7%) of the participants had abnormal cervical cytology. High-risk HPV 16 was the most prevalent followed by HPV 81, 73, 35, and 52. One participant had cervical cancer, was HIV infected, and had multiple high-risk infections with HPV 26, 35, and 58. HPV 16, 6, and 81 had two variants each. HPV 16 in this study clustered with HPV from Iran and Africa. This study shows the circulation of other HPV 35, 52, 73, 81, 31, 51, 45, 58, and 26 in the Kenyan population that play important roles in cancer etiology but are not included in the HPV vaccine. Data from this study could inform vaccination strategies. Additionally, this data will be useful in future epidemiological studies of HPV in Nairobi as the introduction or development of new variants can be detected.\n",

The class 2 type VI CRISPR-Cas effector Cas13a targets and cleaves RNA, providing protection against RNA phages. Here we report the repurposing of CRISPR-Cas13a to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection through targeting HIV-1 RNA and diminishing viral gene expression. We observed strong inhibition of HIV-1 infection by CRISPR-Cas13a in human cells. We showed that CRISPR-Cas13a not only diminishes the level of newly synthesized viral RNA, either from the transfected plasmid DNA or from the viral DNA, which is integrated into cellular DNA, but it also targets and destroys the viral RNA that enters cells within viral capsid, leading to strong inhibition of HIV-1 infection. Together, our results suggest that CRISPR-Cas13a provides a potential novel tool to treat viral diseases in humans.\n",

      "Assisted HIV partner notification services provide a safe and effective way for people living with HIV (PLHIV) to inform their partners about the possibility of exposure and to offer them testing, treatment, and support. This study examined whether or not PLHIV in prison might be willing to participate in assisted HIV partner notification services and their reasons for and against disclosing their HIV-positive status to their partners. PLHIV (n = 150) recruited from Jakarta’s two largest all-male prisons completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire collecting demographic and risk behavior data, and attitudes toward HIV disclosure and partner services. Among those who were sexually active and/or injecting drugs before incarceration, two-thirds (66.4%, 91/137) endorsed provider referral as an acceptable way to notify their sex partners, and nearly three quarters (72.4%, 89/123) endorsed provider referral to notify their drug-injecting partners. Only a quarter (25.1%) of participants reported that their main sex partner had ever received an HIV test. Participants with anticipated stigma were less likely to endorse provider referral for sex partners (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.96) and drug-injecting partners (aOR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.29, 1.00). Relationship closeness was associated with higher odds of endorsing provider referral for drug-injecting partners (aOR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.25, 3.45). Protecting partners from infection and a moral duty to inform were main reasons to disclose, while stigma and privacy concerns were main reasons not to disclose.

      "Glutamate (Glu) is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS). HIV-1 and viral proteins compromise glutamate synaptic transmission, resulting in poor cell-to-cell signaling and bystander toxicity. In this study, we identified that myeloid HIV-1-brain reservoirs survive in Glu and glutamine (Gln) as a major source of energy. Thus, we found a link between synaptic compromise, metabolomics of viral reservoirs, and viral persistence. In the current manuscript we will discuss all these interactions and the potential to achieve eradication and cure using this unique metabolic profile.\n",

      "Even with antiretroviral therapy, children born to HIV-infected (HI) mothers are at a higher risk of early-life infections and morbidities including dental disease. The increased risk of dental caries in HI children suggest immune-mediated changes in oral bacterial communities, however, the impact of perinatal HIV exposure on the oral microbiota remains unclear. We hypothesized that the oral microbiota of HI and perinatally HIV-exposed-but-uninfected (HEU) children will significantly differ from HIV-unexposed-and-uninfected (HUU) children. Saliva samples from 286 child-participants in Nigeria, aged ≤ 6 years, were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Perinatal HIV infection was significantly associated with community composition (HI vs. HUU—p = 0.04; HEU vs. HUU—p = 0.11) however, immune status had stronger impacts on bacterial profiles (p < 0.001). We observed age-stratified associations of perinatal HIV exposure on community composition, with HEU children differing from HUU children in early life but HEU children becoming more similar to HUU children with age. Our findings suggest that, regardless of age, HIV infection or exposure, low CD4 levels persistently alter the oral microbiota during this critical developmental period. Data also indicates that, while HIV infection clearly shapes the developing infant oral microbiome, the effect of perinatal exposure (without infection) appears transient.\n",

      "This report aims to enhance the understanding of early longitudinal neuroimaging features of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Neuroimaging has become crucial in the diagnosis and early recognition of PML. Recognition of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features in the early stages of PML is paramount to avoid misdiagnosis and facilitate the delivery of treatments aimed at reducing disease progression. A 49-year-old white man with HIV presented with 4-month progressive left-sided weakness. Neurological examination revealed mild cognitive impairment, left-sided hemiparesis, and somatosense impairment to all modalities. Brain MRI revealed a punctate pattern with innumerable T2-FLAIR (fluid attenuated inversion recovery) hyperintensities in the cortex, brainstem, cerebellum, subcortical, and periventricular areas. Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) revealed hypointensities involving subcortical U-fibers and cortical architecture. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation was inconclusive. John Cunningham virus (JCV) PCR in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was indeterminate. He was started on antiretroviral therapy. Repeat brain MRI performed 1.5 months later, in the setting of further neurological decline, demonstrated progression of the T2-hyperintensities into a large confluent white matter lesion in the right frontoparietal lobe. Despite an indeterminate JCV PCR, the appearance and characteristic progression of the lesions in successive imaging in the setting of severe immunosuppression, with extensive negative infectious workup, was indicative of PML. This clinical experience illustrates unique neuroimaging features of HIV-PML in early stages and its progression over time.

      "Immune activation is the hallmark of HIV infection and plays a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. In the context of suppressed HIV RNA replication by combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), there remains immune activation which is associated to the HIV reservoirs. Persistent virus contributes to a sustained inflammatory environment promoting accumulation of “activated/exhausted” T cells with diminished effector function. These T cells show increased expression of immunomodulatory receptors including Programmed cell death protein (PD1), Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Associated Protein 4 (CTLA4), Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3), T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT), T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing 3 (TIM3) among others. More importantly, recent reports had demonstrated that, HIV infected T cells express checkpoint receptors, contributing to their survival and promoting maintenance of the viral reservoir. Therapeutic strategies are focused on viral reservoir elimination and/or those to achieve sustained cART-free virologic remission. In this review, we will discuss the immunological basis and the latest advances of the use of checkpoint inhibitors to treat HIV infection.\n",

      "The main role of the human immune system is to eliminate cells presenting foreign antigens and abnormal patterns, while maintaining self-tolerance. However, when facing highly variable pathogens or antigens very similar to self-antigens, this system can fail in completely eliminating the anomalies, leading to the establishment of chronic pathologies. Prototypical examples of immune system defeat are cancer and Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. In both conditions, the immune system is persistently exposed to antigens leading to systemic inflammation, lack of generation of long-term memory and exhaustion of effector cells. This triggers a negative feedback loop where effector cells are unable to resolve the pathology and cannot be replaced due to the lack of a pool of undifferentiated, self-renewing memory T cells. In addition, in an attempt to reduce tissue damage due to chronic inflammation, antigen presenting cells and myeloid components of the immune system activate systemic regulatory and tolerogenic programs. Beside these homologies shared between cancer and HIV-1 infection, the immune system can be shaped differently depending on the type and distribution of the eliciting antigens with ultimate consequences at the phenotypic and functional level of immune exhaustion. T cell differentiation, functionality, cytotoxic potential and proliferation reserve, immune-cell polarization, upregulation of negative regulators (immune checkpoint molecules) are indeed directly linked to the quantitative and qualitative differences in priming and recalling conditions. Better understanding of distinct mechanisms and functional consequences underlying disease-specific immune cell dysfunction will contribute to further improve and personalize immunotherapy. In the present review, we describe relevant players of immune cell exhaustion in cancer and HIV-1 infection, and enumerate the best-defined hallmarks of T cell dysfunction. Moreover, we highlight shared and divergent aspects of T cell exhaustion and T cell activation to the best of current knowledge.\n",

The outcome variable was comprehensive knowledge about HIV, defined as the ability to correctly answer three knowledge questions and to reject the three most common misconceptions about HIV prevention. We found that comprehensive knowledge about HIV increased from 26.1% in 2000 to 44.1% in 2011, but it decreased slightly between 2011 and 2014, from 44.1% to 42.4%. Increased comprehensive knowledge about HIV was associated with women who had higher education and those in the fourth and fifth quintiles of household wealth in all four rounds of the MICS. Comprehensive knowledge about HIV among women was also associated with those who had ever been tested for HIV and those with knowledge of where to be tested for HIV. Women in the urban areas were more likely to have higher levels of comprehensive knowledge about HIV as compared to the women in the rural areas in 2000, 2006, and 2011 but not in 2014.

      "Integration of tuberculosis and HIV services in many resource-limited settings, including Ghana, has been far from optimal despite the existence of policy frameworks for integration. A previous study among programme managers and other stakeholders at the national level has documented tardiness in committing to the integration of services. In this paper, we aimed at unravelling pertinent challenges that confront TB-HIV integrated service delivery. Data were obtained from interviews with 31 individual health care providers operating under different models of TB-HIV service delivery. The study is framed around the Complexity Theory. We applied inductive and deductive techniques to code the data and validations were done through inter-rater mechanisms. The analysis was done with the assistance of QSR NVivo version 12. We found evidence of a convivial working relationship between TB-HIV service providers at the facility level. However, the interactions vary across models of care–the lesser the level of integration, the lesser the complexities for interactions that ensued. This had resulted in operational challenges on account of how the two-disease environment interacts with the other components of the health system. These challenges included; weak/inappropriate infrastructure, frail coordination between the two programmes and hospital administrators, under-staffing in comprehensive TB–HIV management, use of community facility under the Directly-Observed Treatment (DOT) protocols, and financial constraints. To fully appropriate the enormous benefits of TB-HIV service integration, there is a need to address these challenges.\n",

      "A significant number of people living with HIV (PLWH) develop HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) despite highly effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Dysregulated macroautophagy (autophagy) is implicated in HAND pathogenesis. The viral protein Nef, expressed even with suppressive ART, and certain antiretrovirals affect autophagy in non-CNS cells. Astrocytes, vital for CNS microenvironment homeostasis and neuronal health, require autophagy for their own homeostasis. We hypothesized that extracellular Nef and/or ART impact astrocyte autophagy, thus contributing to HAND. We studied in-bulk and selective autophagic flux in primary human astrocytes treated with extracellular Nef and/or a combination of tenofovir+emtricitabine+raltegravir (ART) using Western blotting, a tandem fluorescent LC3 reporter, and transmission electron microscopy/morphometry. We show that after 24 h treatment, Nef and ART decrease autophagosomes through different mechanisms. While Nef accelerates autophagosome degradation without inducing autophagosome formation, ART inhibits autophagosome formation. Combination Nef+ART further depletes autophagosomes by inducing both abnormalities. Additionally, extracellular Nef and/or ART inhibit lysosomal degradation of p62, indicating Nef and/or ART affect in-bulk and selective autophagy differently. Dysregulation of both autophagic processes is maintained after 7 days of Nef and/or ART treatment. Persistent autophagy dysregulation due to chronic Nef and/or ART exposure may ultimately result in astrocyte and neuronal dysfunction, contributing to HAND.\n",

      "Studies have shown that blockade of CTLA-4 promoted the expansion of germinal center B-cells in viral infection or immunization with model antigens. Few studies have evaluated the immunological consequences of CTLA-4 blockade during immunization against relevant vaccine candidates. Here, we investigated the effects of CTLA-4 blockade on HIV virus-like particles (VLPs) vaccination in a C57BL/6J mouse model. We found that CTLA-4 blockade during HIV VLP immunization resulted in increased CD4+ T-cell activation, promoted the expansion of HIV envelope (Env)-specific follicular helper T cell (Tfh) cells, and significantly increased HIV Gag- and Env-specific IgG with higher avidity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) capabilities. Furthermore, after only a single immunization, CTLA-4 blockade accelerated T-cell dependent IgG class switching and the induction of significantly high serum levels of the B-cell survival factor, A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL). Although no significant increase in neutralizing antibodies was observed, increased levels of class-switched Env- and Gag-specific IgG are indicative of increased polyclonal B-cell activation, which demonstrated the ability to mediate and enhance ADCC in this study. Altogether, our findings show that CTLA-4 blockade can increase the levels of HIV antigen-specific B-cell and antigen-specific Tfh cell activity and impact humoral immune responses when combined with a clinically relevant HIV VLP-based vaccine.\n",

      "HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are the spectrum of cognitive impairments present in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The number of patients affected with HAND ranges from 30 to 50% of HIV infected individuals and although the development of combinational antiretroviral therapy (cART) has improved longevity, HAND continues to pose a significant clinical problem as the current standard of care does not alleviate or prevent HAND symptoms. At present, the pathological mechanisms contributing to HAND remain unclear, but evidence suggests that it stems from neuronal injury due to chronic release of neurotoxins, chemokines, viral proteins, and proinflammatory cytokines secreted by HIV-1 activated microglia, macrophages and astrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, the blood–brain barrier (BBB) not only serves as a route for HIV-1 entry into the brain but also prevents cART therapy from reaching HIV-1 brain reservoirs, and therefore could play an important role in HAND. The goal of this review is to discuss the current data on the epidemiology, pathology and research models of HAND as well as address the potential pharmacological treatment approaches that are being investigated.\n",

      "HIV drug resistance is a major global challenge to successful and sustainable antiretroviral therapy. Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) assays enable more sensitive and quantitative detection of drug-resistance-associated mutations (DRMs) and outperform Sanger sequencing approaches in detecting lower abundance resistance mutations. While NGS is likely to become the new standard for routine HIVDR testing, many technical and knowledge gaps remain to be resolved before its generalized adoption in regular clinical care, public health, and research. Recognizing this, we conceived and launched an international symposium series on NGS HIVDR, to bring together leading experts in the field to address these issues through in-depth discussions and brainstorming.

      "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play an important role in intercellular communication. They are naturally released from cells into the extracellular environment. Based on their biogenesis, release pathways, size, content, and function, EVs are classified into exosomes, microvesicles (MVs), and apoptotic bodies (ApoBDs). Previous research has documented that EVs, specifically exosomes and MVs, play an important role in HIV infection, either by promoting HIV infection and pathogenesis or by inhibiting HIV-1 to a certain extent. We have also previously reported that EVs (particularly exosomes) from vaginal fluids inhibit HIV at the post-entry step (i.e., reverse transcription, integration). Besides the role that EVs play in HIV, they are also known to regulate the process of wound healing by regulating both the immune and inflammatory responses. It is noted that during the advanced stages of HIV infection, patients are at greater risk of wound-healing and wound-related complications. Despite ongoing research, the data on the actual effects of EVs in HIV infection and wound healing are still premature. This review aimed to update the current knowledge about the roles of EVs in regulating HIV pathogenesis and wound healing. Additionally, we highlighted several avenues of EV involvement in the process of wound healing, including coagulation, inflammation, proliferation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Understanding the role of EVs in HIV infection and wound healing could significantly contribute to the development of new and potent antiviral therapeutic strategies and approaches to resolve impaired wounds in HIV patients. \n",

      "Death domain-associated protein 6 (Daxx) is a multifunctional, ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved chaperone protein involved in numerous cellular processes, including apoptosis, transcriptional repression, and carcinogenesis. In 2015, we identified Daxx as an antiretroviral factor that interfered with HIV-1 replication by inhibiting the reverse transcription step. In the present study, we sought to unravel the molecular mechanism of Daxx-mediated restriction and, in particular, to identify the protein(s) that Daxx targets in order to achieve its antiviral activity. First, we show that the SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) located at the C-terminus of the protein is strictly required for Daxx to inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcription. By performing a quantitative proteomic screen combined with classical biochemical analyses, we found that Daxx associated with incoming HIV-1 cores through a SIM-dependent interaction with cyclophilin A (CypA) and capsid (CA). Daxx was found to reside within a multiprotein complex associated with viral capsids, also containing TNPO3, TRIM5α, and TRIM34. Given the well-known influence of these cellular factors on the stability of HIV-1 cores, we investigated the effect of Daxx on the cytoplasmic fate of incoming cores and found that Daxx prevented HIV-1 uncoating in a SIM-dependent manner. Altogether, our findings suggest that, by recruiting TNPO3, TRIM5α, and TRIM34 and possibly other proteins onto incoming HIV-1 cores through a SIM-dependent interaction with CA-bound CypA, Daxx increases their stability, thus preventing uncoating and reverse transcription. Our study uncovers a previously unknown function of Daxx in the early steps of HIV-1 infection and further illustrates how reverse transcription and uncoating are two tightly interdependent processes.\n",

      "Minnesota has seen an increase in the number of immigrants from Africa, notably in the mid-1990s, making up around 2% of Minnesota’s total population. This population also faces many impediments that cause important difficulties not only for HIV prevention but also for treatment and care options. The objectives of this study were to capture the experiences of Persons Living with HIV (PLWH) in Minnesota (US) and to elicit their stories about their diagnosis news and what management strategies they use for coping with the stigma associated with the disease. Participants were recruited via fliers in pharmacies, clinics, and HIV service centers located in Minnesota. Recruitment continued until thematic saturation was obtained. Fourteen subjects participated in audio-recorded, semi-structured interviews that were transcribed verbatim into written text. The transcriptions were analyzed using Thematic Analysis. Three themes emerged from the data. Theme 1: Cruel News: “HIV-Oooooo! I wish I was dead”, Theme 2: This is My Secret! and Theme 3: “Stigma and HIV are brother and sister”. The results demonstrate that stigma is an ever-present problem in African-born PLWH living in the US. Participants perceived the stigma associated with HIV status to affect their lives and culture at individual, familial, and societal levels.\n",

      "The epidemic of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) is in its second decade, but the routes of transmission remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that by pairing single genome sequencing (SGS), to enumerate infecting HCV genomes (viruses), with detailed sexual and drug histories, we could gain insight into the routes of transmission among MSM. We used SGS to analyze blood specimens from eight HIV-infected MSM who had 10 episodes of acute (seronegative) or early HCV infections. Seven of eight men reported condomless receptive anal intercourse (CRAI), six with rectal exposure to semen, and all eight denied rectal trauma or bleeding. Of the 10 HCV infections, eight resulted from transmission of a single virus; one infection resulted from transmission of either one or a few (three or four) closely-related viruses; and one infection resulted from transmission of >10 distinct viruses. The participant infected by >10 viruses reported sharing injection equipment for methamphetamine during sex. Two other participants also injected methamphetamine during sex but they did not share injection equipment and were infected by a single virus. Conclusions: Most HCV infections of HIV-infected MSM without a history of either rectal trauma or bleeding or shared injection equipment were caused by a single virus. Intra-rectal exposure to semen during CRAI is therefore likely sufficient for HCV transmission among MSM. Conversely, rectal trauma or bleeding or shared injection equipment are not necessary for HCV transmission among MSM. These results help clarify routes of HCV transmission among MSM and can therefore help guide the design of much-needed behavioral and other interventions to prevent HCV transmission among MSM.\n",

Participants responded to the HIV-AS test and a set of scales used to assess external validity. Content validity analyses reflected good adequacy indices for the items. Exploratory factor analyses revealed a four-factor structure and reliability indices were satisfactory. The structural equation model showed good levels of fit. Most of the items presented a discrimination index above 0.30 and contributed to the reliability of the scale, except for item 9, which was eliminated. Concurrent validity showed significant correlations among the HIV-AS and other similar constructs.

      "The HIV epidemic has dramatically changed over the past 30 years; there are now fewer newly infected people (especially children), fewer AIDS-related deaths, and more people with HIV (PWH) receiving treatment. However, the HIV epidemic is far from over. Despite the tremendous advances in anti-retroviral therapies (ART) and the implementation of ART regimens, HIV incidence (number of new infections over a defined period of time) and prevalence (the burden of HIV infection) in certain regions of the world and socio-economic groups are still on the rise. HIV continues to disproportionally affect highly marginalized populations that constitute higher-risk and stigmatized groups, underserved and/or neglected populations. In addition, it is not uncommon for PWH to suffer enhanced debilitating conditions resulting from the synergistic interactions of both communicable diseases (CDs) and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). While research utilizing only a comorbidities framework has advanced our understanding of the biological settings of the co-occurring conditions from a molecular and mechanistic view, harmful interactions between comorbidities are often overlooked, particularly under adverse socio-economical and behavioral circumstances, likely prompting disease clustering in PWH. Synergistic epidemics (syndemics) research aims to capture these understudied interactions: the mainly non-biological aspects that are central to interpret disease clustering in the comorbidities/multi-morbidities only framework. Connecting population-level clustering of social and health problems through syndemic interventions has proved to be a critical knowledge gap that will need to be addressed in order to improve prevention and care strategies and bring us a step closer to ending the HIV epidemic.\n",

Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) has proven an effective strategy to end paediatric infections and ensure HIV-infected mothers access treatment. Based on cross-sectional data collected from June 2008 to May 2013, we assessed changes in HIV prevalence, risk factors for HIV, provision of PMTCT antiretroviral treatment (ART), and the association between HIV infection, birth outcomes and maternal characteristics at the Simão Mendes National Hospital, Guinea-Bissau’s largest maternity ward. Among 24,107 women, the HIV prevalence was 3.3% for HIV-1, 0.8% for HIV-2 and 0.9% for HIV-1/2. A significant decline in HIV-1, HIV-2, and HIV-1/2 prevalence was observed over time. HIV infection was associated with age and ethnicity. A total of 85% of HIV-infected women received ART as part of PMTCT, yet overall treatment coverage during labour and delivery declined significantly for both mothers and infants. Twenty-two percent of infants did not receive treatment, and 67% of HIV-2-infected mothers and 77% of their infants received ineffective non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors for PMTCT. Maternal HIV was associated with low birth weight but not stillbirth. Inadequate continuity of care and ART coverage present challenges to optimal PMTCT in Guinea-Bissau.\n",

The health and social consequences of the pandemic may exacerbate substance misuse and poor management of HIV among this population. This study compares substance use and HIV care before and during the pandemic using data collected weekly through an opioid relapse prevention and HIV management mobile-health intervention. We found that during the pandemic, PLWH and SUD have increased illicit substance use and contact with other substance-using individuals and decreased their confidence to stay sober and attend recovery meetings. The proportion of people missing their HIV medications also increased, and confidence to attend HIV follow-up appointments decreased. Optimal support for PLWH and SUD is critical during pandemics like COVID-19, as drug-related and HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) non-adherence risks such as overdose, unsafe sexual behaviors, and transmission of infectious diseases may unfold.\n",

      "HIV-1 infection induces B cell defects, not fully recovered upon antiretroviral therapy (ART). Acute infection and the early start of ART provide unique settings to address the impact of HIV on the B cell compartment. We took advantage of a cohort of 21 seroconverters, grouped according to the presence of severe manifestations likely mediated by antibodies or immune complexes, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, with a follow-up of 8 weeks upon effective ART. We combined B and T cell phenotyping with serum immunoglobulin level measurement and quantification of sj-KRECs and ΔB to estimate bone marrow output and peripheral proliferative history of B cells, respectively. We observed marked B cell disturbances, notably a significant expansion of cells expressing low levels of CD21, in parallel with markers of both impaired bone marrow output and increased peripheral B cell proliferation. This B cell dysregulation is likely to contribute to the severe immune-mediated conditions, as attested by the higher serum IgG and the reduced levels of sj-KRECs with increased ΔB in these individuals as compared to those patients with mild disease. Nevertheless, upon starting ART, the dynamic of B cell recovery was not distinct in the two groups, featuring both persistent alterations by week 8. Overall, we showed for the first time that acute HIV-1 infection is associated with decreased bone marrow B cell output assessed by sj-KRECs. Our study emphasizes the need to intervene in both bone marrow and peripheral responses to facilitate B cell recovery during acute HIV-1 infection.\n",

      "Understanding affinity maturation of antibodies that can target many variants of HIV-1 is important for vaccine development. While the antigen-binding site of antibodies is known to mutate throughout the co-evolution of antibodies and viruses in infected individuals, the roles of the mutations in the antibody framework region are not well understood. Throughout affinity maturation, the CH103 broadly neutralizing antibody lineage, from an individual designated CH505, altered the orientation of one of its antibody variable domains. The change in orientation was a response to insertions in the variable loop 5 (V5) of the HIV envelope. In this study, we generated CH103 lineage antibody variants in which residues in the variable domain interface were mutated, and measured the binding to both autologous and heterologous HIV-1 envelopes. Our data show that very few mutations in an early intermediate antibody of the lineage can improve binding toward both autologous and heterologous HIV-1 envelopes. We also crystallized an antibody mutant to show that framework mutations alone can result in a shift in relative orientations of the variable domains. Taken together, our results demonstrate the functional importance of residues located outside the antigen-binding site in affinity maturation.\n",

One of the common HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy presents with advanced immunosuppression in patients and is frequently associated with dementia. However, most cases are subclinical with characteristic findings identified through physical examination and/or imaging modalities. HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy is characterized by progressive spastic paraparesis, gait disturbance and lower extremity sensory abnormalities including vibratory sensation. Magnetic resonance imaging findings in the spinal cord are abnormal in some patients with HIV-associated myelopathy, characteristically showing spinal cord atrophy at the level of the thoracic spine, but they may also be normal. Unfamiliarity with this as initial presentation of HIV infection may lead to failure to diagnose and intervene appropriately.

      "Human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV)-infected macrophages (HIV-Mφ) are a reservoir for latent HIV infection and a barrier to HIV eradication. In contrast to CD4+ T cells, HIV-Mφ are resistant to the cytopathic effects of acute HIV infection and have increased expression of cell survival factors, including X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), baculoviral IAP repeat containing (BIRC) 2/cIAP1, beclin-1, BCL2, BCL-xl, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1, mitofusin (MFN) 1, and MFN2. DIABLO/SMAC mimetics are therapeutic agents that affect cancer cell survival and induce cell death. We found that DIABLO/SMAC mimetics (LCL-161, AT-406 (also known as SM-406 or Debio 1143), and birinapant) selectively kill HIV-Mφ without increasing bystander cell death. DIABLO/SMAC mimetic treatment of HIV-Mφ-induced XIAP and BIRC2 degradation, leading to the induction of autophagy and the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex on phagophore membranes that includes both pro-apoptotic or necroptotic (FADD, receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) 1, RIPK3, caspase 8, and MLKL) and autophagy (ATG5, ATG7, and SQSTM1) proteins. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of early stages of autophagy, but not late stages of autophagy, ablated this interaction and inhibited apoptosis. Furthermore, DIABLO/SMAC mimetic-mediated apoptosis of HIV-Mφ is dependent upon tumor necrosis factor signaling. Our findings thus demonstrate that DIABLO/SMAC mimetics selectively induce autophagy-dependent apoptosis in HIV-Mφ.\n",

We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, preprint databases, and Google Scholar from December 01, 2019, to June 1, 2020. From an initial 547 publications and 75 reports, 25 studies provided specific information on COVID-19 patients living with HIV. Studies described 252 patients, 80.9% were male, the mean age was 52.7 years, and 98% were on antiretroviral treatment (ART). Co-morbidities in addition to HIV and COVID-19 (multimorbidity) included hypertension (39.3%), obesity or hyperlipidemia (19.3%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (18.0%), and diabetes (17.2%). Two-thirds (66.5%) had mild to moderate symptoms, the most common being fever (74.0%) and cough (58.3%).

The process of viral fusion appears to be fast compared with viral egress and has not been visualized by EM. To capture fusion events, the process must be curtailed by trapping Env-receptor binding at an intermediate stage. We have used fusion inhibitors to trap HIV-1 virions attached to target cells by Envs in an extended pre-hairpin intermediate state. Electron tomography revealed HIV-1 virions bound to TZM-bl cells by 2–4 narrow spokes, with slightly more spokes present when evaluated with mutant virions that lacked the Env cytoplasmic tail.

In a two-arm randomized controlled trial we evaluated a short intervention that went a step beyond IPV screening to discuss violence and power with women receiving HIV testing services during antenatal care (ANC). The intervention included training and support for HIV counselors, a take-home card for clients, and an on-site IPV counselor. One third (35%) of women (N = 688) reported experiencing IPV in the past year; 6% were living with HIV. Among women experiencing IPV, program participants were more likely to disclose violence to their counselor than women receiving standard care (32% vs. 7%, p < 0.001). At second ANC visit, intervention group women were significantly more likely to report that talking with their counselor made a positive difference (aOR 2.9; 95% CI 1.8, 4.4; p < 0.001) and felt more confident in how they deserved to be treated (aOR 2.7; 95% CI 1.7, 4.4; p < 0.001).

We show that the HIV-1 leader, which contains the RNA elements necessary for genome packaging, binds approximately two dozen copies of the cognate NC protein with affinities ranging from ∼40 nM to 1.4 µM. Binding to the four highest-affinity “initial” binding sites occurs with endothermic energetics attributed to NC-induced localized RNA melting. Mutations that stabilize these sites inhibit NC binding in vitro and RNA packaging in transfected cells.

Evidence abounds that effector functions are important in controlling infections by influenza, Ebola, or HIV-1 in animal models. However, the relative contribution of virus neutralization versus effector functions to the overall antiviral activity of an antibody remains unknown. To address this fundamental question in immunology, we utilized our knowledge of HIV-1 dynamics to compare the kinetics of the viral load decline (ΔVL) in infected animals given a wild-type (WT) anti–HIV-1 immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) versus those given a Fc-Null variant of the same antibody. In three independent experiments in HIV-1–infected humanized mice and one pivotal experiment in simian–human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-infected rhesus macaques, an earlier and sharper decline in viral load was consistently detected for the WT antibody. Quantifications of the observed differences indicate that Fc-mediated effector functions accounted for 25–45% of the total antiviral activity in these separate experiments.

A possible involvement of Per2 modulation on hematopoietic failure during HIV infection has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to analyze whether Per2 is differently expressed and regulated on HPC during HIV infection, possibly providing a therapeutic target to restore lymphoid potential in the HPC compartment. To this purpose, Per2 expression in circulating HPC was compared in 69 chronic HIV infected patients under successful ART and in matched 30 uninfected healthy donors (HD).

      "This paper assesses the possibility of using debt relief funds to sustain HIV treatment in sub-Saharan Africa, suppress transmission, and reach global goals to quell the epidemic by 2030. The cost of providing antiretroviral treatment is a huge burden on African countries. Concerns for Africa’s capacity to keep pace with global advances are well founded. By analysing levels of ‘debt distress’, health expenditure per capita, and HIV antiretroviral therapy requirements in sub-Saharan African countries, the need for innovative finance with international cooperation emerges clearly. In addition to the HIV epidemic, African countries may become more vulnerable to disasters and other public health diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, Ebola and COVID-19, especially without alternatives to current means of financing. Relief from debt service payments could release funds for sub-Saharan African countries to support universal HIV antiretroviral treatment with sustainable results.\n",

One-third of PLHIV with salient treatment-related concerns were uncomfortable discussing with providers. Of participants who felt that their HIV medication limited their life but did not discuss their concerns with their provider (n = 203), top reasons for not discussing were: perception nothing could be done (49.3% [100/203]), provider never brought up the issue (37.9% [77/203]), and not wanting to appear difficult (30.5% [62/203]).

      "Efficacious HIV-1 vaccination requires elicitation of long-lived antibody responses. However, our understanding of how different vaccine types elicit durable antibody responses is lacking. To assess the impact of vaccine type on antibody responses, we measured IgG isotypes against four consensus HIV antigens from 2 weeks to 10 years post HIV-1 vaccination and used mixed effects models to estimate half-life of responses in four human clinical trials. Compared to protein-boosted regimens, half-lives of gp120-specific antibodies were longer but peak magnitudes were lower in Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA)-boosted regimens. Furthermore, gp120-specific B cell transcriptomics from MVA-boosted and protein-boosted vaccines revealed a distinct signature at a peak (2 weeks after last vaccination) including CD19, CD40, and FCRL2-5 activation along with increased B cell receptor signaling. Additional analysis revealed contributions of RIG-I-like receptor pathway and genes such as SMAD5 and IL-32 to antibody durability. Thus, this study provides novel insights into vaccine induced antibody durability and B-cell receptor signaling.\n",

But the underlying mechanisms of these inhibitions are unknown. Here we show that PSGL-1 directly binds to cellular actin filaments (F-actin) to restrict actin dynamics, which leads to inhibition of HIV DNA synthesis. PSGL-1 is incorporated into nascent virions and restricts actin dynamics in the virions, which partially accounts for the inhibition of virion infectivity. More potently, PSGL-1 inhibits incorporation of Env proteins into nascent virions, causing a loss of envelope spikes on the virions as shown by Cryo-electron microscopy and super-resolution imaging. This loss is associated with a profound defect in viral entry. Mechanistically, PSGL-1 binds gp41 and sequesters gp41 at the plasma membrane, explaining the inhibition of Env incorporation in nascent virions.

Although the adaptive immune responses have been extensively studied in leprosy–HIV co-infected individuals, recent studies have described that innate immune cells may drive the overall immune responses to mycobacterial antigens. Monocytes are critical to the innate immune system and play an important role in several inflammatory conditions associated with chronic infections. In leprosy, different tissue macrophage phenotypes have been associated with the different clinical forms of the disease, but it is not clear how HIV infection modulates the phenotype of innate immune cells (monocytes or macrophages) during leprosy. In the present study, we investigated the phenotype of monocytes and macrophages in leprosy–HIV co-infected individuals, with or without RR. We did not observe differences between the monocyte profiles in the studied groups; however, analysis of gene expression within the skin lesion cells revealed that the RR/HIV group presents a higher expression of macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MRS1), CD209 molecule (CD209), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), arginase 2 (ARG2), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) when compared with the RR group. Our data suggest that different phenotypes of tissue macrophages found in the skin from RR and RR/HIV patients could differentially contribute to the progression of leprosy.\n",

      "Multiple myeloma is a biologically diverse, malignant disease that involve plasma cells. Multiple myeloma is characterized by the unrestrained proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells within the bone marrow. In the present case report, the case of a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patient with an initial manifestation of extramedullary myeloma involving the parotid gland is described. The patient had been on antiretrovirals for the last two years. A Medline, Embase, Scopus and Google Scholar search was performed using the key words: ‘Parotid extramedullary myeloma AND HIV’ as part of the literature review. A 46-year-old female presented to our hospital with a 6-month history of a painful mass on the left side of the face, involving the parotid area, with rapid growth in the preceding month. There was associated fever, body pains and difficulty opening the mouth. This resulted in difficulty in mastication and she also reported pain on swallowing. She did not notice any weakness of her face on the left side. She had no complaints regarding her eyes, such as visual disturbances, eye pain, or an inability to close the eye on the affected side. The patient was diagnosed with HIV infection 2 years prior, and had been on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) since the diagnosis. There is no consensus regarding a treatment protocol for HIV positive patients on HAART and multiple myeloma. However, based on the clinical case report and a review of the relevant literature, the treatment should include high doses of a combination of chemotherapeutic agents. Although multiple myeloma is considered incurable, all patients should be started on treatment with the goal of preventing further complications.\n",

      "The pandemic caused by SARS‐Cov‐2 has led to the elaboration of multiple studies to increase knowledge and understanding, hence, having the ability to accomplish an adequate and timely diagnosis and give an optimal treatment according to the patient's condition. The clinical manifestations of COVID‐19 pose a series of challenges both in understanding and delimiting the disease secondary to the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. This is due to the fact that the main axis of this disease is the endothelial compromise and the production of a \"cytokine storm\", triggering multiple organ failure and death. Given that a complete understanding of its pathophysiology and clinical behavior has not yet been achieved, we wondered if co‐infection with other respiratory viruses modifies its performance and outcomes described so far. A literature search was performed, obtaining 68 articles, of which 25 were analyzed. The analysis showed us that there is a high variety both in the types of associated infections and in the clinical behavior of patients and their outcomes. Therefore, we consider that the search for other infections should be performed exhaustively, especially in those cases that may be susceptible to treatment such as Influenza A, HIV, or bacterial infections. As well as optimize the analysis of these cases and establish if there are characteristics that allow establishing the possibility of carrying an additional infection to that of SARSCoV2 and the implications for the management and prognosis of the patient.\n",

      "Following immunization, high-affinity antibody responses develop within germinal centers (GCs), specialized sites within follicles of the lymph node (LN) where B cells proliferate and undergo somatic hypermutation. Antigen availability within GCs is important, as B cells must acquire and present antigen to follicular helper T cells to drive this process. However, recombinant protein immunogens such as soluble human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope (Env) trimers do not efficiently accumulate in follicles following traditional immunization. Here, we demonstrate two strategies to concentrate HIV Env immunogens in follicles, via the formation of immune complexes (ICs) or by employing self-assembling protein nanoparticles for multivalent display of Env antigens. Using rhesus macaques, we show that within a few days following immunization, free trimers were present in a diffuse pattern in draining LNs, while trimer ICs and Env nanoparticles accumulated in B cell follicles. Whole LN imaging strikingly revealed that ICs and trimer nanoparticles concentrated in as many as 500 follicles in a single LN within two days after immunization. Imaging of LNs collected seven days postimmunization showed that Env nanoparticles persisted on follicular dendritic cells in the light zone of nascent GCs. These findings suggest that the form of antigen administered in vaccination can dramatically impact localization in lymphoid tissues and provides a new rationale for the enhanced immune responses observed following immunization with ICs or nanoparticles.\n",

      "Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal and child mortality worldwide. Globally, 1.4 million pregnant women are estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS, the majority of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa. Maternal HIV infection and antiretroviral treatment (ART) have been associated with increased rates of preterm birth, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Acute HIV infection is associated with a rapid depletion of all three subsets of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), ILC1s, ILC2s and ILC3s, which is not reversed by ART. ILCs have been found at the maternal–fetal interface and we therefore investigated the potential association between maternal HIV infection, peripheral ILC frequencies and preterm birth. In our study of pregnant South African women with accurately dated pregnancies, we show that maternal HIV infection is associated with reduced levels of all three ILC subsets. Preterm birth was also associated with lower levels of all three ILC subsets in early pregnancy. ILC frequencies were lowest in HIV positive women who experienced preterm birth. Moreover, ILC levels were reduced in pregnancies resulting in spontaneous onset of preterm labour and in extreme preterm birth (< 28 weeks gestation). Our findings suggest that reduced ILC frequencies may be a link between maternal HIV infection and preterm birth. In addition, ILC frequencies in early pregnancy may serve as predictive biomarkers for women who are at risk of delivering preterm.\n",

      "Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is a life-threatening pathogen that still lacks a curative therapy or vaccine. Despite the reduction in AIDS-related deaths achieved by current antiretroviral therapies, drawbacks including drug resistance and the failure to eradicate infection highlight the need to identify new pathways to target the infection. Circadian rhythms are endogenous 24-h oscillations which regulate physiological processes including immune responses to infection, and there is an emerging role for the circadian components in regulating viral replication. The molecular clock consists of transcriptional/translational feedback loops that generate rhythms. In mammals, BMAL1 and CLOCK activate rhythmic transcription of genes including the nuclear receptor REV-ERBα, which represses BMAL1 and plays an essential role in sustaining a functional clock. We investigated whether REV-ERB activity regulates HIV-1 replication and found REV-ERB agonists inhibited HIV-1 promoter activity in cell lines, primary human CD4 T cells and macrophages, whilst antagonism or genetic disruption of REV-ERB increased promoter activity. The REV-ERB agonist SR9009 inhibited promoter activity of diverse HIV-subtypes and HIV-1 replication in primary T cells. This study shows a role for REV-ERB synthetic agonists to inhibit HIV-1 LTR promoter activity and viral replication, supporting a role for circadian clock components in regulating HIV-1 replication.\n",

      "CD4-based decoy approaches against HIV-1 are attractive options for long-term viral control, but initial designs, including soluble CD4 (sCD4) and CD4-Ig, were ineffective. To evaluate a therapeutic that more accurately mimics HIV-1 target cells compared with monomeric sCD4 and dimeric CD4-Ig, we generated virus-like nanoparticles that present clusters of membrane-associated CD4 (CD4-VLPs) to permit high-avidity binding of trimeric HIV-1 envelope spikes. In neutralization assays, CD4-VLPs were >12,000-fold more potent than sCD4 and CD4-Ig and >100-fold more potent than the broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) 3BNC117, with >12,000-fold improvements against strains poorly neutralized by 3BNC117. CD4-VLPs also neutralized patient-derived viral isolates that were resistant to 3BNC117 and other bNAbs. Intraperitoneal injections of CD4-CCR5-VLP produced only subneutralizing plasma concentrations in HIV-1–infected humanized mice but elicited CD4-binding site mutations that reduced viral fitness. All mutant viruses showed reduced sensitivity to sCD4 and CD4-Ig but remained sensitive to neutralization by CD4-VLPs in vitro. In vitro evolution studies demonstrated that CD4-VLPs effectively controlled HIV-1 replication at neutralizing concentrations, and viral escape was not observed. Moreover, CD4-VLPs potently neutralized viral swarms that were completely resistant to CD4-Ig, suggesting that escape pathways that confer resistance against conventional CD4-based inhibitors are ineffective against CD4-VLPs. These findings suggest that therapeutics that mimic HIV-1 target cells could prevent viral escape by exposing a universal vulnerability of HIV-1: the requirement to bind CD4 on a target cell. We propose that therapeutic and delivery strategies that ensure durable bioavailability need to be developed to translate this concept into a clinically feasible functional cure therapy.\n",

      "Despite efficient virological suppression on antiretroviral therapy (ART), people living with HIV (PLWH), experience an increased burden of premature co-morbidities, such as cancer and end-organ disease. With remaining challenges in terms of access to therapy, adherence and potential long-term drug toxicity, improving their long-term healthcare outcome, including new strategies for HIV clearance, remains a global priority. There is, therefore, an ongoing need to better characterize and harness the immune response in order to develop new strategies and supplement current therapeutic approaches for a “functional” cure. Current efforts toward HIV eradication to enhance immune recognition and elimination of persistently infected cells have highlighted the need for an optimized “kill” approach. Natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in antiviral defense and by virtue of their innate and adaptive features hold great promise as a focus of “kill” efforts. Galvanized by advances in the cancer field, NK cell exploitation, represents a transformative approach to augment HIV therapeutic modalities, circumventing many of the limitations inherent to T cell approaches. In this review we will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the development of NK cell adaptive/memory responses in HIV infection and highlight new and exciting opportunities to exploit the beneficial attributes of NK cells for HIV immunotherapy.\n",

      "Individuals found at bars in slums have several risk factors for HIV and tuberculosis (TB). To determine the prevalence of HIV and TB among individuals found at bars in slums of Kampala, Uganda, we enrolled adults found at bars that provided written informed consent. Individuals with alcohol intoxication were excluded. We performed HIV testing using immunochromatographic antibody tests (Alere Determine HIV-1/2 and Chembio HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK). TB was confirmed using the Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra assay, performed on single spot sputum samples. We enrolled 272 participants from 42 bars in 5 slums. The prevalence of HIV and TB was 11.4% (95% CI 8.1–15.8) and 15 (95% CI 6–39) per 1,000 population respectively. Predictors of HIV were female sex (aOR 5.87, 95% CI 2.05–16.83), current cigarette smoking (aOR 3.23, 95% CI 1.02–10.26), history of TB treatment (aOR 10.19, 95% CI 3.17–32.82) and CAGE scores of 2–3 (aOR 3.90, 95% CI 1.11–13.70) and 4 (aOR 4.77, 95% CI 1.07–21.35). The prevalence of HIV and TB was twice and four times the national averages respectively. These findings highlight the need for concurrent programmatic screening for both HIV and TB among high risk populations in slums.\n",

      "We describe the first death in Libya from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presenting as acute kidney failure in an 86-year-old woman in Tripoli with no recent travel history. She had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, for which she reported non-compliance with treatment. On 15 March 2020, she was diagnosed with lobar pneumonia and her condition did not improve. On 30 March she presented to Tripoli University Hospital Emergency Department with a cough, temperature of 39°C, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, pulse of 110 beats/min and blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg. Nasopharyngeal swab and sputum were negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on real-time RT-PCR. On 1 April 2020, the patient's status deteriorated and she was diagnosed with acute kidney injury as a complication of sepsis, with a urea level of 240 mg/dL (reference range 5–50 mg/dL) and creatinine level of 7.69 mg/dL (reference range 0.4–1.3 mg/dL). She was referred for dialysis at Tripoli University Hospital on 2 April. However, the patient died, despite attempted resuscitation, from multiple organ dysfunction syndrome following acute kidney injury. A nasopharyngeal swab and sputum were collected, which were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time RT-PCR.

      "Two-component, self-assembling nanoparticles represent a versatile platform for multivalent presentation of viral antigens. Computational design of protein nanoparticles with differing sizes and geometries enables combination with antigens of choice to test novel multimerization concepts in immunization strategies where the goal is to improve the induction and maturation of neutralizing antibody lineages. Here, we describe detailed antigenic, structural, and functional characterization of computationally designed tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral nanoparticle immunogens displaying trimeric HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) ectodomains. Env trimers, based on subtype A (BG505) or consensus group M (ConM) sequences and engineered with SOSIP stabilizing mutations, were fused to an underlying trimeric building block of each nanoparticle. Initial screening yielded one icosahedral and two tetrahedral nanoparticle candidates, capable of presenting twenty or four copies of the Env trimer. A number of analyses, including detailed structural characterization by cryo-EM, demonstrated that the nanoparticle immunogens possessed the intended structural and antigenic properties. When the immunogenicity of ConM-SOSIP trimers presented on a two-component tetrahedral nanoparticle or as soluble proteins were compared in rabbits, the two immunogens elicited similar serum antibody binding titers against the trimer component. Neutralizing antibody titers were slightly elevated in the animals given the nanoparticle immunogen and were initially more focused to the trimer apex. Altogether, our findings indicate that tetrahedral nanoparticles can be successfully applied for presentation of HIV Env trimer immunogens; however, the optimal implementation to different immunization strategies remains to be determined.\n",

      "Stigma regarding HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is commonly implicated as a factor limiting the scale-up of this highly effective HIV prevention modality. To quantify and characterize PrEP stigma, we developed and validated a brief HIV PrEP Stigma Scale (HPSS) among a group of 279 men who have sex with men (MSM). Scale development was informed by a theoretical model to enhance content validity. We assessed two scale versions, Semantic Differential and Likert, randomizing the order in which scales were presented to participants. Both scales demonstrated high internal consistency. The Likert scale had substantially better construct validity and was selected as the preferred option. Scale scores demonstrated construct validity through association with constructs of interest: healthcare distrust, HIV knowledge, perceived proportion of friends/partners on PrEP, perceived community evaluation of PrEP, and perceived effectiveness of PrEP. The scale accounted for 25% of the total variance in reported willingness to be on PrEP, indicating the substantial role PrEP stigma may have on decisions to initiate PrEP. Given increased efforts to roll-out PrEP, having a valid tool to determine the level and types of PrEP stigma in individuals, groups, and communities can help direct implementation plans, identify goals for stigma reduction, and monitor progress over time.\n",

      "The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a complex and well-balanced milieu of anatomic and immunological barriers. The epithelial surface of the GI tract is colonized by trillions of microorganisms, known as the gut microbiota, which is considered an “organ” with distinctive endocrine and immunoregulatory functions. Dysregulation of the gut microbiota composition, termed dysbiosis, has been associated with epithelial damage and translocation of microbial products into the circulating blood. Dysbiosis, increased gut permeability and chronic inflammation play a major role on the clinical outcome of inflammatory bowel diseases, graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) and HIV infection. In this review, we focus on GVHD and HIV infection, conditions sharing gut immune damage leading to dysbiosis. The degree of dysbiosis and level of epithelial gut damage predict poor clinical outcome in both conditions. Emerging interventions are therefore warranted to promote gut microbiota homeostasis and improve intestinal barrier function.

      "Quantifying the inducible HIV reservoir provides an estimate of the frequency of quiescent HIV-infected cells in humans as well as in animal models, and can help ascertain the efficacy of latency reversing agents (LRAs). The quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA) is used to measure inducible, replication competent HIV and generate estimations of reservoir size. However, traditional QVOA is time and labor intensive and requires large amounts of lymphocytes. Given the importance of reproducible and accurate assessment of both reservoir size and LRA activity in cure strategies, efforts to streamline the QVOA are of high priority.

      "Antiretroviral drugs that target various stages of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) life cycle have been effective in curbing the AIDS epidemic. However, drug resistance, off-target effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and varying efficacy in prevention underscore the need to develop novel and alternative therapeutics. In this study, we investigated whether targeting the signaling molecule Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) would inhibit HIV-1 infection and generation of the latent reservoir in primary CD4 T cells. We show that FTY720 (Fingolimod), an FDA-approved functional antagonist of S1P receptors, blocks cell-free and cell-to-cell transmission of HIV and consequently reduces detectable latent virus. Mechanistically, FTY720 impacts the HIV-1 life cycle at two levels. Firstly, FTY720 reduces the surface density of CD4, thereby inhibiting viral binding and fusion. Secondly, FTY720 decreases the phosphorylation of the innate HIV restriction factor SAMHD1 which is associated with reduced levels of total and integrated HIV, while reducing the expression of Cyclin D3. In conclusion, targeting the S1P pathway with FTY720 could be a novel strategy to inhibit HIV replication and reduce the seeding of the latent reservoir.\n",

      "Disconcerting levels of misdiagnosis are common in point-of-care rapid HIV testing programmes in sub-Saharan Africa. To investigate potential pathways to misdiagnosis, we interviewed 28 HIV testers in Zimbabwe and conducted weeklong observations at four testing facilities. Approaching adherence to national HIV testing algorithms as a social and scripted practice, dependent on the integration of certain competences, materials and meanings, our thematic analysis revealed three underlying causes of misdiagnosis: One, a lack of confidence in using certain test-kits, coupled with changes in testing algorithms and inadequate training, fed uncertainties with some testing practices. Two, difficult work conditions, including high workloads and resource-depleted facilities, compounded these uncertainties, and meant testers got distracted or resorted to testing short-cuts. Three, power struggles between HIV testers, and specific client-tester encounters created social interactions that challenged the testing process. We conclude that these contexts contribute to deviances from official and recommended testing procedures, as well as testing and interpretation biases, which may explain cases of misdiagnoses. We caution against user-error explanations to misdiagnosis in the absence of a broader recognition of how broader structural determinants affect HIV testing practices.\n",

The Brazilian Ministry of Health published a resolution in 2013, recommending the use of RTs for the diagnosis of HIV infection, where one positive RT must be followed by another different RT. This was meant to increase the chance of proper diagnosis in specific settings and special populations. However, data comparing and validating the different HIV RTs available in Brazil are scarce. Therefore, the present study seeks to evaluate eight anti-HIV RTs available in the Brazilian market regarding their analytical performance: sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and accuracy.

However, less is known about how these antibody effector functions evolve following infection. Moreover, how the humoral immune response is naturally tuned to recruit the antiviral activity of the innate immune system, and the extent to which these functions aid in the control of infection, are poorly understood. Using plasma samples from 10 hyper-acute HIV-infected South African women, identified in Fiebig stage I (the FRESH cohort), systems serology was performed to evaluate the functional and biophysical properties of gp120-, gp41-, and p24- specific antibody responses during the first year of infection. Significant changes were observed in both the functional and biophysical characteristics of the humoral immune response following acute HIV infection. Antibody Fc-functionality increased over the course of infection, with increases in antibody-mediated phagocytosis, NK activation, and complement deposition occurring in an antigen-specific manner. Changes in both antibody subclass and antibody Fc-glycosylation drove the evolution of antibody effector activity, highlighting natural modifications in the humoral immune response that may enable the directed recruitment of the innate immune system to target and control HIV.

      "Clonal expansions occur in the persistent HIV reservoir as shown by the duplication of proviral integration sites. However, the source of the proliferation of HIV-infected cells remains unclear. Here, we analyze the TCR repertoire of single HIV-infected cells harboring translation-competent proviruses in longitudinal samples from eight individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART). When compared to uninfected cells, the TCR repertoire of reservoir cells is heavily biased: expanded clonotypes are present in all individuals, account for the majority of reservoir cells and are often maintained over time on ART. Infected T cell clones are detected at low frequencies in the long-lived central memory compartment and overrepresented in the most differentiated memory subsets. Our results indicate that clonal expansions highly contribute to the persistence of the HIV reservoir and suggest that reservoir cells displaying a differentiated phenotype are the progeny of infected central memory cells undergoing antigen-driven clonal expansion during ART.\n",

      "Enveloped viruses include the most dangerous human and animal pathogens, in particular coronavirus, influenza virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). For these viruses, receptor binding and entry are accomplished by a single viral envelope protein (termed the fusion protein), the structural changes of which trigger the remodeling and merger of the viral and target cellular membranes. The number of fusion proteins required for fusion activity is still under debate, and several studies report this value to range from 1 to 9 for type I fusion proteins. Here, we consider the earliest stage of viral fusion based on the continuum theory of membrane elasticity. We demonstrate that membrane deformations induced by the oblique insertion of amphipathic fusion peptides mediate the lateral interaction of these peptides and drive them to form into a symmetric fusion rosette. The pulling force produced by the structural rearrangements of the fusion protein ectodomains gives additional torque, which deforms the membrane and additionally stabilizes the symmetric fusion rosette, thus allowing a reduction in the number of fusion peptides needed for fusion. These findings can resolve the large range of published cooperativity indices for HIV, influenza, and other type I fusion proteins.\n",

      "Although retroviral therapy (ART) has changed the HIV infection from a fatal event to a chronic disease, treated HIV patients demonstrate high prevalence of HIV associated comorbidities including cardio/cerebrovascular diseases. The incidence of stroke in HIV infected subjects is three times higher than that of uninfected controls. Several clinical and postmortem studies have documented the higher incidence of ischemic stroke in HIV infected patients. The etiology of stroke in HIV infected patients remains unknown; however, several factors such as coagulopathies, opportunistic infections, vascular abnormalities, atherosclerosis and diabetes can contribute to the pathogenesis of stroke. In addition, chronic administration of ART contributes to the increased risk of stroke in HIV infected patients. Concurrently, experimental studies in murine model of ischemic stroke demonstrated that HIV infection worsens stroke outcome, increases blood brain barrier permeability and increases neuroinflammation. Additionally, residual HIV viral proteins, such as Trans-Activator of Transcription, glycoprotein 120 and Negative regulatory factor, contribute to the pathogenesis. This review presents comprehensive information detailing the risk factors contributing to ischemic stroke in HIV infected patients. It also outlines experimental evidence demonstrating the impact of HIV infection on stroke outcomes, in addition to possible novel therapeutic approaches to improve these outcomes. \n",

      "Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection has resulted in the death of upward of 39 million people since being discovered in the early 1980s. A cure strategy for HIV-1 has eluded scientists, but gene editing technologies such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) offer a new approach to developing a cure for HIV infection. While the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been used successfully in a number of different types of studies, there remains a concern for off-target effects. This review details the different aspects of the Cas9 system and how they play a role in off-target events. In addition, this review describes the current technologies available for detecting off-target cleavage events and their advantages and disadvantages. While some studies have utilized whole genome sequencing (WGS), this method sacrifices depth of coverage for interrogating the whole genome. A number of different approaches have now been developed to take advantage of next generation sequencing (NGS) without sacrificing depth of coverage.

      "The HIV reservoir remains to be a difficult barrier to overcome in order to achieve a therapeutic cure for HIV. Several strategies have been developed to purge the reservoir, including the “kick and kill” approach, which is based on the notion that reactivating the latent reservoir will allow subsequent elimination by the host anti-HIV immune cells. However, clinical trials testing certain classes of latency reactivating agents (LRAs) have so far revealed the minimal impact on reducing the viral reservoir. A robust immune response to reactivated HIV expressing cells is critical for this strategy to work. A current focus to enhance anti-HIV immunity is through the use of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). Currently, HIV-specific CARs are being applied to peripheral T cells, NK cells, and stem cells to boost recognition and killing of HIV infected cells. In this review, we summarize current developments in engineering HIV directed CAR-expressing cells to facilitate HIV elimination. We also summarize current LRAs that enhance the “kick” strategy and how new generation and combinations of LRAs with HIV specific CAR T cell therapies could provide an optimal strategy to target the viral reservoir and achieve HIV clearance from the body.\n",

We adapted our protocol to administer telephone rather than in-person follow-up surveys and included questions about COVID-19. The majority of participants (99%) reported having heard of COVID-19; 23% reported no longer being able to go outside, 17% reported that they could no longer go to their regular clinic for medical care, and 3% reported that they could no longer get medication refills. PHQ-9 screening identified 9% (n = 45) with mild depression symptoms, and 1% (n = 3) with moderate-to-severe depression symptoms. Young adults 20–24 years old had more mild to severe depressive symptoms than the younger age groups (p < 0.001). Offering remote peer-support or mental health care, continuing to offer differentiated care services, and considering financial support will support the health and well-being of ALHIV.\n",

      "HIV-associated neurocognitive deficits include impaired speed-of-information processing (SIP) and motor functions. There is lack of Cameroonian adult norms for assessing SIP or motor functions. This study of 683 Cameroonians (320 HIV+, 363 HIV−) establishes demographically-adjusted norms for six SIP [Wechsler-Adult-Intelligence-Scale (WAIS)-III Digit Symbol (WAIS-IIIDS) and Symbol Search (WAIS-IIISS), Stroop Color-Naming, Stroop Word-Reading, Trail-Making Test-A (TMT-A), Color Trails-1 (CTT1)], and two motor function [Grooved Pegboard-dominant (GP-DH) and non-dominant (GP-NDH) hands] tests. We assessed viral effects on SIP and motor functions. HIV-infected persons had significantly lower (worse) T scores on GP-DH, WAIS-IIIDS, Stroop Word-Reading, TMT-A; lower motor and SIP summary T scores. Significantly higher proportion of cases (20.7%) than controls (10.3%) had impaired SIP. Male cases had better T scores than female cases on GP-NDH, WAIS-IIIDS, WAIS-IIISS, TMT-A, CTT1; better SIP summary T scores. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) was associated with significantly better T scores on GP-NDH, WAIS-IIIDS, Stroop Color-Naming; better motor and SIP summary T scores. Cases with higher CD4 had better T scores on WAIS-IIIDS, TMT-A, CTT1; better SIP summary T scores. Overall, we demonstrate that HIV infection in Cameroon is associated with deficits in SIP and motor functions; ART and higher CD4 are associated with better cognitive performance. We provide SIP and psychomotor functions normative standards, which will be useful for neurobehavioral studies in Cameroon of diseases affecting the brain.\n",

      "Higher cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) titers are strongly associated with mortality risk in individuals with HIV-associated cryptococcal disease. Rapid tests to quantify CrAg levels may provide important prognostic information and enable treatment stratification. We performed a laboratory-based validation of the IMMY semiquantitative cryptococcal antigen (CrAgSQ) lateral flow assay (LFA) against the current gold standard CrAg tests. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the CrAgSQ in HIV-positive individuals undergoing CrAg screening, determined the relationship between CrAgSQ scores and dilutional CrAg titers, assessed interrater reliability, and determined the clinical correlates of CrAgSQ scores. A total of 872 plasma samples were tested using both the CrAgSQ LFA and the conventional IMMY CrAg LFA, of which 692 were sequential samples from HIV-positive individuals undergoing CrAg screening and an additional 180 were known CrAg-positive plasma samples archived from prior studies.

      "Emerging results indicate that an uncontrolled host immune response, leading to a life-threatening condition called cytokine release syndrome (also termed “cytokine storm”), is the major driver of pathology in severe COVID-19. In this pandemic, considerable effort is being focused on identifying host genomic factors that increase susceptibility or resistance to the complications of COVID-19 and translating these findings to improved patient care. In this regard, the chemokine receptor-ligand nexus has been reported as potentially important in severe COVID-19 disease pathogenesis and its treatment. Valuable genomic insights into the chemokine receptor-ligand nexus have been gained from HIV infection and disease progression studies. Applying that knowledge, together with newly discovered potential host genomic factors associated with COVID-19, may lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment outcomes in COVID-19 patients.\n",

      "People with HIV (PWH) experience accentuated biological aging, as defined by markers of inflammation, immune dysfunction, and the epigenetic clock. They also have an elevated risk of multiple age-associated comorbidities. To discuss current knowledge, research gaps, and priorities in aging and age-related comorbidities in treated HIV infection, the NIH program staff organized a workshop held in Bethesda, Maryland in September 2019. This review article describes highlights of discussions led by the Pathogenesis/Basic Science Research working group that focused on three high priority topics: immunopathogenesis; the microbiome/virome; and aging and senescence. We summarize knowledge in these fields and describe key questions for research on the pathogenesis of aging and age-related comorbidities in PWH. Understanding the drivers and mechanisms underlying accentuated biological aging is a high priority that will help identify potential therapeutic targets to improve healthspan in older PWH.\n",

      "HIV prevalence in Oman is low (<5 %); however, 45 % of the population are expatriates, including a portion originating from countries with high HIV prevalence (>5 %). HIV screening is performed at regional public health laboratories as part of a medical fitness programme for residency applicants. We conducted a retrospective evaluation of indeterminate serology results from 11 females of African origin, aged 21–43 years. Serology testing for HIV was conducted according to the national Oman algorithm: fourth-generation immunoassays (Bio-Rad GS HIV Combo Ag/Ab EIA, Siemens Enzygnost HIV Integral 4, Abbott ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab Combo, Roche Elecsys HIV Combi PT, bioMérieux VIDAS HIV DUO QUICK), confirmatory assays (Geenius HIV 1/2 Confirmatory, INNO-LIA HIV I/II Score) and PCR testing. Confirmatory testing to resolve indeterminate results was conducted with available samples for five patients using a combination of immunoassays, confirmatory assays, PCR/PERT and pro-viral DNA levels, at three external laboratories; Roche Diagnostics (Germany), Swiss National Laboratory (Switzerland) and Barts Health NHS Trust (UK). Nineteen serum, 15 plasma and two whole-blood samples were analysed. Nine of ten patients analysed on Bio-Rad and Siemens immunoassays were highly reactive; seven were highly reactive on the Abbott assay. Eight of nine patients tested with the Roche assay were negative. Three of four patients tested on the bioMérieux assay were negative. Five patients underwent confirmatory testing at external laboratories; all were negative by HIV-RNA or pro-viral DNA testing. In conclusion, HIV-RNA and pro-viral DNA testing is recommended for HIV screening of individuals from high-prevalence regions coming to low-prevalence regions.\n",

      "The prevalence of chronic widespread pain (CWP) in people with HIV is high, yet the underlying mechanisms are elusive. Leukocytes synthesize the endogenous opioid, β-endorphin, within their endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When released into plasma, β-endorphin dampens nociception by binding to opioid receptors on sensory neurons. We hypothesized that the heme-dependent redox signaling induces ER stress, which attenuates leukocyte β-endorphins levels/release, thereby increasing pain sensitivity in people with HIV. Results demonstrated that HIV positive individuals with CWP had increased plasma methemoglobin, erythrocytes membrane oxidation, hemolysis, and low plasma heme scavenging enzyme, hemopexin, compared to people with HIV without CWP and HIV-negative individuals with or without pain. In addition, the leukocytes from people with HIV with CWP had attenuated levels of the heme metabolizing enzyme, heme oxygenase-1, which metabolizes free heme to carbon-monoxide and biliverdin. These individuals also had elevated ER stress, and low β-endorphin in leukocytes. \n",

      "Trafficking of cell-associated HIV-1 from the genital mucosa to lymphoid organs represents a critical first step toward systemic infection. Mature DCs capture and transmit HIV-1 to T cells, but insights into DC-to-T cell viral spread dynamics within a 3-dimensional environment is lacking. Using live-cell imaging, we show that mature DCs rapidly compartmentalize HIV-1 within surface-accessible invaginations near the uropod. HIV-1 capture did not interfere with DC migration toward lymph node homing chemo-attractants and their ability to enter lymphatic vessels. However, HIV-captured DCs engaged in prolonged contacts with autologous CD4+ T cells, which led to high T cell infection. Interestingly, we show that surface bound, virion-associated Env induced signal transduction in motile T cells that facilitated prolonged DC:T cell interactions, partially through high-affinity LFA-1 expression. Together, we describe a mechanism by which surface bound HIV-1 particles function as signaling receptors that regulate T cell motility, cell-cell contact dynamics, and productive infection.\n",

      "To examine HIV service interruptions during the COIVD-19 outbreak in South Carolina (SC) and identify geospatial and socioeconomic correlates of such interruptions, we collected qualitative, geospatial, and quantitative data from 27 Ryan White HIV clinics in SC in March, 2020. HIV service interruptions were categorized (none, minimal, partial, and complete interruption) and analyzed for geospatial heterogeneity. Nearly 56% of the HIV clinics were partially interrupted and 26% were completely closed. Geospatial heterogeneity of service interruption existed but did not exactly overlap with the geospatial pattern of COVID-19 outbreak. The percentage of uninsured in the service catchment areas was significantly correlated with HIV service interruption (F = 3.987, P = .02). This mixed-method study demonstrated the disparity of HIV service interruptions in the COVID-19 in SC and suggested a contribution of existing socioeconomic gaps to this disparity.

      "As of July 2020, approximately 6 months into the pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), whether people living with HIV (PLWH) are disproportionately affected remains an unanswered question. Thus far, risk of COVID-19 in people with and without HIV appears similar but data are sometimes contradictory. Some uncertainty is due to the recency of the emergence of COVID-19 and sparsity of data; some is due to imprecision about what it means for HIV to be a “risk factor” for COVID-19. Forthcoming studies on the risk of COVID-19 to PLWH should differentiate between 1) the unadjusted, excess burden of disease among PLWH to inform surveillance efforts; and 2) any excess risk of COVID-19 among PLWH due to biological effects of HIV, independent of comorbidities that confound rather than mediate this effect. PLWH bear a disproportionate burden of alcohol, other drug use, mental health disorders, and other structural vulnerabilities, which may increase their risk of COVID-19. In addition to any direct effects of COVID-19 on the health of PLWH, we need to understand how physical distancing restrictions impact secondary health outcomes, and the need for, accessibility of, and impact of alternative modalities of providing ongoing medical, mental health, and substance use treatment that comply with physical distancing restrictions (e.g., telemedicine).\n",

      "Pakistan is considered by the World Health Organization to currently have a “concentrated” HIV-1 epidemic due to a rapid rise in infections among people who inject drugs (PWID). Prevalence among the country’s nearly 105,000 PWID is estimated to be 37.8% but has been shown to be higher in several large urban centers. A lack of public health resources, the common use of professional injectors and unsafe injection practices are believed to have fueled the outbreak. Here we evaluate the molecular characteristics of HIV-1 sequences (n = 290) from PWID in several Pakistani cities to examine transmission dynamics and the association between rates of HIV-1 transmission with regards to regional trends in opioid trafficking. Tip-to-tip (patristic) distance based phylogenetic cluster inferences and BEAST2 Bayesian phylodynamic analyses of time-stamped data were performed on HIV-1 \n",

      "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common comorbidity among people living with HIV that has a more aggressive course than NAFLD among the general population. In a recent randomized placebo-controlled trial, we demonstrated that the growth hormone–releasing hormone analog tesamorelin reduced liver fat and prevented fibrosis progression in HIV-associated NAFLD over 1 year. As such, tesamorelin is the first strategy that has shown to be effective against NAFLD among the population with HIV. The current study leveraged paired liver biopsy specimens from this trial to identify hepatic gene pathways that are differentially modulated by tesamorelin versus placebo. Using gene set enrichment analysis, we found that tesamorelin increased hepatic expression of hallmark gene sets involved in oxidative phosphorylation and decreased hepatic expression of gene sets contributing to inflammation, tissue repair, and cell division. Tesamorelin also reciprocally up- and downregulated curated gene sets associated with favorable and poor hepatocellular carcinoma prognosis, respectively. Notably, among tesamorelin-treated participants, these changes in hepatic expression correlated with improved fibrosis-related gene score. Our findings inform our knowledge of the biology of pulsatile growth hormone action and provide a mechanistic basis for the observed clinical effects of tesamorelin on the liver.\n",

Studies have demonstrated that the efficacy and safety of antiretrovirals have improved with the introduction of new classes of antiretrovirals, such as integrase inhibitors. This study aimed to estimate the frequency of individuals with a virologic response by week 24 of antiretroviral treatment and to describe the adverse events of the regimen containing dolutegravir. This was a cohort of people living with HIV followed up at a referral hospital. Patients were included who had initiated their first treatment between January and August 2017. Data were obtained from medical records, the Drug Logistics Management System and from the Laboratory Tests Control System. Two hundred and twenty-two patients were included for the tolerability analysis and one hundred and thirty-seven for the virologic response analysis. The mean age was 34 years, the median time between diagnosis and initiating treatment was 1.9 months and the median time on antiretroviral therapy was 13.2 months. The frequency of adverse events was 10% (95% CI: 7% to 15.2%), of these, amongst the most frequent events, 91% presented gastrointestinal effects, and 47.8% neuropsychiatric. By week 24 the estimated incidence of virologic response was 89.1% (95% CI: 83% to 93.5%), with an increase during the first 6 months in the number of T-CD4 lymphocytes of 50.7 cells/mm 3 (95% CI: 42 to 59.3).

      "Ebola virus (EBOV) is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus that can cause Ebola virus disease (EVD). It is thought that EVD survivors are protected against subsequent infection with EBOV and that neutralising antibodies to the viral surface glycoprotein (GP) are potential correlates of protection. Serological studies are vital to assess neutralising antibodies targeted to EBOV GP; however, handling of EBOV is limited to containment level 4 laboratories. Pseudotyped viruses can be used as alternatives to live viruses, which require high levels of bio-containment, in serological and viral entry assays. However, neutralisation capacity can differ among pseudotyped virus platforms. We evaluated the suitability of EBOV GP pseudotyped human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) to measure the neutralising ability of plasma from EVD survivors, when compared to results from a live EBOV neutralisation assay. The sensitivity, specificity and correlation with live EBOV neutralisation were greater for the VSV-based pseudotyped virus system, which is particularly important when evaluating EBOV vaccine responses and immuno-therapeutics. Therefore, the EBOV GP pseudotyped VSV neutralisation assay reported here could be used to provide a better understanding of the putative correlates of protection against EBOV.\n",

      "We examined the factors associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screening and developed a HIV screening prevalence surface map using spatial interpolation techniques to identify the geographical areas with the highest and lowest rates of HIV screening in Mozambique. We analyzed the cross-sectional 2015 Mozambique AIDS Indicator Surveys with an analytic sample of 12,995 participants. Analyses were conducted on SPSS-21, STATA-14, and R freeware 3.5.3. We adjusted for the sample design and population weights. Results indicated that 52.5% of Mozambicans had undergone HIV screening. Mozambicans with these characteristics have a higher probability of undergoing HIV screening: females, those with a primary education or higher, urban dwellers, residents of wealthy households, having at least one lifetime sexual partner, and dwelling in these provinces—Niassa, Tete, Manica, Sofala, Inhambane, Gaza, Maputo Provincia, and Maputo Cidade. The spatial map revealed that the national and regional estimates mask sub-regional level estimates. Generally, zones with the highest HIV screening prevalence are found in southern provinces while the lowest prevalence was found in the northern provinces. The map further revealed intraregional differences in HIV screening estimates. We recommend that HIV screening be expanded, with equitable screening resource allocations that target more nuanced areas within provinces which have a low HIV screening prevalence. \n",

      "The study explored how older adults experience an HIV diagnosis, deal with issues of stigma and disclosure, and navigate the healthcare system. Descriptive phenomenology was used to collect data from 20 older adults receiving antiretroviral treatment in health facilities in Gauteng Province, South Africa. Data analysis was inductive and followed the thematic approach. After diagnosis with HIV, the older adults experienced shock and disbelief, internalized their new reality of being HIV-positive, and found it difficult to disclose their HIV status. Stigma was embedded in their patterns of disclosure, and they chose not to disclose in order to manage stigma, protect their status, and maintain their privacy. Moreover, nondisclosure allowed them to achieve some normality in their lives without the fear of rejection. The older adults adopted various survival skills that aided them to accept their HIV status. Self-acceptance was important for the older adults who did not want to feel cheated out of life by the HIV diagnosis. The positive supportive attitudes of the healthcare professionals provided the much-needed support network for the older adults immediately after they had received their HIV test results. This was instrumental in their acceptance of their HIV status, their adherence to clinic visits, and their ability to live a healthy, positive life.\n",

      "Reducing human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) racial/ethnic disparities in the Deep South has been a critical objective of the U.S. National HIV/AIDS Strategy. This finding, originally published in 2010 by the Office of National AIDS Policy, serves as a complement to the Health and Human Resources and Services Administration’s Ending the HIV Epidemic (EtHE): A Plan for America. The EtHE plan, released in 2019, emphasizes community stakeholder involvement to achieve the planning goals of decreasing new HIV infections in key U.S. geographic areas. According to the plan, an important stakeholder is faith leaders, especially around stigma reduction. This paper focuses on a community–academic research partnership’s exploration of southern Black faith leaders’ teaching perspectives regarding HIV prevention, sexuality, and sexual health in predominantly Black congregations in Memphis, Tennessee. The partnership conducted four focus groups using a semi-structured discussion interview. Any adult faith leader involved in ministry work in a predominantly Black church was eligible to participate in the discussion. A total of 26 faith leaders with a mean age of 54, representing four Christian denominations, consented to participate in the study. Emerging themes included: (1) restriction of scripture to teach prevention and address sexuality, (2) role of secrecy and silence in living with HIV, and (3) impact of the stigma of HIV and sexuality. Findings may inform nationwide jurisdictional implementation plans, particularly for faith-based interventions in southern churches working toward ending the HIV epidemic.\n",

      "HIV transactivator protein (Tat) plays a pivotal role in viral replication through modulation of cellular transcription factors and transactivation of viral genomic transcription. The effect of HIV-1 Tat on reverse transcription has long been described in the literature, however, that of HIV-2 is understudied. Sequence homology between Tat proteins of HIV-1 and 2 is estimated to be less than 30%, and the main difference lies within their N-terminal region. Here, we describe Y44A-inactivating mutation of HIV-2 Tat, studying its effect on capsid production, reverse transcription, and the efficiency of proviral transcription. Investigation of the mutation was performed using sequence- and structure-based in silico analysis and in vitro experiments. Our results indicate that the Y44A mutant HIV-2 Tat inhibited the activity and expression of RT (reverse transcriptase), in addition to diminishing Tat-dependent LTR (long terminal repeat) transactivation. These findings highlight the functional importance of the acidic domain of HIV-2 Tat in the regulation of reverse transcription and transactivation of the integrated provirions.\n",

      "Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious disease of public health concern, mainly in low- and middle-income countries. Most of these countries have challenges in diagnosis and treatment of TB in people with smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis (SNPTB), which remains a significant public health challenge because of the global burden of the disease. We evaluated the epidemiology and clinical presentation of SNPTB in a cohort of patients with high HIV burden. The study was a cross-sectional study among patients with SNPTB in four major hospitals that care for TB/HIV patients in north-central Nigeria. All patients 18 years and above who were newly diagnosed as SNPTB, or patients with SNPTB who had not taken TB drugs for up to 2 weeks irrespective of their HIV status were recruited. Demographic data (sex, age), smoking status, and medical history (clinical form of TB, symptoms at admission, diagnostic methods, presence of comorbidities, prior TB treatment) were obtained using a semi-structured questionnaire. Detailed clinical examination was also done on all the study subjects. Baseline results of packed cell volume, HIV test and sputum acid fast bacilli done during TB screening were retrieved from the patients’ case notes and recorded. Also, the base line Chest X-ray films taken during TB screening were reviewed and reported by two radiologists blinded to each other’s reports. The Xpert MTB/RIF tests and sputum culture (using LJ medium) were done in a TB reference laboratory. A total of 150 patients with SNPTB were studied. Majority of the patients were female 93 (62%). The median age of the patients was 36.5 years with greater percentage of the patients within the ages of 25–44 years 92 (61.3%). Twenty-two (14.7%) of the patients had previous TB treatment. History of cigarette smoking was obtained in only 7(4.7%) of the patients while 82 (64.1%) were HIV positive. All the patients had a history of cough for over a period of at least three weeks, while, 27 (18%) reported having hemoptysis. About 87 (58%) had fever and 110 (73.7%) had anemia, while weight loss and night sweat were reported in 98(65.3%) and 82 (54.7%) of the patients respectively. Chest x rays were reported as typical of TB in only 24 (16%) of the patients. Of the 150 sputa sample analyzed, 21/150 (14.0%) and 22/150 (14.7%) where Gene Xpert and sputum culture positive respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of Gene Xpert assay were 81.8% (18/22; 95% CI 61.5 to 92.7%) and 97.4% (112/115; 95% CI 92.6 to 99.1%), respectively. The study found cough, fever and anemia to be the commonest presentation in patient with SNPTB in a high HIV burden patient’s population. There is also relatively high culture positivity among the patients. This underscores the need to expand the facilities for culture and confirmation in TB centers across the country.\n",

The main purposes of this work are to describe the miRNome of HIV-1 infected patients with different extreme phenotypes and identify potentially altered pathways regulated by differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs. The miRNomes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of dual phenotype EC-LTNP or LTNP with detectable viremia and HIV-infected patients with typical progression before and after treatment, were obtained through miRNA-Seq and compared among them. The administration of treatment produces 18 DE miRNAs in typical progressors. LTNP condition shows 14 DE miRNA when compared to typical progressors, allowing LTNP phenotype differentiation.

Methods: Prospective study of 60 HIV/HCV-coinfected and 30 HCV-monoinfected patients with advanced HCV cirrhosis (liver decompensation or liver stiffness measurement (LSM) ≥ 25 kPa, hepatic liver pressure gradient (HVPG) ≥ 10 mmHg, or Child–Pugh–Turcotte (CPT) ≥ 7). The relative telomere length (RTL) was quantified by real-time multiplex PCR (MMqPCR) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells at baseline and 48 weeks after HCV treatment. Generalized linear models (GLMs) adjusted for the most relevant clinical and epidemiological variables and mixed GLMs were used.

      "Despite the effectiveness of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) in suppressing virus replication, chronic inflammation remains one of the cardinal features intersecting HIV-1, cART, drug abuse, and likely contributes to the accelerated neurocognitive decline and aging in people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) that abuse drugs. It is also estimated that ~30–60% of PLWH on cART develop cognitive deficits associated with HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), with symptomatology ranging from asymptomatic to mild, neurocognitive impairments. Adding further complexity to HAND is the comorbidity of drug abuse in PLWH involving activated immune responses and the release of neurotoxins, which, in turn, mediate neuroinflammation. Premature or accelerated aging is another feature of drug abusing PLWH on cART regimes. Emerging studies implicate the role of HIV-1/HIV-1 proteins, cART, and abused drugs in altering the inflammasome signaling in the central nervous system (CNS) cells. It is thus likely that exposure of these cells to HIV-1/HIV-1 proteins, cART, and/or abused drugs could have synergistic/additive effects on the activation of inflammasomes, in turn, leading to exacerbated neuroinflammation, ultimately resulting in premature aging referred to as “inflammaging” In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of inflammasome activation, neuroinflammation, and aging in central nervous system (CNS) cells such as microglia, astrocytes, and neurons in the context of HIV-1 and drug abuse.\n",

      "Based on the structure of an HIV-1 entry inhibitor peptide two stapled- and a retro-enantio peptides have been designed to provide novel prevention interventions against HIV transmission. The three peptides show greater inhibitory potencies in cellular and mucosal tissue pre-clinical models than the parent sequence and the retro-enantio shows a strengthened proteolytic stability. Since HIV-1 fusion inhibitor peptides need to be embedded in the membrane to properly interact with their viral target, the structural features were determined by NMR spectroscopy in micelles and solved by using restrained molecular dynamics calculations. Both parent and retro-enantio peptides demonstrate a topology compatible with a shared helix–turn–helix conformation and assemble similarly in the membrane maintaining the active conformation needed for its interaction with the viral target site. This study represents a straightforward approach to design new targeted peptides as HIV-1 fusion inhibitors and lead us to define a retro-enantio peptide as a good candidate for pre-exposure prophylaxis against HIV-1.\n",

      "Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) can either undergo a lytic pathway to cause productive systemic infections or enter a latent state in which the integrated provirus remains transcriptionally silent for decades. The ability to latently infect T-cells enables HIV-1 to establish persistent infections in resting memory CD4+ T-lymphocytes which become reactivated following the disruption or cessation of intensive drug therapy. The maintenance of viral latency occurs through epigenetic and non-epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic mechanisms of HIV latency regulation involve the deacetylation and methylation of histone proteins within nucleosome 1 (nuc-1) at the viral long terminal repeats (LTR) such that the inhibition of histone deacetyltransferase and histone lysine methyltransferase activities, respectively, reactivates HIV from latency. Non-epigenetic mechanisms involve the nuclear restriction of critical cellular transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) or nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) which activate transcription from the viral LTR, limiting the nuclear levels of the viral transcription transactivator protein Tat and its cellular co-factor positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), which together regulate HIV transcriptional elongation. In this article, we review how T-cell receptor (TCR) activation efficiently induces NF-κB, NFAT, and activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factors through multiple signal pathways and how these factors efficiently regulate HIV LTR transcription through the non-epigenetic mechanism. We further discuss how elongation factor P-TEFb, induced through an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent mechanism, regulates HIV transcriptional elongation before new Tat is synthesized and the role of AP-1 in the modulation of HIV transcriptional elongation through functional synergy with NF-κB. Furthermore, we discuss how TCR signaling induces critical post-translational modifications of the cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) subunit of P-TEFb which enhances interactions between P-TEFb and the viral Tat protein and the resultant enhancement of HIV transcriptional elongation.\n",

      "The increasing use of the integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) class for the treatment of HIV-infection has pointed to the importance of analyzing the features of HIV-1 subtypes for an improved understanding of viral genetic variability in the occurrence of drug resistance (DR). In this study, we have described the prevalence of INSTI DR in a Russian cohort and the genetic features of HIV-1 integrase sub-subtype A6. We included 408 HIV infected patients who were not exposed to INSTI. Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) were detected among 1.3% of ART-naïve patients and among 2.7% of INSTI-naïve patients. The prevalence of 12 polymorphic mutations was significantly different between sub-subtypes A6 and A1. Analysis of the genetic barriers determined two positions in which subtype A (A1 and A6) showed a higher genetic barrier (G140C and V151I) compared with subtype B, and one position in which subtypes A1 and B displayed a higher genetic barrier (L74M and L74I) than sub-subtype A6. Additionally, we confirmed that the L74I mutation was selected at the early stage of the epidemic and subsequently spread as a founder effect in Russia. Our data have added to the overall understanding of the genetic features of sub-subtype A6 in the context of drug resistance.\n",

      "Animal retroviruses are known for their transforming potential, and this is also true for the ones hosted by humans, which have gathered expanding attention as one of the potent causative agents in various disease, including specific cancer types. For instance, Human T Lymphotropic virus (HTLV) is a well-studied class of oncoviruses causing T cell leukemia, while human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) leads to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is linked to a series of defining cancers including Kaposi sarcoma, certain types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and cervical cancer. Of note, in addition to these “modern” exogenous retroviruses, our genome harbors a staggering number of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs). HERVs are the genetic remnants of ancient retroviral germline infection of human ancestors and are typically silenced in normal tissues due to inactivating mutations and sequence loss. While some HERV elements have been appropriated and contribute to human physiological functions, others can be reactivated through epigenetic dysregulations to express retroviral elements and promote carcinogenesis. Conversely, HERV replication intermediates or protein products can also serve as intrinsic pathogen-associated molecular patterns that cause the immune system to interpret it as an exogenous infection, thereby stimulating immune responses against tumors. As such, HERVs have also been targeted as a potential internal strategy to sensitize tumor cells for promising immunotherapies. In this review, we discuss the dynamic role of human retroviruses in cancer development, focusing on HIV and HERVs contribution. We also describe potential treatment strategies, including immunotherapeutic targeting of HERVs, inhibiting DNA methylation to expose HERV signatures, and the use of antiretroviral drugs against HIV and HERVs, which can be employed as prospective anti-cancer modalities.\n",

      "Macrophages are the first line of defence against invading pathogens. They play a crucial role in immunity but also in regeneration and homeostasis. Their remarkable plasticity in their phenotypes and function provides them with the ability to quickly respond to environmental changes and infection. Recent work shows that macrophages undergo cell cycle transition from a G0/terminally differentiated state to a G1 state. This G0-to-G1 transition presents a window of opportunity for HIV-1 infection. Macrophages are an important target for HIV-1 but express high levels of the deoxynucleotide-triphosphate hydrolase SAMHD1, which restricts viral DNA synthesis by decreasing levels of dNTPs. While the G0 state is non-permissive to HIV-1 infection, a G1 state is very permissive to HIV-1 infection. This is because macrophages in a G1 state switch off the antiviral restriction factor SAMHD1 by phosphorylation, thereby allowing productive HIV-1 infection. Here, we explore the macrophage cell cycle and the interplay between its regulation and permissivity to HIV-1 infection.\n",

      "Endosomal sorting complexes required for transport proteins (ESCRT) catalyze the fission of cellular membranes during budding of membrane away from the cytosol. Here we have used Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to visualize the recruitment of ESCRTs specifically, ALIX, CHMP4b and VPS4 onto the budding HIV Gag virus-like particles (VLPs). We imaged the budding VLPs with 200 millisecond time resolution for 300 frames. Our data shows three phases for ESCRT dynamics: 1) recruitment in which subunits of ALIX, CHMP4b and VPS4 are recruited with constant proportions on the budding sites of HIV Gag virus like particles for nearly 10 seconds, followed by 2) disassembly of ALIX and CHMP4b while VPS4 signal remains constant for nearly 20 seconds followed by 3) disassembly of VPS4. We hypothesized that the disassembly observed in step 2 was catalyzed by VPS4 and powered by ATP hydrolysis. To test this hypothesis, we performed ATP depletion using (-) glucose medium, deoxyglucose and oligomycin. Imaging ATP depleted cells, we show that the disassembly of CHMP4b and ALIX observed in step 2 is ATP dependent. ATP depletion resulted in the recruitment of approximately 2-fold as many subunits of all ESCRTs. Resuming ATP production in cells, resulted in disassembly of the full ESCRT machinery which had been locked in place during ATP depletion. With some caveats, our experiments provide insight into the formation of the ESCRT machinery at the budding site of HIV during budding.\n",
