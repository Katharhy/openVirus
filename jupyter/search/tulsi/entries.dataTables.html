        <span class="abst" title="Introduction:Chlorhexidine (CHX) interacts with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and herbal irrigants such as neem and tulsi to form precipitate which contains para-chloroaniline (PCA). No studies till date have reported about metal elements present in this combination as well as in irrigants. Aim:The aim of this study was to evaluate the precipitate formed on combination of different irrigants, weigh the amount of precipitate formed, and to analyze 35 different metal elements in each irrigant, precipitate formed as well as in PCA. Materials and Methods:Seven irrigants, namely 2% CHX gluconate, 3% NaOCl, 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 5% neem, 5% tulsi, 5% Aloe vera, and 5% garlic were taken in different test tubes. Group (1-6): 1 ml of CHX is mixed with 1 ml of 3% NaOCl/17% EDTA/5% neem/5% tulsi/5% A. vera/5% garlic. Group (7-11): 1 ml of 3% NaOCl is mixed with 1 ml of 17% EDTA/5% neem/5% tulsi/5% A. vera/5% garlic. Group (12-15): 1 ml of 17% EDTA is mixed with 1 ml of 5% neem/5% tulsi/5% A. vera/5% garlic. Group (16-18): 1 ml of 5% neem is mixed with 1 ml of 5% tulsi/5% A. vera/5% garlic. Group (19 and 20): 1 ml of 5% tulsi is mixed with 5% A. vera/5% garlic. Group 21 includes 1 ml of 5% A. vera and 5% garlic. Each group is observed for any precipitate formation, and precipitate formed was weighed. Samples such as 2% CHX gluconate, 3% NaOCl, 17% EDTA, 5% neem, 5% tulsi, 5% A. vera, PCA, and precipitate formed in each group were analyzed for 35 different metal elements using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Statistical Analysis:One-way ANOVA and Post hoc Tukey's test for the precipitate formed. Results:Precipitate formation was seen in CHX + NaOCl (reddish-brown), CHX + EDTA (white), CHX + neem (light green), CHX + A. vera (green), CHX + tulsi (dark green), CHX + garlic (beige). ICP-MS analysis showed the presence of International Agency for Research on Cancer Group 1 carcinogens in NaOCl, CHX, EDTA, and PCA. Conclusion:Carcinogenic metals are undetected in herbal irrigants which is found to be risk free alternatives in near future.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background:Oral candidiasis is a common fungal infection caused by Candida albicans. In recent years, Candida species have shown resistance against many synthetic drugs, which has highlighted the need for novel antifungal drugs with fewer side effects for effective management of candidiasis. Several studies have suggested that some plant species possess promising antimicrobial compounds. Piper betle and Ocimum sanctum Linn are such common medicinal plants that show strong antimicrobial activity by the release of secondary metabolites. However, the effect of these plants on oral candidiasis has not been studied and hence, the present study aimed to evaluate the antifungal activity of these plant extracts on the subcultures of C. albicans and compared with a standard drug, fluconazole. Materials and Methods:Subcultures of C. albicans obtained from oral thrush patients were used in the present study. Ethanolic and ethyl acetate extracts of P. betle (betel) and O. sanctum L. (tulsi) leaves were prepared by cold extraction method. The anticandidal activity and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were evaluated using disc diffusion method and microbroth dilution method, respectively. Values were compared with the standard drug fluconazole. Results:Both the extracts exhibited anticandidal activity on the subcultures of C. albicans. The ethyl acetate extract of mature betel leaf showed a maximum zone of inhibition (26 mm) when compared with tulsi and fluconazole (13 mm). Betel leaf extract showed better MIC values (125 μg/ml) than tulsi (2000 μg/ml). However, these values were high when compared with those of fluconazole (62.5 μg/ml). Conclusion:Ethyl acetate extract of mature betel leaf exhibited good anticandidal activity than that of tulsi and fluconazole.">

Ocimum sanctum, Holy Basil or Tulsi, holiest herb well used in the Indian household, has drawn much attention toward its various health benefits, especially anti-cancer property. The present study was carried out to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of O. sanctum on leukemic cell lines K562. Materials and Methods:Dry and aqueous extracts of two types of Tulsi leaves (Rama Tulsi and Krishna Tulsi) were evaluated for a dose-dependent cytotoxicity and anti-proliferative against K562 cell lines, leukoerythroid progenitor leukemic cell lines by 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. Half-maximal inhibitory concentration was evaluated for each of the extracts. Results:Both dry and aqueous extracts of both types of Tulsi leaves demonstrated a significant amount of cytotoxicity against the studied cell lines. Conclusion:This being preliminary study, we propose the initial finding of cytotoxic abilities of the herb against the leukemic cell lines and recommend a more detailed evaluation of the herb and its components.">

        <span class="abst" title="This paper focuses on the investigation of the antimicrobial activity of banana fabric treated with dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. The fabric was exposed to air plasma for varying treatment times of 1-5 min followed by coating with green tea (Camellia sinensis) and tulsi (Ocimum sanctum) leaf extracts at five different concentrations. The treated fabric was evaluated in terms of surface wettability by a range of tests like wet-out time analysis, hydrophilicity test, and contact angle measurements. The functional groups formed on the treated fabric were analyzed by attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. The surface morphology was studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the surface chemistry was studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The FTIR and XPS analysis results indicate that the plasma-treated fabric was found to have a higher concentration of polar groups (-COOH, -OH, -C=O) that has improved surface hydrophilicity and functionality. The antimicrobial activity of the treated fabric surface was determined both qualitatively and quantitatively by the agar plate method and modified Hoenstein test, against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria. An improvement in the antimicrobial property was observed in plasma-treated banana fabric coated with natural extracts even after four washing cycles. This study suggests that air DBD plasma treatment followed by the absorption of tea/tulsi leaf extracts can serve as a better tool for developing natural antimicrobial textiles, which could serve the purpose in medical and healthcare sectors concerning recent times. It has eventually led to better absorption of plant extracts, thereby increasing their antimicrobial activity.">

In this context, the Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India has recommended 'Ayush Kwath' to improve the immunity and combat the infection. Our objective of this literature review is to review the role of immunity in pathogenesis of COVID-19 and role of Ayush Kwath against the virus and regulation of immunity. Current review was conducted using a search of available literature on COVID-19 and immunity, Vyadhikshamatwa, Ayurveda and COVID-19, Rasayana, Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, immunomodulatory effects of medicinal plants; Tulsi/Holy Basil/Ocimum sanctum, Dalchini/Cinnamon/Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Sunthi/Ginger/Zingiber officinale and Marich/Black Pepper/Piper nigrum. Ayurveda, being an ancient science have both medicinal and cultural values and had stimulated our kitchen and influenced what we ate in different seasons and the remedies we used for common ailments. Herbs such as Tulsi, Marich, Sunthi, Dalchini are the most commonly used and easily available drugs in home. Thus, Ayush Kwath due to its immune-modulatory, antiviral, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet, anti-atherosclerotic, hepato-protective, reno-protective properties; seems to be effective in immuno-regulation for controlling viral infections like COVID-19. Further pre-clinical and clinical trials need to be done for the evaluation of safety and efficacy of this polyherbal formulation.">
