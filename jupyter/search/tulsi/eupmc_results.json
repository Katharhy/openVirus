      "Abstract COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) is a transmissible disease initiated and propagated through a new virus strain SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) since 31st December 2019 in Wuhan city of China and the infection has outspread globally influencing millions of people. Here, an attempt was made to recognize natural phytochemicals from medicinal plants, in order to reutilize them against COVID-19 by the virtue of molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study. Molecular docking study showed six probable inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (Main protease), two from Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) (Withanoside V [10.32 kcal/mol] and Somniferine [9.62 kcal/mol]), one from Tinospora cordifolia (Giloy) (Tinocordiside [8.10 kcal/mol]) and three from Ocimum sanctum (Tulsi) (Vicenin [8.97 kcal/mol], Isorientin 4′-O-glucoside 2″-O-p-hydroxybenzoagte [8.55 kcal/mol] and Ursolic acid [8.52 kcal/mol]). ADMET profile prediction showed that the best docked phytochemicals from present work were safe and possesses drug-like properties. Further MD simulation study was performed to assess the constancy of docked complexes and found stable. Hence from present study it could be suggested that active phytochemicals from medicinal plants could potentially inhibit Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 and further equip the management strategy against COVID-19-a global contagion.  Highlights Holistic approach of Ayurvedic medicinal plants to avenge against COVID-19 pandemic. Active phytoconstituents of Ayurvedic medicinal plants Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha), Tinospora cordifolia (Giloy) and Ocimum sanctum (Tulsi) predicted to significantly hinder main protease (Mpro or 3Clpro) of SARS-CoV-2. Through molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation study, Withanoside V, Somniferine, Tinocordiside, Vicenin, Ursolic acid and Isorientin 4′-O-glucoside 2″-O-p-hydroxybenzoagte were anticipated to impede the activity of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Drug-likeness and ADMET profile prediction of best docked compounds from present study were predicted to be safe, drug-like compounds with no toxicity. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

      "This paper focuses on the investigation of the antimicrobial activity of banana fabric treated with dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. The fabric was exposed to air plasma for varying treatment times of 1-5 min followed by coating with green tea (Camellia sinensis) and tulsi (Ocimum sanctum) leaf extracts at five different concentrations. The treated fabric was evaluated in terms of surface wettability by a range of tests like wet-out time analysis, hydrophilicity test, and contact angle measurements. The functional groups formed on the treated fabric were analyzed by attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. The surface morphology was studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the surface chemistry was studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The FTIR and XPS analysis results indicate that the plasma-treated fabric was found to have a higher concentration of polar groups (-COOH, -OH, -C=O) that has improved surface hydrophilicity and functionality. The antimicrobial activity of the treated fabric surface was determined both qualitatively and quantitatively by the agar plate method and modified Hoenstein test, against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria. An improvement in the antimicrobial property was observed in plasma-treated banana fabric coated with natural extracts even after four washing cycles. This study suggests that air DBD plasma treatment followed by the absorption of tea/tulsi leaf extracts can serve as a better tool for developing natural antimicrobial textiles, which could serve the purpose in medical and healthcare sectors concerning recent times. It has eventually led to better absorption of plant extracts, thereby increasing their antimicrobial activity."

      "The paper highlights a lifetime experience of knowledge gained through interactions with Professor Hung T. Nguyen and the profound impact he has made in advancing the state-of-the-art in modeling, simulating, and understanding the dynamics of uncertain systems. His seminal works on Random Fuzzy Sets have (a) significantly impacted our perceptions of seeking methods and approaches to acquire and assimilate data or information from uncertain sources, (b) enhanced our understanding to develop strategies for deep learning the interconnections, implications, and consequences, thereby allowing the processing of data to its logical conclusions and (c) has infinitely broadened the horizon towards conceiving machine-based decision-making architectures that optimize our perceived understanding to build systems that can mimic human decision-making capabilities. These three universal attributes fit the breadth and scope of Soft Computing. The paper focuses on three distinct topics wherein we explore human perceptions that merge the conscious attributes combining facts, myths, traditions, culture, beliefs, and a sense of reasoning towards a higher level of consciousness, and provides avenues for their adoption and physical realizations. The first topic discusses the possibilities of harvesting vast amounts of hydrokinetic energy from low-head flows in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. The Mekong River has a perceived power potential of between 50 and 70 Gigawatts (GW). The reality is only one-quarter of the perceived power is plausible for harvesting. We discuss the possibility of transforming existing concrete structures across the arteries and tributaries of the Mekong River in the Delta Region to mini-hydropower plants. One example shows the possibilities of harvesting up to 250 KW at an existing structure that can serve the energy needs of local businesses involved in aquaculture, local commerce, and residential needs. Since recognizing conventional hydropower is ecologically damaging, Vietnam has focused its energy policy solely on Solar and Wind, which are 3–4 times higher in cost than Water. Low-head energy, which is currently unused, could be perceived as a significant contributor to the renewable energy portfolio for Vietnam. The second topic discusses the possibility for Ayurvedic medicine, an ancient Indian practice of herbal medicine, as a complementary form of medication compared to modern medicine. The Tulsi plant is recognized for its life-saving properties that make Hindus believe it is a Holy plant. Scientific observations have shown the plant can produce substantial amounts of pure Oxygen by absorbing carbon dioxide from the ambient. Research has also shown that Tulsi can absorb fluorides from water. The discussions highlight the adoption of Ayurvedic medicine based on historical and traditional beliefs that Nature grown ingredients can induce natural body responses that aid in recovery from illnesses. Ayurvedic medicine exploits the power of the mind based on beliefs and traditions as a means for healing from illnesses. Finally, the third topic is a search for the meaning to the phrase “Pointing the finger at the Moon,” and leading to the discovery of a three-dimensional holographic image on the Moon. The discovery sheds light on a long-standing question of what The Buddha was pointing to on the Moon. Historical background based on art is combined with basic Moon facts and a sense of geometry to uncover a three-dimensional holographic image that symbolizes Gautama Buddha’s path to enlightenment. The form is identified as Abhaya Mudra, the Fearless Form. Among the many forms displayed in Buddhist sculptures of the meditation posture, the Abhaya Mudra is significant as it is a gesture for tolerance, fearlessness, and compassion. In Buddhist philosophy, the attributes of intolerance, fearfulness, and hatred are erased from the human mind through detachment."

      "Background:Surge of cancer incidence, effects of chemotherapeutic agents and their cost and reduced survival and responsiveness to treatment have led to shift of attention of researchers toward herbal remedies to look for newer dimension in cancer therapy. Ocimum sanctum, Holy Basil or Tulsi, holiest herb well used in the Indian household, has drawn much attention toward its various health benefits, especially anti-cancer property. The present study was carried out to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of O. sanctum on leukemic cell lines K562. Materials and Methods:Dry and aqueous extracts of two types of Tulsi leaves (Rama Tulsi and Krishna Tulsi) were evaluated for a dose-dependent cytotoxicity and anti-proliferative against K562 cell lines, leukoerythroid progenitor leukemic cell lines by 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. Half-maximal inhibitory concentration was evaluated for each of the extracts. Results:Both dry and aqueous extracts of both types of Tulsi leaves demonstrated a significant amount of cytotoxicity against the studied cell lines. Conclusion:This being preliminary study, we propose the initial finding of cytotoxic abilities of the herb against the leukemic cell lines and recommend a more detailed evaluation of the herb and its components."

      "SARS-CoV-2 infection associated respiratory disease- COVID-19 has evolved into a pandemic but, being a new form of virus, pathogenesis of disease causation is not fully understood and drugs and vaccines against this virus are still being tested so that no effective drugs or vaccines have been advised by regulatory authority. In this context, the Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India has recommended 'Ayush Kwath' to improve the immunity and combat the infection. Our objective of this literature review is to review the role of immunity in pathogenesis of COVID-19 and role of Ayush Kwath against the virus and regulation of immunity. Current review was conducted using a search of available literature on COVID-19 and immunity, Vyadhikshamatwa, Ayurveda and COVID-19, Rasayana, Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, immunomodulatory effects of medicinal plants; Tulsi/Holy Basil/Ocimum sanctum, Dalchini/Cinnamon/Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Sunthi/Ginger/Zingiber officinale and Marich/Black Pepper/Piper nigrum. Ayurveda, being an ancient science have both medicinal and cultural values and had stimulated our kitchen and influenced what we ate in different seasons and the remedies we used for common ailments. Herbs such as Tulsi, Marich, Sunthi, Dalchini are the most commonly used and easily available drugs in home. Thus, Ayush Kwath due to its immune-modulatory, antiviral, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet, anti-atherosclerotic, hepato-protective, reno-protective properties; seems to be effective in immuno-regulation for controlling viral infections like COVID-19. Further pre-clinical and clinical trials need to be done for the evaluation of safety and efficacy of this polyherbal formulation."

      "Background:Oral candidiasis is a common fungal infection caused by Candida albicans. In recent years, Candida species have shown resistance against many synthetic drugs, which has highlighted the need for novel antifungal drugs with fewer side effects for effective management of candidiasis. Several studies have suggested that some plant species possess promising antimicrobial compounds. Piper betle and Ocimum sanctum Linn are such common medicinal plants that show strong antimicrobial activity by the release of secondary metabolites. However, the effect of these plants on oral candidiasis has not been studied and hence, the present study aimed to evaluate the antifungal activity of these plant extracts on the subcultures of C. albicans and compared with a standard drug, fluconazole. Materials and Methods:Subcultures of C. albicans obtained from oral thrush patients were used in the present study. Ethanolic and ethyl acetate extracts of P. betle (betel) and O. sanctum L. (tulsi) leaves were prepared by cold extraction method. The anticandidal activity and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were evaluated using disc diffusion method and microbroth dilution method, respectively. Values were compared with the standard drug fluconazole. Results:Both the extracts exhibited anticandidal activity on the subcultures of C. albicans. The ethyl acetate extract of mature betel leaf showed a maximum zone of inhibition (26 mm) when compared with tulsi and fluconazole (13 mm). Betel leaf extract showed better MIC values (125 μg/ml) than tulsi (2000 μg/ml). However, these values were high when compared with those of fluconazole (62.5 μg/ml). Conclusion:Ethyl acetate extract of mature betel leaf exhibited good anticandidal activity than that of tulsi and fluconazole."

      "Introduction:Chlorhexidine (CHX) interacts with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and herbal irrigants such as neem and tulsi to form precipitate which contains para-chloroaniline (PCA). No studies till date have reported about metal elements present in this combination as well as in irrigants. Aim:The aim of this study was to evaluate the precipitate formed on combination of different irrigants, weigh the amount of precipitate formed, and to analyze 35 different metal elements in each irrigant, precipitate formed as well as in PCA. Materials and Methods:Seven irrigants, namely 2% CHX gluconate, 3% NaOCl, 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 5% neem, 5% tulsi, 5% Aloe vera, and 5% garlic were taken in different test tubes. Group (1-6): 1 ml of CHX is mixed with 1 ml of 3% NaOCl/17% EDTA/5% neem/5% tulsi/5% A. vera/5% garlic. Group (7-11): 1 ml of 3% NaOCl is mixed with 1 ml of 17% EDTA/5% neem/5% tulsi/5% A. vera/5% garlic. Group (12-15): 1 ml of 17% EDTA is mixed with 1 ml of 5% neem/5% tulsi/5% A. vera/5% garlic. Group (16-18): 1 ml of 5% neem is mixed with 1 ml of 5% tulsi/5% A. vera/5% garlic. Group (19 and 20): 1 ml of 5% tulsi is mixed with 5% A. vera/5% garlic. Group 21 includes 1 ml of 5% A. vera and 5% garlic. Each group is observed for any precipitate formation, and precipitate formed was weighed. Samples such as 2% CHX gluconate, 3% NaOCl, 17% EDTA, 5% neem, 5% tulsi, 5% A. vera, PCA, and precipitate formed in each group were analyzed for 35 different metal elements using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Statistical Analysis:One-way ANOVA and Post hoc Tukey's test for the precipitate formed. Results:Precipitate formation was seen in CHX + NaOCl (reddish-brown), CHX + EDTA (white), CHX + neem (light green), CHX + A. vera (green), CHX + tulsi (dark green), CHX + garlic (beige). ICP-MS analysis showed the presence of International Agency for Research on Cancer Group 1 carcinogens in NaOCl, CHX, EDTA, and PCA. Conclusion:Carcinogenic metals are undetected in herbal irrigants which is found to be risk free alternatives in near future."
