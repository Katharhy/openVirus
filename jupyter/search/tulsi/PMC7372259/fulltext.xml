Among the communicable diseases. Emerging and Re-emerging viral pathogens causing Global Pandemic with devastating results were emphasised. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS- Cov-2) has caused a pandemic of Coronavirus disease - 19 (Covid-19) with global public health and economic crisis.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> There is an urgent need for diagnostic and therapeutic countermeasures and rapid development of a vaccine for prevention and control of this formidable disease. Since the WHO notification of first case of this disease on 31st Dec, 2019 and a complete genome sequence of the virus on Jan 5, 2020, global attempts to produce a suitable vaccine are ongoing in scores of laboratories.</p><p id="p0015">Most of the Coroviruses in humans including COVID-19 are derived from bats and there is a variable similarity between them. The whole genome sequence of COVID - 19 has about 50% similarity to that of MERS- CoV. The novel virus is a single strand RNA which attaches to the human cell using through angiotensin converting enzyme 11 (ACE-2) receptors like Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). There is a continuing evolution of this virus globally including the ones seen in Eastern India. The geographic distribution, and severity of disease and risk of subsequent waves caused by these genomic variants is currently unknown.</p><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Phases of vaccine development<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></title><p id="p0020">Various phases of vaccine development are:</p><p id="p0025">Preclinical trials are done in suitable animals for safely and efficacy by challenge studies.</p><p id="p0030">Clinical Studies are made in 4 phases:</p><p id="p0035">Phase I: Vaccines are given to a limited number of human volunteers with emphasis on safety and also to monitor the immune response. Phase II: This is done by vaccine administration to a few hundred volunteers of various age groups to further study safety and efficacy. Phase III: It is done by giving vaccine to thousands of volunteers to monitor protection and safety. Finally the data is analysed and evaluated for submission to regulatory authorities for approval. Phase IV: It is post-marketing surveillance for protection and any adverse events.</p><p id="p0040">The whole process may take several years. However, in an emergency situation as now, it can be compressed by simultaneous phase 1 to 3 trials and scientific collaboration in various institutions.

It is the most used vaccine used in the world and ~ 85%. Children in India are vaccinated at birth. Various epidemiological studies show that it significantly reduces disseminated tuberculosis and its mortality in infants. This is due to protection by BCG against unrelated respiratory pathogens and neonatal sepsis. BCG activates innate cells which engulf and kill virus. (Trained Immunity). Another related organism, Mycobacterium vaccae also has protective action in mouse model and humans against tuberculosis when used for immunotherapy. BCG enhances innate immunity and may reduce viral load of COVID-19 and may reduce cytokine storm. BCG has a general boosting effect. Some ecological studies do suggest a &#x0201c;link between prior BCG vaccine and recorded cases of COVID-19&#x0201d;. However, more studies are required. Professor David Levine from University of California, Berkeley states that there is a &#x0201c;shred of evidence&#x0201d; from studies in Spain and Italy that BCG may protect against COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><label>6</label><title>Timeline of vaccines<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></title><p id="p0090">As of now around 200 vaccines are under development.
