    "Background:Surge of cancer incidence, effects of chemotherapeutic agents and their cost and reduced survival and responsiveness to treatment have led to shift of attention of researchers toward herbal remedies to look for newer dimension in cancer therapy. Ocimum sanctum, Holy Basil or Tulsi, holiest herb well used in the Indian household, has drawn much attention toward its various health benefits, especially anti-cancer property. The present study was carried out to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of O. sanctum on leukemic cell lines K562. Materials and Methods:Dry and aqueous extracts of two types of Tulsi leaves (Rama Tulsi and Krishna Tulsi) were evaluated for a dose-dependent cytotoxicity and anti-proliferative against K562 cell lines, leukoerythroid progenitor leukemic cell lines by 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. Half-maximal inhibitory concentration was evaluated for each of the extracts. Results:Both dry and aqueous extracts of both types of Tulsi leaves demonstrated a significant amount of cytotoxicity against the studied cell lines. Conclusion:This being preliminary study, we propose the initial finding of cytotoxic abilities of the herb against the leukemic cell lines and recommend a more detailed evaluation of the herb and its components."
