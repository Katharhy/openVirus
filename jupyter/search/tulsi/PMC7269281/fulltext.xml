The International Agency for Research on Cancer quotes the statistics to be 14.1 million new cancer cases, 8.2 million cancer deaths and 32.6 million people living with cancer (within 5 years of the diagnosis) in 2012 worldwide.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] By the year 2030, it is projected that there will be &#x0223c;26 million new cancer cases and 17 million cancer deaths per year. The global distribution of cancer and types of cancer that predominate continues to change, especially in economically developing countries. Low- and middle-income countries accounted for about half (51%) of all cancers worldwide in 1975; this proportion increased to 55% in 2007 and is projected to reach 61% by the year 2050.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The existing cancer therapeutics and advancements in research have failed to promise the expectations toward curability of cancer. Understanding of complex cancer genetics and genesis remains still an unsolved mystery to humans, at least the growing cancer deaths and predictions suggest so. The magnitude of this problem necessitates the exploration of newer avenues.</p><p>Natural products have been a rich source of valuable agents to medicine. Natural compounds or compounds related to them contribute to more than 50% of currently available drugs. Above 60% is the contribution of natural products to cancer therapeutics. Currently, more than 30 compounds of natural origin are in different phases of the clinical study for the treatment of different types of cancer.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Ocimum sanctum</title><p>Scientific classification</p><p>Kingdom: Plantae</p><p>(Unranked) Angiosperms</p><p>(Unranked) <italic>Eudicots</italic></p><p>(Unranked) <italic>Asterids</italic></p><p>Order: Lamiales</p><p>Family: <italic>Lamiaceae</italic></p><p>Genus: <italic>Ocimum</italic></p><p>Species: <italic>Ocimum tenuiflorum</italic></p><p>Binomial name: <italic>O.tenuiflorum</italic> or <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> L.</p><p><italic>O. sanctum</italic> (Sanskrit &#x02013; Tulsi and English &#x02013; holy basil) is considered to be one of the holiest and sacred herbs documented in Ayurveda. Tulsi is an aromatic shrub and is known in Ayurveda as &#x0201c;The Incomparable One,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Mother Medicine of Nature&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;The Queen of Herbs&#x0201d; and is revered as an &#x0201c;elixir of life&#x0201d; that is without equal for both its medicinal and spiritual properties.

These functions are often attributed to Tulsi's high content of phenolic compounds and anti-oxidant properties, with Krishna Tulsi (black/purple variety) having a higher phenolic content and anti-oxidant capacity than white Vana (wild) Tulsi.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Various documented beneficial effects of <italic>O. sanctum</italic> include anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, hypolipidemic, immune modulatory and anti-stress activity.

Inhibition of these kinases plays a significant role in limiting the mitotic potential of these cells.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Apoptosis plays a vital role in regulating K562 cells and can be induced by changes in these cell lines.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] BCR-ABL, BCL-2 and various other cellular components play a role in apoptosis, thereby regulating the K562 cell-cycle.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Similarly, the p53 gene, tumor suppressor gene, plays a key role in apoptosis. These p53 genes target various cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that causes cell differentiation and arrests in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and subsequently triggering apoptotic pathway.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] K562 leukemic cell lines are known to have variations in the levels of components induced by BCR-ABL gene and other cellular components that results in reduced apoptosis and cancer cell growth.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The above given properties and the ability to generate these changes in cell cycle regulation provide a potential target for anti-cancer drugs. One of the landmark drugs that utilized these cell lines and led to breakthrough discovery was tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, which is capable of inducing molecular remission in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia.

The cells are then solubilized with an organic solvent (e.g., dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO], Isopropanol) and the released, solubilized Formazan reagent is measured spectrophotometrically.

We could also demonstrate the cytotoxic effect was dose-dependent and established that activity was similar in all the groups evaluated. The medicinal herbs have always provided insight and lead to the pharmacological industry since time immemorial. The present study also provides some insight into the novel anti-cancer effects of the herb on leukemic cell lines. The exact mechanism of the action was not evaluated in this study; however, various mechanisms of the components of the herb with anticancer activity discussed could be the mode of activity exhibited.</p><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Future prospects</title><p>This being preliminary study, we propose the initial finding of cytotoxic abilities of the herb against the leukemic cell lines and recommend a more detailed evaluation of the herb and its components. Since various animal and in-vitro studies have established anti-cancer response and also the herb has been used regularly both in Ayurvedic medicine and household, without any adverse reactions, the medicinal use of this herbal extract needs to evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-12" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Solowey</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Lichtenstein</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Sallon</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Paavilainen</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Solowey</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Lorberboum-Galski</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Evaluating medicinal plants for anticancer activity</article-title><source>ScientificWorldJournal</source><year>2014</year><volume>2014</volume><fpage>721402</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25478599</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Thun</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>DeLancey</surname><given-names>JO</given-names></name><name><surname>Center</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Jemal</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ward</surname><given-names>EM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The global burden of cancer: Priorities for prevention</article-title><source>Carcinogenesis</source><year>2010</year><volume>31</volume><fpage>100</fpage><lpage>10</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19934210</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gordaliza</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Natural products as leads to anticancer drugs</article-title><source>Clin Transl Oncol</source><year>2007</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>767</fpage><lpage>76</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18158980</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pattanayak</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Behera</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Das</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Panda</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title><italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> linn.
