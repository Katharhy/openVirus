contain transmission. This poses the question of whether preparedness for a
future pandemic should include plans to use antiviral drugs to mitigate
transmission.</p><p>Simulations using a standard transmission model that allows for infected arrivals
and delayed vaccination show that attempts to contain transmission require
relatively few antiviral doses. In contrast, persistent use of antiviral drugs
when the reproduction number remains above 1 use very many doses and are
unlikely to reduce the eventual attack rate appreciably unless the stockpile is
very large. A second model, in which the community has a household structure,
shows that the effectiveness of a strategy of dispensing antiviral drugs to
infected households decreases rapidly with time delays in dispensing the
antivirals. Using characteristics of past pandemics it is estimated that at
least 80&#x00025; of primary household cases must present upon show of symptoms
to have a chance of containing transmission by dispensing antiviral drugs to
households. To determine data needs, household outbreaks were simulated with
50&#x00025; receiving antiviral drugs early and 50&#x00025; receiving antiviral
drugs late. A test to compare the size of household outbreaks indicates that at
least 100&#x02013;200 household outbreaks need to be monitored to find evidence
that antiviral drugs can mitigate transmission of the newly emerged virus.</p><p>Use of antiviral drugs in an early attempt to contain transmission should be part
of preparedness plans for a future influenza pandemic. Data on the incidence of
the first 350 cases and the eventual attack rates of the first 200 hundred
household outbreaks should be used to estimate the initial reproduction number
<italic>R</italic> and the effectiveness of antiviral drugs to mitigate
transmission. Use of antiviral drugs to mitigate general transmission should
cease if these estimates indicate that containment of transmission is
unlikely.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The threat from avian influenza H1N5 prompted many countries to establish a stockpile
of antiviral drugs, <xref rid="pone.0017764-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017764-Lett1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017764-Esveld1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017764-Harrod1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, such as oseltamivir and zananivir. The size of the
antiviral stockpile and its proposed use, therapy or prophylaxis, were keenly
debated during the preparation of pandemic management plans. The emergence of
pandemic H1N1 in 2009 prompted a variety of strategies for the use of antiviral
drugs and motivates this look at the use of antiviral drugs for prophylaxis and
implications for decisions on the size of an antiviral stockpile for a future
pandemic.</p><p>The possibility of using antiviral drugs for prophylaxis, to mitigate transmission of
pandemic influenza, arises because their use to protect against currently
circulating strains of influenza indicates a reduced chance of being infected <xref rid="pone.0017764-Hayden1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017764-Hayden2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017764-Hayden3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017764-Moscona1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017764-Welliver1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Also observed
are reduced levels of virus shedding <xref rid="pone.0017764-Hayden1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017764-Hayden2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017764-HaydenFGet1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017764-Nicholson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017764-Treanor1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017764-Jefferson1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017764-Jefferson2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, which suggests a reduction
in infectivity in the event of a breakthrough infection. Use of these observations
in modeling studies suggests that stockpiles of antiviral drugs held by some nations
are sufficiently large to defer the peak of the epidemic until a newly developed
vaccine is available to control transmission <xref rid="pone.0017764-Ferguson1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017764-Longini1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017764-Barnes1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017764-McCaw1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. These results could be expected
to apply to pandemic H1N1 since, with a reproduction number estimated to be of the
order 1.2-1.5 in some localities <xref rid="pone.0017764-Cowling1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017764-Mercer1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, its transmissibility is relatively modest.</p><p>In practice, the antiviral drugs dispensed during the 2009 influenza pandemic
generally failed to contain transmission. This prompts us to ask why timely
administration of antiviral drugs to a sufficient number of cases, exposed
individuals and individuals at high risk of exposure did not occur. Could we have
done better? On a future occasion, should we even attempt to contain transmission
with the assistance of antiviral drugs? A consideration of these questions will
inform preparedness plans for the next pandemic.</p><p>Some argue that using antiviral drugs to mitigate transmission merely wastes doses
that are needed to treat cases experiencing severe disease. Here &#x02018;dose&#x02019;
means a course of antiviral drugs, typically lasting seven days. The fear of wastage
is fed by the fact that the protective effect of antiviral drugs acts only for the
duration of the dose (e.g. 7 days), so that individuals might need several doses
during a pandemic. On the other hand, if prophylactic use of antiviral drugs is able
to reduce the total number individuals infected then there will be fewer cases with
severe disease in need of treatment with antiviral drugs. The optimal allocation of
antiviral doses to treatment and prophylaxis depends on the size of the stockpile,
effectiveness of antiviral drugs for treatment and protection from infection, as
well as the transmission and disease progression characteristics of the new virus
strain. Many of these factors will not be known prior to the pandemic. However, it
is clearly worth asking whether a relatively modest number of antiviral doses used
for prophylaxis might be able to reduce the eventual attack rate substantially.</p><p>Here we use simple models that contain the key features needed to assess the impact
of using antiviral drugs to mitigate transmission. The aim is to clarify the
potential benefit of timely use of antivirals for prophylaxis and its limitations.
Specifically, we ask whether use of antiviral drugs should be included in an attempt
to contain an emerged pandemic, we provide guidance on the size of stockpile needed
for an attempt at containment and consider what data need to be collected at the
start of a pandemic to assess the prophylactic effectiveness of antiviral drugs
against the new virus strain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The basic model</title><p>To assess the potential for antiviral drugs to mitigate transmission, we begin

removal is an individual who is immune as a consequence of vaccination or
recovery from an infection. Let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e001.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>,

of transmission and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e007.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is the recovery
rate. For our purpose, we have added to the standard SIR epidemic model a rate
<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e008.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> of immunisation by vaccination and a rate
<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e009.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> of importing newly infected individuals from other
locations. These two rates may be time-dependent. The initial reproduction
number is the number of secondary infections generated by a typical single
primary case at the beginning when no one else has been infected. For this model
it is given by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e010.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. We do not refer
to this <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e011.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> as the <italic>basic</italic> reproduction number
because we allow for the possibility that awareness of a new pandemic strain may
have changed behaviour and individuals may have some immunity against the new
strain from previous exposure to other influenza strains.</p><fig id="pone-0017764-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0017764.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Baseline transmission model.</title><p>Mass vaccination and arrival of infected individuals from other locations

Attack rates observed during the pandemics of 1918, 1957, 1968 and 2009 are, for
the most part, consistent with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e060.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, or less. It is,
of course, possible that a pandemic strain with a higher transmission rate might
evolve. Indeed, the basic reproduction number of the 1918 pandemic strain was
almost certainly substantially higher, but compliance with public health
measures based on social distancing during this pandemic was high because of the
recognised severity of the disease. This is evident by observing how incidence
changed as social distancing measures were introduced and removed; see Caley
<italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0017764-Caley1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. As a result, although susceptibility was uniformly
high the effective reproduction number, prior to depletion of susceptibles, was
about 1.5. A high level of compliance is also likely in the event of a future
pandemic strain with severe disease, suggesting that an initial effective
reproduction number below 1.5 is likely from social distancing measures
alone.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Distributing antiviral drugs to affected households</title><p>It is natural that individuals responsible for distributing antiviral drugs are
concerned about wastage in attempts to reduce transmission, when these drugs are
thought necessary to treat severe cases and to protect essential-service
personnel, such as health care workers and police, <xref rid="pone.0017764-Barnes1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Faced with competing
demands it is tempting to limit community distribution of antiviral drugs to
cases with laboratory-confirmed infection and individuals with confirmed
exposure. Unfortunately, laboratory confirmation and contact tracing are time
consuming and insistence on such confirmation makes it impossible to administer
antiviral drugs quickly enough to contain transmission. A strategy of dispensing
antiviral drugs quickly and liberally to household members as soon as the first
household case presents seems to be what is needed. A focus on households helps
to clarify who is targeted for antiviral prophylaxis and the co-location of its
members makes timely dispensing to exposed individuals feasible. We therefore
look at transmission in a community of households with a focus on timeliness and

of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e062.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and the mean number of eventual cases, we adopt the
effect formulation of Glass and Becker <xref rid="pone.0017764-Glass1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. They model the effect of
antiviral drugs by a change in the population dynamics of the virus population
within the host and translate this to the corresponding change in
<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e063.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, the probability that a susceptible individual avoids
being infected by a single infected household member of generation
<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e064.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. Infectives of one generation are the individuals
infected by the infectives of the previous generation, where household
generation 0 contains only the primary household case. For our purpose we also
include the corresponding effect on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e065.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, the mean number
of cases a generation-<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e066.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> infective
generates outside their household. As in <xref rid="pone.0017764-Glass1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, individuals who are not
infectives of generations 0 and 1 are assumed to receive antiviral drugs before
being infected and therefore derive the full protective effect of these drugs.
Then the values of the probabilities <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e067.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> are same for
<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e068.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. As in <xref rid="pone.0017764-Glass1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, we use a Reed-Frost model, <xref rid="pone.0017764-Bailey1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017764-Becker2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, for within-household
transmission with the modification that the probability of avoiding infection is
generation-dependent. The 2001 Australian census data was used to allocate a
distribution to household size. With these specifications we compared the value
of the reproduction number <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e069.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> for three
different settings, namely when (i) no antiviral drugs are dispensed, (ii) doses
are dispensed to household members two days after the primary case is infected,
and (iii) doses are dispensed four days after the primary case is infected.</p><p>In order to determine the largest fraction of non-compliance that still permits
transmission to be contained, we also compute the effect of antiviral drugs on
the reproduction number <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e070.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> when a fraction
<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e071.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> of primary household cases fails to present early enough
for the household to receive antiviral drugs.</p><p>Finally, we determine how many household outbreaks might need to be observed to
provide evidence that the antiviral drugs are indeed effective against the newly
emerged virus strain. Here we look at establishing effectiveness via a simple
comparison of the mean outbreak size in households that receive antiviral drugs
early with the mean outbreak size in households that receive them late. This
comparison of means must accommodate heterogeneity in variances and a number of
tests permit this. We have chosen to use the Alexander-Govern test <xref rid="pone.0017764-Alexander1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, because
its computations are relatively simple, good performance has been demonstrated
<xref rid="pone.0017764-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>

parameters assume their baseline value. This allows for one imported infective
per day for every million population members, for a duration of six months, and
all the transmission chains they generate. Prior to the 2009 pandemic many
nations held antiviral stockpiles with doses that numbered more than 20&#x00025;
of their population. Only a small fraction of this would be needed for sustained
containment of transmission until the vaccine controls transmission.</p><p>The 1.2&#x00025; we calculated above is based on sustained containment for six
months. When containment is not achievable we would become aware of this quite
early and would abandon the attempt of containment having spent a small fraction
of the stockpile. For example, Becker <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0017764-Becker3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> show that
a useful estimate of the initial reproduction number is obtained once the

<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e107.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> doses per case and a population of 1 million, we would
therefore abandon the attempt at containment having spent antiviral doses

increases linearly with the rate of importations
(<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e109.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>), and the time until the vaccine is able to control
transmission (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e110.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>). Together, these terms contribute the factor
<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e111.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, which is the mean number of importations of infected
cases from the start of the pandemic until the vaccine is able to reduce the
reproduction number below 1. The remaining factor in (3) is
<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e112.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, the mean number of doses dispensed for each outbreak
initiated by a single infective. Its dependence on

satisfy condition (i), but condition (ii) was not realised. We now consider some
possible reasons for the failure to distribute antiviral drugs effectively.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Distributing antiviral drugs to affected households</title><p>Consider now transmission through a community of households. Suppose that every
infection that an individual generates outside their own household is of a
randomly selected community member. During the containment phase of the
pandemic, the force of infection acting on a susceptible from outside the
household is negligible relative to the force of infection exerted by an
infectious household member. Using this we can show that, in a community of
households, the number of doses of antiviral drugs dispensed per community
member is<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e125.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e126.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is the mean number

of primary cases generated in the community by all the cases of a household
outbreak initiated by a newly-infected individual who is selected randomly from
the community. The derivation of (5) is outlined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0017764.s001">Appendix
S1</xref>. Equation (5) is the equivalent of (4) for a community of households.
To be valid it requires, similarly to (4), that the reproduction number for

1.</p><p>Equation (5) can accommodate a variety of strategies for dispensing antiviral

conclude, as for (4), that an attempt to contain transmission uses relatively
few doses of antiviral drugs, be it sustained containment of transmission or an
attempt to contain transmission that is abandoned once it becomes clear that
containment is not feasible.</p><p>The key to containing transmission in a community of households lies in the

assumption that the effectiveness of antiviral drugs for reducing susceptibility
and infectivity for the emerged virus strain is as estimated for currently

symptoms are not severe or present late due to delayed access to health

pandemic H1N1 influenza in 2009 was not successful because the fraction of
infected individuals who failed to present, or presented late, was too high. It

demonstrated effectiveness against currently circulating influenza strains.
There is no guarantee that these drugs will be equally effective, or even
effective at all, against a newly emerged pandemic strain of influenza. Informed
decisions about the use of antiviral drugs in a pandemic require effectiveness
for reducing transmission to be established from incidence data collected early
in a pandemic. In preparation we need to know what data, and how much, are
required to establish effectiveness. Glass and Becker <xref rid="pone.0017764-Glass1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> consider this question by
estimating two specific parameters, one quantifying the effect on susceptibility
and the other the effect on infectivity. Here we look at establishing
effectiveness by comparing mean outbreak size in households that receive
antiviral drugs early and households that receive them late. We have to allow
for different household sizes. Households of size one provide no information for
our comparison and we restrict attention to households of sizes two, three and
four. The Australian census data indicate that the relative frequency of
households of size 2, 3 and 4 is about 50&#x00025;, 25&#x00025; and 25&#x00025;.
Allowing for size-biased sampling we expect to observe roughly an equal number
of outbreaks in households of size 2, 3 and 4. Accordingly, we assume that we
observe <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e171.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> outbreaks in households that receive antiviral drugs at
onset of symptoms in the primary household case in households of size 2, 3 and
4, making <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e172.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> households. In addition, we assume that we observe
<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e173.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> outbreaks in households that receive antiviral drugs
late (two days after the onset of symptoms in the primary case) in households of
size 2, 3 and 4, giving observations on another <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e174.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> household
outbreaks.</p><p>An Alexander-Govern test statistic <xref rid="pone.0017764-Alexander1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> is computed for the
comparison in households of a given size and values of these three test
statistics are then summed and the null hypothesis of no effect is rejected if
the sum exceeds the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e175.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> percentile of the

power curves for four antiviral effect scenarios similar to the ones considered

effects for currently circulating influenza strains, <xref rid="pone.0017764-Glass1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In the simulations we used

infectivity and their effect on susceptibility is to induce full,
partial and zero protection, respectively. Simulations for curve (d)
assume no effect on infectivity and a partial effect on
susceptibility.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.g006"/></fig><p>The antiviral effect on susceptibility is to reduce the probability of
transmission of an infection occurring during a contact by a factor
<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e182.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> for a susceptible who is on antiviral drugs at the time.
The effect on infectivity depends on the time when the infective starts taking
the antiviral drug and is measured by the factor by which the area under the
infectiousness function is reduced (i.e. the potential to infect others is
reduced). Let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e183.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> denote the factor by which the area under the
infectiousness function is reduced when the individual commences taking the drug
at onset of symptoms. The curves (a), (b) and (c) of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017764-g006">Figure 6</xref> show the power as

respectively. Each point on the curve is obtained by simulating 500 data sets
and observing the fraction that reject the no-effect hypothesis when our
modified Alexander-Govern test is used. Curve (d) assumes the effect scenario
with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e187.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, no effect on infectivity, and
<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e188.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, partial effect on susceptibility.</p><p>When considering the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017764-g006">Figure 6</xref> it is useful to keep in mind that monitoring infected
households for cases is labour-intensive. In practice, monitoring more than 300
household outbreaks during the busy early stages of a pandemic would be very
challenging. We would therefore like <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e189.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, the total number
of household outbreaks monitored, to be less than 300. Let us take a power of
80&#x00025; as a minimum requirement. Inspecting curves (a), (b) and (c), which
are generated by including a common effect on infectivity, illustrates that
observations on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e190.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> household
outbreaks has a power of at least 80&#x00025; of detecting an antiviral effect if
there is also a moderate effect on susceptibility, but many more households are
needed if susceptibility is not reduced. Comparing curves (b) and (d), which are
generated by including a moderate effect on susceptibility, illustrates that a
total of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e191.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> household outbreaks are needed to detect an effect if
there is also a moderate effect on infectivity, but many more households are
needed if the effect on infectivity is weak.</p><p>The hope that a direct comparison of mean outbreak size for households would
require less data than a comparison based on specific parameters, as in <xref rid="pone.0017764-Glass1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, was not
realised. The two approaches indicate approximately the same data needs.
However, it is reassuring that a simple test based on minimal assumptions about
the nature of transmission in the community can detect an antiviral effect with
about the same amount of data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our aim was to see whether antiviral drugs should be used to mitigate general
transmission following emergence of a future pandemic influenza strain. The main
conclusion is a strong recommendation that liberal and timely use of antiviral drugs
should be part of an attempt at local containment of transmission. The case for this
lies in the substantial benefits of successful containment and the fact that the
accumulated use of antiviral drugs over a period of successful containment is
modest, even when the immigration rate of infected arrivals is high. The recommended
plan for the attempt at containment must include abandoning prophylactic use of
antiviral drugs once there is strong empirical evidence that containment is unlikely
to succeed, because continued use of antiviral drugs to mitigate transmission when
early containment fails is likely to use a very sizable supply of antiviral drugs
with little benefit. The likelihood of successful containment should be evident by
the time 350 cases have been reported and we have data on 200 household
outbreaks.</p><p>Our basic first model acknowledges that the first few doses of antivirals dispensed
per case can be targeted more effectively than a similar number of additional doses.
That is, dispensing very many doses per cases is wasteful and likely to attract
justified criticisms and objections. A practical way to dispense doses to close
contacts only is to target household members of cases who present. Accordingly, our
second model considers transmission through a community with a household structure
and we considered delays in presentation. The conclusion that an attempt to contain
transmission uses relatively few antiviral doses continues to hold in this setting.
We also conclude that successful containment of transmission, if possible, requires
early presentation by the primary household case. We cannot wait for laboratory
confirmation of a strain-specific infection. The number of doses used by an attempt
to contain transmission is so small that one can afford, while a chance of
containing transmission remains, to be liberal in dispensing doses to household
members of any early presenter with clinical symptoms that are consistent with a
pandemic-strain infection.</p><p>Next we allowed for failure by a fraction of primary household cases to present soon
after onset of symptoms. The conclusion is that, even when antivirals are adequately
effective, containment is not possible if more than a modest fraction of primary
household cases fail to present early. In our illustration we required the
proportion of primary cases who fail to present early to be smaller than 20&#x00025;.
This 20&#x00025; includes asymptomatic cases, mildly-symptomatic cases who do not
bother to present and symptomatic cases unable to gain timely access to a health
service provider.</p><p>Finally, appropriate data must be collected at the start of the local outbreak to
estimate the initial reproduction number and to confirm that antiviral drugs do
reduce transmission of the new strain of influenza virus. It is concluded that we
can expect to detect an antiviral effect on transmission from data on
<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e192.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> household outbreaks only if the antiviral drug has a
moderate effect on both susceptibility and infectivity (of the same order as for
currently circulating strains of influenza).</p><p>These conclusions are not consequences of the simplifying assumptions made in the
specific models of this paper. They rely primarily on the threshold result that
<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e193.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> implies containment and this result holds under a very wide
range of community settings and disease characteristics. The likelihood of achieving
<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e194.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> depends critically on the transmission characteristics of
the newly emerged disease and our ability to deliver antiviral drugs early enough to
affected households. With pandemic H1N1<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e195.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> we were close in some
locations. For example, in Western Australia, as in some other localities, most
early cases were imported infections indicating that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e196.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> was maintained for a
substantial period, <xref rid="pone.0017764-Mercer2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. With clear understanding and confidence that continued
liberal use of antiviral drugs is the best option at that stage it may have been
possible to sustain <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e197.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> longer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0017764.s001"><label>Appendix S1</label><caption><p>
