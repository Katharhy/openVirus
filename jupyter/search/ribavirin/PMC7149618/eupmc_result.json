    "Viruses are major pathogenic agents causing a variety of serious diseases in humans, other animals, and plants. Drugs that combat viral infections are called antiviral drugs. There are no effective antiviral drugs for many viral infections. However, there are several drugs for influenza, a couple of drugs for herpesviruses, and some new antiviral drugs for treatment of HIV and hepatitis C infections. The arsenal of antivirals is complex. As of March 2014, it consists of approximately 50 drugs approved by the FDA, approximately half of which are directed against HIV. Antiviral drug creation strategies are focused on two different approaches: targeting the viruses themselves or targeting host cell factors. Direct virus-targeting antiviral drugs include attachment inhibitors, entry inhibitors, uncoating inhibitors, protease inhibitors, polymerase inhibitors, nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, and integrase inhibitors. Protease inhibitors (darunavir, atazanavir, and ritonavir), viral DNA polymerase inhibitors (acyclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, and tenofovir), and an integrase inhibitor (raltegravir) are included in the list of Top 200 Drugs by sales for the 2010s."
