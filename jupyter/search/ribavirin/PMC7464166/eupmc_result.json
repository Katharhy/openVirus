    "Antiviral polymers are part of a major campaign led by the scientific community in recent years. Facing this most demanding of campaigns, two main approaches have been undertaken by scientists. First, the classic approach involves the development of relatively small molecules having antiviral properties to serve as drugs. The other approach involves searching for polymers with antiviral properties to be used as prescription medications or viral spread prevention measures. This second approach took two distinct directions. The first, using polymers as antiviral drug-delivery systems, taking advantage of their biodegradable properties. The second, using polymers with antiviral properties for on-contact virus elimination, which will be the focus of this review. Anti-viral polymers are obtained by either the addition of small antiviral molecules (such as metal ions) to obtain ion-containing polymers with antiviral properties or the use of polymers composed of an organic backbone and electrically charged moieties like polyanions, such as carboxylate containing polymers, or polycations such as quaternary ammonium containing polymers. Other approaches include moieties hybridized by sulphates, carboxylic acids, or amines and/or combining repeating units with a similar chemical structure to common antiviral drugs. Furthermore, elevated temperatures appear to increase the anti-viral effect of ions and other functional moieties."
