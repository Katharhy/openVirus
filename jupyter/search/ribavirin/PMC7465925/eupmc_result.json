    "The adverse events of antiviral drugs are dose-dependent and often reversible. The nervous system is often affected and to date, many studies have been published regarding the central nervous system toxicity of antiviral agents. They may cause significant neuropsychiatric complications, which range from mild symptoms such as irritability and difficulty sleeping to severe complications such as depression, psychosis, and painful peripheral neuropathy, side effects which may necessitate discontinuation of treatment. The pathogenetic mechanisms may involve molecular targets common to other centrally active drugs, including human monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A), serotonin receptors, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) GABA-A receptors, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors and others. Notable examples include oseltamivir which may act as MAO inhibitor and efavirenz, which has an affinity for serotonin 5-HT2 and GABA-A receptors, the serotonin transporter, the MAO enzyme, and the vesicular monoamine transporter, with subjective effects which may be similar to those of the psychedelic hallucinogen lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Other antiviral drugs with prominent nervous system effects include nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, which are associated with the development of peripheral neuropathy after prolonged use (an effect strongly associated with older drugs which have since fallen into disfavor such as stavudine) and interferons, which may cause depression. Clinicians should be familiar with such adverse effects in order to recognise them promptly once they occur and manage them appropriately."
