In this study, we established the first ICR mouse model of CVA4 infection for the evaluation of inactivated vaccines and antiviral drug screening. The CVA4 YT226R strain was selected to infect the neonatal mice and three infectious factors were optimized to establish the infection model. The 3-day-old neonatal mice exhibited clinical symptoms such as hind limb paralysis and death. The severe inflammatory reactions were closely related to the abnormal expression of the acute phase response proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and an imbalance in the IFN-&#x003b3;/IL-4 ratio. Importantly, the inactivated CVA4 whole-virus vaccine induced humoral immune responses in adult females and the maternal antibodies afforded mice complete protection against lethal dose challenges of homologous or heterologous CVA4 strains. Both IFN-&#x003b1;2a and antiserum inhibited the replication of CVA4 and increased the survival rates of neonatal mice during the early stages of infection. This neonatal murine model of CVA4 infection will be useful for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines and for screening of antiviral drugs targeting CVA4 to decrease morbidity and mortality.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>HFMD</kwd><kwd>coxsackievirus A4</kwd><kwd>murine model</kwd><kwd>inactivated vaccine</kwd><kwd>antiviral drugs</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Natural Science Foundation of China</named-content></funding-source><award-id>81802009</award-id><award-id>81601773</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province</named-content></funding-source><award-id>ZR2018PC012</award-id><award-id>ZR2015CL033</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Projects of medical and health technology development program in Shandong province</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2015WS0123</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Taishan Scholars program of Shandong Province</named-content></funding-source><award-id>ts201511056</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 81802009, 81601773], the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, China [grant numbers ZR2018PC012, ZR2015CL033], Projects of medical and health technology development program in Shandong province, China [grant number 2015WS0123] and W.S. was supported by the Taishan Scholars program of Shandong Province, China [grant number ts201511056].</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="52"/><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Coxsackievirus A4 (CVA4) belongs to the family <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, genus <italic>Enterovirus</italic> of linear, non-enveloped, positive polarity single-stranded RNA viruses, which principally cause herpangina and hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in children [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Prior to 2009, viral pathogens associated with HFMD included enterovirus A71 (EVA71) and CVA16; however, in recent years, other types of enteroviruses (EVs), such as CVA4, CVA6 and CVA10 have increased in prevalence [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;3</xref>]. Numerous outbreaks of CVA4 have occurred during recent years in different regions in China, such as Fujian [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], Shandong [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], Sichuan [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], Yunnan [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and Jiangsu [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Other countries, such as Thailand [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], Australia [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Italy [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] have also reported CVA4 infections. Genetic recombination between CVA4 and other EVs has been described generating novel emerging strains which may be associated with more severe disease [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although the majority of CVA4 and EV infections are usually subclinical, these agents are highly contagious and exhibit a broad spectrum of disease presentation in symptomatic cases ranging from mild symptoms such as erythematous maculopapular exanthema [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] to severe outcomes such as aseptic meningitis, myocarditis and acute flaccid paralysis [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Given the increased frequency of CVA4 circulation globally [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], evidence for complex spatiotemporal dynamics in Asia-Europe [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and the emergence of novel CVA recombinants with the potential to spread rapidly in immunologically na&#x000ef;ve populations [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], greater focus is required both on surveillance and also the development of prophylactic and therapeutic approaches.</p><p>At present, there are no specific drugs for the clinical treatment of HFMD. HFMD is currently treated with broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, such as ribavirin [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and glucocorticoids [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which can cause damage to the innate immune system [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and lead to haematopoietic system disorders [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Prophylactic approaches employing vaccination to prevent EV transmission now exist [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and are being combined with existing non-EV vaccines to simplify childhood vaccination regimes [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Antiviral research on EVs is lacking and the establishment of CVA4 infection models for drug development and the examination of the immunogenicity of inactivated CVA4 vaccines is urgently needed. With the wide application of the inactivated EVA71 vaccine among children under five in China [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], it is conceivable that the EV-associated HFMD pathogens will alter in the future as the immune protection can last for &#x0003e;5 years [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Incidence rates of other EVs will likely increase gradually, therefore it is imperative to study the pathogenic mechanisms of other EVs, such as CVA4, and to develop antiviral drugs and vaccines accordingly. In the present study, a CVA4 neonatal murine model was established to analyse viral tissue tropism and pathology and to better elucidate the pathogenicity associated with CVA4 infection. Employing this infection model, we have evaluated the antiviral effects of immune sera and the protective effects of cytokines and maternal antibodies against CVA4.</p></sec><sec id="S002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S002-S2001"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The experimental animals were outbred SPF ICR mice [qualification number: SCXK (Beijing) 2012-0001].

EVA71 vaccines have been successfully developed employing mouse [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and primate [<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] models.

Due to the significant increase in the incidence of CVA4-associated HFMD infections worldwide in recent years [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], it is urgently required to establish a CVA4 infection model for evaluation of both inactivated and attenuated live CVA4 vaccines and for the screening of existing and novel antiviral drugs. In this study, we found inoculation of CVA4 by the i.m. route caused the most rapid onset of illness in the neonatal ICR mice, which we hypothesize may be attributable to the pronounced tropism and elevated replication of CVA4 in muscle tissue and the subsequent systemic dissemination of the virus through the circulatory system. Neonatal mice (&#x02264; 3 d) were most susceptible to CVA4 and showed high mortality rates. By optimizing these factors, a CVA4 infection model with high levels of repeatability for clinical scores, disease onset and duration of illness was established.</p><p>In the present study, we found that CVA4 had a copy number of up to 10<sup>6</sup> copies/mg tissue in the musculature, which was associated with rupture and necrosis of muscle fibres and muscle bundles. Despite the relatively low viral load in the lungs (10<sup>3</sup> copies/mg), the mice showed severe diffuse alveolar damage and moderate inflammatory infiltration. EV infections can induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines as part of the innate immune response and immune regulation to eliminate viruses. However, it is thought that the overwhelming viral replication combined with increased levels of cytokines is one of the key factors inducing severe HFMD [<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Indeed, high levels of cytokines and chemokines in cerebrospinal fluid, including TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, and IFN-&#x003b3;, are associated with brain stem encephalitis and pulmonary oedema caused by EVA71 infection [<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41&#x02013;43</xref>.] In this study, the expression levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IFN-&#x003b3; were abnormally high after the lethal dose of CVA4 was administered to neonatal mice. This phenomenon is similar to that observed in children infected with EVA71, in which the expression of IL-6 and IFN-&#x003b3; in serum was significantly elevated [<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Some researchers have proposed that sustained high levels of IL-6 alone can cause severe tissue damage. In support of this, anti-IL-6 treatments significantly reduce tissue damage and enhance immune cell activity [<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Similarly, we found that mice challenged with CVA4 had higher clinical scores after treatment with exogenous IL-6 which accelerated the death of the neonatal mice. In addition, after EV infection in human neuronal cells, the expression levels of IFN-&#x003b3; secreted by Th1 cells is increased, inhibiting the secretion of IL-4 by Th2 cells and resulting in an imbalance of the IFN-&#x003b3;/IL-4 ratio. While the infected cells were rapidly cleared, contemporaneously, excessive inflammatory reactions and cellular immune responses were also produced [<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The expression level of IL-4 was significantly lower in the CVA4-infected mice than that in the control group (mean value: 73.5 vs 165.4&#x02005;pg/mL) in this study. Therefore, we consider that the CVA4-induced high levels of IL-6 and an imbalance of the IFN-&#x003b3;/IL-4 ratio are likely correlated with severe pathological damages.</p><p>Ribavirin is a hypoxanthine nucleoside analog which acts as a broad-spectrum antiviral drug inducing lethal mutations during viral RNA replication [<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Ribavirin inhibits EVA71 replication and reduces paralysis and mortality rates in EVA71-infected mice [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It has been clinically applied in the treatment of HFMD and has anti-CVA4 effect <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>; however, these nucleoside drugs have side effects with long-term administration leading to haematopoietic dysfunction and allergic reactions in children [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Surprisingly, IFN-&#x003b1;2a had strong anti-CVA4 effects (comparable to ribavirin), which significantly reduced the copy number of CVA4. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments showed that IFN-&#x003b1;2a could inhibit CVA4 replication and increase the survival rates of neonatal mice. It is important to note that the protective effect of cytokines is closely related to the time of administration [<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The antiviral effects of cytokines (such as IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-6) mainly functioned in the early stage of viral infection and when administered in the later stages, the cytokines did not alleviate symptoms but instead, led to further deterioration of the disease, which may be due to aggravated immunopathology [<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>With the increasing incidence of CVA4, inoculation with an inactivated CVA4 vaccine may be the most effective measure to prevent infections. A previous study found that human antibodies against EVA71 and CVA16 infections were detected in the serum after 35 weeks of pregnancy [<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The inactivated CVA4 vaccine developed in this study also induced protective antibodies in adult female mice and could be passed on to offspring to protect the pups from the lethal dose of CVA4 challenge. Importantly, the protection rate of pups challenged with both homologous and heterologous CVA4 strains was 100%. However, it did not have neutralizing ability against CVA16, EVA71 and CVA6 strains. Therefore, developing multivalent vaccines using different antigens which elicit balanced immunological responses and afford equivalent protection to each target are urgently needed.</p><p>Anti-CVA4 serum could alleviate the early clinical symptoms of the neonatal mice and the surviving animals fully recovered. However, it had no therapeutic effect on late-stage infected neonatal mice, which may be because the late illness onset of the neonatal mice (&#x02265;3&#x02005;dpi) had irreversible systemic inflammatory responses and/or established nervous system damage. Similarly, severe cases of HFMD caused by EVA71 infection usually progress rapidly. Although the proportion of critically ill patients with EVs infection is &#x02264;1.1%, the number of annual cases exceeds one million in China [<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Therefore, patients with HFMD should be treated with antiviral and symptomatic treatments in a timely manner before irreversible disease deterioration.</p><p>In summary, we have established the first stable neonatal mice model of CVA4 infection which displayed consistent pathological changes and demonstrated the immunogenicity of an inactivated CVA4 whole-virus vaccine. IFN-&#x003b1;2a and antiserum had effective anti-CVA4 effects <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. This neonatal murine model lays a foundation for studying the pathogenesis of CVA4 and for evaluating the effectiveness of vaccines and screening of antiviral drugs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM2939"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" xlink:href="TEMI_A_1673135_SM2939.zip" orientation="portrait" id="d37e215" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="S006"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p>No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>YC</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <etal>et al.</etal></person-group>
