    "Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses belonging to family Coronaviridae and order Nidovirales which cause infections in birds and mammals. Among the human coronaviruses, highly pathogenic ones are Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which have been implicated in severe respiratory syndrome in humans. There are no approved antiviral drugs or vaccines for the treatment of human CoV infection to date. The recent outbreak of new coronavirus pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a high mortality rate and infections around the world which necessitates the need for the discovery of novel anti-coronaviral drugs. Among the coronaviruses proteins, 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is an important drug target against coronaviral infection as the auto-cleavage process catalysed by the enzyme is crucial for viral maturation and replication. The present work is aimed at the identification of suitable lead molecules for the inhibition of 3CLpro enzyme via a computational screening of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved antiviral drugs and phytochemicals. Based on binding energies and molecular interaction studies, we shortlisted five lead molecules (both FDA approved drugs and phytochemicals) for each enzyme targets (SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, SARS-CoV 3CLpro and MERS-CoV 3CLpro). The lead molecules showed higher binding affinity compared to the standard inhibitors and exhibited favourable hydrophobic interactions and a good number of hydrogen bonds with their respective targets. A few promising leads with dual inhibition potential were identified among FDA approved antiviral drugs which include DB13879 (Glecaprevir), DB09102 (Daclatasvir), molecule DB09297 (Paritaprevir) and DB01072 (Atazanavir). Among the phytochemicals, 11,646,359 (Vincapusine), 120,716 (Alloyohimbine) and 10,308,017 (Gummadiol) showed triple inhibition potential against all the three targets and 102,004,710 (18-Hydroxy-3-epi-alpha-yohimbine) exhibited dual inhibition potential. Hence, the proposed lead molecules from our findings can be further investigated through in vitro and in vivo studies to develop into potential drug candidates against human coronaviral infections."
