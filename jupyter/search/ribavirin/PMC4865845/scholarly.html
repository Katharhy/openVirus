Abstract</div> <p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a globally spreading alphavirus against which there is no commercially available vaccine or therapy. Here we use a genome-wide siRNA screen to identify 156 proviral and 41 antiviral host factors affecting CHIKV replication. We analyse the cellular pathways in which human proviral genes are involved and identify druggable targets. Twenty-one small-molecule inhibitors, some of which are FDA approved, targeting six proviral factors or pathways, have high antiviral activity <i>in vitro</i>, with low toxicity. Three identified inhibitors have prophylactic antiviral effects in mouse models of chikungunya infection. Two of them, the calmodulin inhibitor pimozide and the fatty acid synthesis inhibitor TOFA, have a therapeutic effect <i>in vivo</i> when combined. These results demonstrate the value of loss-of-function screening and pathway analysis for the rational identification of small molecules with therapeutic potential and pave the way for the development of new, host-directed, antiviral agents.</p> </div> <div class="abstract" title="abstract"> <p><span class="inline-graphic" title="inline-graphic" />Chikungunya virus is a mosquito transmitted untreatable emergent pathogen that causes joint pain and fever.

Originating from Africa, CHIKV has spread to Asia, emerged in Southern Europe and reached the Americas<a href="#b1">1</a>. Despite its severe health and economic impact, little is known about the cell biology of CHIKV infection and, as for all emerging infections, neither prophylactic nor therapeutic strategies are available on the market<a href="#b1">1</a>. In the absence of available therapeutics and vaccines, there is an urgent need for antimicrobial agents to combat emerging infections<a href="#b2">2</a>. As illustrated by the latest generation of drugs available to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected or hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients, deciphering that the biology of infections has proven successful for the development of highly effective drugs targeting different viral proteins<a href="#b3">3</a><a href="#b4">4</a>. However, this virus-directed strategy for drug discovery is time-consuming and not rapidly applicable to emerged pathogens<a href="#b2">2</a>. In the context of emerging infections, targeting host factors critical to infection is a promising approach<a href="#b5">5</a><a href="#b6">6</a><a href="#b7">7</a>. Indeed, this host-directed antiviral design can be coupled with a drug repositioning strategy<a href="#b8">8</a> that could lead to the rapid identification of antiviral agents.</p> <p>RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated loss-of-function screens have enabled the identification of novel host factors and pathways that are either important for replication (proviral) or limit replication (antiviral) of different viruses<a href="#b9">9</a><a href="#b10">10</a><a href="#b11">11</a><a href="#b12">12</a><a href="#b13">13</a><a href="#b14">14</a>, and therefore represent potential target for therapeutic purposes. Here we perform a host genome-wide loss-of-function screen to identify the host factors implicated in CHIKV replication in human cells. We analyse the cellular pathways and factors necessary for CHIKV infection and identify antiviral drugs with both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> efficacy.</p> <div class="results" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Identification of CHIKV pro- and anti-viral factors</div> <p>A host genome-wide loss-of-function screen was performed by reversely transfecting a genome-wide library of ∼60,000 short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting ∼17,000 annotated and ∼6,000 predicted genes into CHIKV-permissive human cells (HEK-293) for 3 days. Transfected cells were infected with a recombinant CHIKV-expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (CHIKV-GFP) in infected cells. At 18 h post infection (p.i.), cells were fixed and analysed by automatic fluorescence microscopy to quantify the ratio of infected to uninfected cells (<a href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>). To reduce the number of false-positive hits, 7,561 non-expressed genes (<a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</a>) and 3,274 toxic siRNAs (<a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b,c</a>) were excluded following transcriptional microarray and viability analyses, respectively. RNAi data were then analysed statistically using cellHTS2 (ref. <a href="#b15">15</a>), and normalized using as positive control, an siRNA targeting the viral E1 gene, and as negative control AllStars siRNA (<a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</a>). A <i>Z</i>-score transformation was applied to center and scale the plate-wise data (<a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</a>), and the medians of resulting values of at least three independent replicates were used for redundant siRNA activity (RSA) analysis<a href="#b16">16</a>. Using RSA log <i>P</i> values of ≤−2 as cutoff, we identified 279 proviral and 269 antiviral factors (<a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e,f</a>). To minimize off-target false positives, we further validated these hits with three additional siRNAs per gene. On the basis of the calculated cSSMD (collective strictly standardized mean difference) values, which reflect effect strength and significance<a href="#b17">17</a> (<a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 1g,h</a>), we validated 156 proviral and 41 antiviral host factors (<a href="#f1">Fig. 1b</a>; <a href="#S1">Supplementary Data 1</a> and <a href="#S1">2</a>). Strikingly, 66 of these proviral genes have been identified in previous screens with influenza A virus (IAV)<a href="#b9">9</a><a href="#b14">14</a>, HCV<a href="#b18">18</a><a href="#b19">19</a>, sindbis virus (SINV)<a href="#b10">10</a><a href="#b11">11</a>, dengue virus (DENV)<a href="#b20">20</a>, West Nile virus (WNV)<a href="#b21">21</a>, HIV-1 (refs <a href="#b13">13</a>, <a href="#b22">22</a>) or vaccinia virus (VACV)<a href="#b23">23</a> (<a href="#f1">Fig. 1c</a>; see <a href="#S1">Supplementary Data 3</a> for details and references). Moreover, 16 factors are relevant for multiple viruses (white boxes in <a href="#f1">Fig. 1c</a>), therefore representing the central biological nodes for broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutic intervention.</p> <p>To definitely validate these 16 factors, we used an independent method, the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, to generate cells deficient for each of these genes. We observed a significant reduction of CHIKV replication with guide RNAs (gRNA)-transduced Cas9-expressing cells for 14 out of 16 genes, establishing that they are proviral factors (<a href="#f1">Fig. 1d,e</a>; <a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 1i,j</a>; <a href="#S1">Supplementary Data 4</a>) and highlighting the strong reliability of the RNAi-validated hits of our study. Among the proviral factors, the three largest protein–protein interaction networks are involved in transcription, translation and signalling, respectively (<a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 1k</a>). Gene enrichment analysis revealed biological processes (<a href="#f2">Fig. 2a</a>) and molecular functions (<a href="#f2">Fig. 2b</a>) required for infection, including cell metabolism, post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications, and cellular function and maintenance (<a href="#f2">Fig. 2a,b</a>; <a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a–d</a>). Genes associated with lipid metabolism, in particular fatty acid synthesis, were statistically overrepresented within the hits (<a href="#f2">Fig. 2b</a>; <a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</a>).</p> </div> <div class="fattyacidsynthesisisrequiredforchikvreplication" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Fatty acid synthesis is required for CHIKV replication</div> <p>Cytosolic fatty acid synthesis involves the following three enzymes: (i) ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), needed for the formation of acetyl CoA, (ii) acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), which transforms acetyl CoA into malonyl CoA, and (iii) fatty acid synthase (FASN), which converts acetyl and malonyl CoA into palmitate (<a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</a>). Both FASN and ACLY were unambiguous hits (<a href="#f1">Figs 1b</a> and <a href="#f3">3a</a>; <a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</a>). Interestingly, FASN activity is required for the replication of other enveloped viruses<a href="#b24">24</a><a href="#b25">25</a> and both the enzymes are present in late replication complexes (Rc) of a closely related alphavirus (Semliki Forest virus)<a href="#b26">26</a>. To analyse the functional implication of lipid metabolism in CHIKV replication, we used a CHIKV replicon, allowing measurement of genomic and subgenomic viral RNA (vRNA) expression simultaneously (<a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</a>). Consistent with the screening results, the expression of both the vRNA forms was impaired in HeLa cells depleted in either FASN or ACLY, but not in cells depleted in ACC (<a href="#f3">Fig. 3b,c</a>). Immunofluorescence analysis further showed that Rc co-localized with FASN (<a href="#f3">Fig. 3d,e</a>; <a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</a>). We next independently confirmed these results pharmacologically. Infected HeLa cells were exposed to cerulenin (FASN inhibitor), 5-tetradecyloxy-2-furoic acid (TOFA, ACC inhibitor), BMS-303141 (ACLY inhibitor) or vehicle only (dimethylsulphoxide, DMSO). All three inhibitors induced a significant and dose-dependent reduction in genomic and subgenomic vRNA synthesis (<a href="#f3">Fig. 3f</a>), with no deleterious effect on cell viability (<a href="#f3">Fig. 3g</a>). Together, these results show that fatty acid synthesis is necessary for CHIKV vRNA replication.</p> </div> <div class="rationalidentificationofantiviraldrugs" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Rational identification of antiviral drugs</div> <p>On the basis of the demonstration of the antiviral activity of all lipid biosynthesis inhibitors targeting the proviral factors identified by the host genome-wide loss-of-function screen, we next considered all the other hits as putative drug targets. Therefore, to exploit the translational potential of our screen, we systematically assessed the antiviral activity of chemical compounds targeting the identified proviral factors involved in CHIKV replication. We interrogated specialized databases (<a href="http://www.drugbank.ca">www.drugbank.ca</a><a href="#b27">27</a>; lincs.hms.harvard.edu/kinomescan<a href="#b28">28</a>; <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl">www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl</a><a href="#b29">29</a>), linking several drugs to their experimentally proven target proteins/genes, and identified 52 compounds interacting with the gene products of 14 distinct CHIKV proviral genes. In addition, we generated three compounds against the CDC-like kinase 1 (CLK1), a proviral factor for CHIKV, IAV and WNV (<a href="#f1">Fig. 1c</a>; <a href="#S1">Supplementary Data 3</a>; <a href="#S1">Supplementary Methods</a>). Of these, 20 compounds—8 of them already Food and Drug Administration approved—interacting with six distinct proviral factors or pathways (<a href="#t1">Table 1</a>) potently inhibited CHIKV replication with no significant toxicity (<a href="#t1">Table 1</a>; <a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</a>; <a href="#S1">Supplementary Data 5</a>). These antiviral compounds inhibit the following targets and pathways: (i) the vacuolar-type H+ ATPase (vATPase); (ii) CLK1; (iii) the fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4 or VEGFR3); (iv) calmodulin signalling; (v) fatty acid synthesis; (vi) the K (lysine) acetyltransferase 5 (KAT5 or TIP60; see <a href="#S1">Supplementary Data 6</a> for more details).</p> <p>Since five of these six druggable hits were also identified as proviral factors in other RNAi screens (<a href="#f1">Fig. 1c</a>; <a href="#S1">Supplementary Data 3</a>), we sought to characterize the efficacy of inhibitors of these hits on the replication of a wide spectrum of viral species. Cells were treated with specific inhibitors of fatty acid synthesis, calmodulin signalling, FLT4 and vATPase, and infected with cytosolic double-stranded DNA virus (cowpox, CPXV), nuclear double-stranded DNA virus (herpes simplex type 1, HSV-1, or adenovirus type 5, Ad5) or negative-stranded segmented RNA virus (IAV) (<a href="#f4">Fig. 4</a>). Interestingly, differences in the antiviral activity of these compounds were observed between viral species, suggesting that the identified cellular pathways are required for the replication of several, but not all virus types, and that the antiviral effect observed for CHIKV is genuine and not the consequence of a general toxic effect on cell metabolism induced by the inhibitors.</p> </div> <div class="invitrocharacterizationoftheantiviralcompounds" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title"><i>In vitro</i> characterization of the antiviral compounds</div> <p>To get some insight into the mechanism of action of the identified antiviral compounds, we investigated which stage of the viral life cycle was affected by inhibition of each of these six distinct druggable targets. In a first set of experiments, single-cycle CHIKV infection was measured before or after viral entry (<a href="#f5">Fig. 5a</a>). Infectivity of the supernatants of post-entry-treated cells was also measured to detect the possible defects on late-stage CHIKV life cycle. As expected for the control of vacuolar pH by vATPase<a href="#b30">30</a>, its inhibitor bafilomycin specifically blocked CHIKV entry (<a href="#f5">Fig. 5b</a>). In contrast, the drugs targeting the other proviral hits all affected the CHIKV cycle post entry (<a href="#f5">Fig. 5c–g</a>). This was also true for the specific calmodulin inhibitor (W7), included in the experiment as a specificity control for this pathway (<a href="#f5">Fig. 5e</a>). Because of the incomplete inhibition observed with the CLK1 inhibitor KH-CB19 at early times p.i., we were not able to precisely determine the step of infection controlled by CLK1 (<a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</a>). Importantly, consistent with the mechanism of action of the FLT4 inhibitors that are known to suppress FLT4 phosphorylation, using validated specific antibodies (<a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</a>), we observed increased FLT4 phosphorylation in cells infected with CHKV (<a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</a>).</p> <p>One of the druggable targets (KAT5) is part of the acetylation complex Tip60-EP400, recently described as a general antiviral factor<a href="#b31">31</a>. Since, somewhat surprisingly, several components of this complex were identified as proviral factors in our screen (<a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</a>), we further investigated this target using three siRNAs against different subunits (<a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 5d</a>) in HeLa and HEK-293T cells. We observed that the pro- or anti-viral contribution of the Tip60-EP400 complex was cell line specific for both CHIKV and SINV (<a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 5e</a>), and therefore did not pursue this lead.</p> <p>We next characterized the step in CHIKV replication cycle targeted by the specific inhibitors of fatty acid synthesis, calmodulin signalling and FLT4 that act after entry. Infected HeLa cells were exposed to cerulenin, TOFA, pimozide, W7, tivozanib or vehicle only (DMSO). All the tested inhibitors significantly reduced vRNA synthesis (<a href="#f5">Fig. 5h</a>) and strongly inhibited viral release in the supernatants (<a href="#f5">Fig. 5i</a>), with no detectable cell toxicity (<a href="#f5">Fig. 5j</a>) when applied following 1-h infection with wild-type CHIKV isolate C21. Of note, a delayed treatment (6–8 h p.i.) had only a minor impact on vRNA replication but induced a major defect in viral release (<a href="#f5">Fig. 5k,l</a>), suggesting that the pathways targeted by these inhibitors are also involved in the late phase of CHIKV life cycle.</p> </div> <div class="invivocharacterizationoftheantiviralcompounds" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title"><i>In vivo</i> characterization of the antiviral compounds</div> <p>We next aimed at translating these <i>in vitro</i> results <i>in vivo</i>. We therefore generated C57BL/6<sup><i>clk1</i>−/−</sup> mice (see Methods) and investigated the requirement for CLK1 in CHIKV <i>in vivo</i> infection<a href="#b32">32</a>. Weight-matched 9-day-old C57BL/6<sup><i>clk1</i>−/−</sup> mice developed significantly less paralysis (∼50%) than control isogenic mice (5.8%; <i>P</i>=0.005, log-rank test; <a href="#f6">Fig. 6a,b</a>), identifying CLK1 as a valid <i>in vivo</i> target for antiviral drug development. To analyse the antiviral effect of tivozanib (targeting FLT4) <i>in vivo</i>, 7-day-old C57BL/6 mice were treated with the drug or vehicle only for 2 days and infected with CHIKV at day 9. Tivozanib administration was continued for 21 days (<a href="#f6">Fig. 6c</a>). Tivozanib caused a significant reduction in mortality of CHIKV-infected mice (<a href="#f6">Fig. 6d</a>; <i>P</i>=0.02, log-rank test), protected from the onset of paralysis (<a href="#f6">Fig. 6e</a>; <i>P</i>=0.03, log-rank test) and had a positive impact on body weight gain (<a href="#f6">Fig. 6f,g</a>; <i>P</i>=0.0133, two-sided <i>t</i>-test). Tivozanib treatment also significantly reduced CHIKV viral load in different vital organs (<a href="#f6">Fig. 6h</a>).

Effect of drug combination <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i></div> <p>Having identified and characterized compounds with anti-CHIKV activity both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>, we combined drugs to improve antiviral activity. We focused on pimozide and TOFA, since they both demonstrated an antiviral effect in the same mouse model of CHIKV infection. We initially tested the effect of drugs administrated in combination on HEK-293T cells infected with CHIKV for 1 h. In comparison with monotherapy, TOFA and pimozide combination resulted in increased inhibition of CHIKV infection rate (5 μM each, interaction effect=0.44; lower=0.36; upper=0.54; <i>P</i>&amp;lt;0.001, two-factor design method) and CHIKV release (5 μM each, interaction effect=3.44; lower=0.68; upper=17.41; <i>P</i>=0.133, two-factor design method), with no deleterious effect on cell viability (<a href="#f7">Fig. 7a–c</a>). We then evaluated the anti-CHIKV effect of drug combination <i>in vivo</i>, in adult mice therapeutically treated with pimozide and TOFA alone or in combination. Importantly, pimozide and TOFA combination caused a significant reduction in CHIKV replication (<a href="#f7">Fig. 7d</a>) (interaction effect=0.16; lower=0.05; upper=0.47; <i>P</i>&amp;lt;0.001, two-factor design method) and in CHIKV-induced joint swelling (<a href="#f7">Fig. 7e</a>) (interaction effect=0.94; lower=0.79; upper=1.13; <i>P</i>=0.506, two-factor design method), when therapeutically administrated to infected adult mice, suggesting that combining different drugs identified in the RNAi screen increases their antiviral effect.</p> </div> </div> <div class="discussion" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Discussion</div> <p>Despite major outbreaks over the past decade in Africa, the Indian Ocean and Asia and its recent emergence in the Americas, still little is known regarding CHIKV cell biology. CHIKV infection in human is associated with acute and chronic symptoms, which pathophysiology remains incompletely understood, and there is no commercially available vaccine or drugs to tackle this global public health issue. To better characterize CHIKV interaction with human cells, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen and report here on the identification of 156 cellular factors required for CHIKV life cycle and 46 antiviral factors. Importantly, follow-up studies of those hits led to the identification of molecular pathways and cellular functions required for multiple steps of CHIKV life cycle, from viral entry, replication to viral release. For example, we demonstrated the critical role of the vacuolar ATPase in viral entry, and lipid biosynthesis in vRNA replication and release. Therefore, our study represents a major advance in the field of CHIVK cell biology, and will pave the way for detailed mechanistic studies for each of the pro- and anti-CHIKV host factors we have identified, similarly to other loss-of-function screens published for other human viruses<a href="#b9">9</a><a href="#b10">10</a><a href="#b11">11</a><a href="#b13">13</a><a href="#b14">14</a><a href="#b18">18</a><a href="#b19">19</a><a href="#b20">20</a><a href="#b21">21</a><a href="#b22">22</a><a href="#b23">23</a>.</p> <p>We followed an innovative translational approach by directly exploiting the results of the genome-wide loss-of-function screen to identify druggable pathways and corresponding antiviral compounds. Indeed, using a drug repositioning strategy, we identified a series of chemical inhibitors, directed against five druggable proviral hits, with <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> antiviral activity, either alone or in combination. Since some of the drugs are already Food and Drug Administration approved for other diseases, this has the potential to considerably shorten the time-consuming and expensive ‘hit-to-lead' and ‘lead-optimization' phases, making our approach of particular interest for antiviral drug discovery in the field of emerging infectious diseases. Importantly, most of the identified proviral hits and all druggable targets we followed up are also critical for the replication of other very diverse viral species (including IAV, SINV, HIV-1 and HCV; see <a href="#f1">Fig. 1c</a>), highlighting the relevance of this strategy for the identification of broad-spectrum antiviral compounds and the potential for broadly active, host-directed, antiviral therapies (for example, pimozide that had an antiviral effect both for CHIKV and HSV-1 in <a href="#f4">Fig. 4</a>).</p> <p>This proof-of-concept study, based on a genome-wide loss-of-function screen, led to the identification of antiviral targets, pathways and compounds for which antiviral efficacy was proven <i>in vitro</i>, as well as <i>in vivo</i>, although it did not completely block viral replication in this setting. Additional studies will be required for the selection of the best target inhibitors and lead optimization, before clinical development. Since our approach led to the selection of a number of independent targets and pathways, and for each of those to the identification of multiple antiviral compounds, pre-clinical studies may exploit the potential synergistic effect of drug combination. With this in mind, we showed that the combination of two drugs targeting independent cellular pathways (TOFA and pimozide) have an increased activity when combined <i>in vitro</i> as well as <i>in vivo</i>, where it exhibits a therapeutic antiviral effect.</p> <p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated here the significance of host genome-wide loss-of-function screens for the rational identification of antiviral targets and their accelerated <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> validation for emerging pathogens, for which therapeutics and vaccines are critically missing<a href="#b1">1</a><a href="#b2">2</a>.</p> </div> <div class="methods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

siRNA screening</div> <p>HEK-293 cells were used for the screening because of their concomitant permissiveness to CHIKV infection and to high-efficiency siRNA transfection.

Briefly, all siRNAs (Qiagen Hu_Genome 1.0 and Human Druggable Genome siRNA Set V2.0; Qiagen) were arrayed in 384-well plates. To each well, 8 μl of serum-free RPMI medium (Invitrogen) containing 3.75% HiPerFect (Qiagen) was added. After 20-min incubation at room temperature, 30 μl of cell suspension containing 1,250 cells was added to give a final siRNA concentration of ∼20 nM. Cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 72 h before infection with 3.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> plaque-forming units (PFUs).

Data analysis and reproducibility</div> <p>For identification of primary hits, mainly the inhibitory effect on CHIKV, replication was taken into consideration. To reduce possible off-target or other unspecific effects and to maximize the robustness of the hit selection, two additional parameters were analysed: (i) non-expressed genes were excluded by determining constitutive or inducible expression via microarray profiling of non-infected and infected HEK-293 cells (7,561 genes were filtered out). (ii) Using the microscopic assay applied throughout the primary screen, toxic siRNAs, which reduced total cell numbers (&amp;lt;1,000 cells per well) on transfection were excluded. In this way, 3,274 siRNAs (targeting 2,635 different genes) were excluded from further analysis. The statistical analysis of the revised raw data was performed using cellHTS2 (ref. <a href="#b15">15</a>), an R-implemented software package for the analysis of cell-based high-throughput RNAi screen data. Raw data were normalized and centred by <i>Z</i>-score transformation. The medians of the centred and scaled values of at least three independent replicates were used for RSA analysis<a href="#b16">16</a>. Primary hits were selected by using the cutoff criterion log <i>P</i>≤2.</p> <p>The validation was performed based on the primary hit list, thereby focusing not only on proviral but also on antiviral factors. Although the validation was experimentally identical to the primary screening, the hit selection varied slightly: after filtering out 133 toxic siRNAs, the <i>Z</i>-scores were again determined using the cellHT2 software package. However, instead of using the RSA analysis, which has limitations in analysing data sets consisting of siRNAs that should theoretically all influence CHIKV replication, we computed the cSSMD based on the normalized per cent inhibition of individual siRNAs, by assessing the collective activity of multiple siRNAs relative to the control<a href="#b17">17</a>. For the special case of only two siRNAs available, we used the simple method of moments estimate:</p> <p> </p><div class="disp-formula" title="disp-formula"><span class="inline-graphic" title="inline-graphic" /></div> <p /> <p>where <span class="inline-formula" title="inline-formula"><span class="inline-graphic" title="inline-graphic" /></span> denotes the collective difference relative to control and <span class="inline-formula" title="inline-formula"><span class="inline-graphic" title="inline-graphic" /></span> denotes the corresponding difference for the corresponding siRNA (<i>i</i>=1 and 2).</p> <p>String analysis shown in <a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 1k</a> was performed using only experimental data for prediction (confidence score≥0.5). Networks containing fewer than nine genes are not depicted. Molecular functions were arbitrarily assigned to the networks based on known functions.</p> <p>The ingenuity analysis on the proviral factors, which is depicted in <a href="#f1">Fig. 1g</a>, was performed using the ingenuity knowledge-base reference set (genes only), including direct and indirect relationships, and endogenous chemicals, and filtered for the ‘experimentally observed' confidence criterion. Enriched molecular functions were selected on the basis of their statistical significance (<i>P</i>≤0.01 was used as threshold). Statistically enriched gene ontology terms associated to less than two genes were removed. Co-localization analysis shown in <a href="#f3">Fig. 3e</a> was performed on three-dimensional cell stacks using the intensity correlation analysis plugin for the WCIF Image J program. Statistical analyses in <a href="#f1">Figs 1</a>, <a href="#f3">3</a>, <a href="#f5">5</a>, <a href="#f6">6</a> and <a href="#f7">7</a>, <a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</a> and <a href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</a> were performed using GraphPad prism.
