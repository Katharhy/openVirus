Here we use a genome-wide siRNA screen to identify 156 proviral and 41 antiviral host factors affecting CHIKV replication. We analyse the cellular pathways in which human proviral genes are involved and identify druggable targets. Twenty-one small-molecule inhibitors, some of which are FDA approved, targeting six proviral factors or pathways, have high antiviral activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, with low toxicity. Three identified inhibitors have prophylactic antiviral effects in mouse models of chikungunya infection. Two of them, the calmodulin inhibitor pimozide and the fatty acid synthesis inhibitor TOFA, have a therapeutic effect <italic>in vivo</italic> when combined. These results demonstrate the value of loss-of-function screening and pathway analysis for the rational identification of small molecules with therapeutic potential and pave the way for the development of new, host-directed, antiviral agents.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

Originating from Africa, CHIKV has spread to Asia, emerged in Southern Europe and reached the Americas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Despite its severe health and economic impact, little is known about the cell biology of CHIKV infection and, as for all emerging infections, neither prophylactic nor therapeutic strategies are available on the market<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. In the absence of available therapeutics and vaccines, there is an urgent need for antimicrobial agents to combat emerging infections<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. As illustrated by the latest generation of drugs available to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected or hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients, deciphering that the biology of infections has proven successful for the development of highly effective drugs targeting different viral proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. However, this virus-directed strategy for drug discovery is time-consuming and not rapidly applicable to emerged pathogens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. In the context of emerging infections, targeting host factors critical to infection is a promising approach<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Indeed, this host-directed antiviral design can be coupled with a drug repositioning strategy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> that could lead to the rapid identification of antiviral agents.</p><p>RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated loss-of-function screens have enabled the identification of novel host factors and pathways that are either important for replication (proviral) or limit replication (antiviral) of different viruses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, and therefore represent potential target for therapeutic purposes. Here we perform a host genome-wide loss-of-function screen to identify the host factors implicated in CHIKV replication in human cells. We analyse the cellular pathways and factors necessary for CHIKV infection and identify antiviral drugs with both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of CHIKV pro- and anti-viral factors</title><p>A host genome-wide loss-of-function screen was performed by reversely transfecting a genome-wide library of &#x0223c;60,000 short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting &#x0223c;17,000 annotated and &#x0223c;6,000 predicted genes into CHIKV-permissive human cells (HEK-293) for 3 days. Transfected cells were infected with a recombinant CHIKV-expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (CHIKV-GFP) in infected cells. At 18&#x02009;h post infection (p.i.), cells were fixed and analysed by automatic fluorescence microscopy to quantify the ratio of infected to uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). To reduce the number of false-positive hits, 7,561 non-expressed genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>) and 3,274 toxic siRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b,c</xref>) were excluded following transcriptional microarray and viability analyses, respectively. RNAi data were then analysed statistically using cellHTS2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), and normalized using as positive control, an siRNA targeting the viral E1 gene, and as negative control AllStars siRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>). A <italic>Z</italic>-score transformation was applied to center and scale the plate-wise data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>), and the medians of resulting values of at least three independent replicates were used for redundant siRNA activity (RSA) analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Using RSA log <italic>P</italic> values of &#x02264;&#x02212;2 as cutoff, we identified 279 proviral and 269 antiviral factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e,f</xref>). To minimize off-target false positives, we further validated these hits with three additional siRNAs per gene. On the basis of the calculated cSSMD (collective strictly standardized mean difference) values, which reflect effect strength and significance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1g,h</xref>), we validated 156 proviral and 41 antiviral host factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">2</xref>). Strikingly, 66 of these proviral genes have been identified in previous screens with influenza A virus (IAV)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, HCV<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, sindbis virus (SINV)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, dengue virus (DENV)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, West Nile virus (WNV)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, HIV-1 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) or vaccinia virus (VACV)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3</xref> for details and references). Moreover, 16 factors are relevant for multiple viruses (white boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>), therefore representing the central biological nodes for broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutic intervention.</p><p>To definitely validate these 16 factors, we used an independent method, the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, to generate cells deficient for each of these genes. We observed a significant reduction of CHIKV replication with guide RNAs (gRNA)-transduced Cas9-expressing cells for 14 out of 16 genes, establishing that they are proviral factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1i,j</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>) and highlighting the strong reliability of the RNAi-validated hits of our study. Among the proviral factors, the three largest protein&#x02013;protein interaction networks are involved in transcription, translation and signalling, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1k</xref>). Gene enrichment analysis revealed biological processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>) and molecular functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>) required for infection, including cell metabolism, post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications, and cellular function and maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a&#x02013;d</xref>). Genes associated with lipid metabolism, in particular fatty acid synthesis, were statistically overrepresented within the hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Fatty acid synthesis is required for CHIKV replication</title><p>Cytosolic fatty acid synthesis involves the following three enzymes: (i) ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), needed for the formation of acetyl CoA, (ii) acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), which transforms acetyl CoA into malonyl CoA, and (iii) fatty acid synthase (FASN), which converts acetyl and malonyl CoA into palmitate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). Both FASN and ACLY were unambiguous hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). Interestingly, FASN activity is required for the replication of other enveloped viruses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and both the enzymes are present in late replication complexes (Rc) of a closely related alphavirus (Semliki Forest virus)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. To analyse the functional implication of lipid metabolism in CHIKV replication, we used a CHIKV replicon, allowing measurement of genomic and subgenomic viral RNA (vRNA) expression simultaneously (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). Consistent with the screening results, the expression of both the vRNA forms was impaired in HeLa cells depleted in either FASN or ACLY, but not in cells depleted in ACC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis further showed that Rc co-localized with FASN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). We next independently confirmed these results pharmacologically. Infected HeLa cells were exposed to cerulenin (FASN inhibitor), 5-tetradecyloxy-2-furoic acid (TOFA, ACC inhibitor), BMS-303141 (ACLY inhibitor) or vehicle only (dimethylsulphoxide, DMSO). All three inhibitors induced a significant and dose-dependent reduction in genomic and subgenomic vRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>), with no deleterious effect on cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>). Together, these results show that fatty acid synthesis is necessary for CHIKV vRNA replication.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Rational identification of antiviral drugs</title><p>On the basis of the demonstration of the antiviral activity of all lipid biosynthesis inhibitors targeting the proviral factors identified by the host genome-wide loss-of-function screen, we next considered all the other hits as putative drug targets. Therefore, to exploit the translational potential of our screen, we systematically assessed the antiviral activity of chemical compounds targeting the identified proviral factors involved in CHIKV replication. We interrogated specialized databases (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.drugbank.ca">www.drugbank.ca</ext-link><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>; lincs.hms.harvard.edu/kinomescan<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>; <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl">www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl</ext-link><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>), linking several drugs to their experimentally proven target proteins/genes, and identified 52 compounds interacting with the gene products of 14 distinct CHIKV proviral genes. In addition, we generated three compounds against the CDC-like kinase 1 (CLK1), a proviral factor for CHIKV, IAV and WNV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). Of these, 20 compounds&#x02014;8 of them already Food and Drug Administration approved&#x02014;interacting with six distinct proviral factors or pathways (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>) potently inhibited CHIKV replication with no significant toxicity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 5</xref>). These antiviral compounds inhibit the following targets and pathways: (i) the vacuolar-type H&#x0002b; ATPase (vATPase); (ii) CLK1; (iii) the fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4 or VEGFR3); (iv) calmodulin signalling; (v) fatty acid synthesis; (vi) the K (lysine) acetyltransferase 5 (KAT5 or TIP60; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 6</xref> for more details).</p><p>Since five of these six druggable hits were also identified as proviral factors in other RNAi screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3</xref>), we sought to characterize the efficacy of inhibitors of these hits on the replication of a wide spectrum of viral species. Cells were treated with specific inhibitors of fatty acid synthesis, calmodulin signalling, FLT4 and vATPase, and infected with cytosolic double-stranded DNA virus (cowpox, CPXV), nuclear double-stranded DNA virus (herpes simplex type 1, HSV-1, or adenovirus type 5, Ad5) or negative-stranded segmented RNA virus (IAV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Interestingly, differences in the antiviral activity of these compounds were observed between viral species, suggesting that the identified cellular pathways are required for the replication of several, but not all virus types, and that the antiviral effect observed for CHIKV is genuine and not the consequence of a general toxic effect on cell metabolism induced by the inhibitors.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> characterization of the antiviral compounds</title><p>To get some insight into the mechanism of action of the identified antiviral compounds, we investigated which stage of the viral life cycle was affected by inhibition of each of these six distinct druggable targets. In a first set of experiments, single-cycle CHIKV infection was measured before or after viral entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Infectivity of the supernatants of post-entry-treated cells was also measured to detect the possible defects on late-stage CHIKV life cycle. As expected for the control of vacuolar pH by vATPase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, its inhibitor bafilomycin specifically blocked CHIKV entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). In contrast, the drugs targeting the other proviral hits all affected the CHIKV cycle post entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c&#x02013;g</xref>). This was also true for the specific calmodulin inhibitor (W7), included in the experiment as a specificity control for this pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Because of the incomplete inhibition observed with the CLK1 inhibitor KH-CB19 at early times p.i., we were not able to precisely determine the step of infection controlled by CLK1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). Importantly, consistent with the mechanism of action of the FLT4 inhibitors that are known to suppress FLT4 phosphorylation, using validated specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>), we observed increased FLT4 phosphorylation in cells infected with CHKV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>).</p><p>One of the druggable targets (KAT5) is part of the acetylation complex Tip60-EP400, recently described as a general antiviral factor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Since, somewhat surprisingly, several components of this complex were identified as proviral factors in our screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>), we further investigated this target using three siRNAs against different subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>) in HeLa and HEK-293T cells. We observed that the pro- or anti-viral contribution of the Tip60-EP400 complex was cell line specific for both CHIKV and SINV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>), and therefore did not pursue this lead.</p><p>We next characterized the step in CHIKV replication cycle targeted by the specific inhibitors of fatty acid synthesis, calmodulin signalling and FLT4 that act after entry. Infected HeLa cells were exposed to cerulenin, TOFA, pimozide, W7, tivozanib or vehicle only (DMSO). All the tested inhibitors significantly reduced vRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5h</xref>) and strongly inhibited viral release in the supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5i</xref>), with no detectable cell toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5j</xref>) when applied following 1-h infection with wild-type CHIKV isolate C21. Of note, a delayed treatment (6&#x02013;8&#x02009;h p.i.) had only a minor impact on vRNA replication but induced a major defect in viral release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5k,l</xref>), suggesting that the pathways targeted by these inhibitors are also involved in the late phase of CHIKV life cycle.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> characterization of the antiviral compounds</title><p>We next aimed at translating these <italic>in vitro</italic> results <italic>in vivo</italic>.

CHIKV infection in human is associated with acute and chronic symptoms, which pathophysiology remains incompletely understood, and there is no commercially available vaccine or drugs to tackle this global public health issue. To better characterize CHIKV interaction with human cells, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen and report here on the identification of 156 cellular factors required for CHIKV life cycle and 46 antiviral factors. Importantly, follow-up studies of those hits led to the identification of molecular pathways and cellular functions required for multiple steps of CHIKV life cycle, from viral entry, replication to viral release. For example, we demonstrated the critical role of the vacuolar ATPase in viral entry, and lipid biosynthesis in vRNA replication and release. Therefore, our study represents a major advance in the field of CHIVK cell biology, and will pave the way for detailed mechanistic studies for each of the pro- and anti-CHIKV host factors we have identified, similarly to other loss-of-function screens published for other human viruses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p><p>We followed an innovative translational approach by directly exploiting the results of the genome-wide loss-of-function screen to identify druggable pathways and corresponding antiviral compounds. Indeed, using a drug repositioning strategy, we identified a series of chemical inhibitors, directed against five druggable proviral hits, with <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> antiviral activity, either alone or in combination. Since some of the drugs are already Food and Drug Administration approved for other diseases, this has the potential to considerably shorten the time-consuming and expensive &#x02018;hit-to-lead' and &#x02018;lead-optimization' phases, making our approach of particular interest for antiviral drug discovery in the field of emerging infectious diseases. Importantly, most of the identified proviral hits and all druggable targets we followed up are also critical for the replication of other very diverse viral species (including IAV, SINV, HIV-1 and HCV; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>), highlighting the relevance of this strategy for the identification of broad-spectrum antiviral compounds and the potential for broadly active, host-directed, antiviral therapies (for example, pimozide that had an antiviral effect both for CHIKV and HSV-1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>This proof-of-concept study, based on a genome-wide loss-of-function screen, led to the identification of antiviral targets, pathways and compounds for which antiviral efficacy was proven <italic>in vitro</italic>, as well as <italic>in vivo</italic>, although it did not completely block viral replication in this setting. Additional studies will be required for the selection of the best target inhibitors and lead optimization, before clinical development. Since our approach led to the selection of a number of independent targets and pathways, and for each of those to the identification of multiple antiviral compounds, pre-clinical studies may exploit the potential synergistic effect of drug combination.

(ii) Using the microscopic assay applied throughout the primary screen, toxic siRNAs, which reduced total cell numbers (&#x0003c;1,000 cells per well) on transfection were excluded.
