respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) calls urgently for effective therapies.
Anti-malarial medicine chloroquine (CQ) and particularly its chemical analogue
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been recommended as promising candidate therapeutics that
are now under either compassionate off-label use or clinical trials for the treatment of
COVID-19 patients. However, there are public concerns and disputes about both the safety
and efficacy of CQ and HCQ for this new application. Given the fact that for decades HCQ
has been approved as an immunomodulatory drug for the long term treatment of chronic
rheumatic diseases, as experienced rheumatologists, we would like to share our thoughts in
this regard and trigger a brainstorm among clinical care providers for exchanging their
diverse opinions on this urgent topic.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>therapy</kwd><kwd>hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)</kwd><kwd>Chloroquine (CQ)</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Natural Science Foundation of

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a serious threat to global public
health and local economies [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Such huge numbers
of infected people and deaths call for an urgent and effective therapy to treat symptomatic
patients, which can also decrease the duration of virus carriage in order to limit the
transmission of viruses in the community.</p><p>As originally an anti-malarial medicine applied for decades, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is
one of the disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), which is widely used for treating
certain rheumatic diseases such as rheumatic arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE), and it also demonstrates a strong immunomodulatory capacity, which prevents
inflammation flare-ups and organ damage. Some clinicians recommend that patients with
COVID-19 should be counselled about HCQ treatment [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>&#x0003e;
<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>
<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>1&#x02013;3]. However, the optimal
dosage, course and the side-effect for HCQ in SARS-CoV-2 infection need to be assessed by
the standard clinical trials in the coming days.</p></sec><sec id="S002"><title>HCQ may confer an antiviral effect at early infection stage</title><p>Chloroquine (CQ) is a drug widely used in the treatment of malaria and autoimmune diseases,
reportedly having broad-spectrum antiviral potential [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Given that HCQ demonstrates similar molecular mechanisms to CQ, it is highly
likely that HCQ will perform similarly in terms of early prevention of disease progression
[<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The antiviral activity of HCQ may be due
to the following four ways [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]: (1) reducing the
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor terminal glycosylation on the surface of
cells thus interfering with the binding of SARS-COV-2 to the ACE2 receptor; (2) increasing
the pH of endosomes and lysosomes to prevent the fusion process of the virus with host cells
and subsequent virus replication; (3) preventing antigen processing and major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-mediated autoantigen presentation to T cells,
which reduces T cell activation, differentiation and expression of co-stimulatory proteins
and cytokines produced by T cells and B cells (e.g. IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;); and (4)
disrupting the interaction of DNA/RNA with toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the nucleic acid
sensor cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) and therefore the transcription of
pro-inflammatory genes cannot be stimulated [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].
It is speculated that HCQ functions at entry of the SARS-COV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells
[<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Antiviral drugs should be used to reduce
viral replication in the early stages of disease based on the dynamic results of clinical
trials. Gautret et al. reported that azithromycin (AZM) added to HCQ was significantly more
effective for virus elimination than using HCQ alone. They used 200&#x02005;mg of HCQ three times a
day for 10 days, plus AZM if deemed necessary. A higher frequency of COVID-19 clearance was
noticed after 6 days of treatment with HCQ alone or HCQ&#x02009;+&#x02009;AZM versus the untreated control
group (70% vs 12.5%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In our opinion, patients before having shortness of breath or in the high-risk
category even with just mild symptoms should be treated as soon as possible.</p><p>The transition to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) occurs in many severe COVID-19
cases because of the cytokine release syndrome (CRS), or &#x0201c;cytokine storm&#x0201d;[<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Guastalegname and Vallone controversially
commended that to the SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, there might be no benefits of HCQ, if
not any harm, on mortality and lymphopenia improvement [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Immunosuppressants should be used with caution to combat cytokine storms and
reduce mortality in severe patients.</p></sec><sec id="S003"><title>Safety and adverse events</title><p>HCQ exhibits better anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and fewer toxic side effects than CQ [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].
Gautret et al. showed that HCQ (200&#x02005;mg, three times per day for ten days) is efficient in
clearing viral nasopharyngeal carriage of SARS-CoV-2 in only three to six days, in most
COVID-19 patients [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A recent Chinese study has
recommended that HCQ sulfate can be given orally for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients at the
dose of 400&#x02005;mg twice daily for the first day, followed by a maintenance dose of 200&#x02005;mg given
twice daily for 4 days [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Expert consensus
statement has recommended HCQ in an attempt of antiviral treatment in China [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Long-term exposure of the patients to HCQ can cause side effects such as retinopathy and
cardiomyopathy. Although HCQ has a low level of tissue accumulation, high-dose and long-term
(over 5 years) intake of HCQ is likely to contribute to the development of retinopathy
[<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, a study that focused on the dose
loading with HCQ (400, 800&#x02005;mg/day, and 1,200&#x02005;mg/day groups) for RA patients showed that
ocular abnormalities occurred in 17 of 212 patients (8%), and there were no adverse ocular
events at 6 weeks [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Luckily long-term
treatment is not needed for COVID-19 patients.</p><p>Previous study also suggested a synergistic effect of the combination of HCQ and AZM [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Speculated potential risk of severe QT
prolongation induced by the association of the two drugs and viral myocarditis caused by
SARS-CoV-2 infection should be considered. This side effect is rare, but it is not clear
whether their combined use in the treatment of COVID-19 may amplify this risk. In this
sense, HCQ should be avoided in patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) examination should be performed before the treatment, and ECG
monitoring can be performed if necessary.</p><p>As rheumatologists, we have comprehensive experiences in successfully treating patients
with chronic autoimmune diseases with long-term HCQ treatment (400&#x02005;mg/day for more than 5
years). It was reported that the safe dosage (6&#x02013;6.5&#x02005;mg/kg per day) of HCQ sulfate could
generate serum levels of 1.4&#x02013;1.5&#x02005;&#x003bc;M in humans [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. HCQ has a low level of tissue accumulation, and the maximum tolerable dose for
HCQ is 1200&#x02005;mg [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, 400&#x02005;mg per day
for HCQ is in a safe dosage range. Patients with long-term exposure to HCQ at this safe
dosage suffer from few side effects.</p><p>Importantly, the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has placed pregnant women at high risk of
infection. HCQ should be considered as a potential therapeutic solution for these patients,
given its safety profile in pregnancy [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S004"><title>Summary</title><p>We suggest that HCQ has few side effects and should be used as an initial treatment as soon
as the diagnosis of COVID-19 is made. When the disease progression is from mild to severe,
hospitalization and stronger immunosuppressive treatment are required. Our opinions on
HCQ/CQ for the treatment of COVID-19 here appear somewhat different from the more
conservative ones expressed recently by other rheumatology colleagues [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The role of HCQ in against COVID-19 needs to be thoroughly
evaluated in both observational studies and high quality randomized controlled studies.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)
