We found that during the 2009 influenza pandemic, the Texas Department of State Health Services achieved an estimated statewide access of 88% (proportion of population willing to travel to the nearest dispensing point). However, access reached only 34.5% of US postal code (ZIP code) areas containing &#x0003c;1,000 underinsured persons. Optimized distribution networks increased expected access to 91% overall and 60% in hard-to-reach regions, and 2 or 3 major pharmacy chains achieved near maximal coverage in well-populated areas. Independent pharmacies were essential for reaching ZIP code areas containing &#x0003c;1,000 underinsured persons. This model was developed during a collaboration between academic researchers and public health officials and is available as a decision support tool for Texas Department of State Health Services at a Web-based interface.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords: </title><kwd>antiviral drugs</kwd><kwd>influenza</kwd><kwd>influenza virus</kwd><kwd>viruses</kwd><kwd>2009 pandemic</kwd><kwd>influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus</kwd><kwd>pandemic influenza</kwd><kwd>optimization</kwd><kwd>control</kwd><kwd>pharmacies</kwd><kwd>pharmacy-based drug distribution</kwd><kwd>underinsured populations</kwd><kwd>ZIP codes</kwd><kwd>Texas</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Influenza pandemics occur when novel strains of the influenza virus emerge in human populations and spread worldwide (
<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>1</italic>
</xref>
). There were 3 influenza pandemics in the 20th century (1918, 1957, and 1968), and 1 has occurred so far in the 21st century (2009). The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic was far more severe than the others, causing an estimated 50 million deaths globally (
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>2</italic>
</xref>
). In contrast, the 2009 pandemic had an estimated death toll of 284,000 (
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>3</italic>
</xref>
). Experts conjecture that the risk for new pandemics will increase in the coming decades (
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>4</italic>
</xref>
), and several emerging threats are already under surveillance. A highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus has occasionally been infecting humans in Asia, Africa, and Europe since 1997 (
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>5</italic>
</xref>
); the first human case in North America was reported in January 2014 (
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>6</italic>
</xref>
). Since March 2013, China has been trying to contain an ongoing outbreak of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (H7N9) virus (
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>7</italic>
</xref>
,
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>8</italic>
</xref>
).</p><p>The primary control measures for pandemic influenza are antiviral medications and vaccines (
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>9</italic>
</xref>
), as well as nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing measures, school closures, and hygienic precautions (
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>10</italic>
</xref>
). Although the efficacy of influenza vaccines depends on factors such as patient age and virus type/subtype (
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>11</italic>
</xref>
), these vaccines are arguably the best intervention strategy (
<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>1</italic>
</xref>
). However, because development and deployment of effective vaccines for a new influenza virus may take several months (
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>12</italic>
</xref>
), antiviral drugs and nonpharmaceutical interventions are particularly critical for early pandemic control.</p><p>Antiviral drugs are believed to reduce disease severity and duration of infectiousness in individual patients, if taken sufficiently early (
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>9</italic>
</xref>
), and to protect contacts of infected persons, if taken prophylactically (
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>13</italic>
</xref>
<italic>&#x02013;</italic>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>15</italic>

). Some studies have suggested that aggressive treatment policies can effectively mitigate local transmission (

<italic>16</italic>
</xref>
,
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>17</italic>
</xref>
). In preparation for future influenza pandemics, the US Department of Health and Human Services therefore maintains a large Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) of antiviral drugs (
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>18</italic>
</xref>
), and most states include SNS antiviral drugs as a major component of their pandemic response plans (

<italic>19</italic>
</xref>
<italic>&#x02013;</italic>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>22</italic>
</xref>
).</p><p>After detection of the new influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in April 2009, the US government declared a public health emergency, and the World Health Organization declared a global influenza pandemic. Vaccines became widely available after 6 months of sustained transmission (
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>23</italic>
</xref>
). In the early weeks of the pandemic, the US Department of Health and Human Services distributed 11 million courses of federally held SNS antiviral drugs to states (
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>24</italic>
</xref>
) and issued a series of guidelines for implementing antiviral drug and nonpharmaceutical interventions. During the pandemic, many states sought to work in cooperation with retail pharmacies and independent drug stores to assist in dispensing their shares of the SNS and state caches (
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>19</italic>
</xref>
<italic>&#x02013;</italic>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>22</italic>
</xref>
). The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) enlisted the help of several major pharmacy chains and independent retail pharmacies to dispense &#x0003e;200,000 antiviral drug courses from the SNS and state cache (
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>25</italic>
</xref>
). A report analyzing the pandemic response indicated that additional planning is required to ensure that persons residing in counties in Texas lacking pharmacies can obtain antiviral drugs when needed (
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>26</italic>
</xref>
).</p><p>We propose a method for optimizing the location of dispensing points for antiviral drugs within a state. Several state pandemic response plans include the following goals: using commercial pharmacies as antiviral drug-dispensing partners to limit strain on hospitals; reaching a population of broad demographics, including underinsured populations; and improving convenience. These states include Virginia (
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>19</italic>
</xref>
), Louisiana (
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">

), Tennessee (

<italic>22</italic>
</xref>
), and Texas (
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>25</italic>
</xref>
). These plans further specify that the choice of participating chains will depend on their location and local demographics, and they include strategies for reaching the underinsured population at minimal or no cost.</p><p>Working with Texas DSHS, we developed a data-driven facility-location model for designing commercial pharmacy antiviral drug distribution networks that maximizes access to underinsured populations, when access is based on a willingness-to-travel model estimated from National Household Travel Survey data (
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">

). We describe the model that is now available to the Texas DSHS as a Web-based decision-support tool for future pandemics (
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">

), and we use it to evaluate and optimize the commercial pharmacy distribution network established in Texas during the 2009 influenza pandemic.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Data</title><p>Texas has 1,939 US postal code (ZIP code) areas in 254 counties; 1,023 of these ZIP code areas contain &#x02265;1 pharmacy (

Other pharmacies, independent or small chain, are listed as independents. The Texas DSHS provided the list of pharmacies selected to dispense antiviral drugs to underinsured populations during the 2009 influenza pandemic; these pharmacies were in 723 ZIP code areas.

We made the simplifying assumption that health care&#x02013;seeking behavior in Texas during an influenza pandemic will resemble national willingness to travel by privately operated vehicle for work, school, family, and social reasons.

These pharmacies were located in 723 of the 1,023 ZIP code areas in Texas that had &#x02265;1 pharmacy. We estimated that this network provided antiviral drug access for 88% of the state&#x02019;s underinsured population (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>

In comparison, we also estimated that optimization over all possible pharmacy chains produced a network expected to achieve comparable access by using only 526 ZIP code areas, increased access to 92.5% with 723 ZIP code areas, and reached a maximum access of 95.2% with all 1,023 ZIP code areas.</p><p>However, optimizing for statewide access can lead to critical gaps in coverage. We categorized all Texas ZIP code areas on the basis of underinsured population sizes into small (&#x0003c;1,000 persons), medium (1,001&#x02013;7,000 persons), and large (&#x0003e;7,000 persons). These areas contained 7%, 51%, and 42% of the statewide underinsured population, respectively. The actual Texas 2009 distribution network and the corresponding optimized network (with 723 ZIP code areas) were estimated to achieve only 34.5% and 38.3% access in small ZIP code areas, respectively, but reached 88.0% and 92.5% access overall. By definition, the small ZIP code areas do not carry much weight in a statewide optimization model. They also tend to be more remote than larger ZIP code areas, and thus have lower access to selected pharmacies.</p><p>To address this gap, we modified the objective function to maximize access specifically in small ZIP code areas. Although these modifications improved coverage in these hard-to-reach populations, the solutions were suboptimal overall. Thus, we developed a hybrid optimization procedure that sequentially ensures high access statewide and in small ZIP code areas. With 723 dispensing points, the hybrid method with
<italic>P</italic>
= 75% of dispensing points allocated to small ZIP code areas produced networks that are expected to achieve 60.5% access in small ZIP code areas and 90.5% overall.

The pharmacy chains eligible for participation in Texas include Brookshire, Costco, CVS, HEB, Kmart, Kroger, Randalls, Sam&#x02019;s Club, Target, Tom Thumb, United, Walgreens, Walmart, and independent retail pharmacies (henceforth independents). During the 2009 influenza pandemic, the Texas DSHS distributed antiviral drugs from the SNS and state cache through 6 major chains (Brookshire, HEB, Kroger, United, Walgreens, and Walmart), and independents. When we restricted the optimization to a few major chains, the resulting networks still achieved broad statewide coverage (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>
,
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>
). For example, Walgreens alone was expected to achieve &#x02248;75% coverage if it dispenses in all of its 490 ZIP code areas; CVS and Walmart followed close behind (located in 422 and 372 ZIP code areas, respectively). These 3 chains have the greatest presence in the state (
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>
), but have highly overlapping geographic areas. Broad accessibility can also be achieved through a combination of smaller chains with geographic complementarity, for example, HEB and Kroger (in 189 and 167 ZIP code areas, respectively). Walgreens and Walmart overlap over half of their ZIP code areas (256), whereas HEB and Kroger overlap in only 30 ZIP code areas. However, the number of ZIP code areas alone is not predictive of access. For example, Brookshire has almost as many stores as Target (in 118 and 127 ZIP code areas, respectively), yet provides considerably less statewide access alone and in combination with other stores.</p><fig id="F3" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Antiviral drug access in underinsured populations for single-chain and 2-chain pharmacy distribution networks during the 2009 influenza pandemic, Texas, USA.

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>

). We have developed and demonstrated a simple, extensible, facility-location model for designing pharmacy-based antiviral drug distribution networks that effectively reach target populations. This model has been parameterized for the state of Texas and incorporated into a Web-based decision-support tool (

) for the Texas DSHS (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref>
,
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>
). The user can opt to target the underinsured or total population statewide or within any specified counties and to exclude or include particular pharmacies and pharmacy chains. On the basis of user input, the tool solves a family of optimization models, spanning the full range of possible network sizes, and presents the structure and performance of the optimized networks by using interactive graphs and maps. The tool is designed for use by Texas DSHS staff, who have Web-based access to it. Although this implementation is specific for Texas, the general model structure is readily adaptable to other jurisdictions. Adaptation requires specification of geographic units (e.g., ZIP code areas or counties), distances between each pair of units, estimated target population sizes within each unit, and number of pharmacies from each eligible chain located within the unit. The model can be easily extended to other states by using data available through the US Census Bureau and state pharmacy associations (

The nature and resolution of available data led to several simplifying assumptions. After fitting several decaying functions to the data, we chose a simple model that considers only the distance between one&#x02019;s home ZIP code area and the nearest pharmacy ZIP code area, rather than, for example, a more complex gravity model that incorporates the attractiveness of a store (
<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>36</italic>
</xref>
,
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>37</italic>
</xref>
). The national data did not specify health-related travel patterns. Texas NHTS data had coarser mileage bins, and represented only 1% of the nation-wide person-trips. Thus, we used national-scale data on all available travel categories (to earn a living, family/personal business, school/church, social/recreational, and miscellaneous), and included only travel by privately operated vehicles (because of the sparsity of data on public transportation and bicycles). We also approximated home ZIP code area distances to pharmacy ZIP code area distances by using great circle distances between the ZIP code centroids, rather than road travel distances between their street addresses, which can underestimate the distance an individual must travel. Finally, we approximated the underinsured and small ZIP code area populations by using methods described in the Data section.</p><p>During future pandemics, timely and effective deployment of antiviral drugs from the SNS and state cache might be essential for reducing early illness and death (
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">
<italic>19</italic>
</xref>
). Data-driven models, such as those in this optimization tool can be instrumental in the planning process, enabling public health agencies to identify and recruit networks of broad-reaching chains and remote independent pharmacies that can achieve equitable and effective distributions to target groups, such as underinsured, high-risk, or age-specific populations. This tool will also facilitate rapid, adaptive decision-making during pandemics, if, for example, a region requires additional supplies, particular pharmacies are unwilling or unable to provide assistance, or the target population changes.</p><p>As with many optimization studies, the general insights gleaned from the design and preliminary applications of this decision-support tool might be as valuable as the tool itself. The Texas DSHS has gained actionable perspectives on the geographic coverage and redundancies of major pharmacy chains, the unique reach of independent pharmacies, and as discussed further (

), the convenient overlap between optimal distribution networks for the underinsured population and total population. Given the need for and difficulties associated with enlisting independent pharmacies in sparsely populated areas, state agencies should engage them well before the next pandemic, perhaps in partnership with local health departments.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="citation"><p>
