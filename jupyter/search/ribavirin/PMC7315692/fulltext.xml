Control measures, based on isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine, can decrease and delay the burden of the ongoing epidemic. With respect to the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, recent modeling work shows that these interventions may be inadequate to control local outbreaks, even when perfect isolation is assumed. The effect of infectiousness prior to symptom onset combined with asymptomatic infectees further complicates the use of contact tracing. We aim to study whether antivirals, which decrease the viral load and reduce infectiousness, could be integrated into control measures in order to augment the feasibility of controlling the epidemic.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Using a simulation-based model of viral transmission, we tested the efficacy of different intervention measures to control local COVID-19 outbreaks. For individuals that were identified through contact tracing, we evaluate two procedures: monitoring individuals for symptoms onset and testing of individuals. Additionally, we investigate the implementation of an antiviral compound combined with the contact tracing process.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">For an infectious disease in which asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections are plausible, an intervention measure based on contact tracing performs better when combined with testing instead of monitoring, provided that the test is able to detect infections during the incubation period. Antiviral drugs, in combination with contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation, result in a significant decrease of the final size and the peak incidence, and increase the probability that the outbreak will fade out.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">In all tested scenarios, the model highlights the benefits of control measures based on the testing of traced individuals. In addition, the administration of an antiviral drug, together with quarantine, isolation, and contact tracing, is shown to decrease the spread of the epidemic. This control measure could be an effective strategy to control local and re-emerging outbreaks of COVID-19.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>EpiPose project from the European Union&#x02019;s SC1-PHE-CORONAVIRUS-2020 programme</institution></funding-source><award-id>101003688</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hens</surname><given-names>Niel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>European Union&#x02019;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme </institution></funding-source><award-id>682540</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hens</surname><given-names>Niel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Universiteit Antwerpen (BE)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Onderzoeksprogramma Artifici&#x000eb;le Intelligentie (AI) Vlaanderen'' programme.</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the European Union&#x02019;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program</institution></funding-source><award-id>101003627</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neyts</surname><given-names>Johan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par5">The use of invasive non-pharmaceutical interventions (i.e. full city lockdown (Wuhan), school closures, cutting inter-city travel and intra-city mobility) was able to bring the epidemic under control in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], but these measures are associated with profound societal and economic disruptions. We investigate the use of contact tracing and isolation in combination with an antiviral compound to control local outbreaks of COVID-19, to avoid such invasive social measures, and to preemptively reduce the burden of the epidemic. Even when perfect isolation is in place, this may not be sufficient to contain a local COVID-19 outbreak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], due to presymptomatic transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, in the absence of a vaccine, an antiviral drug in addition to isolation could be used to contain the current COVID-19 epidemic. There are currently no potent and selective antivirals available against coronaviruses. The development of such potent and safe drugs typically takes 10&#x000a0;years or longer. However, there are a number of drugs that either directly target a viral enzyme (such as the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, e.g., remdesivir and favipiravir) or that have been developed for non-viral indications, but that exert at least some level of antiviral activity (the so-called repurposed drugs). We here assume that an antiviral drug will reduce the viral load of an infected individual with COVID-19. For our modeling experiments, we considered the experimental drug remdesivir, for which viral load data were available to inform our model. Remdesivir is an investigational, broad-spectrum antiviral agent that was developed for the treatment of Ebola virus infections. It is a nucleotide analog that inhibits the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and has activity against a wide range of RNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It is also active against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which can be explained by similarities in the active site of the polymerase of these viruses. Based on this promising activity against other coronaviruses, remdesivir was recently shown to also inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As a consequence, this drug is currently under evaluation against COVID-19 in various clinical trials, and based on preliminary efficacy data, the drug was granted emergency use designation for severe COVID-19 patients by the FDA on 1 May 2020. For the aforementioned reasons, we chose to inform our model with data on the control of MERS-CoV viral load by remdesivir in a translational murine model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This animal model was specifically developed to better approximate the pharmacokinetics and drug exposure profile in humans. Therefore, the measure of viral titers in lung tissue at different time points in this murine model serves as a reasonable proxy for viral dynamics upon compound exposure in the controlled setting of a viral challenge. To this end, we calibrate the model to represent the viral load decrease thereof.</p><p id="Par6">In this manuscript, we first present the effect of isolation, considering both home quarantine (for individuals that are part of a contact trace network and for infected individuals with mild symptoms) and hospital isolation (for severe cases). We argue that when an individual is quarantined at home, this will only result in a partial reduction of contacts, since contacts with household members remain and other breaks of isolation can occur. To compensate for this imperfect isolation, we consider the use of an antiviral compound. We test these different control measures in a simulation study that aims at representing, given the available information, the current COVID-19 epidemic. Many countries are already beyond the point where local containment alone will suffice. However, we do expect that the methodology we propose will be key to avoid a second peak, especially given the limited depletion of susceptibles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Epidemiological dynamics</title><p id="Par7">The disease dynamics are depicted in the left panel of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

Ultimately, all infectives are assumed to either recover from infection or die (<italic>R</italic>). Isolation and quarantine start at the time of diagnosis. Isolation is assumed to be perfect; therefore, individuals can no longer transmit the disease. The quarantined individuals, instead, can still make contacts, although at a decreased rate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Transmission model</title><p id="Par9">The transition from the susceptible to the exposed class is governed by a stochastic process based on the notion of infectious contact processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. First, contacts between individuals are generated. When such contacts are generated between susceptible and infectious people, these can result in an infection event according to a Bernoulli experiment, using a probability value based on the time since infection. This probability is computed, at a precise time point, as the product of two components: the infectiousness measure, <italic>&#x003c5;</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), which quantifies the level of infectiousness over time, and the total amount of infectivity <italic>q</italic>, i.e., the number of expected effective contacts over the contact rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The function <italic>&#x003c5;</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is defined over the exposed and infectious period, or analogously over the incubation and symptomatic period, along which it integrates to one. This function is scaled to have a similar shape among different infectives, based on their lengths of exposed and infectious period. According to this framework, an infectious individual makes effective contacts at a rate, <italic>r</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), given by:

Isolation and quarantine are therefore more effective when performed prior to symptom onset, which is important, as recent work shows that infectees are infectious prior to symptom onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].

To challenge this assumption, we perform a sensitivity analysis where we consider a logistic curve (i.e., the Gompertz model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]: another common way to model biological population processes) and a linear function (Additional&#x000a0;File&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1). This sensitivity analysis shows that the different decay models yield similar results, supporting the robustness of our proposed prevention scheme (Additional&#x000a0;File&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S2).</p><p id="Par28">Regarding transmissibility, we tested the effect of a longer mean incubation period of 6.4&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], while keeping the infectiousness measure profile fixed. Doing so, we investigated a higher probability of presymptomatic infections. Results reported in Additional&#x000a0;File&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S6 indicate similar performance of the control strategies based on testing, while monitoring is shown to be less effective. Since SARS-CoV-2 also spreads in the presymptomatic stage, testing and administering antivirals are expected to be beneficial to reduce the number of infectives.</p><p id="Par29">In our baseline scenario, we assume that infected individuals can be identified using PCR testing starting 2&#x000a0;days post-infection. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of a test that can only detect infection after 3 and 4&#x000a0;days since infection (Additional&#x000a0;File&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S11 and Fig. S12). As expected, the efficacy of a control measure based on testing is sensitive to detection timeframes, but the control measure that uses antiviral drugs is still the most effective among the ones that were tested. Nevertheless, it is important to note that early diagnosis seems feasible based on this recent work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], where individuals in a nursing facility were found positive through PCR test, prior to symptom onset. This indicates that it is possible to diagnose patients early after infection. Another recently published paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] states that infectious coronavirus particles are shed at high concentrations from the nasal cavity before symptom development, which again indicates that it could be possible to detect infection early by means of PCR test.</p><p id="Par30">We assume that we have sufficient antiviral drug doses to treat all individuals that are encountered via the contact tracing procedure and enough tests to detect their infectious status. This is motivated by the fact that we consider an emerging outbreak and the required number of doses and tests will thus be limited.</p><p id="Par31">Furthermore, in the baseline scenario, we assume that all symptomatic individuals are in fact diagnosed. Due to the awareness of COVID-19 given by media and government officials, individuals are more likely to act upon even mild symptoms. This assumption is in line with the work of Hellewell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While this is a limitation of our study, we argue that in the scenarios where we aggressively trace and treat the contacts of individuals, we are more likely to detect (and constrain) cases that would otherwise go undetected. In addition, we investigated the impact of a proportion of mild symptomatic individuals that are not being diagnosed, unless they are traced (Additional&#x000a0;File&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S3, Fig. S4, and Fig. S5). As expected, all the tested control measures perform better when a high percentage of individuals are diagnosed. However, the use of antivirals in combination with testing and isolation/quarantine remarkably reduces the total number of cases and the peak incidence also in these scenarios.</p><p id="Par32">When severe cases are diagnosed or test positive, we assume they are immediately placed in perfect isolation, meaning that these infected individuals can no longer transmit the infection. While this assumption is consistent with earlier work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], health care workers are still at risk as they could be infected by infected individuals being cared for in isolation.</p><p id="Par33">In the IBS and IBTBS scenarios, we assume that the traced individuals that test positive are isolated in 16% of cases, even before showing actual severe symptoms.</p><p id="Par34">Although this model is informed with data on the control of MERS-CoV viral load using prophylaxis with remdesivir, it stands to reason that different classes of viral inhibitors control the viral load in different ways. Additionally, despite the sequence similarity of MERS-CoV and SARS-COV-2, it remains to be established whether the impact of remdesivir (or other antivirals) on the viral load is similar. Recently, clinical trials addressing the use of remdesivir in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients in different phases of their disease course were initiated. The clinical outcomes of such antiviral administrations are starting to be published in literature, where the starting time of the treatment seems to be crucial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Wang et al. reported a randomized trial in which no statistically significant benefit was associated with remdesivir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, it has been argued that this trial is underpowered and therefore results in inconclusive findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In addition, in that trial, the median time before the start of treatment was 10&#x000a0;days from the start of disease onset, possibly reflecting a phase in which the efficacy of antiviral administration is more limited. In this phase, not only the viral presence but also an excessive inflammatory response is a major cause of patient death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Moreover, a more positive statement on the efficacy of remdesivir was recently released, in which a moderate clinical improvement in recovery time was reported in an additional clinical trial (NCT04292899) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">However, the relationship between the effect of the antiviral on the viral load is not available yet, especially if administered in the early stage of the infection. To this end, longitudinal data of the viral load on COVID-19 infected patients treated with different viral inhibitors will be informative, especially when the administration is performed in the early stage of infection. Furthermore, Sheahan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] demonstrated that the efficacy of remdesivir for MERS depends on the viral dose and also on the timing of the treatment of the viral inhibitor. When mice were inoculated with a high inoculum of virus, delayed start of antiviral treatment failed to fully prevent viral pathogenesis. Although remdesivir proved effective at reducing the viral load also under these conditions, the argument for an early start of antiviral treatment is evident. Presumably, reducing the viral load with an antiviral compound loses its efficacy in advanced disease as the tissue damage is sustained by inflammatory processes in absence of the viral initiator. We here suggest to consider the proposed scenario based on remdesivir. In our implementation, antiviral injections are immediately administered to successfully traced individuals, mostly in their asymptomatic phase, and to the diagnosed patient. Therefore, we believe that the assumptions on the use of this drug, in the considered scenario, are reasonable. Furthermore, as remdesivir is a repurposed drug that was developed for Ebola, it remains possible that more potent coronavirus inhibitors will be developed in the future.</p><p id="Par36">We considered a homogeneous population that lacks structured contact patterns. In fact, the probability of successfully tracing contacts depends on the mixing behavior of the specific individual. In particular, close contacts within the household are likely to be traced as well as contacts in working places, school, and leisure environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Since the majority of close contacts occur in these locations, it is reasonable to assume that a high proportion of secondary infections can be correctly traced. Therefore, this analysis should be further investigated in a more fine-grained individual based model prior to moving this strategy to public health practice.</p><p id="Par37">While a limited number of countries (Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea) were able to control the epidemic through contact tracing without the use of an antiviral compound, many countries (e.g., Italy, France, Spain, Belgium, USA) so far failed using this approach, partly due to limited capacity to implement similar measures. Therefore, we believe an approach that can accommodate contract tracing imperfections, e.g., by reducing infectiousness through the use of an antiviral compound, is warranted.</p><p id="Par38">We also tested the impact of outbreaks that are initiated by multiple infectives, and the results are shown in Additional&#x000a0;File&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S16. Final size and peak incidence approximate the baseline scenario but the fade-out probability decreases. Nevertheless, the administration of antivirals in combination with the other measures still results in a higher fade-out probability compared to the other tested scenarios, reducing the probability that an outbreak will be major.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par39">The ongoing epidemic of COVID-19 threatens to overwhelm the health systems of many countries. Although control measures such as isolation and quarantine are important, their exclusive use may not be able to efficiently contain an outbreak, requiring a prolonged lockdown that could harm the economic system. In addition, when a high proportion of infected individuals require hospital care, the number of cases at peak should be minimized as much as possible to avoid regional health care infrastructure becoming overwhelmed. In the current study, we highlight the importance of testing compared to monitoring, and we show the impact of an antiviral compound that reduces the viral load and, consequently, the infectiousness of infectives. For this simulation study, we utilized the data on the control of the viral load by remdesivir in a pathogen challenge experiment. However, this study can be easily extended to other antivirals, given the availability of viral load data upon drug administration. Although the efficacy of administering an antiviral compound, in addition to isolation and quarantine, depends on the effectiveness of the respective drug, it is plausible that drugs that interfere with the infection life cycle show a comparable impact on the viral load. We demonstrate that the implementation of such a compound together with quarantine leads to a substantial reduction of the final size and the peak incidence. In addition, the number of outbreaks that are most challenging to contain decreases when the antiviral is administered to diagnosed and traced individuals. The same result holds when the basic reproduction number is set to an equal value for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (Additional&#x000a0;File&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S11) and when the proportion of asymptomatic and diagnosed individuals vary among the population (Additional&#x000a0;File&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S3, Fig. S4, Fig. S5, Fig. S14, and Fig. S15). Therefore, the administration of an antiviral drug, together with isolation and quarantine, is expected to have a major impact in the control of local COVID-19 outbreaks. Although antiviral drugs are mostly evaluated in clinical trials for their capacity to control the disease manifestations and alter the clinical outcome in individual patients, our study implies that antiviral drugs can be implemented to alter the spread of a viral epidemic by influencing the viral load and infectiousness of infectees upon quarantine. Given the fact that antiviral treatment should be given in the quarantine setting, the route of administration in relation to the frequency and duration of treatment and the safety of the compound in healthy volunteers are critical for the success of such an intervention. Although oral formulations are desirable, intraveneous application in a limited outbreak could prevent hospitalizations and thus reduce the pressure on the health care capacity as the antiviral treatment is initiated earlier in the disease.</p><p id="Par40">However, such a treatment falls in many countries under the responsibility of a prescribing practitioner that is typically not part of the track and contact trace team.</p><p id="Par41">An important consideration is the use of contact tracing in combination with an antiviral to reduce the burden on nursing home facilities. Recent work shows that despite lockdowns, SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread in such facilities, resulting in a high number of deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. We believe that the implementation of frequent testing, contact tracing in combination with pharmaceutical intervention (with an antiviral) to treat individuals of a nursing home facility early, could have an important impact on the number of deaths in these facilities.</p><p id="Par42">We remain hopeful for drugs to be identified, either directly or indirectly targeting the virus, that can be used as a treatment for the hospitalized patient population. Yet, our work shows that such compounds have an additional potential to mitigate the pandemic when implemented in concert with quarantine and contact tracing. Therefore, research aimed at the identification of new drugs and drug formulations suitable for the prophylactic use for different viral families with pandemic potential remains warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec12"><p>
