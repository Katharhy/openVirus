However, poor availability, variation between batches and ethical issues regarding PHHs limit their applications. The discovery of human sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (hNTCP) as a functional HBV receptor has enabled the development of a surrogate model to supplement the use of PHHs. In the present study, the evolutionary distance of seven species was assessed based on single-copy homologous genes. Based on the evolutionary distance and availability, PHHs and primary rabbit hepatocytes (PRHs) were isolated and infected with hNTCP-recombinant lentivirus, and susceptibility to HBV infection in the two cell types was tested and compared. In addition, HBV infection efficiency of hNTCP-expressing PPHs with pooled HBV-positive serum and purified particles was determined. The potential use of HBV-infected hNTCP-expressing PPHs for drug screening was assessed. The results demonstrated that pigs and rabbits are closer to humans in the divergence tree compared with mice and rats, indicating that pigs and rabbits were more likely to facilitate the HBV post-entry lifecycle. Following hNTCP complementation and HBV infection, PPHs and Huh7D human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, but not PRHs, exhibited increased hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B e-antigen secretion, covalently closed circular DNA formation and infectious particle secretion. hNTCP-expressing PPHs were susceptible to infection with HBV particles purified from pooled HBV-positive sera, but were poisoned by raw HBV-positive sera. The use of HBV-infected hNTCP-expressing PPHs for viral entry inhibitor screening was revealed to be applicable and reproducible. In conclusion, hNTCP-expressing PPHs may be valuable tool for investigating HBV infection and antiviral drugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hepatitis B virus</kwd><kwd>sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide</kwd><kwd>primary pig hepatocyte</kwd><kwd>cell model</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection exhibits a wide spectrum of clinical liver manifestations (<xref rid="b1-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) are currently considered to be the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; cell model for studying HBV infection (<xref rid="b2-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, poor availability, variation between batches and ethical issues regarding PHHs limit their application. Primary hepatocytes from non-human primates, such as chimpanzees and monkeys, are expensive, difficult to obtain and also associated with ethical concerns (<xref rid="b3-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Primary <italic>tupaia</italic> hepatocytes (PTHs) from the treeshrew genus <italic>Tupaia belangeri</italic> are less expensive, but also difficult to obtain, and HBV infection of PTHs is different compared with that of PHHs, as the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) plus polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG8000) during infection does not significantly promote HBV infectivity (<xref rid="b3-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>The discovery of the HBV functional receptor human sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (hNTCP) (<xref rid="b4-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) has enabled the development of primary cell models and immunocompetent animal models based on easily obtainable laboratory animals. However, complementation of mouse and rat hepatocytes with hNTCP does not result in susceptibility to HBV infection (<xref rid="b4-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), which indicates that additional host factors may be needed for the post-entry HBV lifecycle in mouse and rat hepatocytes. Therefore, other easily obtained laboratory animals that do not pose the same ethical concerns as primates may be a promising alternative solution for primary cell and animal models of HBV infection.</p><p>In the presence of hNTCP, hepatocytes from primates are susceptible to HBV infection, whereas mouse and rat hepatocytes resist HBV infection (<xref rid="b4-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In the present study, it was presumed that animals with short evolutionary distance to primates may facilitate the HBV post-entry lifecycle. The generation of an easily obtained primary cell model for HBV infection based on other laboratory animals may be valuable for fundamental research on HBV infection and antiviral drugs. To achieve this goal, evolutionary distance was assessed based on single-copy homologous genes of seven species. The hepatocytes from candidate animals (pigs and rabbits) were then isolated, cultured and infected with hNTCP-recombinant lentivirus, followed by HBV infection. Anti-HBV drugs were also screened in the hNTCP-complemented hepatocytes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Cell isolation and culture</title><p>Ethical approval for the study was granted by the Institutional Bioethics Committee of Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, First Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University (Shenzhen, China).

Based on the single-copy homologous genes of seven species (<xref rid="b18-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), a divergence tree was generated (<xref rid="f1-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The divergence years were estimated to be in the following order: <italic>M. musculus</italic> and <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> (84.9 million years) &#x0003e; <italic>O. cuniculus</italic> (69.8 million years) &#x0003e; <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and <italic>M. mulatta</italic> (59.9 million years) &#x0003e; <italic>S. scrofa</italic> and <italic>T. brasiliensis</italic>. Primary hepatocytes isolated from <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and <italic>M. mulatta</italic> fully support the HBV post-entry lifecycle, whereas hepatocytes from <italic>M. musculus</italic> and <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> are resistant (<xref rid="b4-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In addition, bats, such as <italic>T. brasiliensis</italic>, carry pathogenic hepadnaviruses that are antigenically related to HBV and are capable of infecting human hepatocytes (<xref rid="b19-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), indicating that <italic>T. brasiliensis</italic> hepatocytes may also facilitate the HBV post-entry lifecycle as hepadnaviruses are highly host selective. Notably, hepadnavirus has been detected in <italic>S. scrofa</italic> (domestic pigs) (<xref rid="b20-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and <italic>O. cuniculus</italic> (rabbits), which may also be infected by an HBV-like virus (<xref rid="b22-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Therefore, easily obtained laboratory animals, such as pigs and rabbits, may be suitable as potential hosts for HBV infection after hNTCP complementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Culture and hNTCP complementation of PPHs and PRHs</title><p>PPHs and PRHs were isolated by a two-step collagenase digestion and plated on collagen-coated culture plates. PPHs were maintained in PMM (<xref rid="b4-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) for &#x0003e;2 weeks and exhibited a typical highly differentiated morphology, such as spherical bright nuclei and a polarized shape (<xref rid="f2-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). However, PRHs rapidly deteriorated in PMM and died within 2 days (data not shown). Following optimization, PRHs could be maintained in PMM supplemented with 10% FBS for approximately 10&#x02013;14 days and exhibited a typical highly differentiated morphology (<xref rid="f2-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The difference in maintenance medium between PPHs and PRHs indicated that PPHs may more closely resemble PHHs compared with PRHs, which matched the evolutionary distances identified in the divergence tree (<xref rid="f1-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>As a positive control for HBV infection, the human cell line Huh7D exhibits increased susceptibility to HBV infection in the presence of hNTCP compared with the HepG2 cell line (<xref rid="b10-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>); therefore, the Huh7D cell line was selected in the present study as a positive control for subsequent experiments. PPHs and PRHs, as well as Huh7D cells, were infected with the hNTCP-recombinant lentivirus. Cells were harvested 4 days post-lentiviral infection to determine the hNTCP mRNA expression levels by qPCR and protein expression levels by western blotting, or were fixed to detect hNTCP expression and location by immunofluorescence assay. hNTCP expression was only observed in cells infected with hNTCP-recombinant lentivirus (<xref rid="f2-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B and C</xref>). Although the same MOI of the lentivirus (MOI=1) was used, the estimated percentage of hNTCP-positive PPHs and Huh7D cells was 70&#x02013;80%, whereas the estimated percentage of hNTCP-positive PRHs was slightly lower at 50&#x02013;60% (<xref rid="f2-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). These hNTCP-expressing cells were subsequently subjected to HBV infection.</p></sec><sec><title>HBV infection of primary hepatocytes</title><p>HBV infection was performed using concentrated viral stocks prepared from HepAD38 cells (<xref rid="b20-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). According to our preliminary data, the hNTCP-complemented PPHs could be maintained for &#x0003e;2 weeks post-HBV infection, whereas hNTCP-complemented PRHs could be maintained for 1 week (data not shown). Therefore, the experimental period was limited to 7 days post-infection (dpi). Following infection with HBV (MOI=1,000), all cell types without hNTCP exhibited either negative or reduced secretion of HBsAg/HBeAg, indicating that these cells were resistant to HBV infection. Following hNTCP complementation, Huh7D and PPHs, but not PRHs, were positive for HBsAg/HBeAg secretion, with continuously increased secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg until the end of culture (<xref rid="f3-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A and B</xref>). Of note, HBsAg and HBeAg secretion in hNTCP-complemented PPHs was significantly higher compared with the levels in hNTCP-complemented Huh7D cells, although hNTCP mRNA and protein levels were similar in these cells (<xref rid="f2-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B and C</xref>).</p><p>To confirm the formation of cccDNA, the infected cells were lysed, and nuclear DNA was extracted for qPCR. As presented in <xref rid="f3-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, hNTCP-complemented PPHs produced the highest cccDNA levels among the three types of cells, followed by hNTCP-complemented Huh7D cells, whereas the cccDNA levels in hNTCP-complemented PRHs were comparable to the controls. These results were similar with the results of HBeAg and HBsAg secretion. To further confirm the secretion of infectious HBV particles, the new virions in the culture medium at 3, 5, and 7 dpi were concentrated by PEG8000 and added to a new batch of hNTCP-complemented PPHs (<xref rid="f3-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). HBeAg secretion in infected hNTCP-complemented PPHs gradually increased in a time-dependent manner, indicating that new virions were infectious and could be passaged (<xref rid="f3-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p><p>Serum from HBV-positive patients is frequently used as a viral source for infection, as it is related to clinical viral strains. hNTCP-complemented PPHs were infected at MOI=200 with raw pooled patient serum and purified HBV particles. As presented in <xref rid="f3-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, HBeAg secretion was positive and continuously increased during HBV infection with purified HBV particles, indicating that hNTCP-complemented PPHs could be infected by clinical viral strains. Raw pooled patient serum was cytotoxic to PPHs, as the cells died in the presence of this serum (data not shown). This cytotoxicity was significantly reduced by heating the raw pooled patient serum at 56&#x000b0;C for 30 min (<xref rid="f3-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>), indicating that natural human anti-pig antibodies (such as anti-Gal or anti-Neu5Gc antibodies) and the complement system were the major cause of cytotoxicity. Therefore, purification is essential for the establishment of HBV infection using human serum as the viral source.</p></sec><sec><title>Anti-HBV drugs may be screened in the hNTCP-complemented PPHs</title><p>Lamivudine, Myr-preS1<sup>2-47</sup> and 4B10 are well-characterized inhibitors of HBV replication and/or HBV entry (<xref rid="b23-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b25-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and were tested in HBV-infected hNTCP-complemented PPHs in the present study. The three inhibitors were non-cytotoxic to hNTCP-complemented PPHs (<xref rid="f4-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Myr-preS1<sup>2-47</sup> and 4B10, the peptide HBV entry inhibitors, exhibited concentration-dependent inhibition of HBsAg and HBeAg secretion and HBV DNA in the supernatants as higher concentration of inhibitors significantly reduced antigens/virion secretion compared with the lower concentration although there is a plateau, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 0.5&#x02013;1 nM (<xref rid="f4-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-C</xref>), which matches the reported data regarding HBV infection in the PHH model (<xref rid="b23-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Lamivudine, an inhibitor of HBV replication, also exhibited concentration-dependent inhibition of HBsAg and HBeAg secretion and HBV DNA in the supernatants, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of ~50 nM. The less effective inhibition of HBV infection by lamivudine possibly occurred due to the failure of lamivudine to block HBV entry. These results indicated that HBV-infected hNTCP-complemented PPHs may be applicable for anti-HBV drug screening.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of the present study indicated species tropism regarding the HBV post-entry lifecycle. <italic>S. scrofa</italic> was hypothesized to facilitate the HBV post-entry lifecycle, as it is close to <italic>T. brasiliensis</italic> in the divergence tree, both of which are close to <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and <italic>M. mulatta</italic>. <italic>S. scrofa</italic> was experimentally demonstrated to facilitate the HBV post-entry lifecycle in the present study. Although <italic>O. cuniculus</italic> is closer to <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and <italic>M. mulatta</italic> compared with <italic>M. musculus</italic> and <italic>R. norvegicus</italic>, PRHs were unable to facilitate the HBV post-entry lifecycle in the present study. According to the present results, <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> and <italic>O. cuniculus</italic> may lack one or more limiting factors for the HBV post-entry lifecycle. Identification of these limiting factors may help in the development of immunocompetent small animal models and identification of novel antiviral targets.</p><p>As demonstrated in the present study, the differentiation status is an important limiting factor in productive HBV infection and replication. According to viral antigen secretion and cccDNA formation, hNTCP-complemented PPHs may be a superior cell model for HBV infection compared with the dedifferentiated human hepatoma cell line Huh7D (<xref rid="b10-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The Huh7 cell line can be induced by DMSO to a higher differentiation state compared with untreated cells. Our previous study has also demonstrated this phenomenon (<xref rid="b10-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, the differentiation state of well-differentiated Huh7 is still lower compared with that of primary human hepatocytes. For example, well-differentiated Huh7 is resistant to HBV infection. According to our previous unpublished data, the expression levels of differentiation-related genes are lower in well-differentiated Huh7 cells compared with primary human hepatocyte. As pig is close to human in the divergence tree, PPHs complemented with hNTCP may be a superior model for HBV infection compared with the dedifferentiated human hepatoma cell line.</p><p>hNTCP expression in PPHs is controlled by a relatively stable promoter (human elongation factor-1&#x003b1;); this is different from the endogenous promoter that induces hNTCP expression in PHHs, which leads to a rapid decrease in hNTCP expression, thus causing PHHs to be resistant to HBV infection (<xref rid="b9-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Therefore, hNTCP-complemented PPHs may be more susceptible to HBV infection compared with PHHs. However, hNTCP-complemented PPHs have certain limitations, such as genomic differences compared with PHHs and limited genomic annotation. One of these differences is the xenoantigens expressed on pig cells (e.g., Gal and Neu5Gc), which can be recognized by natural anti-pig antibodies in human blood and may lead to complement-dependent cytotoxicity (<xref rid="b26-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). This may explain why hNTCP-complemented PPHs were fragile when raw patient serum was used as the viral source in the present study. However, hNTCP-complemented PPHs may partially replace the roles of PHHs in HBV-related fundamental research and drug screening.</p><p>The MOI for HBV infection of PPHs using HepAD38 cells as viral source was different compared with that using patient serum as viral source. The majority of viral particles from HepaAD38 are naked, whereas the majority of viral particles in the patient serum are intact. Therefore, different MOI was used in HBV infection with different viral sources, which has been suggested for successful HBV infection in our previous publications (<xref rid="b8-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Lempp <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b27-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) have reported that hNTCP is the limiting factor in HBV infection in pig hepatocytes, which was also demonstrated in the present study. In addition, the possibility of <italic>O. cuniculus</italic> facilitating the HBV post-entry lifecycle was assessed and subsequently excluded from the present study, which supplemented the literature on potential animal hosts for HBV infection.</p><p>In conclusion, hNTCP-complemented PPHs may be a valuable tool for investigating HBV infection and antiviral drugs. The results also indicated that the pig is a promising candidate in the development of an immunocompetent animal model.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Professor Chen Xulin from Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS (Wuhan) for kindly providing HepAD38.
