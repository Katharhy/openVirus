<article-title>Comparative specificity and sensitivity of NS1-based serological assays for the detection of Flavivirus immune response</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><p>Surveillance of Usutu virus is crucial to prevent future outbreaks both in Europe and in other countries currently na&#x000ef;ve to the infection, such as the Americas. This goal remains difficult to achieve, notably because of the lack of large-scale cohort studies and the absence of commercially available diagnostic reagents for USUV.</p><p>This work started with the first identification of USUV in a blood donor in the Friuli Venezia Giulia (FVG) Region in Northern-Eastern Italy, which is endemic for West Nile virus. Considering that only one IgG ELISA is commercially available, but none for IgM, a novel NS1 antigen based IgG/M ELISA has been developed. This assay tested successfully for the detection of Usutu virus in blood donors with the identification of a second case of transmission and high levels of exposure. Furthermore, two pan-flavivirus antiviral drugs, that we previously characterized to be inhibitors of other flavivirus infectivity, were successfully tested for inhibition of Usutu virus with inhibitory concentrations in the low micromolar range.</p><p>To conclude, this work identifies North-Eastern Italy as endemic for Usutu virus with implications for the screening of transfusion blood. A novel NS1-based ELISA test has been implemented for the detection of IgM/G that will be of importance as a tool for the diagnosis and surveillance of Usutu virus infection. Finally, Usutu virus is shown to be sensitive to a class of promising pan-flavivirus drugs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Tropical viruses transmitted by ticks or mosquitoes are becoming a health threat in areas of the world that were previously na&#x000ef;ve to these infections. Usutu virus is a mosquito-borne virus that is circulating in Europe causing massive outbreaks in birds. Transmission to humans is documented, with some reports of severe neurological disease. However, the real size of transmission to humans suffers from lack of data due to insufficient surveillance. The first confirmed case of human USUV infection in an asymptomatic blood donor from North-Eastern Italy is hereby demonstrated by molecular assays and virus isolation. Specific Usutu virus serology has also been developed taking advantage of the NS1 viral antigen, which is tested on a number of blood donors demonstrating a high level of Usutu positivity. These findings confirm the human transmission in the region and offer a novel tool for specific Usutu virus surveillance. Finally, two drugs that were previously shown to have a wide spectrum of activity towards members of this family of viruses are shown to inhibit also Usutu virus, opening the way to a novel class antivirals.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Work on flaviviruses in AM&#x02019;s laboratory is supported by the Beneficientia Stiftung, Vaduz Lichtenstein, and by the ZIDECHIP project from the Regione FVG of Italy.

USUV belongs to the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) antigenic complex, similar to West Nile virus (WNV), which is often circulating in the same areas. Similar to other flaviviruses, USUV is an enveloped virus with a (+)-strand RNA genome encoding a single polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved into structural (C, prM and E) and non-structural (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) proteins. USUV was initially isolated in Africa in 1959 and it has been continuously circulating with several introductions in Europe through migratory birds since the first documented cases in birds in Tuscany in 1996 and Vienna in 2001 [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, several distinct lineages of USUV (Europe 1&#x02013;5 lineages) currently co-circulate [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Recently, a report of USUV infection of <italic>Anatidae</italic> in Belgium pose a risk of economically relevant zoonoses [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. USUV is transmitted by different species of <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes, particularly <italic>Culex pipiens</italic>, which is thought to be the main vector in Europe [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the invasive mosquito <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is also capable of USUV transmission, albeit at a lower competence, and USUV was found naturally also in the invasive mosquito species <italic>Aedes japonicus</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Humans, as well as other mammals, are dead-end hosts for USUV and show generally mild symptoms. However, neurological complications in immune-compromised patients could represent a growing concern for human health. Since 2009, several human cases of USUV-related neuroinvasive illness were reported in Italy [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and in 2013, three other human cases were reported in Croatia [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. USUV has also been recently associated with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic facial paralysis in France [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Transfusion-transmitted USUV infection has not been reported so far. However, USUV-infected donations in the EU blood supply have been detected during routine screening of blood donations for WNV RNA [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. USUV antibodies in blood donors had also been detected [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The prevalence of USUV among blood donors is not fully determined also because there is no requirement to screen blood donors for USUV. Assessing the risk of USUV transmission through blood transfusion is therefore crucial. The cross-reactivity of WNV nucleic-acid tests (NAT) with USUV can contribute to the detection of these flaviviruses in donated blood [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, WNV NAT&#x02013;reactive donations should undergo virus-specific confirmatory tests [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The identification and isolation of Usutu virus from a blood donor in the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region of North-Eastern Italy is hereby reported. Partial sequencing of the isolated virus mapped to the Europe 1 lineage. Importantly, an in-house IgG/M ELISA assay based on the NS1 antigen was therefore optimized in order to assess the seroprevalence of Usutu virus in this area. In addition, two novel pyridobenzothiazolone derivatives were also shown to be inhibitory against Usutu virus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Identification and isolation of USUV</title><p>Blood donations in the FVG Region, an area endemic for WNV, are routinely screened by the Cobas WNV nucleic acid test and positive results are sent for confirmation to the Regional Reference Laboratory for Arbovirus infection in Trieste. In August 2018 an asymptomatic blood donor positive in the initial screening test could not be confirmed for WNV RNA. However, the sample turned positive for USUV RNA by the amplification protocol of Cavrini et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The infectious virus was rescued from Vero cells inoculated with the human serum and a sequence of a 659 bp conserved region of NS5 was obtained (accession number MN509808). This novel isolate, named USUV/HU/FVG.ITA/2018/01 was shown to cluster with USUV strains from lineage Europe 01 isolated in Austria, Hungary and Germany (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008156.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).

Expression plasmids encoding codon-optimized full-length nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) from USUV and WNV were generated. These constructs included a Sec leader peptide at the N-terminus of the protein for optimal secretion and a 6x-histidine tag (6x-His) or V5 tag at the C terminus for protein purification or mice immunization, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008156.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Secreted recombinant USUV NS1 (rNS1) was affinity purified by nickel chromatography from human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells transiently transfected with these constructs. A control WNV rNS1 was also purified and both proteins were analyzed in parallel by SDS PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008156.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Thick bands around 55 kDa in size corresponding to the glycosylated forms of the protein were observed as expected. Densitometric analysis of the gel showed purity in the range of 87&#x02013;90%, similar to commercially available NS1 proteins. To assess the native oligomeric state of the secreted proteins the purified rNS1 were analyzed by western blot under denaturing/reducing and non-denaturing/non-reducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008156.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).

Therefore, it is important to initiate antiviral testing as soon as possible.

Therefore, blood donors are routinely screened for WNV infection. USUV co-circulates with WNV in many European countries and share host and vector species [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The year 2018 showed a dramatic increase of USUV and WNV infections in Europe with increased transmission to humans [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], including the neighboring Veneto Region [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Furthermore, circulation of USUV in mosquitoes has been described in the region [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, in this report for the first time, the presence in FVG of USUV transmission to humans is being documented by isolation and a retrospective serological analysis. Two samples of serum from 44 blood donors were confirmed as new infections with USUV, one also by NAT and virus isolation. Genetic analysis indicates that the isolate belongs to the Europe 1 lineage circulating in Italy and neighboring countries at least since 2009 [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Given the increased incidence of USUV, it is critical to develop specific serological assays for diagnosis and surveillance. However, only the Eurimmune USUV IgG ELISA is commercially available, while for IgM there are none on the market. The Eurimmune USUV IgG ELISA is based on the viral structural proteins and these assays suffer from broad antigenic cross-reactivity of anti-flavivirus antibodies [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. To this end the use of secreted flavivirus NS1 as an antigen alternative to virion proteins for the detection of IgM/G has proven to provide a better level of specificity [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. NS1 is secreted as a glycosylated oligomer in high amounts during the viremic phase and its detection is considered a marker of infection [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Anti-NS1 IgM appear early (2&#x02013;3 days) following infection. Evaluation of acute infection by measuring anti-NS1 IgM antibodies has shown higher sensitivity compared to RT-PCR in sera samples of infected patients with dengue virus [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Detection of IgG antibodies using purified NS1 antigens from different flaviviruses has been reported to show a low degree of cross-reactivity to related viruses and high reactivity to homologous NS1 antigens [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Available commercial assays for USUV are scarce and exploit mostly virion components as antigen. In this report, IgM/G ELISA based on recombinant NS1 for USUV is being established and tested in comparison with the highly homologous and geographically overlapping WNV. Careful analysis in immunized mice allowed a better characterization of sensitivity and specificity showing that immune IgM sera for TBEV, WNV, ZIKV, and DENV1-4 didn't cross-react with USUV, while some cross-reactivity for WNV, and to a lesser extent to DENV2 persisted for IgG detection. Retrospective serological analysis in a restricted group of blood donors with suspected WNV infection confirmed a second USUV infection and overall 45% (20/44) USUV IgM positive sera, with at least 7/44 that were also positive for WNV IgM. Although cross-reactivity cannot be completely ruled out, the latter samples may also indicate co-infections with WNV and USUV occurring in the same patient. This hypothesis is sustained by the fact that viruses co-circulate in the same area and share hosts, vectors and seasonality. Furthermore, recent report identified human cases with co-infection by WNV and USUV in the same individual [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>In this report, it has also been shown that HeE1-2Y and HeE1-17Y compounds are active against USUV in the lower micromolar range.

Although HeE1-2Y and HeE1-17Y compounds were tested only for one USUV strain, it is expected that they will be active also for other circulating strains because of the little genetic variation among isolates observed so far [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].

For IgM detection, sera samples were pre-adsorbed with GullSorb (Meridien Bioscience) and incubated for 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C, while for IgG detection sera samples were incubated for 1 hour at RT. 100 &#x003bc;l/well of HRP-linked goat antibodies anti-mouse IgM/G or anti-human IgM/G were used (Sigma, 1:5000). In all cases, secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 hour at RT. After each antibody incubation, wells were washed three times with PBS 0.1% tween 20 (PBST). Signal was developed by adding 70 &#x003bc;l of 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Sigma). The reaction was stopped by adding 30 &#x003bc;l of 2N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to each well. The optical density was measured at 450 nm (OD<sub>450</sub>) with an ELISA EnVision 2104 Multilabel Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer). The P/N ratio for both IgM/IgG rNS1-based ELISA was obtained by dividing the OD<sub>450</sub> of test specimen by the mean OD<sub>450</sub> of 16 negative control specimens. Commercial ELISA Eurimmun USUV IgG EI 2667&#x02013;9601 G and Focus DxSelect WNV IgG EL0300G were used for USUV and WNV IgG detection, respectively. The comparative receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to calculate the optimal cut-off values of P/N ratios for IgM/G detection by WNV rNS1-based ELISA. A bin range of different P/N ratio values was used to select the optimal cut-off value that gave 100% sensitivity and specificity [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Plaque reduction neutralization assay (PRNT)</title><p>PRNT was performed on Vero cells as previously described [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Briefly, Heat-inactivated (56&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes) serum samples were serially diluted two-fold in DMEM, mixed with equal volumes of WNV or USUV (50 PFU) and incubated for 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C. Vero cells seeded on 24 wells&#x02019; plates were incubated with the mixture for 1h at 37&#x000b0;C and then overlaid with 3% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC, Sigma) in DMEM 2% FBS. After 3 days, cells were fixed 3.7% paraformaldehyde and stained with 1% crystal violet for 30 min. Plaques were counted manually. The neutralization titer (PRNT<sub>50</sub>) was calculated as the reciprocal of the highest test serum dilution for which the virus infectivity was reduced by 50% when compared with the average plaque count of the challenge virus.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Pyridobenzothiazolone derivatives</title><p>HeE1-2Y and HeE1-17Y were re-synthesized for this study following the chemical procedures previously reported [<xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008156.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].
