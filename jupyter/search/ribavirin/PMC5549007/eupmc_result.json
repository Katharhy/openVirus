    "Natural history of HCV-infected renal transplant recipients is about to change with the invention of new drugs available for the treatment of HCV.To analyze the evolution of renal transplant recipients infected with HCV in 30 years of activity of a Renal Transplantation Unit.We studied 1334 patients who underwent renal transplantation between 1985 and 2015.189 (14.2%) of these 1334 were found HCV seropositive. 60 were HCV RNA-positive for >6 months. 5 died with a functioning graft; 19 lost their graft and resumed dialysis. Most of the rejections occurred within the first year of the transplantation and none resulted in immediate loss of the graft. In post-transplantation period, 14 patients developed clinical hepatic disease, 10 manifested new-onset diabetes after transplantation, and 4 had de novo neoplasia, none of them had hepatocellular carcinoma. The outcomes of the different variables analyzed were similar between patients with HCV-infection and those with HCV and HBV co-infection. The median survival time was 13.4 (95% CI: 10.7-16.1) years; the median survival time of patients without HCV infection was 14.6 (95% CI: 13.8-15.4) years (p=0.23).In the era before the availability of new anti-HCV drugs, our experience with HCV-infected renal transplant recipients revealed similar post-transplantation complications, graft and patient survival as those not infected with HCV."
