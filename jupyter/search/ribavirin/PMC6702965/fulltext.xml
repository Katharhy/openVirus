Some of these compounds are involved in the control of lipid metabolism and/or membrane rearrangements. Here, we describe the effect of three of these cell-targeting antivirals: lauryl gallate (LG), valproic acid (VPA), and cerulenin (CRL) in the multiplication of viruses causing important porcine diseases. The results confirm the antiviral action in cultured cells of LG against African swine fever virus (ASFV), foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), as well as the inhibitory effect of VPA and CRL on ASFV infection. Other gallate esters have been also assayed for their inhibition of FMDV growth. The combined action of these antivirals has been also tested in ASFV infections, with some synergistic effects when LG and VPA were co-administered. Regarding the mode of action of the antivirals, experiments on the effect of the time of its addition in infected cell cultures indicated that the inhibition by VPA and CRL occurred at early times after ASFV infection, while LG inhibited a late step in FMDV infection. In all the cases, the presence of the antiviral reduced or abolished the induction of virus-specific proteins. Interestingly, LG also reduced mortality and FMDV load in a mouse model. The possible use of cell-targeted antivirals against porcine diseases is discussed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>virus</kwd><kwd>porcine</kwd><kwd>antiviral</kwd><kwd>lauryl gallate</kwd><kwd>valproic acid</kwd><kwd>cerulenin</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn1">Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci&#x000f3;n</funding-source><award-id rid="cn1">2011-20E112</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn2">Ministerio de Econom&#x000ed;a y Competitividad<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003329</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn2">AGL2014-52395-C2-1-R</award-id><award-id rid="cn2">AGL2017-84097-C2-1-R</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn3">ECFEDER</funding-source><award-id rid="cn3">S20149/ABI-2906-PLATESA</award-id><award-id rid="cn3">P2018/BAA-4370-PLATESA-CM</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn4">Fundaci&#x000f3;n Ram&#x000f3;n Areces and Banco Santander Universidades</funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="33"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="6877"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Conventional antiviral drugs (AVs) that interfere with viral proteins or functions have been developed against a number of different animal viral diseases, but these compounds often lead to selection of drug resistance in virus populations evolving under selective pressures (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Cuypers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Maldonado and Mansky, 2018</xref>). An alternative approach is the identification of compounds targeted against cellular functions required for viruses to complete their multiplication cycle. Hence, an efficient non-conventional cell-targeted antiviral would inhibit viral entry and/or replication at a non-toxic concentration for the cell and, ideally, it would help to control a wide variety of viral diseases and virus strains. Following this approach, we have focused our studies on three compounds: lauryl gallate (LG), valproic acid (VPA), and cerulenin (CRL) (<xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) that can interfere with cell metabolism and have been previously described as potential AVs.</p><table-wrap id="tab1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Formula and cytotoxicity of antivirals in different cell lines.</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="fmicb-10-01853-i001.jpg"/></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" valign="top" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Antiviral<xref rid="tfn1" ref-type="table-fn"><sup>a</sup></xref></th></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cell line</th><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LG</th><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VPA</th><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CRL</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Vero</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">45 &#x003bc;M</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50 mM</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">45 &#x003bc;M</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">COS</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">33 &#x003bc;M</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">180 mM</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60 &#x003bc;M</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BHK</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">75 &#x003bc;M</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">175 mM</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60 &#x003bc;M</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">IBRS-2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30 &#x003bc;M</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40 &#x003bc;M</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tfn1"><label>a</label><p><italic>Data expressed as CC<sub>50</sub>, concentration of antiviral yielding a 50% of cell viability in MTT assay</italic>.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>LG is an ester derivative of gallic acid, a natural plant phenolic compound. It has been widely used as antioxidant (E312) in food manufacturing, as well as in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. LG protects cells from oxidative stress, in a process associated with radical scavenging, inhibition of enzymes involved in lipid peroxidation, and increasing expression of antioxidant genes (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Kubo et al., 2002</xref>). Due to its hydrophobic properties, LG can disrupt biomembranes and cause protein inactivation (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Jurak and Minones, 2016</xref>). This interaction with lipid molecules can be correlated with different pharmacological effects against bacterial cells and viruses (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Ogita et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Hurtado et al., 2008</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that viral production was strongly inhibited at non-toxic concentrations of LG, in different cell lines infected with African swine fever virus (ASFV), herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), vaccinia virus (VV), influenza virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus and Sindbis virus (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Hurtado et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>VPA is a branched short-chain fatty acid that has been widely used for treatment of neurological diseases such as epilepsy, migraines, or bipolar disorders (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Terbach and Williams, 2009</xref>).

Therapeutic roles of VPA have been proposed in cancer, Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, and HIV treatment (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Monti et al., 2010</xref>). We previously showed that VPA is a potent inhibitor of the multiplication of several enveloped viruses (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Vazquez-Calvo et al., 2011</xref>). VPA treatment of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-infected cells reduced viral production without significantly affecting viral RNA and protein synthesis but interfering with both cell release and specific infectivity of virion particles, while VPA blocked virus entry and multiplication during West Nile virus (WNV) (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Vazquez-Calvo et al., 2013</xref>) and HSV-1 infection (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Crespillo et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The FASN synthase inhibitor cerulenin has been shown to reduce production of several viruses such as VV, WNV, and Semliki Forest virus (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Martin-Acebes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Greseth and Traktman, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Royle et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that <italic>de novo</italic> fatty acid biosynthesis is relevant for numerous viral infections.</p><p>Despite the considerable effort invested in new vaccine designs, viruses still produce many porcine diseases with economic importance, such as those caused by ASFV, foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), VSV, or swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), and many aspects regarding their spread and persistence remain elusive. ASFV causes an important animal disease for which no effective vaccine or therapeutic treatment is available (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Sanchez-Cordon et al., 2018</xref>). Likewise, FMD is the animal viral disease with the largest economic impact worldwide. Conventional vaccines have allowed FMD control and eventual eradication of the disease when properly produced and administered, but pose shortcomings such as the need of high-containment facilities for production, short-lived immunity, and short shelf-life after formulation (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Sobrino et al., 2001</xref>).

Virus yield was reduced about 3 log.u. when Vero (IC<sub>50</sub>: 1 &#x003bc;M) or COS (IC<sub>50</sub>: 0.4 &#x003bc;M) cell monolayers were infected with the non-pathogenic ASFV isolate Ba71V in the presence of LG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), as expected from previous results (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Hurtado et al., 2008</xref>). A similar reduction of ASFV production was observed in the presence of non-toxic concentrations of VPA (IC<sub>50</sub>: 2.5&#x02013;3 mM), and of CRL (IC<sub>50</sub>: 9 &#x003bc;M). Moreover, the virulent ASFV isolate E70 was also inhibited in COS cells infected in the presence of similar concentrations of the three drugs (IC<sub>50</sub>: 2 &#x003bc;M for LG, 2.5 mM for VPA, and 3 &#x003bc;M for CRL).</p><p>To confirm the antiviral effect of CRL and VPA in ASFV infection, we analyzed the expression of virus proteins induced in Vero cells at late times of infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). No late ASFV proteins (like p17 or p12) and a very low expression of the early virus protein p32 were detected in cultures infected in the presence of CRL or VPA, as reported in LG-treated ASFV-infected Vero cells (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Hurtado et al., 2008</xref>). This decrease in protein synthesis was consistent with the inhibition observed in infective virus yield. The low levels of p32 detected, mainly at late times (24 h.p.i), are likely due to the accumulation of residual virus particles less sensitive to the AVs. Late ASFV protein P72 could not be quantified because of its co-migration with similar molecular weight-unspecific proteins, even detectable in mock samples.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>(A)</bold> Effect of VPA and CRL on ASFV protein expression.

In the case of CRL, recovery of virus productivity was observed when CRL was added as early as 0 h after infection (simultaneous with the virus inoculum), which could support its implication in preventing virus attachment. Nevertheless, it has been described that CRL, among other inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis, affected ASFV production in Vero cells by inhibiting a fusion activity, without affecting the binding and internalization of the virus particles (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Bernardes et al., 1998</xref>).

We studied the effect on ASFV infection of LG, VPA, and CRL, either alone or, searching for possible synergistic effects, in their possible combinations but most of the mixtures of two AVs resulted in an inhibitory effect similar to that obtained with the single drugs, or at least not higher than the sum of effects of both AVs.
