    "Presently, the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has been spreading throughout the world. Some drugs such as lopinavir, simeprevir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and amprenavir have been recommended for COVID-19 treatment by some researchers, but these drugs were not effective enough against this virus. This study based on in silico approaches was aimed to increase the anti-COVID-19 activities of these drugs by using caulerpin and its derivatives as an adjunct drug against SARS-CoV-2 receptor proteins: the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Caulerpin exhibited antiviral activities against chikungunya virus and herpes simplex virus type 1. Caulerpin and some of its derivatives showed inhibitory activity against Alzheimer's disease. The web server ANCHOR revealed higher protein stability for the two receptors with disordered score (<â€‰0.6). Molecular docking analysis showed that the binding energies of most of the caulerpin derivatives were higher than all the suggested drugs for the two receptors. Also, we deduced that inserting NH2, halogen, and vinyl groups can increase the binding affinity of caulerpin toward 6VYB and 6LU7, while inserting an alkyl group decreases the binding affinity of caulerpin toward 6VYB and 6LU7. So, we can modify the inhibitory effect of caulerpin against 6VYB and 6LU7 by inserting NH2, halogen, and vinyl groups. Based on the protein disordered results, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein domain are highly stable proteins, so it is quite difficult to unstabilize their integrity by using individual drugs. Also, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation indicates that binding of the combination therapy of simeprevir and the candidate studied compounds to the receptors was stable and had no major effect on the flexibility of the protein throughout the simulations and provided a suitable basis for our study. So, this study suggested that caulerpin and its derivatives could be used as a combination therapy along with lopinavir, simeprevir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and amprenavir for disrupting the stability of SARS-CoV2 receptor proteins to increase the antiviral activity of these drugs."
