    "After the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic caused by the H1N1 virus, the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) brought us to the time of serious global health catastrophe. Although no proven therapies are identified yet which can offer a definitive treatment of the COVID-19, a series of antiviral, antibacterial, antiparasitic, immunosuppressant drugs have shown clinical benefits based on repurposing theory. However, these studies are made on small number of patients, and, in majority of the cases, have been carried out as nonrandomized trials. As society is running against the time to combat the COVID-19, we present here a comprehensive review dealing with up-to-date information of therapeutics or drug regimens being utilized by physicians to treat COVID-19 patients along with in-depth discussion of mechanism of action of these drugs and their targets. Ongoing vaccine trials, monoclonal antibodies therapy and convalescent plasma treatment are also discussed. Keeping in mind that computational approaches can offer a significant insight to repurposing based drug discovery, an exhaustive discussion of computational modeling studies is performed which can assist target-specific drug discovery."
