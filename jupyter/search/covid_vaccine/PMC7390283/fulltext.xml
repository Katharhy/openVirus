Such vaccines rely on proven technologies such as recombinant protein&#x02013;based vaccines to facilitate its transfer for emerging market vaccine manufacturers. Our group is developing a two-pronged approach to advance recombinant protein&#x02013;based vaccines to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections. One vaccine is based on a yeast-derived (<italic>Pichia pastoris</italic>) recombinant protein comprised of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV formulated on alum and referred to as the CoV RBD219-N1 Vaccine. Potentially, this vaccine could be used as a heterologous vaccine against COVID-19. A second vaccine specific for COVID-19 is also being advanced using the corresponding RBD of SARS-CoV-2. The first antigen has already undergone current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) manufacture and is therefore &#x0201c;shovel ready&#x0201d; for advancing into clinical trials, following vialing and required Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology testing. Evidence for its potential efficacy to cross-protect against SARS-CoV-2 includes cross-neutralization and binding studies using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. Evidence in support of its safety profile include our internal assessments in a mouse challenge model using a lethal mouse-adapted SARS strain, which shows that SARS-CoV RBD219-N1 (when adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide) does not elicit eosinophilic lung pathology. Together, these findings suggest that recombinant protein&#x02013;based vaccines based on the RBD warrant further development to prevent SARS, COVID-19, or other coronaviruses of pandemic potential.</p><disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;The thing we have to think about now that&#x02019;s different is</italic>, <italic>how do we produce vaccines specifically for the developing world if this is a truly global epidemic</italic>.<italic>&#x0201d;&#x02014;Seth Berkley</italic>, <italic>CEO</italic>, <italic>Gavi</italic></p></disp-quote></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Introduction: Disease burden in low- and middle-income countries</title><p>As of June 2020, COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has infected more than 7 million people globally (confirmed cases) and caused almost 400,000 deaths [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although the epidemic began in China, Europe, and the United States, there are significant concerns about the risks of disease emergence in low- and middle-income nations. There are now more almost 750,000 cases in Brazil, 300,000 cases in India, and 50,000 cases in South Africa, such that COVID-19 will become widespread among the poor living in the group of 20 nations [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection is expected to emerge in the Global South [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the African region of the World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 is now spreading in the populated areas of Ghana, Nigeria, and Democratic Republic of Congo, and presumably across the region [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In nations such as India, for example, the feasibility of enforcing social distancing in large and crowded urban centers will be particularly daunting [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], so that ensuring access to a safe and affordable COVID-19 vaccine will become a global priority. Dr. Seth Berkley, the CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, has highlighted the importance of prioritizing a COVID-19 vaccine specifically for these countries [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Rationale and approach</title><p>At least a dozen COVID-19 candidate vaccines are under development using different technology platforms [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], with an emphasis on speed, maximizing safety, and avoiding vaccine-induced immunopathology [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Many of these will enlist cutting-edge nucleic acid delivery technologies and other innovative approaches. In the meantime, there is urgency to address and rapidly respond to Gavi&#x02019;s charge and pursue safe, low-cost, easily administered, and rapidly scalable approaches. For instance, Texas Children&#x02019;s Center for Vaccine Development (CVD) at Baylor College of Medicine, in collaboration with its nonprofit product development partners&#x02014;Seattle-based PATH and Infectious Disease Research Institute (IDRI)&#x02014;have been spearheading a coronavirus vaccine program focusing on recombinant subunit protein vaccines produced in a globally available microbial fermentation platform, and optimized to maximize yield following expression and protein purification [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Towards this goal, we are now also developing the SARS-CoV-2 RBD recombinant protein as a potential vaccine candidate, in parallel with the existing CoV RBD219-N1 candidate vaccine, which was previously developed and manufactured under cGMP in 2016 [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The bulk drug substance has been stored frozen (&#x02212;70&#x000b0;C to 80&#x000b0;C) and remains stable through ongoing testing. Furthermore, an independent quality assessment confirmed the suitability of the material through Phase 2 clinical trials.</p><p>Both RBD vaccine candidates have potential as vaccine antigens to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19. Overall, our initial approach relies on advancing the already manufactured CoV RBD219-N1 as a heterologous recombinant subunit vaccine to protect against both SARS and COVID-19 [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and in parallel accelerate the advancement of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD candidate as a homologous COVID-19 vaccine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008548.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Our preliminary studies now show that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD candidate, which is specific for the sequence of the SARS-CoV-2, can also be highly produced in the yeast <italic>P</italic>. <italic>pastoris</italic>.

For instance, immune enhancement in children following a formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine was first reported in the 1960s and later shown to occur in laboratory animals with early prototype SARS-CoV vaccines using virus-vectored platforms or inactivated virus constructs [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We have recently summarized the major safety concerns of some prototype coronavirus vaccines based on studies conducted in laboratory animals (rodents, ferrets, and nonhuman primates) [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. They include the following points.</p><sec id="sec005"><title>Avoiding virus-vectored platforms</title><p>Some of the earliest SARS-CoV vaccine candidates used vectored-based platforms, and these were associated with immune enhancement or activation. In 2004&#x02013;2005, scientists at the Public Health Agency of Canada&#x02019;s National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba (who helped to develop the first successful Ebola vaccine), found that a recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara (rMVA) expressing the S-spike protein resulted in severe liver pathology upon SARS-CoV virus challenge. Similarly, rMVA expressing the S-spike also resulted in lung immunopathology in rhesus macaques, as did other virus-vectored constructs. Lung immunopathology is also linked to whole inactivated viral vaccines. However, it was determined that in many cases eosinophilic pathology is driven by the SARS nucleocapsid (N) protein, although a recent trial in nonhuman primates found that an alum-adjuvanted inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine did not induce immunopathology [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Among the major conclusions of these studies was that they may be driven by T helper-17 (Th17) responses linked to interleukin-6 [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and that aluminum formulations exhibit greatly reduced immunopathology [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Recombinant protein RBD vaccines</title><p>Given the history of virus-vector platforms and inactivated vaccines in eliciting eosinophilic immunopathology, our emphasis has been on the evaluation of inexpensive recombinant proteins produced in microbial systems. These are comprised of the CoV RBD219-N1 antigen, encoding amino acids 319&#x02013;536 (219 AA) of the SARS-CoV S-spike protein [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and now a second, CoV2 RBD antigen, which is also expressed without the N-terminal amino acid. The rationale for selecting the RBD domain of the S protein includes focusing on the key component that binds to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, and removing the known elements of the S protein involved in immune enhancement. Supporting studies summarized elsewhere emphasize how S protein peptides outside of the RBD can induce immune enhancement in non-human primates [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, CoV RBD219-N1 induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies in mice and 100% infection against SARS CoV virus challenge [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Alum formulations of CoV RBD 219-N1 do not induce immunopathology [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], a finding consistent with other published studies [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Evaluating efficacy</title><p>There is evidence to justify advancing the CoV RBD219-N1 antigen as either a homologous vaccine against SARS [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] or as a heterologous vaccine against COVID-19 [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In parallel, a CoV2 RBD protein candidate is being advanced. Regarding the former, against SARS CoV homologous virus challenge the vaccine formulated on alum exhibits high levels of protective immunity and with evidence of minimal or no immune enhancement [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. With regards to cross-protection against SARS CoV2, the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 and CoV RBD219-N1 share significant similarity of amino acid sequence (&#x0003e; 75% identity, &#x0003e;80% similarity) and there is evidence that both viruses use the human ACE2 receptor for cell entry [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Further published studies indicate strong antigenic similarities between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs, and the potential for cross protection. For example, serum from a convalescent SARS-CoV patient was shown to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 driven entry [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, new studies by Tai and colleagues find that using pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2, the SARS-CoV RBD blocks the entry of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus into human ACE2-expressing 293T cells [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Through pseudovirus neutralization activity, it was found that SARS-CoV RBD-specific antisera could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection, suggesting that SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 RBD and cross neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Additional studies find that multiple (but not all) neutralizing monoclonal antibodies bind to both RBDs [<xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008548.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Next steps</title><p>An international priority is the scale-up and global access of an affordable and safe recombinant vaccine to prevent emerging coronavirus infections, including COVID-19.
