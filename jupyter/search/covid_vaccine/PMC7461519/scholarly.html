Nine essential stakeholder engagement practices were reviewed: formative research; stakeholder engagement plan; communications and issues management plan; protocol development; informed consent process; standard of prevention for vaccine research and standard of care for treatment research; policies on trial‐related physical, psychological, financial, and/or social harms; trial accrual, follow‐up, exit trial closure and results dissemination; and post‐trial access to trial products or procedures.

It is important to work closely with the risk‐communication and community engagement programmers to ensure that the COVID‐19‐related messages align with and jointly promote an optimal public‐health response.

During the Ebola outbreak, it was agreed that offering experimental therapy for some community members and a placebo to others, when they all faced the same risk of death, was not acceptable.

DISCUSSION</div> <p>The nine essential stakeholder engagement practices enumerated in the GPP‐EP are applicable to the planning and conduct of COVID‐19‐related clinical trials in sub‐Saharan Africa, but the culture of the societies in the region may require adapting the practices while in the field. The collectivism/communitarian nature of the societies will influence the choice of clinical trial design; considerations for informed consenting; the development of stakeholder engagement; communications and issues management plan; and decisions about third‐party access to standard of care and/or prevention. Policies on the management of trial‐related physical, psychological, financial, and/or social harms should recognize the limited access of trial participants to health insurance and the limited capability of the region's weak public and clinical health systems to deal with these challenges. Finally, the procedures of trial closure, dissemination of results, and post‐trial access to trial products or procedures can benefit from the biomedical HIV prevention and treatment research on managing expectations for results; plans must be made upfront for post‐trial access to trial products. The formative research will help identify cultural ‘landmines’ that should be negotiated when planning COVID‐19‐related clinical trials in sub‐Saharan Africa, and stakeholder engagement prior to conclusion of the study protocols will help reach consensus on trial implementation.</p> <p>Although Ethics Committees can play important roles in facilitating community engagement, they cannot be a means to an end in promoting community engagement in COVID‐19 research in Sub‐Saharan Africa.

CONCLUSION</div> <p>Stakeholder engagement in the designing, implementing, monitoring, and disseminating COVID‐19 clinical trials is an important ethical consideration for collective societies like those in sub‐Saharan Africa, and the stakeholder engagement needs to be promoted and monitored by clinical trial regulators. The GPP‐EP is a good framework for guiding stakeholder engagement in COVID‐19 clinical trials. Guidelines that are cognizant of the sociocultural context of the region increase the stakeholder engagement. Documented successes with COVID‐19 clinical trials will help in achieving stakeholder engagement in future trials to be conducted in the region.</p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="ack" title="ack"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
