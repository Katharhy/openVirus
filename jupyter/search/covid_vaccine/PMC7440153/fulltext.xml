COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), with cases ranging from individuals who are asymptomatic to those who experience severe respiratory distress, pneumonia, and death <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. As of August 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 20 million cases and 700,000 deaths worldwide <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The United States (US) has experienced the largest burden of COVID-19 of any country up to this point, with more than five million cases and 160,000 deaths thus far <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p id="p0010">Protective behaviors are key to managing pandemics <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, and vaccination could be a key protective behavior for COVID-19. Several prophylactic vaccines against COVID-19 are currently in development across multiple countries <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Estimated timelines for licensure of a COVID-19 vaccine differ, though there is some speculation that licensure could occur in 2021 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. With vaccine development underway, it becomes important to start examining people&#x02019;s acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine. During the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, early estimates of vaccine acceptability suggested that about 50%-64% of adults in the US intended to get the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, little is currently known about people&#x02019;s acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine or factors that affect acceptability. Such information is useful for generating informed projections of what vaccine uptake might be in the future and also identifying strategies for improving acceptability (and uptake following vaccine availability). The current study examined acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine among a national sample of adults in the US.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design</title><p id="p0015">We conducted a cross-sectional survey study about COVID-19 with adults in the US in May 2020 (about two months after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic<sup>1</sup>). Eligibility criteria included being age 18 or older and currently living in the US. We recruited all participants from an online survey panel accessed through a survey company, SSRS (Glen Mills, PA). The online panel is a national opt-in panel, and its members are invited to complete self-administered online surveys on a regular basis in exchange for incentives from the survey company.</p><p id="p0020">We utilized a convenience sample from this online panel for this study. Panel members who were potentially eligible received an email invitation from SSRS to participate. Panel members who were interested in the study proceeded via weblink to a brief online screener survey that collected demographic information to determine study eligibility (<italic>i.e.</italic>, data on age and US residence determined eligibility status). Panel members who were confirmed eligible then provided informed consent prior to completing their online study survey. A total of 2,006 adults from all 50 states (plus the District of Columbia) participated in our study and completed a survey. The mean time of survey completion was about 23&#x000a0;min, and participants received a standard incentive from SSRS for completing the survey. (<italic>e.g.</italic>, a $5 gift card). The Institutional Review Board at &#x0201c;The Ohio State University&#x0201d; determined this study was exempt from review.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Measures</title><p id="p0025">
<italic>COVID-19 Vaccination.</italic> A copy of the study survey is provided in Appendix A. We developed survey items on vaccination based on past research involving vaccination behaviors <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Prior to survey items about a COVID-19 vaccine, participants were provided with multiple informative statements about COVID-19 infection and a statement that a vaccine is in development. Survey instructions then told participants to imagine that a vaccine will become available when answering items about COVID-19 vaccination. We assessed participants&#x02019; vaccine acceptability by asking how willing they would be to get a COVID-19 vaccine if it was free or covered by health insurance. Response options included &#x0201c;definitely not willing,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;probably not willing,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;not sure,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;probably willing,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;definitely willing.&#x0201d; For our primary outcome, we dichotomized these responses into &#x0201c;willing&#x0201d; (definitely or probably willing) or &#x0201c;not willing&#x0201d; (all other responses). Participants then indicated the most they would pay out-of-pocket to get vaccinated against COVID-19 ($0, $1-$19, $20-$49, $50-$99, $100-$199, or $200+&#x000a0;).</p><p id="p0030">We then examined factors that would matter in participants&#x02019; decisions about whether or not to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Participants were asked to imagine that they are considering whether or not to get a COVID-19 vaccine. The survey then presented participants with a total of 11 factors, and participants indicated whether each factor would matter or would not matter to them in deciding about vaccination. Each factor was treated as a separate binary outcome (<italic>i.e.</italic>, &#x0201c;would matter&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;would not matter&#x0201d;). Factors were presented to participants one at a time and in random order.</p><p id="p0035">
<italic>Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs.</italic> We assessed participants&#x02019; knowledge about COVID-19 infection by calculating the proportion of five knowledge items answered correctly (possible range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0&#x02013;1). The survey also included attitude and belief items about COVID-19 infection: perceived likelihood of getting a COVID-19 infection in the future (1 item, possible range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1&#x02013;4); perceived severity of a COVID-19 infection (1 item, possible range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1&#x02013;4); and perceived stigma associated with COVID-19 infection (4 items, <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.75, possible range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1&#x02013;5). Attitude and belief items about COVID-19 vaccination included: perceived effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine (1 item, possible range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1&#x02013;4); perceived potential harms of a COVID-19 vaccine (1 item, possible range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1&#x02013;5); and perceived unavailability of a COVID-19 vaccine (<italic>i.e.</italic>, difficulty in finding a clinic to get vaccinated; 1 item, possible range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1&#x02013;5). The survey also assessed participants&#x02019; self-efficacy to engage in protective behaviors against COVID-19 (1 item, possible range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1&#x02013;5) and perceived positive social norms of protective behaviors against COVID-19 in their community (1 item, possible range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1&#x02013;5). &#x0201c;Protective behaviors&#x0201d; were described in the survey as things people can do to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 infection. We coded each attitude and belief variable so that higher values indicate greater levels of that construct.</p><p id="p0040">
<italic>Demographic and Health-Related Characteristics.</italic> The survey assessed a range of demographic and health-related characteristics (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>

We examined if participants had one or more underlying medical conditions that would put them at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 (chronic lung disease, asthma, serious heart conditions, being immunocompromised, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, or body mass index of 40 or higher) <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. We calculated body mass index based on participants&#x02019; self-reported height and weight. For the other medical conditions, participants indicated which conditions (from a predefined list) a doctor or other healthcare provider had ever told them they have, with participants having the ability to select multiple conditions if needed. The survey assessed if participants had ever been tested for COVID-19 infection, had a personal history of COVID-19 infection, and had a history of COVID-19 infection among their family members and friends.

This is similar to data recently made available online, where 59%-75% of US adults indicated a willingness to get vaccinated <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Our finding represents one of the first estimates of acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine in the US and can be used to guide projections of future vaccine uptake. Moving forward, it will be important to monitor temporal changes in acceptability as vaccine development continues, and, if a vaccine becomes available, determine how estimates of acceptability translate into vaccine uptake since willingness/intent may not always lead to actual behavior.</p><p id="p0080">Vaccine acceptability was lower among several demographic groups, including participants who were non-Latinx black, had lower incomes, had no health insurance, or were conservative in their political leaning. The pattern among non-Latinx black participants is concerning since early data suggest that non-Latinx blacks have among the highest COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates in the US <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. It is, however, encouraging that vaccine acceptability was high among Latinx participants, as the Latinx population has also experienced a high burden of COVID-19 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. If a vaccine becomes available, ensuring vaccine uptake among these populations may help lessen these existing disparities related to COVID-19. Our findings for income and health insurance coincide with past research, which found uptake of other vaccines was lower among individuals with lower socioeconomic status or without health insurance <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Several states have already indicated that they will require insurers to cover COVID-19 vaccination with no cost-sharing following vaccine availability <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, which may help facilitate vaccine uptake by reducing potential financial barriers. Reducing such barriers is important since only 35% of participants in our study would pay $50 or more out-of-pocket for a COVID-19 vaccine. The finding concerning political leaning may reflect the polarization of issues related to COVID-19 by political leaning. Indeed, individuals with a conservative political leaning may perceive lower risk of COVID-19 infection and may be less likely to engage in protective behaviors (<italic>e.g.</italic>, social distancing, wearing a mask) <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p id="p0085">One of the strongest correlates of vaccine acceptability was whether participants thought their healthcare provider would recommend they get vaccinated against COVID-19. Provider recommendation is a key determinant of vaccination behaviors <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> though missed opportunities for healthcare providers recommending and administering vaccines to patients are still common <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. If a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available, strong healthcare provider recommendations will be critical to promoting vaccine uptake among vaccine-eligible patients. Several health beliefs were also correlated with vaccine acceptability (<italic>i.e.</italic>, perceived likelihood, perceived severity, perceived vaccine effectiveness, perceived potential vaccine harms). These beliefs are central constructs of multiple health behavior theories (<italic>e.g.</italic>, Health Belief Model <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, Protection Motivation Theory <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and have been correlated with the acceptability and uptake of other vaccines <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Importantly, these beliefs also represent modifiable targets for future interventions. Past interventions that have included components targeting such beliefs have been successful in improving knowledge, attitudes/beliefs, and uptake of other vaccines <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p id="p0090">The results of our survey activity where participants indicated the factors that would matter in their vaccination decisions lend support to the findings from our regression analyses. For example, many of the most commonly endorsed factors (<italic>e.g.</italic>, those related to vaccine effectiveness, healthcare provider recommendation, cost/insurance coverage, and vaccine side effects) are similar to constructs identified as correlates of vaccine acceptability. Results of this survey activity also highlight that the importance of certain factors may differ depending on how ready a person is to get vaccinated, and we think this has implications for future communication efforts about a COVID-19 vaccine. For example, communications for people who are more ready to get vaccinated (<italic>i.e.,</italic> those classified as willing in our study) may need to focus more on issues like vaccine efficacy and healthcare provider recommendation, whereas communications for people who are less ready to get vaccinated (<italic>i.e.,</italic> those classified as not willing in our study) may need to focus more on reducing concern about vaccine side effects. This approach would coincide well with several of the stage theories in health behavior (<italic>e.g.</italic>, Transtheoretical Model <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and Precaution Adoption Process Model <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, in which the resources and information needed often vary depending on a person&#x02019;s stage of behavior change.</p><p id="p0095">The strengths of our study include a large sample size, participants from throughout the entire US, and examining a wide range of possible correlates. A key limitation of this study is that we recruited a convenience sample of participants from an opt-in survey panel. Although the demographic characteristics of our participants are similar to those of the US population <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, this limitation should be considered in interpreting and applying the results of the current study. Additional limitations include the study&#x02019;s cross-sectional design and lack of available data on non-respondents. Given that data collection occurred during the early stages of development of a COVID-19 vaccine, we were not able to provide participants with information about details that could affect vaccine acceptability (<italic>e.g.</italic>, dosing schedule). Lastly, our survey assessed vaccine acceptability under the condition that the vaccine was free or covered by health insurance, and acceptability might be lower if there would be out-of-pocket costs associated with the vaccine.</p></sec><sec id="s0055"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0100">If a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available, it will be a key public health strategy for reducing existing disparities and the overall disease burden due to COVID-19. Our study provides early insight into the acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine, with results indicating that many adults in the US would be willing to get vaccinated if a vaccine becomes available. As the vaccine development process continues, it will be important to monitor changes in people&#x02019;s vaccine acceptability. Our results highlight that vaccine acceptability may differ by several demographic characteristics, as well as the key role that healthcare providers and modifiable health beliefs play in acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine. These findings can help guide the planning and development of future public health efforts to increase acceptability (and uptake following vaccine licensure) of a COVID-19 vaccine.</p></sec><sec id="s0060"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0105">Supported by Award Number Grant UL1TR002733 from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.
