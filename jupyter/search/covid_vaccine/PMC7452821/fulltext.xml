Antibody response is often a poor marker of prior coronavirus infection, particularly in mild infections, and is shorter-lived than virus-reactive T-cells; strong antibody response correlates with more severe clinical disease while T-cell response is correlated with less severe disease; and antibody-dependent enhancement of pathology and clinical severity has been described. Indeed, it is unclear whether antibody production is protective or pathogenic in coronavirus infections. Early data with SARS-CoV-2 support these findings. Data from coronavirus infections in animals and humans emphasize the generation of a high-quality T cell response in protective immunity. Yellow Fever and smallpox vaccines are excellent benchmarks for primary immune response to viral vaccination and induce long-lived virus-reactive CD8 T-cells, which are present and measurable within 1&#x02013;4&#x000a0;months of vaccination. Progress in laboratory markers for SARS-CoV2 has been made with identification of epitopes on CD4 and CD8 T-cells in convalescent blood. These are much less dominated by spike protein than in previous coronavirus infections. Although most vaccine candidates are focusing on spike protein as antigen, natural infection by SARS-CoV-2 induces broad epitope coverage, cross-reactive with other betacoronviruses. It will be important to understand the relation between breadth, functionality and durability of T-cell responses and resulting protective immunity. It would be a public health and general trust-in-medicine nightmare - including a boost to anti-vaccine forces - if immune protection wears off or new disease patterns develop among the immunized. Data correlating clinical outcomes with laboratory markers of cell-mediated immunity, not only with antibody response, after SARS-CoV-2 natural infection and vaccines may prove critically valuable if protective immunity fades or if new patterns of disease emerge.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kg005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>SARS</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Protective immunity</kwd><kwd>T-cells</kwd><kwd>CD8 T-cells</kwd><kwd>Antibodies</kwd><kwd>T cell lifespan</kwd><kwd>Durable immunity</kwd><kwd>Antibody-dependent enhancement</kwd><kwd>T-cell epitopes</kwd><kwd>Vaccines</kwd><kwd>Yellow Fever Vaccine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0005">The most definitive solution to the current world-wide public health and economic crisis will be an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).

Antibodies can worsen disease (antibody-dependent enhancement) in coronavirus infection in animals and possibly humans. Feline infectious peritonitis is a coronavirus disease.

SARS-CoV-1 virus causes hepatitis in ferrets only in previously vaccinated animals <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In macaques, administering immunoglobulin against spike protein worsened subsequent SARS-CoV-1-induced lung damage, induced inflammatory cytokines and reduced wound healing <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. These findings parallel dengue hemorrhagic fever in humans, where initial infection and antibody response followed by a second infectious episode is required for serious hemorrhagic disease. Subneutralizing antibodies can promote viral entry into cells, including entry into and activation of macrophages and can occur through low-affinity antibodies, cross-reactive antibodies to different strains, or suboptimal titers of neutralizing antibodies. Vaccine trials for feline infectious peritonitis and dengue had to be halted because of disease enhancement. It has to be considered that antibodies alone might worsen coronavirus disease severity. Emerging data in COVID-19 patients support this concern.

This CD8 T-cell response pattern provides us with criteria for evaluating long-term, &#x0201c;high quality&#x0201d; protective immunity in vaccine trials or after natural infection.</p><p id="p0070">In this context, recent data on the durability and cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 responsive T-cells in exposed and unexposed subjects may have important clinical implications. LeBert et al. <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> reported remarkable results about T-cells that react to the coronavirus structural protein N in a Singapore population. Prevalence of reactive T-cells to SARS-CoV-2 N in was 100% in COVID-19 recovered patients (36/36 patients) and included coverage of multiple regions of the N protein. Moreover, 23/23 patients studied 17&#x000a0;years after recovery from SARS-CoV-1 infection still had reactive T-cells to SARS-CoV-1 N. Importantly, these cells also reacted to SARS-CoV-2 N. Finally, ~50% (19/37) of subjects who were never clinically exposed to either SARS-CoV-1 or &#x02212;2 infection exhibited SARS-CoV-2 N-reactive T-cells.</p><p id="p0075">These results in unexposed humans for N-reactive T-cells are supported by findings for spike-reactive T-cells <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. T-cells that react to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were present in 34% of seronegative, clinically unexposed healthy controls in a German cohort. COVID-19 recovered patients in this population showed 83% prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 spike-reactive T-cells at higher levels than in unexposed subjects. An intriguing finding was that the COVID-19 recovered patients&#x02019; T-cells covered epitopes broadly spaced across the spike protein, whereas the epitopes covered in control subjects were mostly against the C-terminal region, which has greater homology to spike proteins in betacoronviruses that cause the common cold. Prevalence of T-cells that are reactive to SARS-CoV-2 proteins has also been reported in unexposed subjects in studies from the United States <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, Sweden <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and the Netherlands <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, although not in studies from Wuhan China <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> or the United Kingdom <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p id="p0080">Taken together, these findings tell an important and potentially promising story. After SARS-CoV-1 or &#x02212;2 infection, T-cells reactive to coronavirus proteins are universally observed, persist for many years and exhibit cross-reactivity between the two viruses. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 reactive T-cells may often be induced by mild betacoronavirus infections that cause common colds. The finding of SARS-CoV-2-responding T-cells in unexposed subjects has now been reported in several geographic locations and, if it holds up to further study, might explain some of the variability of clinical outcomes for COVID-19. This observation also suggests potentially testable protective strategies for COVID-19 prevention through exposure to betacoronavirus common colds (the original vaccine of Jenner against smallpox, of course, was induced by intentional natural infection with a zoonotic virus that caused mild symptoms in humans).</p><p id="p0085">The apparent durability of virus-specific T-cells against SARS-CoV-1 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> after natural infection is also a central feature of highly effective viral vaccines - in particular, YF and smallpox vaccinations <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. To understand the basis of long-lived, high quality protective immunity following viral vaccination, we <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> recently characterized the lifespan and differentiation of YF virus (YFV)-specific CD8 T-cells (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>
) after vaccination and <italic>in vivo</italic> labeling <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Long inter-mitotic interval was an early feature of YFV-specific CD8 T-cells generated. Long lifespan allowed differentiation from effector cells that proliferated during the initial viral exposure to a unique, stem-like memory T-cell population. These mitotically quiescent YFV-reactive cells maintained an epigenetic fingerprint of their effector history with open chromatin profiles at effector genes even a decade after vaccination. Indeed, these long-lived T-cells combine features of na&#x000ef;ve and effector cells - surface markers (CD45RA and CCR7) and lack of granzyme B expression (na&#x000ef;ve cell characteristics), rapid proliferation in response to viral antigens or cytokines (effector), and gene expression patterns distinct from either type. Importantly, long life-span of virus-specific T-cells was apparent within 1&#x02013;4&#x000a0;months after vaccination by monitoring the slow die-away of labeled YFV-reactive T-cells (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). It may therefore be possible to characterize very early after vaccination the quality and the durability of induced T-cell immune protection. As Flaxman and Ewer suggested <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, vaccine developers could use T-cell measurement methods &#x0201c;to evaluate vaccine-specific T-cells&#x0201d;.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Long lifespan and mitotic quiescence of YFV-specific CD8 T-cells after vaccination (heavy water labeling shown in blue) (from <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>).

Knowledge is advancing on how this plays out for natural coronavirus infections (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>
). Protective natural immunity to coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2, provides criteria for vaccine evaluation. In particular, CD8 T-cells with broad specificity (not just to spike protein) and long persistence, more than a robust antibody response alone, may be a signature of successful protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 infections.<fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p><italic>Protective and Pathologic Immunity in Coronavirus Infection: Humoral and Cellular Roles</italic>. Long-term survival and rapid proliferation with effector function on re-exposure are benchmarks of T-cells in highly effective infection- or vaccine-induced protective immunity against viral infections. Long-lifespan and maturation of CD8 T-cells is key for both quality and durability of immunity. In CoV infections, T-cells exhibit these features but antibodies and memory B-cells have not been durable. CD4 T-cells play critical helper roles for both CD8 T-cells and B-cells. Antibodies (by ADE or macrophage activation) and CD4 T-cells (by excessive cytokine production or Th2 eosinophilic immune damage) are concerns for potential contribution to tissue pathology in CoV infection. CD4 T-cells and tissue cytokines have shown a Th1 pattern in SARS-CoV-2. T-cells in CoV infections appear to have long lifespan and in both SARS-CoV-1 and -2 patients there cross-reactivity for betacoronavirus proteins.

A theoretical advantage of mRNA vaccines, for example, is that antigens are synthesized in the cell cytosol where they can be processed and bound to MHC-class I molecules on the cell surface for recognition by CD8 T-cells. But it is not known whether the absence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens such as M or N will mimic the functionality of T-cell responses from natural infection or what the durability of induced T-cells will be. The same uncertainties hold true for any spike protein based COVID-19 vaccine.</p><p id="p0100">Preliminary reports on humoral and T-cell responses have been published for three SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates in humans <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and for candidates in non-human primates <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.

Data correlating clinical outcomes with laboratory markers of cell-mediated immunity, not only with antibody responses, after vaccination or natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 or other betacoronviruses may prove critically valuable, particularly if protective immunity fades or new patterns of disease emerge.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p
