    "In December 2019, a novel virus, namely COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, developed from Wuhan, (Hubei territory of China) used its viral spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) for the entrance into a host cell by binding with ACE-2 receptor and cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Data revealed that the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 affected more than 24,854,140 people with 838,924 deaths worldwide. Until now, no licensed immunization or drugs are present for the medication of SARS-CoV-2. The present review aims to investigate the latest developments and discuss the candidate antibodies in different vaccine categories to develop a reliable and efficient vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in a short time duration. Besides, the review focus on the present challenges and future directions, structure, and mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 for a better understanding. Based on data, we revealed that most of the vaccines are focus on targeting the spike protein (S) of COVID-19 to neutralized viral infection and develop long-lasting immunity. Up to phase-1 clinical trials, some vaccines showed the specific antigen-receptor T-cell response, elicit the humoral and immune response, displayed tight binding with human-leukocytes-antigen (HLA), and recognized specific antibodies to provoke long-lasting immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image Highlights • The latest developments and antibodies recommendations for a vaccine formulation against SARS-CoV-2 are studied.• The SARS-CoV-2 shared the more than 80% nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-1 and 90% to bat genome.• Over 115 companies started the work on different vaccine candidates to develop a strong vaccine.• Phase-1 clinical trials showed better results in provoking specific humoral and immune responses against SAR-CoV-2.• The ideal vaccine should be simple, easy to administrate, long-lasting, and well-coordinated with targets."
