    "Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), originally, from Wuhan, China, has now spread to most countries across the globe and devastated global healthcare systems. The impact of this disease has, however, shown baffling variations in prevalence in different regions of the world. The aim of this short review is to identify differential national COVID-19 prevalence of COVID-19, as well as to suggest these epidemiological differences.  Methods A review of studies was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar search engines. Search tactics were centered on COVID-19 (\"COVID-19\" AND \"coronavirus\") and BCG vaccination (\"BCG vaccination\" OR \"Bacillus Calmette-Guérin\" OR \"vaccine\") Results It is found that national prevalence differences may be linked with BCG childhood immunization history. A statistically insignificant difference was observed in COVID-19 prevalence when comparing countries with a BGC policy and countries without it (P> 0.05). This inconclusivity suggests the influence of confounders in this study. Conclusions National differences in COVID-19 cases can be attributable to immunologic regulations, such as BCG vaccination protocols. Caution should be taken in establishing a correlation between COVID-19 prevalence and BCG vaccination, partly due to the weak quality of statistical data on COVID-19 related to poor testing rates in countries with BCG vaccination policy. Nonetheless, the analysis of the epidemiological aspects of COVID-19 will shed light on future efforts towards effective control and prevention."
