In the light of the emergence of the coronavirus Sars-CoV-2, the Wolff article has been artfully manipulated by the anti-vaxxer community as an argument against influenza vaccination. As pointed out by GG Wolff himself in a recent letter <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, the study concerned the 2017&#x02013;18 winter season, and the reported results have nothing to do with the novel Sars-CoV-2 virus, but represent four endemic coronavirus strains regularly circulating in the US. In addition, Wolff&#x02019;s study was observational (not experimental) in nature, used a crude odds ratio, and, while focusing on influenza, it was also extended to several non-influenza respiratory viruses, some of which were significantly more (coronavirus and human metapneumovirus) or less (parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus) often detected among influenza vaccinees. These results remain largely unexplained, could have age confounding effects, and the author could not find any evidence to support the hypothesis of viral interference as a possible explanation. While further research on this topic should be encouraged, it is vital to reiterate that the results of Wolff&#x02019;s paper do not concern the Sars-Cov-2 virus.</p><p id="p0010">There is extensive evidence that influenza vaccination provides both health and economic benefits and it should remain a public health priority unless equally solid evidence emerges that advises against it. We performed a literature review (until 15 June 2020) and found a number of papers that highlight the significant benefits of influenza vaccination in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Skowronski et al. conducted a test-negative design study using historical data (2010&#x02013;11 to 2016&#x02013;17) in Canada and found (at odds with Wolff&#x02019;s findings) no effect of influenza vaccination on the risk of coronaviruses infection <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. An inverse correlation between influenza vaccine coverage and COVID-19 mortality emerged in an ecological study analyzing data from thirty-four countries worldwide <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Jehi et al. developed and validated a COVID-19 infection prediction model, in which influenza vaccinees had a reduced COVID-19 infection risk <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Finally, a modelling paper by Li et al. concluded that &#x0201c;increasing influenza vaccine uptake [&#x02026;] would facilitate the management of respiratory outbreaks coinciding with the peak flu season&#x0201d;, thus allowing a more efficient use of healthcare resources <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">In conclusion, we recommend that influenza vaccination continues to be promoted as a central public health measure, as the evidence accrued so far, albeit limited, indicates that it can greatly benefit the management of the coronavirus pandemic, e.g. facilitating differential diagnosis and avoiding an overload of health services and hospitals associated with influenza infections. In addition, influenza vaccination plays an important role in protecting the elderly, which is a group that is particularly vulnerable for COVID-19. In summary, from a public health perspective we think it is important that influenza vaccination programmes are continued during the upcoming winter seasons.</p><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="p0020">The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: [Saverio Caini, Ben Cowling, Susanna Esposito, Angela Gentile, Jan Kyncl, Richard Pitman and Bruno Lina declare no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
