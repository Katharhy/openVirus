Decisions regarding initiation or continuation of disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis have to consider the potential relevance to the pandemic. Understanding the mechanism of action and the possible idiosyncratic effects of each therapeutic agent on the immune system is imperative during this special time. The infectious side-effect profile as well as the route and frequency of administration of each therapeutic agent should be carefully considered when selecting a new treatment or deciding on risk mitigation strategies for existing therapy. More importantly, the impact of each agent on the future severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine should be carefully considered in treatment decisions. Moreover, some multiple sclerosis therapies may have beneficial antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 while others may have beneficial immune-modulating effects against the cytokine storm and hyperinflammatory phase of the disease. Conventional injectables have a favorable immune profile without an increased exposure risk and therefore may be suitable for mild multiple sclerosis during the pandemic. However, moderate and highly active multiple sclerosis will continue to require treatment with oral or intravenous high-potency agents but a number of risk mitigation strategies may have to be implemented. Immune-modulating therapies such as the fumerates, sphinogosine-1P modulators, and natalizumab may be anecdotally preferred over cell-depleting immunosuppressants during the pandemic from the immune profile standpoint. Within the cell-depleting agents, selective (ocrelizumab) or preferential (cladribine) depletion of B cells may be relatively safer than non-selective depletion of lymphocytes and innate immune cells (alemtuzumab). Patients who develop severe iatrogenic or idiosyncratic lymphopenia should be advised to maintain social distancing even in areas where lockdown has been removed or ameliorated. Patients with iatrogenic hypogammaglobulinemia may require prophylactic intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in certain situations. When the future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine becomes available, patients with multiple sclerosis should be advised that certain therapies may interfere with mounting a protective immune response to the vaccine and that serological confirmation of a response may be required after vaccination. They should also be aware that most multiple sclerosis therapies are incompatible with live vaccines if a live SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is developed. In this article, we review and compare disease-modifying therapies in terms of their effect on the immune system, published infection rates, potential impact on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, and vaccine-related implications. We propose risk mitigation strategies and practical approaches to disease-modifying therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="FPar1"><title>Key Points</title><p id="Par2">

Among those who require intensive care, the mortality rate is high. It was identified that the SARS-CoV-2 genome is closely related to the type-1 virus SARS-CoV and the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Therefore, hypotheses can be made about the immune system response to SARS-CoV-2 based on studies in other related corona viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated central nervous system (CNS) disorder that requires immunosuppressive or immunomodulating disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention designated patients receiving immunotherapies and those with disabilities as possible high-risk groups for COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The MS International Federation published a global advice to the MS community addressing measures to reduce infection risk and general implications related to DMT use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The National MS Society endorsed the MS International Federation global advice and published broad DMT guidelines on their COVID-19 webpage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Patients taking certain DMTs may be at a higher risk for general viral and respiratory infections and infection-related risks. More importantly, some DMTs may have implications on the future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Therefore, understanding the impact of each DMT on the immune system, its associated infection risks, and its potential impact on future vaccination is imperative for the safe management of MS during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we evaluate the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and its future vaccine as it relates to the mechanism of action of each DMT as well as each agent&#x02019;s idiosyncratic effects on the immune system and published rates of infectious side effects. We conclude with a comparison of the relative safety of each DMT in relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>SARS-CoV-2 Immune Response</title><p id="Par5">In addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptors, SARS-CoV-2 can enter host cells through the binding of integrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Integrins are receptors that are located on the surface of various cells in the body and play a role in signaling processes. Following viral infection, the innate immune system is activated. The innate immune response is non-specific and involves activation of macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells. Some macrophages and dendritic cells are CD52 positive. Typically, when there is a viral invasion, these innate immune cells recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Following detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, the downstream signaling cascade is activated to induce anti-viral pro-inflammatory cytokines to combat the virus at the entry site including type I and type III interferons (IFNs) [the former includes IFN-&#x003b2;]. Sufficient excretion of IFNs can limit the spread of infection in some cases but SARS-CoV-2 has the ability to evade the innate immune system by inhibiting IFNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. COVID-19 infection can also lead to low levels and dysfunction of natural killer cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. After interaction with innate immunity, the adaptive immune response is activated and can be further subcategorized into cell-mediated and humoral responses. During cell-mediated responses, helper T cells will organize the overall adaptative immune response while cytotoxic T cells directly attack and kill virally infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. COVID-19 infection can cause significant T cell lymphopenia likely due to consumption at inflammatory sites and secondary to the effect of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This T-cell depletion may help in the spread and worsening severity of the infection. For the humoral immune response, B cells will produce immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against the virus, some of which can specifically neutralize the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Long-living plasma cells can provide long-term immunity via production of neutralizing antibodies. In addition, virus-specific memory B cells develop and can also help limit future re-infection. However, antibody levels may decrease over time potentially increasing the risk of reinfection. T cells are the most important cell type in the early immune response against coronaviruses while B cells are more implicated in the long-term immunity. Insights from patients with genetic agammaglobulinemia infected with COVID-19 suggest that the immune system can fight and recover from the infection through the effect of T cells only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, humoral immunity is not without value in the early immune response against the virus based on reports of severe infection in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia due to common variable immune deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The difference in COVID-19 course between patients with genetic agammaglobulinemia (mild course) and those with common variable immune deficiency (severe course) suggests that the absence of B cells in the former group might attenuate the intensity of the hyperinflammatory cytokine storm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, B cells might have a protective role against viral spread and reinfection via production of neutralizing antibodies, but may also contribute to the hyperinflammation and cytokine storm stage of the disease through non-antibody-mediated mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cytokine Storm and Hyperinflammation</title><p id="Par6">An individual&#x02019;s body can normally regulate the levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. However, when a virus enters the host, many cells such as macrophages, lymphocytes, and natural killer cells can become abnormally activated. These cells proceed to release a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This phenomenon is referred to as a cytokine storm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Many studies have shown that the cytokine storm is implicated in the COVID-19 lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Common elevated biomarkers include tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, and granulocyte&#x02013;macrophage colony-stimulating factor, among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This cytokine storm can lead to secondary hemophagocytic lymph histiocytosis, which is characterized by fever, cytopenia, pulmonary involvement, and multi-organ failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Pathogenic dysfunctional granulocyte&#x02013;macrophage colony-stimulating factor-positive T cells have been found in abundance in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and are believed to play a pivotal role in this hyperinflammatory stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Deficiency of T-regulatory cells has also been implicated in the hyperinflammation in patients with COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This dysfunctional T-cell processing is similar to changes implicated in the pathogenesis of MS. As mentioned earlier, B cells may also be implicated in the cytokine storm through direct production of IL-6 and other non-antibody-mediated mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Eventually, this dysregulation in the immune response can lead to immune-mediated lung damage, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and even death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Future Vaccines Against SARS-CoV-2</title><p id="Par7">There are currently multiple pharmaceutical companies attempting to develop a successful SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. One type of vaccine formulation that has become prevalent is the epitope vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Epitopes are short viral protein amino acid sequences that create a more potent and direct effect as opposed to the whole cognate protein. Studies indicated that there is encouraging data to support T-cell epitopes over B-cell epitopes for long-term protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Other platforms that are being investigated include viral vector vaccines, live-attenuated, inactivated, viral RNA and DNA, and artificial antigen-presenting cell vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Safety parameters related to patients with MS taking certain DMTs will come into play depending on the type of vaccine that best demonstrates efficacy and becomes approved for use. A recent study demonstrated successful development of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies similar to those found in convalescent serum after vaccination with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccine without trial-limiting safety concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Current Multiple Sclerosis Disease-Modifying Therapies</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Interferon-Beta (Interferon-&#x003b2;1a and Interferon-&#x003b2;1b)</title><p id="Par8">Interferon-&#x003b2; agents were the first to receive approval for MS management and are available in subcutaneous and intramuscular formulations.

Last, the number of CD56 natural killer cells is increased by IFN-&#x003b2;; these cells efficiently produce anti-inflammatory mediators and potentially have the ability to limit neuronal inflammation. Side effects may include rare leukopenia, lymphopenia, and lymphadenopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Infectious Side Effects</title><p id="Par10">Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) were observed with IFN-&#x003b2;1a (14% vs 12% placebo) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

Therefore, it is likely safe to continue ongoing IFN-&#x003b2; treatment during the pandemic even in patients with COVID-19 infection. It is also safe to start IFN-&#x003b2; treatment in patients with newly diagnosed MS. Based on influenza vaccine studies, IFN-&#x003b2; does not seem to reduce the protective immune response to vaccines and will likely be compatible with the future SARS-CoV-2 viral protein or inactivated vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Compatibility with live-attenuated vaccines is unknown. The subcutaneous or intramuscular routes of administration are safe from the exposure risk standpoint compared with intravenous DMTs that require administration at infusion centers or hospital settings. Although the optimal safety profile of IFN-&#x003b2; compared with other DMTs makes it a suitable option for patients with mild MS during the pandemic, its potency is low compared with the newer agents and it may not be the best choice for patients with highly active MS or who have several negative outcome predictors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Glatiramer Acetate</title><p id="Par12">Glatiramer acetate (GA) is a subcutaneous injectable that provides a modest reduction in the annualized relapse rate.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Mechanism of Action and Impact on the Immune System</title><p id="Par13">Glatiramer acetate is a synthetic polypeptide that is structurally similar to myelin basic protein; an important component of myelin sheath.

Delaying the second course of treatment should be considered during the pandemic especially in patients infected with COVID-19 based on published expert opinions and regional guidelines, although the value of this approach has not been proven yet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Switching to a safer DMT should also be considered. Starting new treatment with cladribine is not preferred during the pandemic except if extremely necessary. As with other cell-depleting DMTs, checking post-vaccination serology is recommended when the future SARS-CoV-2 viral protein or inactivated vaccine becomes available. Patients in the immune reconstitution phase are unlikely to have increased infection-related risks.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Discussion and Conclusions</title><p id="Par52">The global COVID-19 pandemic is expected to linger for several months and possibly years. Early reports on the risk of infection in patients with MS are largely reassuring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>], and a recent retrospective study did not find a difference in DMT utilization between patients with MS with mild COVID-19 infection and those with severe COVID-19 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. This highlights the importance of maintaining and initiating DMTs in patients with MS when indicated during the pandemic. However, the same study and several other reports suggest that different DMTs may be associated with different degrees of COVID-19-related risks. Therefore, clinical neuroimmunologists should have a basic understanding of the mechanism of action of each DMT and the potential interaction with the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and its future vaccine. The exposure risk related to each agent&#x02019;s route and the frequency of administration should also be considered. Infection-related risks should be weighed against the potency of the medication.</p><p id="Par53">The ideal DMT during the pandemic is one with a moderate-to-high potency against MS without increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and susceptibility, and without a negative impact on the future vaccine. A potential benefit against the virus or its associated cytokine storm phase in infected patients is an additional factor to consider when deciding on DMT initiation. None of the existing DMTs fulfill all these criteria, thus a thorough discussion of the benefits and risks of each agent should take place prior to DMT initiation. Patient involvement in DMT selection has been an integral part of modern MS management but the relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic should now be part of the discussion and the decision-making process.</p><p id="Par54">Conventional injectables probably have the safest immune profile and may need to be considered more frequently in patients with mild MS during the pandemic. The non-cell-depleting oral agents are likely safer than cell-depleting agents from the mechanism of action standpoint and safer than all intravenous agents from the exposure risk standpoint. However, they each have their own disadvantages during the pandemic related to either low potency (teriflunomide), idiosyncratic lymphopenia (the fumarates), or a potential negative impact on future vaccine response (S1P modulators). Natalizumab is a relatively safe, high-potency DMT for patients who are JCV-IgG-negative during the pandemic but its monthly intravenous administration carries a high exposure risk. Among the cell-depleting DMTs, ocrelizumab is perhaps the safest but it should be used sparingly during the pandemic given its potential negative impact on infection risk and the response to the future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Cladribine may be relatively safer than alemtuzumab given the oral route of administration, the limited impact on innate immunity, and the relative sparing of T cells. However, both agents may increase the potential for infection-related risks and negatively impact the efficacy of the future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine during the lymphocyte depletion phase of treatment.</p><p id="Par55">For patients who are currently taking DMT, continuation of the current DMT is preferred but some risk mitigation strategies should be considered when feasible. In high-risk patients in whom risk mitigation strategies are not possible, medication interruption or a switch may be needed.
