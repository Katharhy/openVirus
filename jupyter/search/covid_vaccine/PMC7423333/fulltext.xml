As COVID-19 vaccines are under development, public health officials and policymakers need to create strategic vaccine-acceptance messaging to effectively control the pandemic and prevent thousands of additional deaths.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Using an online platform, we surveyed the U.S. adult population in May 2020 to understand risk perceptions about the COVID-19 pandemic, acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine, and trust in sources of information. These factors were compared across basic demographics.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Of the 672 participants surveyed, 450 (67%) said they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine if it is recommended for them. Males (72%) compared to females, older adults (&#x02265;55 years; 78%) compared to younger adults, Asians (81%) compared to other racial and ethnic groups, and college and/or graduate degree holders (75%) compared to people with less than a college degree were more likely to accept the vaccine. When comparing reported influenza vaccine uptake to reported acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine: 1) participants who did not complete high school had a very low influenza vaccine uptake (10%), while 60% of the same group said they would accept the COVID-19 vaccine; 2) unemployed participants reported lower influenza uptake and lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptance when compared to those employed or retired; and, 3) Black Americans reported lower influenza vaccine uptake and lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptance than all other racial groups reported in our study. Lastly, we identified geographic differences with Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) regions 2 (New York) and 5 (Chicago) reporting less than 50 percent COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Although our study found a 67% acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine, there were noticeable demographic and geographical disparities in vaccine acceptance. Before a COVID-19 vaccine is introduced to the U.S., public health officials and policymakers must prioritize effective COVID-19 vaccine-acceptance messaging for all Americans, especially those who are most vulnerable.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="keys0001"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Vaccine acceptance</kwd><kwd>Evidence-based messaging</kwd><kwd>Health disparities</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="para9001">

[<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] While most countries impacted have developed successful response strategies and observed significant improvements, the U.S. (as of June 28th, 2020) leads globally with 2&#x000b7;50&#x000a0;million cases and over 125,000 deaths. <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> Additionally, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), current data show a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 infections and deaths among racial and ethnic minority communities. <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> With the U.S. facing an economic disruption and the future remaining unknown, a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 infection is perhaps the best hope for ending the pandemic.</p><p id="para0013">As misinformation about COVID-19 has spread across media outlets, it is important for U.S. public health officials and politicians to begin planning for effective messaging and policies before a vaccine is introduced. The U.S. already struggles with reaching high rates of influenza vaccine coverage&#x02014;with less than half of the adult population vaccinated in 2019&#x02014;therefore, COVID-19 presents an imminent danger that requires immediate action. <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> Health communication must reach all communities, especially the most vulnerable, to educate Americans about the safety of vaccines and prevent future infections and deaths.</p><p id="para0014">Immunization programs are only successful when there are high rates of acceptance and coverage. To accomplish this, it is critical to understand Americans&#x02019; risk perceptions about COVID-19, acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine, and confidence in media sources, specifically those used to obtain information about the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of our study is to describe the current vaccine acceptance landscape with aims to 1) predict COVID-19 vaccine acceptance using regularly available demographic information, 2) identify the most vulnerable populations, and 3) provide information for public health officials and politicians to develop messaging for all Americans, while targeting communities most in need.</p></sec><sec id="sec0002"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p id="para0015">Data were collected using an electronic questionnaire via Qualtrics&#x000ae; (Qualtrics, Provo, UT). In early May 2020, participants completed a questionnaire on CloudResearch. <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> CloudResearch is an online survey platform that allows for representative surveying. The goal of our sampling was to be representative of the U.S. general population based on age, gender, education, race and ethnicity. Participants were eligible if they were 18 years of age or older, could read English, and had a CloudResearch account with access to the internet via computer or smart phone. Participants received compensation in the amount they agreed to with the platform through which they entered this survey; these rewards could include gift cards or donations to a participant-selected charity.</p><p id="para0016">Basic demographic information was collected as well as zip code, state of residence, and employment status. Additionally, we asked participants how strongly they agreed with the following statement (5-point Likert Scale: 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;strongly disagree to 5&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;strongly agree): &#x0201c;If a vaccine becomes available and is recommended for me, I would get it&#x0201d;; this variable was dichotomized to COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;strongly disagree/disagree/neutral; 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;agree/strongly agree). Participants also completed the perceived risk scale (Cronbach's &#x003b1; =0&#x000b7;72) which had 10 survey-items (5-point Likert Scale: 0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;strongly disagree/disagree/neutral; 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;agree/strongly agree). The scoring of the perceived risk perception scale, which ranges from 0 to 10, was calculated by summing the participants&#x02019; responses of &#x0201c;Agree&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Strongly Agree&#x0201d; to 10 survey-items. The greater the number a participant receives on this scale, the greater their perceived risk of COVID-19. We also asked the participants if they had received the influenza vaccine in the previous 8 months. Finally, participants were asked about their confidence in media sources and the reliability of these sources regarding the COVID-19 pandemic (5-point Likert Scale: 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree). Yale University Institutional Review Board approved this study (IRB protocol number: 2000027891).

With many COVID-19 vaccines under development <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and substantial vaccination levels needed to achieve herd immunity, we must clearly understand the hesitancy and acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine to develop evidenced based interventions. This will allow healthcare professionals and health officials to develop messaging to best address concerns and educate all Americans, especially vulnerable groups.</p><p id="para0029">Our study shows that COVID-19 vaccine acceptance can be predicted with relatively high accuracy by readily available demographic characteristics. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, it has been clear that low-income and communities of color are at higher risk for infection and death from COVID-19. <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> In fact, when looking at data by zip code from New York City, the dramatic inequality in COVID-19 infections and deaths is evident. <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> Not only are the most affected areas largely made up of communities of color, but there are also significant income disparities, demonstrating the intersectionality between race, socioeconomic status (SES), and health outcomes.</p><p id="para0030">The disparate health outcomes related to COVID-19 occur not only in New York City, but also across the U.S. <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> Owen et&#x000a0;al. discuss the racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19 infections and deaths in Chicago, Illinois; Charlotte, North Carolina; Milwaukee, Wisconsin and across the states of Michigan and Louisiana. <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> Historical oppression and current disparities in care are linked to a mistrust of the healthcare system among some Black Americans and may result in these differences in health outcomes. <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> Supporting this, our study found that Black Americans were less likely to get the influenza vaccine and are less likely to accept a potential COVID-19 vaccine. In addition to racial disparities, COVID-19 vaccine acceptance differs based on education and employment. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, as years of education increases, unemployment rates decrease, and income increases. <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> Related to this, our study found that as years of education increases, so does reported acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, unemployed participants reported a lower acceptance rate of a COVID-19 vaccine. These findings demonstrate that low income communities, which are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> may be more susceptible to continued outbreaks, even if a vaccine is available.</p><p id="para0031">We need to use caution assuming that reported acceptance or intent translates into actual behavior. This is especially a concern when there is some time between the measurement of intention and the observation of behavior, <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> which cannot occur until a COVID-19 vaccine is available publicly. Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is covered on the 24-hour news networks and dominates a great deal of online media. This media coverage may make the COVID-19 pandemic more salient in daily life, especially when compared to influenza. Additionally, during a pandemic and immediately around a new vaccine release, excitement about a vaccine is at its highest. <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> Another factor that could change salience is if a definitive pharmacological treatment is discovered that reduces duration of illness or deaths. Aside from salience, there may be other unidentified factors that influence COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and eventually vaccine uptake. For example, we found that DHHS Region 2- New York, which includes the epicenter for the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., had the lowest reported COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Therefore, COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and eventual uptake may be influenced by more than just media coverage and direct exposure to the economic and health consequences. This means planning for a COVID-19 vaccine should be comprehensive, with a focus on groups that are at high risk.</p><p id="para0032">Building confidence in a COVID-19 vaccine is essential because the herd immunity threshold for SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, is estimated to be between 55% and 82%, <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and we found that 67% of our sample would accept the vaccine. Also, the number of Americans who actually receive a COVID-19 vaccine could be lower than those who claim they intend to vaccinate. Thus, health professionals must be careful to encourage trust in vaccination and minimize misinformation. Currently, opposition to vaccination overall may amplify outbreaks [<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] like it did during the 2019 measles outbreak. <xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> Opposition to vaccines, which occurs actively online, <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> may influence COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. However, according to Larson, governments that deliberately release reassuring misinformation about COVID-19 may also reduce COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> In the United States, misinformation released by the government includes the country's testing capacity, <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> the efficacy and safety of potential pharmacological interventions, <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and the speed at which a vaccine can safely be developed and produced. <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>
</p><p id="para0033">To counter this misinformation and improve trust, thoughtful and targeted messaging needs to be developed and tested now to build on the current public interest and continue the momentum past the release of a vaccine. Messaging and education should not only target the general American population but also specifically focus on high risk groups, including low-income individuals and communities of color. This emphasis on high risk communities indicates a need for cultural humility and community engagement. Additionally, how these messages are made available to the public should be considered. We found that our participants had the most trust in COVID-19 information from healthcare professionals and health officials; participants indicated that information from these sources are more reliable than social media. Hence, health officials and healthcare professionals, including nurses and ancillary healthcare staff, should be engaged in community messaging to improve trust in a COVID-19 vaccine and increase uptake.</p><p id="para0034">Our findings may be influenced by possible selection bias because participants needed a CloudResearch account and access to a smartphone/computer to participate, which may limit the generalizability of our sample. This may have also excluded poor and older people, which are groups vulnerable to COVID-19, and may have resulted in an overestimate of the percentage of those who would accept a COVID-19 vaccine. On sensitivity analysis, weighing by age, sex, and race decreased the vaccine percent acceptance to 57%. Additionally, because this is a survey-based study and all data were generated online, we were unable to check if the participants&#x02019; responses were true (e.g., whether the participants had really received an influenza vaccine is unknown). Another limitation is the effects of a social desirability bias, as participants may respond to questions in a manner that is viewed favorably by others. Lastly, merging the &#x0201c;neutral&#x0201d; group with the &#x0201c;strongly disagree&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;disagree&#x0201d; groups may have resulted in some loss of statistical outcomes when dichotomizing the outcome variable, COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. We did, however, have a high completion rate of 72% and our data are fairly representative of the U.S. population. In addition to the representative sample, strengths of our study include timeliness and ability to stratify on demographic and geographic factors to predict COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Most importantly, this is one of the first studies that looks at detailed COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.</p><p id="para0035">To conclude, our study found 67% of our sample from across the U.S. would accept a COVID-19 vaccine. However, there were demographic and geographical variations in rates of acceptance that need to be carefully addressed. Policymakers and stakeholders should focus on evidence-based community messaging to improve uptake and break the transmission dynamics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="para0041">All authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebibl1"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0001"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gardner</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>An interactive web-based dashboard to track COVID-19 in real time</article-title><source>Lancet Infect Dis</source><volume>20</volume><issue>5</issue><year>2020</year><fpage>533</fpage><lpage>534</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">32087114</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0002"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref0002"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Johns Hopkins University &#x00026; Medicine</collab></person-group><chapter-title>Coronavirus resource center: COVID-19 dashboard by the center for systems science and engineering (CSSE)</chapter-title><year>2020</year><publisher-name>Johns Hopkins University (JHU)</publisher-name><comment>at</comment><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html" id="interref0002">https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html</ext-link><comment>(accessed: 29th June 2020)</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other" id="sbref0003">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
