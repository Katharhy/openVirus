    "This communication provides a compilation on aspects of COVID-19 infection control measures, describes the potential role of therapeutic plasma exchange to reduce fatality rates, addresses precautions concerning dexamethasone pharmacotherapy and updates the current status on the availability of vaccines. As part of passive immunotherapy, it focuses on various blood derivatives. These include coronavirus neutralising antibodies extracted from different sources to be administered as a pure hyper concentrate intramuscularly or for upgrading and standardising the specific potency of high affinity antibodies. These processes are intended to compose standardised pooled bioproducts of corona convalescent plasma/cryosupernatant that are pathogen inactivated for additional safety by well-established UV technologies. For the best practice of optimising plasma exchange, hyper concentrate NAb should be added to the cryosupernatant, which contains some of the active principles of corona convalescent plasma. The cryosupernatant apart from the high molecular weight viscous part of cold insoluble proteins that are removed, is equivalent to CCP, but makes it safer for general application. Such a bioproduct is often used routinely for substitution therapy of thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura. Alternative resources of large-scale specific coronavirus antibodies warrant further exploration such as cadaveric donations. The early uses of therapeutic plasma exchange and low molecular weight heparin, for any clinical trial in development is warranted, in order to interdict the intense inflammatory/kinin driven cascade. Because coronavirus positive patients are highly prone to thrombosis, thromboprophylaxis is necessary, even some time after recovery guided by the laboratory data."
